<h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Summary 
  of the decision</span></h4>
<p>From May 14th to 17<sup>th</sup>, 2001,  a panel of the Court of Appeal for 
  Ontario, composed of Court of Appeal Justices Karen Weiler and Robert Sharpe, 
  and Superior Court Justice Paul Rivard (sitting as an <i>ad hoc</i> member of 
  the Court of Appeal) heard appeals from a decision of Ontario's Divisional Court 
  dated November 29, 1999.  In that decision, Superior Court Justices James Carnwath, 
  Robert Blair, and Michel Charbonneau quashed directions of the Health Services 
  Restructuring Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) ordering Ottawa's Hôpital 
  Montfort (&quot;Montfort&quot;) to substantially reduce its services.  </p>
<p>Montfort is the only hospital in Ontario in which the working language is French 
  and where services in French are available on a full-time basis.  The Divisional 
  Court found that the Commission's directions would reduce the availability in 
  the Ottawa-Carleton region of health care services in French, jeopardize the 
  training of French-speaking health care professionals, and cripple Montfort 
  as an important francophone institution.  The directions were therefore quashed 
  because they failed to consider the unwritten constitutional principle of respect 
  for and protection of minorities.  The Divisional Court also held that the Commission's 
  directions did not violate the equality rights of francophones under s. 15 of 
  the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i></p>
<p>The Ontario Minister of Health (&quot;Ontario&quot;) appealed from the decision 
  of the Divisional Court.  Montfort cross-appealed from the Court's ruling on 
  s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the decision of the Divisional Court.  
  The Court ruled, first, that the Commission did not comply with s. 7 of the 
  <i>French Language Services Act</i> because it failed to establish that it was 
  &quot;reasonable and necessary&quot; to reduce health care services in French 
  and also because it failed to take &quot;all reasonable measures&quot; to comply 
  with the Act<i>.   </i>Second, in failing to give serious weight and consideration 
  to the importance of Montfort to the survival of the Franco-Ontarian minority, 
  the Commission failed to exercise its public interest mandate as required by 
  the fundamental principles of the Constitution.  Third, the Court affirmed the 
  Divisional Court's ruling that the directions of the Commission did not violate 
  s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Court therefore dismissed the appeals, affirmed 
  the order quashing the Commission's directions, and ordered the Minister of 
  Health to reconsider the matter.  </p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Background</span></h4>
<p>Montfort was founded in 1953 by leaders of the Franco-Ontarian community 
  under the direction of a religious order of nuns.  Unlike other hospitals in 
  the Ottawa area that were either English or bilingual, Montfort was originally 
  a homogeneous francophone hospital. Although today it also provides bilingual 
  services in English, Montfort's medical services and training remain essentially 
  francophone.  It is the only hospital in Ontario to provide a wide range of 
  medical services and training in a francophone setting.     [Paragraph 4]</p>
<p>In 1996, the Health Services Restructuring Commission was established to restructure 
  the delivery of health care services in Ontario.  The <i>Public Hospitals Act</i>, 
  section 6, authorized the Commission to issue directions to public hospitals 
  to: close, amalgamate operations with other hospitals, or change the level and 
  nature of health services.  In issuing its directions, the Commission was required 
  to consider what was &quot;in the public interest&quot; and to &quot;[have] 
  regard to district health council reports&quot; for the communities concerned.      
  [Paragraphs 8 - 13]</p>
<p>The Commission released its first report in February 1997 and issued a notice 
  of intention to close Montfort.  The decision was met with a storm of protest.  
  In particular, the District Health Council of Eastern Ontario and the Ottawa-Carleton 
  Regional District Health Council stressed that the decision would imperil the 
  training of health care professionals in French and make access to health services 
  in French more difficult.   [Paragraphs 33 - 36]</p>
<p>In August 1997, the Commission released its final report and issued directions 
  reversing its initial proposal to close Montfort.  Montfort's services, however, 
  would be substantially reduced.  Montfort would go from receiving funding as 
  a 196-bed general community hospital to receiving funding for 51 mental 
  health beds and 15 low-risk obstetrical beds.  Montfort would no longer 
  provide emergency, intensive care, and general surgery services associated with 
  short-term hospital admission.  Montfort would also no longer offer short-term 
  admission and treatment for a variety of ailments in family medicine or internal 
  medicine.  Cardiology, Montfort's second largest program, would be transferred 
  to the General campus of the amalgamated Ottawa Hospital.  Montfort would only 
  offer &quot;urgent care&quot; (a form of walk-in clinic and some day surgery), 
  low risk obstetrical beds, and psychiatric services.  [Paragraph 44]</p>
<p>Montfort in short would cease to function as a community hospital.  These directions 
  were issued despite the recommendations of both the Ottawa-Carleton and Eastern 
  Ontario Health Councils that Montfort should continue to operate as a community 
  hospital to meet the needs of the francophone community.  [Paragraph 45]</p>
<p>In July 1998, the Commission further directed that 22 sub-acute beds 
  be allocated to Montfort, for a total of 88 beds. [Paragraph 47]</p>
<p>On February 22, 1999, the Commission responded to submissions that it had not 
  considered Montfort's larger institutional role as an agent for the preservation 
  of the language and culture of Franco-Ontarians.  A letter was written 
  by the Commission's president, Dr. Duncan Sinclair, to Ms. Michelle de Courville 
  Nicol, the president of Montfort's board of directors.  The letter stated that 
  &quot;[d]ebate of this belief is not within the purview of the Health Services 
  Restructuring Commission&quot;.  [Paragraph 49]</p>
<p>Montfort and the respondents then brought an application to the Divisional 
  Court to set aside the directions of the Commission.  The Court granted the 
  application and quashed the directions.  Ontario appealed and Montfort cross-appealed 
  to the Court of Appeal.  [Paragraphs 50 - 56]</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Decision 
  of the Court of Appeal</span></h4>
<p>The Court affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court, quashed the Commission's 
  directions, and dismissed Ontario's appeal.  The Court also dismissed Montfort's 
  cross-appeal.  </p>
<p>The 
  Court considered the following issues [paragraph 57]:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1.  Did the Divisional Court err in its findings of fact?</p>
  <p>2.  Does s. 16(3) of the <i>Charter</i> protect the status of Montfort as 
    a francophone institution?</p>
  <p>3.  Do the Commission's directions infringe s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>?</p>
  <p>4.  What is the relevance to Montfort of the unwritten constitutional principle 
    of respect for and protection of minorities?</p>
  <p>5.  Do the Commission's directions violate the <i>French Language Services 
    Act</i>?</p>
  <p>6.  Are the Commission's directions reviewable pursuant to the unwritten 
    constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court first ruled that the Divisional Court made no errors in its findings 
  of fact.  The Court affirmed the Divisional Court's findings that the Commission's 
  directions to Montfort would reduce the availability of health care services 
  in French, jeopardize the training of French language health care professionals, 
  and impair Montfort's broader role as an important linguistic, cultural, and 
  educational institution that is vital to the minority francophone population 
  of Ontario [paragraphs 58 - 76].</p>
<p>The Court next turned to the legal issues.  The Court ruled that neither s. 
  16(3) of the <i>Charter</i> (advancement of status or use of English and French) 
  nor s. 15 (equality rights) applied to protect the status of Montfort as a francophone 
  institution.  The Court was not persuaded that s. 16(3) provided constitutional 
  protection for government measures taken to advance linguistic equality.   The 
  Court held that section 16(3) was not a rights-conferring provision but 
  rather a shield against government action that would otherwise contravene s. 
  15 or exceed legislative authority.  The Court also affirmed the Divisional 
  Court's ruling that the Commission's directions did not violate s. 15 of the 
  <i>Charter</i>, holding that s. 15 could not be invoked to supplement language 
  rights that the <i>Charter</i> had not expressly conferred.  [Paragraphs 92 
  - 102]</p>
<p>The Court then considered the Constitution's unwritten principles as recognized 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1998 <i>Quebec Secession Reference</i> 
  decision.  These principles are federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and 
  the rule of law, and respect for and protection of minorities.  The latter principle 
  is a fundamental structural feature of the Canadian Constitution that both explains 
  and transcends the minority rights that are specifically guaranteed in the constitutional 
  text.  These rights include s. 16(1) of the <i>Charter</i> which proclaims English 
  and French to be the official languages of Canada, and s. 23 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  which guarantees the general right of primary or secondary school instruction 
  in the language of the English or French linguistic minority population of a 
  province.  The structural principle of respect for and protection of minorities 
  is a bedrock principle of the Constitution that bears directly on the interpretation 
  of the <i>French Languages Services Act</i> of Ontario and on the legality of 
  the Commission's directions affecting Montfort.   [Paragraphs 103 to 125.]</p>
<p>The Court noted that the <i>French Language Services Act</i> builds on the 
  language rights contained in Canada's Constitution to advance the equality of 
  status or use of the French language as provided in s. 16(3) of the <i>Charter</i>.  
  One of the underlying purposes of the Act is to protect the minority francophone 
  population in Ontario.  Other underlying purposes include the advancement of 
  the French language and the promotion of its equality with English.  These purposes 
  coincide with underlying unwritten principles of the Constitution of Canada.  
  Underlying constitutional principles may in certain circumstances give rise 
  to substantive legal obligations because of their powerful normative force.  
  [Paragraphs 127 - 143]</p>
<p>The Court held that the Commission's directions to Montfort would reduce the 
  availability and accessibility of healthcare services in French in the Ottawa-Carleton 
  region and eastern Ontario.  The directions would also imperil the training 
  of health care professionals in French.  This would in turn increase the assimilation 
  of Franco-Ontarians.  Montfort's designation as a French language service provider 
  included not only the healthcare services available in French at the time of 
  designation but also whatever structures were necessary to ensure the delivery 
  of those services, including the training of healthcare professionals in French.  
  To give the legislation any other interpretation is to prefer a narrow, literal, 
  compartmentalized interpretation to one that recognizes and reflects the intent 
  of the legislation.  Language and culture are not separate watertight compartments.  
  [Paragraphs 144 - 162]</p>
<p>The Court found that the serious adverse effects of the Commission's directions 
  were inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of the <i>French Language 
  Services Act</i>.  In designating Montfort under the Act, Ontario had indicated 
  that the health care services at Montfort, offered at the time of designation, 
  were intended to be permanently offered and readily accessible in French.  Ontario 
  was therefore required under s. 7 of the Act to continue to provide those services 
  in French subject to &quot;such limits as are reasonable and necessary&quot;.  
  Ontario was also required show that &quot;all reasonable measures&quot; for 
  compliance with the Act had been taken before limiting Montfort's services as 
  a community hospital.  This does not simply mean directing another hospital 
  to attain designation under the Act and then transferring some of the health 
  care services offered at Montfort to that hospital before designation has been 
  attained.  Nor does &quot;all reasonable measures&quot; mean creating a seemingly 
  insurmountable problem for the training of healthcare professionals in French 
  and essentially leaving the affected community to solve the problem itself.  
  [Paragraphs 163 - 165]</p>
<p>The Court therefore concluded that the Commission's directions did not comply 
  with s. 7 of the <i>French Languages Services Act</i>.  The Court said that 
  it was impossible to specify precisely what is encompassed by the words &quot;reasonable 
  and necessary&quot;, but at a minimum some justification or explanation was 
  required for directions limiting the rights of francophones to benefit from 
  Montfort as a community hospital.  [Paragraph 166]</p>
<p>The Court stated that although the Commission, now Ontario, may change and 
  limit the services offered in French by Montfort, it cannot simply invoke administrative 
  convenience and vague funding concerns as the reasons for so doing.  The Commission's 
  mandate has to be reconciled with the statutory requirements of the <i>French 
  Language Services Act</i>.  The Commission may not remove from Montfort medical 
  services provided in French without showing that it is &quot;reasonable and 
  necessary&quot; to do so, particularly when those services are not available 
  in French on a full-time basis elsewhere in the Ottawa-Carleton region.  
  [Paragraph 168]</p>
<p>The Court also concluded that the Commission's directions failed to reflect 
  the fundamental constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities.  
  The Commission was required by statute to exercise its powers <i>in accordance 
  with the public interest</i>.  In determining the public interest, the Commission 
  was required to have regard to this fundamental constitutional principle.  The 
  Commission was also required to consider the views of regional health councils 
  which made explicit recommendations based on Montfort's importance to the francophone 
  community.  The Commission, however, regarded consideration of Montfort's larger 
  institutional role as beyond its mandate.  [Paragraph 180]</p>
<p>The Court agreed with the Divisional Court that the language and culture of 
  the francophone minority in Ontario &quot;hold a special place in the Canadian 
  fabric as one of the founding communities of Canada and as one of the two official 
  language groups whose rights are entrenched in the Constitution&quot;.  If implemented, 
  the Commission's directions would greatly impair Montfort's role as an important 
  linguistic, cultural, and educational institution, vital to the minority francophone 
  population of Ontario.  The directions are thus contrary to the fundamental 
  constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities.  [Paragraph 
  181]</p>
<p>The Court noted that the Commission offered no justification for diminishing 
  Montfort's important linguistic, cultural, and educational role in the Franco-Ontarian 
  community.  The Commission failed to heed the relevant constitutional values.  
  It also failed to justify departure from those values on the grounds that it 
  was necessary to do so to achieve some other important objective.  Although 
  the Commission was entitled to deference, deference does not protect directions 
  taken &quot;in the public interest&quot; that impinge without justification 
  on fundamental Canadian constitutional values.  Because the Commission failed 
  to give serious weight and consideration to the linguistic and cultural significance 
  of Montfort to the survival of the Franco-Ontarian minority, contrary 
  to the unwritten constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities,  
  the Commission's directions must be quashed.  [Paragraphs 184 - 187]</p>
<p>The Court therefore dismissed the appeals, affirmed the order quashing the 
  Commission's directions, and ordered the Minister of Health to reconsider the 
  matter.  </p>
<p>[The Court's conclusions are summarized at paragraph 188 of the decision.]<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
