<p>On appeal from her convictions by Justice B. Thomas Granger, sitting without

  2000</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant appeals her convictions on four counts of criminal 
  negligence causing death, one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, 
  four counts of impaired driving causing death, and one count of impaired driving 
  causing bodily harm.  She also appeals the sentence imposed of four years imprisonment, 
  and a 15 year driving prohibition under s. 259(2)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The charges arose as a result of a tragic high-speed 
  car crash which left four young occupants dead, and the other two occupants, 
  including the appellant, seriously injured.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We did not find it necessary to hear from the respondent, and 
  concluded that the appeal of the convictions and sentence must be dismissed.   
</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>The Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant raised a number of grounds of 
  appeal from her convictions: </span></p>
<p> 1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <u>The Warrants to Seize the Residual Blood Sample and Relevant Medical 
  Records from the Clinton Public Hospital and the Medical File from the London 
  Health Sciences Centre</u></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our view, the information contained in the 
  affidavits filed in support of the applications to obtain the warrants was sufficient 
  to justify their issuance.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police officer conveyed, in his affidavit, the horrific circumstances 
  of the crash; his belief that the appellant had been the driver; that she had 
  been drinking at an all-night party; and that open liquor was found in the vehicle 
  after the crash.  In our view, these factors constituted sufficient information 
  to justify the issuance of the warrants and we find no error in the trial judge’s 
  ruling in this regard.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are also all of the view that the validity of the warrant 
  is not affected by the officer’s failure to convey in his affidavit that he 
  had been told by the appellant’s friends that they thought she was sober when 
  she took the wheel of the vehicle.  Given the other factors noted above, we 
  are all of the view that the warrants would nevertheless have been properly 
  issued if the omitted information had been included in the affidavit. The reasons 
  of the trial judge show that he was alive to the test for quashing a search 
  warrant, and it is implicit in his reasons on this issue that he was of the 
  view that no <i>material</i> facts had been omitted.  His finding in this regard 
  is entitled to deference.  </p>
<p> 2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <u>The Assertion that the Verdicts Were Unreasonable</u> </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When it is claimed that the verdict is unreasonable, the standard 
  of review is whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting 
  judicially, could reasonably have rendered:  <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> (2000) 143 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. G.(A.)</i> (2000) 143 C.C.C. (3d) 46 (SC.C.).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The central issue at trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the appellant was driving the vehicle at the time of 
  the fatal accident. In our view, there was ample evidence supporting the trial 
  judge’s conclusion that the appellant was the driver. In his careful review 
  of the evidence, the trial judge identified a variety of factors which led him 
  to that conclusion.   Although it may have been a modest overstatement to have 
  observed that the appellant’s evidence was “simply not consistent with the other 
  evidence in the case”, it was nevertheless open to the trial judge to reject 
  her evidence in light of the convincing evidence that she was the driver at 
  the time of the accident.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We conclude that the verdict was not unreasonable. 
  </span></p>
<p>3. <u>The Alleged Misapprehension of the Evidence</u></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are not satisfied that the trial judge misapprehended the 
  evidence in any material way.  While his observations concerning the difference 
  between the Clinton and the London blood samples are not clear, we are nevertheless 
  of the view that it was open to the trial judge to accept the evidence of the 
  first blood sample.  Moreover, any difference in the results of the two samples 
  was not, in our view, material to the trial judge’s ultimate conclusion that 
  the appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol at 
  the time of driving.   </p>
<p>4. <u>The Failure to Preserve the Clinton Blood Sample</u></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant asserts that the failure of the authorities to 
  preserve a blood sample for independent testing deprived her of her right to 
  make full answer and defence, a component of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  We 
  agree with the trial judge’s analysis of this issue.  He concluded that because 
  the Crown did not rely upon a certificate of analysis pursuant to the legislative 
  scheme contained in s. 258 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, there was no <i>statutory</i> 
  obligation to preserve a separate blood sample for independent testing.  The 
  trial judge acknowledged a general duty, however, to preserve the fruits of 
  an investigation.  After applying the principles articulated in <i>R. v. La</i> 
  (1997) 116 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), he concluded that there was no impropriety 
  on the part of the state, and that there was no violation of the appellant’s 
  rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  We see no basis to interfere with 
  this finding. </p>
<p>5.   <u>The Assertion that the Trial Judge Unfairly Characterized the Evidence 
  of the Defence Witness, Dr. McLeod</u></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, it was open to the trial judge on the evidence, 
  to arrive at the conclusions that he did concerning the evidence of this witness.  
  His conclusions as to the weight to be given to his evidence are entitled to 
  deference from this court. </p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>The Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The 23-page transcript of the trial judge’s reasons for sentence 
  reveals that he gave careful consideration to the relevant factors. He concluded 
  that because of the enormity of the tragic consequences of the appellant’s actions, 
  his duty was to impose a sentence that would send a “clear and unequivocal message” 
  emphasizing the principle of general deterrence.  He concluded that a conditional 
  sentence of imprisonment would “in no way act as a general deterrent or properly 
  reflect society’s denunciation of the appellant’s actions”.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are unable to conclude that he erred in principle in imposing 
  the sentence that he did.  </p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the result, the appeal respecting the convictions and sentence 
  is dismissed.  </p>
