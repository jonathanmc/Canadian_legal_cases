  </span></span> This is an appeal by the defendants (other than Trish Wood who 
  made a personal assignment in bankruptcy on September 22, 1999) from the judgment 
  of Cunningham J., sitting without a jury, dated April 20, 2000.  His reasons 
  are reported at (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 656 and (2000), 50 C.C.L.T. (2d) 213 (Sup. 
  Ct.).  The judgment awarded the plaintiff, Dr. Frans H. H. Leenen general, aggravated 
  and punitive damages totalling $950,000, together with costs, for defamation 
  arising from the defendant’s production and broadcasting of a one hour television 
  program called “The Heart of The Matter”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The program was produced by a part or department of the Canadian 
  Broadcasting Corporation (“the CBC”) described as <i>“the fifth estate”</i> 
  which engages in investigative journalism.  The program was shown once on CBC’s 
  main television channel to an audience in excess of 1,000,000 people and four 
  times on its Newsworld channel to audiences totalling 400,000. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The defendants appeal the finding of liability, 
  the damages and the fixing of costs.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The program examined questions raised in the medical scientific 
  community about the safety of heart medications known as Calcium Channel Blockers 
  (“CCBs”) and particularly one called nifedipine.  The program focused on the 
  response of Health Canada’s Health Protection Branch (“HPB”) to that issue.  
  The thesis of the program was that nifedipine in its short-acting capsule form, 
  which was approved by Health Canada for the treatment of angina but was being 
  prescribed by doctors for both angina and hypertension, was turning out to be 
  more of a hazard than a help and that HPB was not moving quickly or positively 
  enough in determining whether nifedipine, in its long-acting pill form, was 
  also doing more harm than good.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The mechanics of the program involved a monologue by Wood interspersed 
  with excerpts from interviews by Wood with some of the parties or representatives 
  of the parties said to be involved.  Amongst those parties was an insider or 
  former insider from HPB who was used to establish the theme.  Other authorities 
  were then introduced, including Leenen, again by excerpts from interviews by 
  Wood, to provide their respective views on some of the questions raised.  The 
  trial judge found that this was done in the form of a “good guy/bad guy” scenario.  
  A viewing of the video tape of the program confirms that characterization.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> What is complained of is that by a sophisticated “cut and paste” 
  process, Leenen was portrayed as one of the “bad guys”, largely by the use of 
  his own statements and appearance.  The complaint is not that his words or any 
  of the statements made are false or defamatory in their true and natural meanings, 
  but rather that the “overall impression created by the words and the images 
  is alleged to be defamatory”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Leenen’s position is that the program created 
  the following innuendoes:</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge analysed the voluminous evidence and considered 
  the arguments for and against the plaintiff’s position, concluding that the 
  four innuendoes were defamatory and were made out on the evidence.  He completed 
  his analysis in this regard as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Having found in law that the words complained of are indeed capable of 
      bearing the meanings alleged by the plaintiff, I have concluded  in fact 
      that the words complained of do actually bear those meanings.  Recognizing 
      that I am not to select the harshest and most extreme meaning along a spectrum 
      of possible meanings, I have applied the test of a reasonable and fair-minded 
      viewer, rather than one who is looking to question the plaintiff’s reputation.  
      In analyzing the actual words used to assess whether harm was occasioned 
      to the plaintiff’s reputation, I have focused on what ordinary viewers in 
      Canada would infer the words to mean, given their general experience and 
      knowledge of public affairs.  As was stated by Lord Reid in <i>Lewis v. 
      Daily Telegraph Ltd., (supra), </i>[[1963] 2 All E.R. 151 (H.L.)] at p. 
      154:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally 
        been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words.  But that expression 
        is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements 
        in it.  Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves 
        as where the  plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer.  But more 
        often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the 
        ordinary man will <u>infer</u> from them and that is also regarded as 
        part of their natural and ordinary meaning. [Emphasis added.]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Context, of course, is crucial in determining the defamatory sense of words 
      and an alleged defamatory statement cannot be considered apart from the 
      circumstances in which it is made.  I have not analyzed the words as though 
      I were carefully considering a written contract.  Rather, I have taken the 
      broadcast as a whole in determining whether it is defamatory and it is upon 
      that basis that I have reached the conclusion that this broadcast was indeed 
      devastatingly defamatory of the plaintiff.  Within that context, the reasonable 
      viewer would conclude that Dr. Leenen supported the prescribing of killer 
      drugs, that he was in conflict of interest, that he was receiving a pay-off 
      from Pfizer and, at the very least, that as chair of the committee he was 
      negligent and more likely dishonest.  The words, within the context of the 
      entire broadcast, certainly are capable of bearing the meaning that the 
      plaintiff was guilty of misconduct.  The words suggest a lack of integrity 
      on the part of the plaintiff, something which strikes at the very heart 
      of his professional stature.</p>
    <p>Television, a very powerful medium, provides widespread and instantaneous 
      dissemination of information.  Programs such as <i>the fifth estate</i> 
      have remarkable potential and capacity to cause damage.  A program such 
      as this one, by the sensationalized manner in which it was produced, is 
      far more likely to cause damage than other less respected publications or 
      broadcasts.  Thus, there is a greater responsibility upon those who produce 
      such programs to ensure that the content is factually correct.  A person’s 
      reputation for honesty and integrity is a precious commodity and when that 
      is put into question the results can be devastating.  Just as allegations 
      of conflict of interest are defamatory, to suggest that a person of Dr. 
      Leenen’s stature lacked integrity, was less concerned about patient safety 
      than about drug manufacturers’ profits, and that he conducted himself in 
      a less than professional manner, not only calls into question his credibility 
      as a research scientist, thereby demeaning him in the eyes of his colleagues, 
      but causes his overall reputation in his larger community to suffer irreparable 
      damage.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Having concluded that a reasonable and fair-minded viewer 
      would infer these meanings, I want to stress that I have canvassed all of 
      the alternatives and a full range of meanings that might be taken.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then went on to consider whether the defendants’ 
  plea of justification or “truth” was a complete answer to the plaintiff’s claim.  
  The defendants had set out their version of the “true facts” in paragraph 10(a) 
  to (q) of their statement of defence.  The plaintiff conceded that a number 
  of these “facts” were true but the trial judge concluded that, on the basis 
  of the evidence adduced at trial, many were not and for that reason the plea 
  of justification had to fail.  I agree with that approach and that conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge then turned to the defendant’s 
  claim of qualified privilege stating that “to succeed in this defence the defendant 
  must establish not only some public or private duty, but also that the recipient 
  had a corresponding interest in receiving the information”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>He concluded that while the program was “<i>of 
  </i>public interest”, it was not “<i>in</i> the public interest” [emphasis added] 
  but rather was: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>. . . contrary to the public interest because of its real 
      potential for harm by inciting a panic amongst patients suffering from high 
      blood pressure . . .</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>[the program]</span></p>
    <p>. . . had nothing to do with a duty to communicate important information.  
      It had everything to do with sensationalizing an issue, with creating viewer 
      interest through alarm and with providing a podium for its producer’s [Regush] 
      long held views, capably assisted by the over heated concerns of a disgruntled 
      regulator [the insider].  . . . The program could easily have presented 
      important information in a fair and balanced manner and had it done so, 
      the public interest readily could have been served.  By presenting a biased 
      and slanted view, a view which in many respects the CBC knew to be inaccurate 
      or simply untrue, no public interest was served.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then considered the defence of fair comment.  
  He defined it as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The defence of fair comment protects words that are <i>prima 
      facie </i>defamatory provided they are comments based on true facts made 
      honestly without malice with reference to a matter of public interest . 
      . . . The defence of fair comment has been identified as the repository 
      within the law of defamation of the values of freedom of speech and it must 
      be interpreted and applied in that light.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Leenen was not the only one offended by the broadcast in question.  
  Dr. Martin G. Myers also sued the same defendants and succeeded.  The reasons 
  of Bellamy J. are reported at (1999), 47 C.C.L.T. (2d) 272 (Sup. Ct.).  With 
  respect to the defence of fair comment she said at p. 305:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I conclude that no fair-minded person, nor indeed any reasonable person, 
      could have come to hold the views about Dr. Myers which were conveyed in 
      the program, given all the facts (reported and unreported) available to 
      the defendants.  From my review of the detailed transcripts and the tapes, 
      including the parts which were not used in the program, I find that CBC 
      dramatically simplified a complex medical debate by seriously mischaracterizing 
      Dr. Myers’ position.  The CBC set him up quite unfairly as a “bad guy” in 
      the debate.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In considering the defence of fair comment in 
  relation to the broadcast Cummingham J. said:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>One of the elements of fair comment, of course, is fairness.  If it is 
      found that the comment is unfair, the defence fails.  In the present case, 
      the defendants argue that they did provide the viewer with a balanced debate.  
      I disagree.  This program, from its inception, was slanted in one direction.  
      Throughout, the critics of CCBs were treated in a positive light, while 
      the so-called defenders were treated in a negative way.  Fairness would 
      require that viewers be presented with both sides of the argument in a balanced 
      way.  In this case, by omitting key information, by deliberately failing 
      to provide Dr. Leenen an o`pportunity to accurately present his views, and 
      by deliberately failing to follow up with further interviews, the CBC cannot 
      claim fair comment when it describes Dr. Leenen as an advocate of CCBs.  
      The selectivity in the presentation of the material for this program in 
      and of itself demonstrates an inherent unfairness towards those whose views 
      did not mesh with Mr. Regush’s.  So much important information was kept 
      away from the viewer, information that, had it been presented, probably 
      would have destroyed the Regush thesis.  From this, the only conclusion 
      one can reach is that the defendants never intended there to be fairness 
      and what in fact they did was to either directly or by inference present 
      statements of fact, albeit for the most part inaccurate ones.  No comment 
      can be fair if it is based upon facts which are invented or misstated: <i>England 
      v. C.B.C.</i>, [1979]              3 W.W.R. 193 (N.W.T.S.C.). What makes 
      the misrepresentations in this case so alarming is that the CBC  knew that 
      its thesis in many respects was ill-founded. The CBC knew or certainly ought 
      to have known that there was little, if any, difference between the views 
      of all the doctors involved in the program on the subject of the use of 
      CCBs.  Yet it forged ahead with a program depicting defenders versus critics.  
      Any differences, if not imaginary, were so slight that little attention 
      should have been paid to them.  As Esson J. held in <i>Vogel v. C.B.C.</i>, 
      [1982] 3 W.W.R. 97 (B.C.S.C.) at p. 173:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To be fair, comment must be based on facts truly stated, and must not 
        contain imputations of corrupt or dishonourable motives on the person 
        whose conduct is criticized, save insofar as such imputations are warranted  
        by the  facts . . . </p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Another necessary ingredient of the defence of fair 
        comment is honest belief in the truth of the comment.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sadly, those involved in the production of this program could not have 
      believed what they were doing.  They clearly knew or had to have known that 
      much of what they were presenting was false.  Despite the defendants’ submission 
      that all of the innuendoes said to arise from the broadcast are comments, 
      a closer look reveals otherwise.  Applying the objective test, which I must, 
      I cannot conclude that the views presented were honestly held.  And looking 
      at the matter subjectively, I cannot conclude, despite their assertions 
      to the contrary, that the defendants honestly believed what they were saying.  
      Having raised the defence of fair comment, the defendants must satisfy the 
      burden of establishing that the facts upon which it is based are true and 
      that it is objectively fair.  They have not done so.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge then went on to deal with the 
  innuendoes on an individual basis concluding as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I disagree with the defendant’s submission that all of the innuendoes said 
      to arise from the broadcast are “comments” because they are unstated inferences 
      or conclusions which a viewer would draw from the stated facts in the broadcast.  
      As Lane J. stated in <i>Hodgson v. Canadian Newspapers Co., (supra)</i>, 
      [(1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 235 (Gen. Div.)] at p. 385, citing <i>O’Brien v. Marquis 
      of Salisbury </i>(1889), 6 T.L.R. 133 (Q.B.) at p. 137:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Comment may sometimes consist in the statement of fact, 
        and may be held to be comment if the fact so stated appears to be a deduction 
        or conclusion come to by the speaker from the facts stated or referred 
        to by him, or in the common knowledge of the person speaking and those 
        to whom the words are addressed and from which his conclusions can reasonably 
        be inferred.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>This simply is not our case because the facts upon which 
      the “comment” is based are not true.</span></p>
    <p>Applying all of the appropriate tests to the language of the broadcast, 
      I am of the view that a reasonable viewer would conclude that all the innuendoes 
      are statements of fact.  They are presented as fact.  Hence the defence 
      of fair comment must fail.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although at this stage of the proceedings it was not necessary 
  to do so, Cunningham J. went on to deal with the issue of malice in the event 
  that any of his earlier conclusions with respect to the defences raised were 
  reversed and because it was relevant to the issue of damages.  There was ample 
  evidence to support the conclusion he reached that there was malice and having 
  seen the video tape and read much of the evidence, I agree with his findings 
  except in two respects.  Those two instances both involve the conduct of the 
  law suit and may be dealt with very briefly.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first instance was the refusal of the CBC to accept service 
  of written notice under the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i> R.S.O. 1990 c. L. 12 
  s. 5 on behalf of the individual defendants.  The second was the circumstances 
  of the defendants’ request for an adjournment of the trial of this action.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge dealt with these matters and counted each as 
  illustrating the attitude of the CBC toward Leenen throughout.  In my respectful 
  view neither of the incidents should have been relied upon as evidence of malice 
  on the part of the CBC.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In so far as the refusal to accept of service of the notice of 
  libel is concerned, the factual basis is not adequate to support the inference 
  that there was malice.  Regush was not a CBC employee.  Webster was in Africa.  
  Studer said that he believed that the CBC would accept services as a matter 
  of course.  In any event, an order for substituted service was secured very 
  quickly by counsel for Leenen.  In my view, these circumstances are simply not 
  sufficient to support a finding of malice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial of this action was to have commenced February 15, 1999.  
  Shortly before that date the CBC moved for an adjournment upon the basis that 
  Regush was going to be unavailable and his attendance on a daily basis was required 
  during the cross-examination of Leenen.  In the result, the adjournment was 
  granted and as a consequence the Myers action was tried first.  At the Leenen 
  trial Regush only attended to give his own evidence and little or nothing more.  
  He did not attend for the cross-examination of Leenen.  The trial judge found 
  that “this demonstrates a further attempt on the part of the defendants to discourage 
  Dr. Leenen from prosecuting this action.  It was simply another roadblock thrown 
  up in Dr. Leenen’s path, evidencing further proof of malice.” </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Again with respect, I do not think that inference can be drawn 
  safely.  The CBC had the same counsel in both cases.  It is entirely possible 
  that as a result of the experience gained in the Myers trial, counsel for the 
  defendants changed his mind as to the strategy to be followed in the Leenen 
  trial.  Such a decision falls entirely within counsel’s discretion and it would 
  be unfair and improper for the trial judge to interfere with it.  I am unable 
  to agree that these circumstances demonstrate any malice on the part of the 
  defendants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having decided the question of liability in favour of the plaintiff, 
  the trial judge turned to the assessment of damages.  In the result he awarded 
  $400,000 for general damages against all defendants, aggravated damages of $100,000 
  against the CBC, $150,000 against Regush and $50,000 as against each of Wood 
  and Webster.  He also assessed punitive damages against the CBC, Wood, Nicholas 
  Regush and Webster at $50,000 each for a total of $950,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In arriving at these awards the trial judge found that Leenen 
  was devastated both personally and professionally.  As in the case of Myers 
  (the reasons in the appeal in <i>Myers v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
  et al</i> will be released with these reasons) a patient attacked him directly, 
  coming into his office and stating:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Leenen, you wrongly prescribed nifedipine for me and 
      you did it for personal gain, to make money.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Director of the Ottawa Heart Institute circulated to all 
  staff the guidelines for conflict of interest as a consequence of the program.  
  Leenen was avoided by friends and neighbours.  Two of his research protocols 
  were put on hold and for a time enrolment in his research programs was stopped.  
  An article in the New England Journal of Medicine questioned his objectivity 
  in assessing the safety of drugs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In summarizing his findings the trial judge 
  said in part:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . the defamatory innuendoes presented in this broadcast caused great 
      suffering to Dr. Leenen and made him feel as though his well-earned reputation 
      for integrity, both professional and otherwise, had been destroyed.  These 
      innuendoes would have been devastating for anyone; for a world-renowned 
      research scientist they were almost fatal.  This was the CBC firing its 
      guns at Dr. Leenen, not some little tabloid to which no one would have paid 
      much attention.  How does one respond when the CBC strikes? . . . </p>
    <p>In the present case, this program reached over one million viewers and 
      its rebroadcast on <i>Newsworld</i>, four hundred thousand.  The program 
      itself was a full one-hour documentary taking up the entire episode of <i>the 
      fifth estate</i>.  I have found that in fact no crisis, apart from the one 
      created by Nicholas Regush, ever existed.  Certainly there was some controversy 
      within the medical/scientific community following the release of Dr. Psaty’s 
      abstract.  This was exactly the concern Dr. Leenen was trying to forestall 
      when he co-authored the April 4<sup>th</sup> 1995 letter to Canadian physicians.  
      Nevertheless, as his nasty little story developed, Mr. Regush decided to 
      target Dr. Leenen as a hypocritical defender of CCBs in a story that not 
      once presented in a fair way Dr. Leenen’s well known and firmly held views.  
      This slanted, one-sided production, I am satisfied, caused devastating damage 
      to Dr. Leenen such that ordinary right-thinking, reasonable people, viewing 
      this program would have concluded that Dr. Leenen had been seriously compromised.  
      Worse, that he had done wrong.  I accept his evidence and that of his wife 
      and nurse that he suffered enormously and that he probably continues to 
      feel that his honesty and integrity are still being called into question. 
    </p>
    <p>. . . Clearly, each libel case is unique and must be judged on its own 
      peculiar set of facts.  Taking into account the seriousness of the defamation 
      as I have found it to be, the breadth of the publication and its source, 
      the republication, the standing of the victim and the nature of his reputation 
      at the time of broadcast, I have concluded from my review of the cases that 
      this is as serious a libel as can be imagined.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In dealing with aggravated damages the trial 
  judge referred extensively to the language of Cory J. in <i>Hill v. Church of 
  Scientology,</i> [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at p. 1205:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Aggravated damages may be awarded in circumstances where the defendant’s 
      conduct has been particularly high-handed or oppressive, thereby increasing 
      the plaintiff’s humiliation and anxiety arising from the libellous statement.  
      The nature  of these damages was aptly described by Robins J.A. in <i>Walker 
      v. C.F.T.O. Ltd., supra</i> [(1987), 59 O.R. 2d 104] in these words at p. 
      111:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span>            </span>Where the defendant is guilty of insulting, 
        high-handed, spiteful, malicious or oppressive conduct which increases 
        the mental distress - - humiliation, indignation, anxiety, grief, fear 
        and the like - - suffered by the plaintiff as a result of being defamed, 
        the plaintiff may be entitled to what has come to be known as “aggravated 
        damages”.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These damages take into account the additional harm caused to the plaintiff’s 
      feelings by the defendant’s outrageous and malicious conduct.  Like general 
      or special damages, they are compensatory in nature. Their assessment requires 
      consideration by the jury of the entire conduct of the defendant prior to 
      the publication of the libel and continuing through to the conclusion of 
      the trial.  They represent the expression of natural indignation of right-thinking 
      people arising from the malicious conduct of the defendant.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge then addressed the issue of 
  aggravated damages as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I could not have been presented with a set of facts more congruent with 
      Cory J.’s last comments.  This was no spontaneous report, but rather the 
      product of months of preparation and absolute adherence to a slanted and 
      biased story line.  There was never an apology or withdrawal of the libel; 
      rather to the very end and throughout the trial there was an uncompromising 
      defence of the activities of the defendants.  The pattern of conduct by 
      the CBC was established right at the outset when its in-house counsel refused 
      to accept service for the individual defendants.  This scorched earth attitude 
      is evident in the refusal to disclose important information without a court 
      order, with stone-walling on discovery claiming source protection and, most 
      tellingly, with an eleventh-hour adjournment request which I have concluded 
      was made only to thwart the plaintiff.  Those involved in the production 
      of this program knew or should have known that Dr. Leenen’s views on the 
      long acting CCBs were essentially the same as of those individuals the program 
      portrayed as “good guys”.  The CBC had to have known that Dr. Leenen knew 
      nothing about H.P.B. conflict of interest guidelines.  If it didn’t it was 
      reckless carrying on as it did without properly sourcing that information.  
      To put a spin Dr. Leenen’s April 4, 1995 letter as they did and to maintain 
      that position throughout the trial, in my view, was conduct which aggravated 
      the situation.  To suggest there was nothing they could have broadcast which 
      would have put Dr. Leenen in a better light in respect of the April 4, 1995 
      letter, the trip to Egypt and the conflict allegations, is simply untrue.  
      There was ample information the CBC had at hand which it could have used 
      to present Dr. Leenen’s side on each of the issues raised.  In frustration, 
      at one point during his interview with Ms. Wood, Dr. Leenen stated:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span>            </span>. . . You won’t help Canadians by coming up, 
        speaking, dealing with this type of cynicism on this issue.  I think you 
        have to look at the facts and if a lot of Canadians could stop at the 
        moment the unproven agents like calcium antagonists or like A.C.E. inhibitors, 
        let their blood pressure go out of control, you’re doing a lot of damage.  
        Yes your cynicism is then hurting Canadians, it’s not helping them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Needless to say, nothing like this made it to air.  That would not have 
      served the program’s thesis.  In order to fully develop Mr. Regush’s story 
      line, Dr. Leenen had to be made to look foolish, incompetent and worse, 
      dishonest.  They succeeded. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In dealing with the matter of punitive damages 
  the trial judge again relied upon language of Cory J. in <i>Hill</i> at p. 1208 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Punitive damages may be awarded in situations where the defendant’s misconduct 
      is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court’s 
      sense of decency.  Punitive damages bear no relation to what the plaintiff 
      should receive by way of compensation.  Their aim is not to compensate the 
      plaintiff, but rather to punish the defendant.  It is the means by which 
      the jury or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious conduct of the 
      defendant.  They are in the nature of a fine which is meant to act as a 
      deterrent to the defendant and to others from acting in this manner.  It 
      is important to emphasize that punitive damages should only be awarded in 
      those circumstances where the combined award of general and aggravated damages 
      would be insufficient to achieve the goal of punishment and deterrence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=No style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge then stated:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is with this in mind that I have determined that punitive damages are 
      required in this case.   The CBC has enormous power and an incredible ability 
      to inflict damage.  For the reasons I have earlier set out and for the malicious 
      manner in which the defendants conducted themselves, their conduct must 
      not be sanctioned.  A clear message must be sent so that other vulnerable 
      people will not be attacked in such a fashion.  This can never simply be 
      a cost of doing business.  The award must reflect the Court’s outrage of 
      (sic) the defendant’s conduct.  In my view, this is one of those exceptional 
      cases spoken of by Cory J. in <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, 
      (supra).</i></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge commented on the differences 
  between the instant action and the Myers action as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Because the action involving Dr. Martin Myers arose from the same broadcast 
      and which has resulted in a judgment in his favour, I believe it is important 
      for me to distinguish the two cases.  In <i>Hill v. The Church of Scientology 
      of Toronto (supra), </i>Cory J. observed that each case of libel is unique 
      and that little is to be gained from a detailed comparison of libel awards.  
      Defence counsel argue that an exception should be made here.  I disagree.  
      These are two separate actions with many factors distinguishing them.  To 
      begin with the pleadings are not the same.  Nor is the evidence before the 
      Court identical.  For example, Bellamy J. in <i>Myers v. CBC (supra)</i> 
      was not made aware of many of the outtake interviews to which I was exposed, 
      nor was she aware of the extent and lack of success achieved by Dr. Brill-Edwards’ 
      labour dispute with the H.P.B.  Unlike Dr. Leenen, the program never presented 
      a sting of conflict of interest <i>per se</i> against Dr. Myers.  Even the 
      findings differ.  I have found that the defence of fair comment fails in 
      respect of all of the innuendoes while Bellamy J. found that the defence, 
      in certain instances succeeded, albeit ultimately to be defeated by a finding 
      of malice.</p>
    <p>There did not appear to be a finding in Myers that his relationship with 
      his hospital had changed.  Dr. Leenen, on the other hand, had his reputation 
      and integrity damaged not only with his patients but also within his research 
      community.  After <i>the fifth estate</i> broadcast, the director of the 
      Ottawa Heart Institute, Dr. Wilbert Keon, circulated conflict of interest 
      guidelines and approached Dr. Leenen in a manner never before witnessed 
      by Dr. Leenen.  Not only did the number of new patient referrals to Dr. 
      Leenen decline, but as well his research protocols were given shorter renewal 
      periods.  Dr. Leenen, because of circumstances following the broadcast, 
      felt compelled to resign from the Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.  
      An award of damages must reflect not only the damage inflicted on a person’s 
      reputation but also the difficulty in restoring that reputation particularly 
      within a research environment where one’s integrity is critical.</p>
    <p>In the present case, the defendants chose to broadcast a segment showing 
      Dr. Leenen fumbling  because he did not have his glasses.  This most unflattering 
      segment was repeated at the end of the program for no other reason, I have 
      concluded, than to reduce Dr. Leenen’s standing and credibility in the mind 
      of the viewer.  This emphasis on trying to portray Dr. Leenen’s ineptitude 
      with a most fundamental function in life goes to the depth to which the 
      defendants tried to destroy the plaintiff not just professionally but as 
      a human being.</p>
    <p>In my consideration of aggravated damages, unlike the situation here, the 
      Myers trial was not adjourned at the last minute for six months.  By doing 
      this, in the circumstances, I have found the defendants managed to heighten 
      Dr. Leenen’s anxiety and delay his opportunity to clear his name.  This 
      is but one of many examples of malicious conduct on the part of the defendants.  
      This conduct began during preparation for the broadcast, continued through 
      the broadcast and right through until the end of the trial.  In the absence 
      of any misconduct on the part of Dr. Leenen, the defendants’ conduct had 
      a devastating impact upon him.  The fact that it was orchestrated by an 
      organization such as the CBC, in my view, clearly aggravated the situation.</p>

  </span></span> The quantum of damages awarded calls for a review and the appellants 
  have attacked every aspect of the awards.  The strong language of the trial 
  judge leaves no doubt about his view of the very serious damages suffered by 
  the plaintiff and the egregiousness of the behaviour of the defendants, individually 
  and collectively.  That behaviour began with the publication of the libel and 
  continued through to the end of the trial.  To complete the picture, it continued 
  through the hearing of the appeal.  Counsel for the appellants did not retreat 
  in any respect nor was there any suggestion of apology, remorse, or regret from 
  the appellants.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In so far as liability is concerned I am not 
  persuaded that the trial judge erred in any matter of fact or law in such fashion 
  as to call for any alteration in his conclusions in that regard.</span></p>

  </span></span> In my view, his conclusions on malice are not well founded in 
  so far as they are based upon the refusal of the CBC to accept service on behalf 
  of the personal defendants and upon the circumstances of the adjournment.  Counsel 
  for Leenen also ask this court to consider two other matters in this regard.  
  One was the refusal of the CBC to produce outtakes.  This led to a motion in 
  one action, the making of an order in that action and the CBC complying with 
  that order in both actions.  Having regard to the fact that the action was based 
  upon what was broadcast and the outtakes were by definition not broadcast, it 
  cannot be said that the original position of the CBC was without some merit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second matter urged upon us as evidence of malice was a comment 
  alleged to have been made by a Master that a motion by the defendants to strike 
  out the statement of claim or parts of it was “an abuse of process”.  The motion 
  in question was for particulars of parts of the statement of claim, or in the 
  alternative, to strike out those parts.  In the result, the order for particulars 
  was made, demonstrating that the motion did have merit.  Accordingly, a finding 
  of malice cannot be based on that incident.</p>

  </span></span> Returning to the awards made by the trial judge, I agree with 
  him that this was a very serious libel, that general, aggravated and punitive 
  damages were appropriate and that the awards made are not so large as to shock 
  the conscience of this court.  I would not reduce any of them on account of 
  the small matters that should not have been included in the trial judge’s finding 
  of malice.</p>

  </span></span> The appellants also seek leave to appeal the disposition of costs.  
  The reasons for judgment were released on April 20, 2000.  On June 7, 2000 the 
  trial judge decided that the plaintiff was entitled to solicitor and client 
  costs and on September 11, 2000 reasons were released dealing in detail with 
  those costs and fixing them at $836,178.94.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It is argued that in awarding aggravated and 
  punitive damages, in awarding solicitor and client costs and in fixing the quantum 
  of those costs, the trial judge in effect “punished” the defendants more than 
  once for the same conduct.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The impact on the appellants may be the same but the fact is 
  that the conduct in question may quite properly be the origin of both an award 
  of aggravated and/or punitive damages and an award of solicitor and client costs.  
  The intent of the trial judge was that Leenen be fully indemnified with respect 
  to his legal costs.  In the circumstances, that intention was properly founded 
  and the accepted way to give effect to it is by an award of solicitor and client 
  costs.  Quite apart from that, the plaintiff was entitled to solicitor client 
  costs under rule 49.10(1) by reason of having made an offer to settle very early 
  in the proceedings for an amount less than the judgment recovered.  No persuasive 
  reason was advanced why the rule should not apply.  </p>

lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants raise issues respecting the hourly rate allowed 
  for senior counsel, the failure to delegate more work to juniors, the attendance 
  of senior counsel at the Myers trial and comparing the costs award to Leenen 
  with the $100,000 award of costs to Dr. Myers.  With respect to the latter item, 
  the comments of Cunningham J. noted above are a complete answer.  They were 
  simply different actions and different trials.  With respect to hourly rates, 
  delegation and attendance at the Myers trial, no error in principle appears 
  to have been made and accordingly, I would not intervene.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary the appeal is dismissed, with costs.  Leave is granted 
  to appeal the costs award but that appeal too is dismissed, again with costs.</p>
