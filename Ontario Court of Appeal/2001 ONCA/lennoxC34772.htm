<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Jack 
  H. Jenkins of the Superior Court of Justice dated July 13, 2000, reported at 
  [2000] O.J. No. 2756. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>BY

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant Arbor operates a large cemetery business in Ontario 
  and elsewhere in Canada. The respondent Lennox was a groundskeeper at Arbor’s 
  Peterborough cemetery. Arbor terminated Lennox for cause. Lennox had misled 
  Arbor about needing to take time off work in order to look after his daughter 
  when the true reason was to cover for his wife who provided management services 
  to another cemetery. Arbor appeals from a finding at trial that it wrongfully 
  dismissed Lennox and from the judgment for damages in the amount of $31,749.13 
  representing salary in lieu of nine months’ notice.  </p>
<p> <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There are two grounds of appeal, one involving the proper application 
  of the law in respect of just cause for dismissal, as recently explained by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of <i>McKinley v. B. C. Tel</i>, [2001]  
  S.C.C. 38. The second and main ground of appeal is that the trial judge interfered 
  to such an extent in the conduct of the trial, that the image of judicial impartiality 
  was destroyed, thereby denying Arbor a fair trial.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Regretfully, we are 
  obliged to give effect to the second ground, and on that basis, set aside the 
  judgment and order a new trial.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Arbor carries on a 
  funeral business in Ontario. Mr. Lennox began working for Arbor on a part-time 
  basis while he was a student in 1986, became assistant property manager at its 
  Scarborough location in 1987, then worked as a groundskeeper at the Peterborough 
  property from 1995 until he was terminated on January 13, 1998.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In 1996 Mr. Lennox 
  applied for employment at a small rural cemetery near Peterborough called Emily 
  Cemetery. They were unable to pay him a salary sufficient to allow him to leave 
  Arbor. However, he accepted their invitation to join the Board of Directors 
  on a volunteer basis. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Lennox began her own cemetery 
  management company and commenced working in the spring of 1997. Her company 
  provided management services to the Emily Cemetery, including hiring the back-hoe 
  operator to dig the graves, providing the grass-cutting and flower services, 
  and attending to arrange for burials as needed. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When Mr. and Mrs. Lennox were expecting a baby, Mr. Lennox applied 
  for parental leave from Arbor for an 18 week period from April to August, 1997. 
  During that time Mr. Lennox was observed by an employee of Arbor overseeing 
  the filling of a grave at Emily Cemetery. When he was confronted by Michelle 
  Gibbons of Arbor, he said he was a volunteer on the Board of Emily Cemetery, 
  that he was not working at other cemeteries while on parental leave from Arbor, 
  but was looking after his daughter.  He did not disclose at that time that his 
  wife had a funeral services business that served Emily Cemetery.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On January 12, 1998, Mr. Lennox received a telephone call from 
  his father, who was looking after his daughter, advising him of a problem at 
  the Emily Cemetery.  As Mr. Lennox was unable to reach his wife, who was with 
  the accountant, he decided he had to go to the cemetery to address the problem 
  himself.  In order to obtain permission to leave his job at Arbor, Mr. Lennox 
  told his supervisor, Mr. Horler, that he could not reach his wife and that his 
  father was watching his daughter, but could not do so all day.  However, he 
  had told a co-worker that he had to figure out a way to get away from work because 
  he had to take care of a problem at Emily Cemetery.  The co-worker reported 
  this to Mr.&nbsp;Horler. As a result, Mr. Horler attended at the cemetery where 
  he confronted Mr. Lennox at approximately 3:00 p.m. and asked him if he was 
  performing any work at Emily.  Mr. Lennox said he was there to service a burial 
  and that his family problem had been taken care of earlier. Mr. Horler then 
  suspended him.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The next day the Regional Property Manager, Mr. Hunter, called 
  Mr.&nbsp;Lennox at home and asked him to explain his absence from work the day 
  before, and his attendance at Emily Cemetery. Mr. Lennox said the explanation 
  was the same one he had given to Mr. Horler, that he had to help out his wife 
  and look after his child. He also said that when Mr. Horler was at the cemetery, 
  his wife had gone to get coffee, which was not true.  Mr. Hunter then told Mr. 
  Lennox that he was terminated.</p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</span></b></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In his reasons for 
  judgment, after reviewing the factual background, the trial judge set out the 
  issues in the following way:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The defendant's position is that Lennox is 
      a dishonest employee. He lied about his whereabouts on January 12<sup>th</sup>, 
      and more importantly, failed to tell the truth when confronted with his 
      lies. The defendant invites me to infer that he was, in reality, running 
      the cemetery business that was registered in his wife's name, and he failed 
      to disclose that to Michelle Gibbons when she telephoned him in 1997. He 
      was also dishonest in working during his parental leave and failed to disclose 
      his wife's business in his conversation to Michelle Gibbons.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge then 
  made the following important findings:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I have no hesitation in finding that Lennox 
      lied to his employer on January 12<sup>th</sup> when he absented himself 
      from work that day. He had a legitimate business reason for going to the 
      Emily Cemetery and covering for his wife, however he lied to several employees 
      of Arbor in explaining his whereabouts. He has still failed to acknowledge 
      this deceit. </span></p>
    <p align="center"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>…</span></p>
    <p><span>            </span>I find that Lennox's conduct is, albeit, less 
      than laudatory [sic], does not constitute such dishonest conduct which would 
      warrant a dismissal under the circumstances. </p>
    <p align="center"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>…</span></p>
    <p><span>            </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>There is insufficient evidence for me to 
      conclude that he was working during parental leave. … </span></p>
    <p><span>            </span>Having considered Lennox's work description, length 
      of service, reporting responsibilities, I conclude that he is entitled to 
      damages representing nine months of salary benefits, less the proper deductions. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge spent a significant portion of the judgment discussing 
  the appellant’s Personnel Policy Manual although that document was not pleaded 
  and not produced until the trial judge insisted upon its production at trial. 
  The trial judge concluded that Arbor did not follow the discipline procedure 
  contained in its manual.  Specifically, the company did not provide the respondent 
  with a series of warnings, but instead chose to rely on the provision dealing 
  with instant dismissal for dishonest conduct. He concluded that although Mr. 
  Lennox was dishonest, his conduct was not such as to warrant instant dismissal 
  as opposed to the progressive discipline regime set out in the manual.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In our view the trial 
  judge’s conduct of the trial created an appearance of unfairness. We agree with 
  the appellant’s submission that the trial judge appeared to assist the respondent. 
  The trial judge intervened unduly in the presentation of the case and, in effect, 
  became a protagonist for the respondent. A review of the transcript demonstrates 
  that the trial judge:</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>redirected lines of 
  questioning which the respondent’s counsel sought to pursue and which the trial 
  judge viewed as unhelpful to the respondent and strategically ill-advised;</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>required the production 
  of the appellant’s policy manual, which was not part of the pleadings or productions, 
  and therefore not part of the case before the court as prepared and conducted 
  by counsel; and</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>sought more than an 
  explanation or clarification of evidence brought out by counsel by questioning 
  two Arbor witnesses (Mr. Horler and Ms. Gibbons) extensively about the policy 
  manual.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A trial judge is expected and entitled to take reasonable steps 
  to ensure that the issues are clear, that evidence is presented in an organized 
  and efficient manner and that the trial runs smoothly and proceeds in a timely 
  manner. Trial judges are also entitled to intervene in the trial where there 
  is need for clarification. However, there is a point at which judicial “intervention 
  becomes interference and is improper”: <i>Majcenic v. Natale</i> (1967), 66 
  D.L.R. (2d) 50 at 64 (Ont. C.A.).  Unfortunately, upon a review of the entire 
  transcript, it appears that is what occurred in this case.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge undoubtedly 
  intended to ensure that the trial was conducted as efficiently and effectively 
  as possible. However, both the nature and the extent of the interventions were 
  such that the trial judge crossed the line and created the appearance of possible 
  injustice.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>Majcenic v. 
  Natale</i>, Evans J.A. quoted at p. 65 from an earlier decision of this court, 
  <i>Boran v. Wenger,</i> [1942] 2 D.L.R. 528, where Riddell J.A. said:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>We think that it is the right of a litigant to have 
      his case submitted to the trial tribunal as his counsel thinks advisable 
      and in the interests of his client – being governed, of course, by the rules 
      governing trial which are well-established and recognized; the trial judge 
      has no right to take the case into his own hands, and out of the hands of 
      counsel.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>We do not for a moment suggest that the trial judge 
      has not the right – it may often be the duty- to obtain from the witnesses 
      evidence in addition to that brought out by counsel – but this is adjectival, 
      to clear-up, to add to, what counsel has brought out.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Evans J.A. then added his own description 
  of improper judicial intervention:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>When a judge intervenes in the examination or cross-examination 
      of witnesses, to such an extent that he projects himself into the arena, 
      he of necessity, adopts a position which is inimical to the interests of 
      one or other of the litigants. His action, whether conscious or unconscious, 
      no matter how well intentioned or motivated, creates an atmosphere which 
      violates the principle that “justice not only be done, but appear to be 
      done.” Intervention amounting to interference in the conduct of a trial 
      destroys the image of judicial impartiality and deprives the Court of jurisdiction. 
      The right to intervene is one of degree and there cannot be a precise line 
      of demarcation but if it can be fairly said that it amounted to the usurpation 
      of the function of counsel it is not permissible.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In this case, the 
  trial judge’s interventions not only exceeded the acceptable limits; they were 
  entirely directed at assisting the respondent. Consequently, they created an 
  appearance of unfairness. In particular, the trial judge’s preoccupation with 
  the respondent’s policy manual is a matter of concern. The trial judge diverted 
  the trial away from the issues the parties sought to present and toward what 
  he conceived to be the central issue. The reasons for judgment then dealt extensively 
  with what the judge concluded was Arbor’s failure to follow its policy manual 
  with respect to progressive discipline and to correctly interpret the circumstances 
  which could warrant instant dismissal in accordance with the manual.</span><span> </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The respondent submits 
  that we should affirm the judgment on the basis of <i>McKinlay v. B.C. Tel</i>, 
  a case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada after the trial in the case at 
  bar, where the court discussed the law of dismissal for cause where there has 
  been dishonest conduct on the part of the employee. The Supreme Court effectively 
  confirmed the legal validity of the conclusion reached by the trial judge in 
  this case, that not all dishonest conduct creates just cause for dismissal without 
  notice. However, the Supreme Court also held that the question of whether the
