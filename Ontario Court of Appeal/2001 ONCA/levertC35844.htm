style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant appeals from his conviction and sentence for sexual 
  interference.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  On the appeal from 
  conviction, he submits that the verdict following a trial before Cusson&nbsp;J. 
  and a jury was unreasonable.  He therefore asks that this court enter an acquittal.  
  In the alternative, he submits that a new trial is required because of a number 
  of serious improprieties by Crown counsel in the conduct of the cross-examination 
  of the appellant and in the jury address.  If this court should uphold the conviction, 
  the appellant asks that the custodial part of the sentence of six months’ imprisonment 
  and two years’ probation be varied to a conditional sentence.  For the reasons 
  that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant met M.L. at a swimming pool in Ottawa.  M.L. was 
  the foster mother of the complainant P.G.  P.G. was five or six years of age 
  at the time.  He was fourteen years of age at the trial.  The appellant and 
  M.L. became friends and the appellant took an interest in P.G.  The appellant 
  is a school teacher and became something of a big brother to the complainant.  
  The appellant took the complainant and other boys on various outings and on 
  occasion the complainant and one of his friends slept over at the appellant’s 
  home.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant has several disabilities.  He is dyslexic, cannot 
  tell time, days or months, cannot read nor write nor count and does not have 
  a good memory.  He suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder, has difficulty concentrating, 
  and has been taking Ritalin since the age of seven or eight years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The charges against the appellant relate to two incidents.  The 
  complainant testified that when he was nine or ten years of age he and a friend, 
  C.B., were sleeping over at the appellant’s home.  He testified that the appellant 
  came down to the basement where he was sleeping.  The appellant put his hand 
  on the complainant’s penis, underneath his clothing and was “playing” with it.  
  C.B. was present at the time but was not called as a witness.  The complainant 
  was not sure whether C.B. would have seen anything.  The complainant remembered 
  that he and his friend had been watching a particular movie earlier in the night.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant remembered the time when the complainant and C.B. 
  slept over at his home and had been watching the movie described by the complainant.  
  The appellant admitted that he went down to the basement where the complainant 
  and C.B. were staying.  He testified, however, that he went downstairs because 
  the boys were supposed to be sleeping but were still watching the movie.  The 
  appellant stayed with the boys and watched the last fifteen minutes of the movie 
  and then turned off the television.  He denied any improper touching.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second incident testified to by the complainant occurred 
  when the appellant took him rollerblading at an arena.  According to the complainant, 
  after parking his vehicle, the appellant reached across and put his hand on 
  top of the complainant’s penis over his clothing.  The complainant could not 
  identify the arena where this occurred nor could he say how long it lasted.  
  He did testify that he and the appellant were alone in the vehicle at the time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant’s foster mother confirmed that the appellant 
  took the complainant and other boys to arenas for rollerblading.  Counsel for 
  the appellant asserts that the effect of her evidence is that, contrary to the 
  complainant’s evidence, the appellant was never alone with the complainant on 
  these trips, as there were always other boys or adults in the car.  The appellant 
  testified that he took the complainant rollerblading but that he was never alone 
  in his car with the complainant on these trips.  On the other hand, the appellant 
  conceded that he was alone with the complainant in his vehicle on other occasions, 
  such as camping trips.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In January 1998, the complainant went to live with his birth 
  mother but he continued to visit M.L.  In February 1998, the complainant told 
  M.L. about the inappropriate touching.  M.L. and her husband confronted the 
  appellant with the complainant’s allegations.  According to M.L., the appellant 
  “just sat back and it was like, no big deal.  Like he just talked very low, 
  very, very, very calm”.  The appellant denied the allegations.  In his testimony, 
  he accepted this characterization of his conduct when confronted with the allegations.  
  He explained that he is generally a calm person and he had no real concern because 
  M.L. was a good friend and he was sure she would find out that nothing improper 
  had occurred.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL FROM CONVICTION</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  First, he submits 
  that the verdict is unreasonable.  Second, he submits that misconduct by Crown 
  counsel in his cross-examination of the appellant and in his jury address so 
  tainted the trial as to cause actual prejudice to the appellant’s right to a 
  fair trial, or at least created an appearance of unfairness.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Unreasonable verdict</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable 
  because it depends entirely upon the unconfirmed evidence of the complainant.  
  He points out that the complainant has a number of “serious personal difficulties” 
  that make his evidence unreliable.  Further, that evidence is not only contradicted 
  by the appellant but by M.L. with respect to whether the complainant was ever 
  alone with the appellant on the rollerblading trips.  The appellant also particularly 
  relies upon this part of the cross-examination of M.L.  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.            Did [the complainant] have problems on occasions with – with 
      his ability to tell the truth?  Did he ever get into trouble for things 
      like that?  Telling stories, or making things up?</p>
    <p>A.            He didn’t tell stories but he did lie at times.</p>
    <p>Q.            Okay.</p>
    <p>A.            Just so that he would not be in trouble.</p>
    <p>Q.            Yeah.  But you saw that.  Again, I don’t – I’m not – I don’t 
      want you to take this on – that I’m trying in some way to be horrible but 
      did you- did you see that as – on occasions a problem that he was lying?</p>
    <p>A.            He did not lie a lot but he did on occasion.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This testimony must, however, be considered 
  with Crown counsel’s re-examination of M.L.:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.            [Defence counsel], Ma’am, questioned you about P. lying on 
      certain things.  What type of things would P. lie about, Ma’am?</p>
    <p>A.            Well, not eating his apple and his lunch.  Things like that.  
      He would say that he ate it but he threw it in the garbage.  Or, one time 
      he- he borrowed something from a friend and he said that his friend had 
      given it to him.  And so when I confronted him after a week that he still 
      had it, he said no, he lent to me, I have to give back to him.</p>
    <p>Q.            So he admitted that he had lied?</p>
    <p>A.            Yeah.</p>
    <p>Q.            To your knowledge, did he ever lie about something, which 
      would accuse someone of doing something?</p>
    <p>A.            No.  And every time he would lie, he would tell me after 
      that he had lied.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I should point out that counsel for the appellant argues as part 
  of the second ground of appeal that this re-examination was improper.  For reasons 
  that I will elaborate on when I discuss that ground of appeal, it is my view 
  that this re-examination was not improper in the circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have said, the complainant was fourteen years of age when 
  he testified.  While the dates of the alleged offences were somewhat uncertain 
  because of the complainant’s disabilities, it is likely that they occurred three 
  to four years earlier.  The complainant had some problems with his memory.  
  However, he was able to remember aspects of the incidents that the appellant 
  confirmed, such as the name of the movie the complainant and his friend were 
  watching at the appellant’s home.  The complainant’s description of the two 
  incidents of improper touching seems to have remained constant, although there 
  was some inconsistency in minor details, such as the distance he and the appellant 
  drove before reaching the rollerblading arena and the size of the parking lot.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant nevertheless submits that because of the complainant’s 
  disabilities, the verdict is unreasonable.  He submits that the complainant’s 
  evidence is so unreliable that a conviction based on that evidence cannot stand.  
  This court has the power to overturn a verdict of guilty based upon findings 
  of credibility if those findings are unreasonable.  McLachlin J. summarized 
  the limits of this court’s jurisdiction in <i>R. v. W.&nbsp;(R.)</i> (1992), 
  74 C.C.C. (3d) 134 (S.C.C.) at 142:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The trial judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate court, of seeing 
      and hearing the evidence of witnesses.  However, as a matter of law it remains 
      open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility 
      where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages 
      afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While this was said in the context of a trial by judge alone, 
  this court has a similar power to intervene in a trial by jury.  I am not convinced 
  that a finding in favour of the credibility, including reliability, of the complainant’s 
  evidence is unreasonable.  In this respect, a viable argument can be made that 
  the attack on the complainant’s evidence is based upon unsubstantiated preconceptions 
  about children with these types of disabilities.  There is nothing to indicate 
  that with all of his problems, mostly learning disabilities, the complainant 
  was unable to accurately recall that the appellant had abused him.  The evidence 
  of the complainant had to be carefully considered since it was the sole foundation 
  of the Crown’s case and the complainant was testifying to events several years 
  earlier.  That evidence was not, however, inherently unreliable because of the 
  complainant’s learning disabilities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The testimony from his foster mother that the complainant lied 
  on occasion about trivial matters was no foundation for rejecting testimony 
  given under oath in a court of law.  The jurors, relying upon their common sense 
  and experience with children, were well positioned to determine the weight to 
  give to this testimony.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant also submits that the complainant’s testimony was 
  contradicted by M.L. as to whether the complainant was alone with the appellant 
  on one of the rollerblading trips.  I have reviewed M.L.’s evidence on this 
  point and, in my view, it is not at all clear that she contradicted the complainant.  
  M.L. testified that when the appellant took the complainant to Montreal to go 
  rollerblading, there were other boys in the car.  However, there were rollerblading 
  outings to places other than Montreal.  On these occasions there were “sometimes” 
  other boys present, according to M.L.  The appellant confirmed that there were 
  “many” rollerblading outings, although he testified that at least one other 
  boy was always present.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant pointed to nine instances of alleged 
  impropriety by Crown counsel in his cross-examination of the appellant and his 
  jury address.  In the course of oral argument, we asked counsel for the respondent 
  to respond to one other aspect of the jury address.  I point out that neither 
  counsel who appeared before this court were counsel at trial.  I will deal with 
  most, but not all, of the alleged improprieties below.  Some, in my view, were 
  trivial complaints.</p>

  </span></span> I have already set out the cross-examination and re-examination 
  of M.L. concerning the complainant’s alleged propensity to lie.  No objection 
  was taken by Crown counsel to the cross-examination and no objection was taken 
  by defence counsel to the re-examination.  Experienced counsel represented the 
  appellant.  He obviously perceived a tactical advantage in asking M.L. about 
  the complainant’s veracity.  That perceived advantage was pursued in this court 
  when Mr. Shore, counsel for the appellant, attempted to bolster the unreasonable 
  verdict argument by relying upon the cross-examination.  I do not see how the 
  appellant can complain when Crown counsel amplifies the record to put this evidence 
  in perspective.  The fact that the complainant, like most children, was capable 
  of lying about trivial matters was of little assistance to the jury in their 
  task of deciding whether he was lying in court under oath about these serious 
  allegations.  As this court said in R. v. Clarke (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 
  pp. 13-4:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Testifying under oath is so rare and a trial is such an unusual event 
      that a person's reputation for honesty and veracity in everyday affairs 
      is not likely to be of substantial assistance in predicting behaviour on 
      the witness-stand. Specific safeguards surround testimony in a court of 
      law that are simply not part of the environment of everyday life. In court, 
      the witness is sworn to tell the truth and is subject to prosecution for 
      lying under oath. The testimony takes place before a judge and sometimes 
      a jury and the witnesses know that they are subject to cross-examination. 
      This is not to say that witnesses do not lie under oath. <u>However, the 
      circumstances under which a person may be willing to lie under oath are 
      probably considerably different from the circumstances in which he or she 
      would lie to an acquaintance or even acquire a reputation for lack of veracity</u>.

  </span></span> The jurors, using common sense, could probably have reached that 
  conclusion on their own.  However, the Crown was entitled to re-examine M.L. 
  to avoid leaving the jury with an unfair and distorted picture of the complainant’s 
  capacity to tell the truth.  See <i>R. v. McMillan</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d)

  counsel to cross-examine the appellant to suggest that the complainant was the 
  “perfect victim”.  After receiving a denial from the appellant that he sexually 
  assaulted the complainant, Crown counsel suggested to the appellant that P.G. 
  was the perfect victim because he would have a problem remembering things.  
  Crown counsel repeated this theme in his jury address in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… well, wasn’t P.G. just perfect for Gerald Levert?  Young, intellectually 
      challenged, not much family support …</p>
    <p>A conclusion, ladies and gentleman of the jury, as I have already indicated, 
      the Crown’s theory is that P.G. was the ideal victim for Gerald Levert.  
      And that P. was in fact sexually abused as he described.  Is there any other 
      logical and reasonable conclusion?</p>

  </span></span> I agree with counsel for the appellant that these parts of the 
  cross-examination and jury address were improper.  This line of argument is 
  based on the inadmissible theory that the appellant had a propensity to sexually 
  assault young boys and was just looking for the “perfect victim”.  The substantial 
  attack on the credibility and reliability of the complainant by the defence 
  because of the complainant’s learning and other disabilities did not justify 
  this attack on the appellant’s character.  I will consider the impact of these

  reaction when M.L. and her husband confronted him with the complainant’s allegations.  
  The effect of that evidence was that the appellant was “very, very, very calm”, 
  “not on the defensive at all”, but that he denied the allegations.  The appellant 
  was cross-examined on this evidence.  He dealt very well with the evidence.  
  In clear terms he explained his reaction.  He knew M.L. to be a good friend 
  and was sure that once they talked it out with the complainant she would discover 
  that nothing had happened.  In his jury address, Crown counsel invited the jury

  The law governing admission of this type of evidence is set out in <i>R. v.

  </span></span> Since it was not suggested that the appellant had adopted the 
  allegations, the only possible basis upon which the evidence of the appellant’s 
  demeanour on being confronted with the allegation could be relevant in this 
  case is that his unusually calm reaction was evidence of consciousness of guilt.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The probative value of this type of evidence is highly suspect.  
  In the two recent cases of Susan Nelles and Guy Paul Morin use of the accuseds’ 
  demeanour was found to have played a part in the wrongful prosecution.  The 
  <i>Report of The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin</i>, 1998, 
  vol. 2, pp. 1142 to 1150, contains an extensive discussion of the dangers of 
  admitting such demeanour evidence.  The expert and other evidence introduced 
  at the Commission strongly suggests that this evidence can be highly suspect 
  and should be admitted at a criminal trial with caution.  Perceptions of guilt 
  based on demeanour are likely to depend upon highly subjective impressions that 
  may be difficult to convey to the jury and in any event the significance of 
  the reaction will often be equivocal.<a href="#_ftn2"

  and use of the evidence in this case did not impair a fair trial.  As I have 
  said, the appellant handled this part of the case very well.  I see no basis 
  for believing that the jury would have attached undue weight to this part of 
  the Crown’s case.  It received only brief attention in the cross-examination 
  of the appellant and the Crown’s jury address.  In his address, defence counsel, 
  in effect, invited the jury to find that the appellant’s response showed his 
  innocence.  While it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have 
  directed the jury to ignore the evidence, rather than refer to it as an aspect 
  of the Crown’s case, I am not satisfied that the use of the evidence rendered 
  the trial unfair.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As Crown prosecutor I’m not in this to win or lose.  The concept of winning

  the remarks by Crown counsel about defence counsel’s skill were disingenuous 
  and designed to denigrate defence counsel and thus his client.  It would seem 
  that the trial judge did not draw the same inference from Crown counsel’s conduct.  
  I think in this area an appellate court should ordinarily defer to the trial 
  judge’s view.  We can only rely upon the transcript and, subject to some comments

  </span></span> I am concerned about Crown counsel explicitly setting out his 
  view of the role of the Crown.  There is a danger that it invites an invidious 
  comparison with defence counsel’s role.  In other words, the jury may give more 
  weight to the submissions of Crown counsel because of the impression that they 
  are objective whereas the submissions of defence counsel should be discounted

  by the court in <i>Boucher v. The King</i> (1954), 110 C.C.C. 263 (S.C.C.).  
  In that case, Crown counsel said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>It is the duty of the Crown, when an affair like that happens, no matter 
      what affair, and still more in a serious affair, to make every possible

      the conclusion is come to that the accused is not guilty or that there is 
      a reasonable doubt, it is the duty of the Crown, gentlemen, to say so, or 
      if the conclusion is come to that he is not guilty, not to make an arrest. 
      That is what was done here.</span></p>
    <p><span

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Many, if not the majority of, jurors acting, it may be, for the first time, 
      unacquainted with the language and proceedings of Courts, and with no precise 
      appreciation of the role of the prosecution other than as being associated 
      with Government, would be extremely susceptible to the implications of such 
      remarks. <u>So to emphasize a neutral attitude on the part of Crown representatives 
      in the investigation of the facts of a crime is to put the matter to unsophisticated 
      minds as if there had already been an impartial determination of guilt by 
      persons in authority.</u> Little more likely to colour the consideration 
      of the evidence by jurors could be suggested. It is the antithesis of the 
      impression that should be given to them: they only are to pass on the issue 
      and to do so only on what has been properly exhibited to them in the course

  of Crown counsel’s statement to the jury in this case:  “The role of prosecutor 
  excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public

  manner, this will be apparent to the trier of fact.  They need not take unfair 
  advantage of their important role in the administration of justice by wrapping 
  themselves in the <i>Boucher</i> flag.  That said, I cannot think that the jury 
  in this case was so naïve as to accept at face value Crown counsel’s description 
  of his role or that they would unfairly discount the defence submissions.  Unlike 
  <i>Boucher</i>, Crown counsel did not expressly or implicitly suggest that he 
  had investigated the case and determined the appellant was guilty.  Thus, while 
  I think comments like those made by Crown counsel are best avoided, I am satisfied

  </span></span> Of the many allegations of misconduct against the Crown, I have 
  found that those concerning the “perfect victim” were improper.  In <i>R. v. 
  R. (A.J.)</i> (1995), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 168 (Ont. C.A.) at 176 Doherty J.A. described 
  the test to be applied when an appellate court is faced with allegations of 
  Crown impropriety:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are, however, well-established limits on cross-examination. Some 
      apply to all witnesses, others only to the accused. Isolated transgressions 
      of those limits may be of little consequence on appeal. Repeated improprieties 
      during the cross-examination of an accused are, however, a very different 
      matter. As the improprieties mount, the cross-examination may cross over 
      the line from the aggressive to the abusive. When that line is crossed, 
      the danger of a miscarriage of justice is very real. <u>If improper cross-examination 
      of an accused prejudices that accused in his defence or is so improper as 
      to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, an appellate court 
      must intervene</u> . . .  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Crown counsel’s conduct of this case was not a model of propriety 
  even if the “perfect victim” remark is the only one that has the capacity to 
  undermine a fair trial.  I have not, however, been persuaded that this conduct 
  was so improper as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I 
  am also not satisfied that there is a danger of a miscarriage of justice from 
  the  “perfect victim” comments.  The defence was able to present its case.  
  The cross-examination was not abusive.  The appellant handled himself well in 
  the face of a vigorous cross-examination.  Although credibility was the crucial 
  factor in this case, I am satisfied that the improper remarks by Crown counsel 
  did not prejudice a fair trial.  The appellant dealt well with the “perfect 
  victim” cross-examination and there was no evidence at all before the jury to 
  suggest the appellant had any disposition to sexually assault young boys.  The 
  trial judge, apparently in response to some of defence counsel’s complaints 
  about Crown counsel’s jury address, gave the jury a “very special caution” not 
  to speculate and, rather, to base their conclusions on the trial evidence and 
  nothing else.  It follows that I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  this year, the appellant was 51 years of age.  He has no criminal record.  He 
  had been a schoolteacher for almost thirty years but was suspended when these

  </span></span> The trial judge gave extensive consideration to the defence submissions 
  concerning the suitability of a conditional sentence.  In my view, in the course 
  of considering a conditional sentence, he erred in principle in one respect.  
  He said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The present case, in my view, warrants a term of imprisonment in an institution 
      principally because of the breach of trust <u>and to a certain extent lack 
      of remorse.  </u>The accused certainly has the right to maintain his innocence 
      and he can do so even after a court, here composed of a jury of his peers, 
      found him guilty.  <u>The trouble is that always effects the question of 
      risk and security of society.  When a person does not show remorse for activities 
      or offences committed, then at that point I agree with defence that you 
      can’t give him credit as such or take that into account when you are looking 
      at the term of incarceration.  However, it does, in my view, affect the 
      factor of safety of the community and whether or not there is a risk of 
      re-offending.</u>  So, in my view the term of incarceration will address 
      both the deterrence factors and the other factors I have referred to, being 
      general and specific deterrence and denunciation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  at 482–84, Lamer C.J.C. examined the factors to be considered in assessing whether 
  the safety of the community would be endangered by a conditional sentence.  
  He gave particular attention to the risk of re-offence and generally approved 
  of cases where courts enumerated such objective factors as the offender’s prior 
  record, record of compliance with court orders, the nature of the offence, the 
  degree of participation, lifestyle, mental state and conduct while on judicial 
  interim release.  Using these more objective criteria I think it unlikely that 
  the appellant would be a danger to the community while serving a conditional

  </span></span> factors for rejecting a conditional sentence were the seriousness 
  of the conduct and the high moral culpability of the accused.  The appellant 
  was a mature offender.  The complainant’s foster mother had trusted the appellant 
  sufficiently to put this vulnerable boy in his care on many occasions.  On two 
  of those occasions, the appellant abused that trust.  The fact that the abuse 
  was not as intrusive as has been seen in many other cases was reflected in the 
  relatively short period of imprisonment.  While less deference is due the trial 
  judge’s decision because of the error in principle, I am nevertheless satisfied

    is inadmissible if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  
    It is not necessary that the probative value be “slight” and the prejudicial 
    effect “great” to warrant exclusion.</p>
