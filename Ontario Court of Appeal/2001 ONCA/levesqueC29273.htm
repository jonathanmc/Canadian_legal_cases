  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Luc Levesque, is the son of the 
  respondent Berthier Levesque. This action arises out of a collision on a gravel 
  cottage road between the four-wheel all-terrain vehicle driven by the appellant 
  and the pickup truck driven by the respondent. The appellant suffered a permanent 
  and disabling injury to his knee as a result of the accident. Following a trial 
  by judge and jury, the jury found that the accident was 100% attributable to 
  the appellant’s negligence and assessed his damages at a total of $566,634. 
  On February 12, 1998, Stornini J. dismissed the appellant’s action in accordance 
  with the jury’s verdict. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals the judgment on the ground 
  that the jury’s verdict is unreasonable. He asks that the trial judgment be 
  set aside and that judgment be granted by this court for the full amount of 
  damages assessed by the jury at $566,634. Alternatively, the appellant seeks 
  a new trial. The respondent cross-appeals with respect to the quantum of damages 
  for future economic loss. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The standard of appellate review of a jury’s 
  verdict is well-established. This court reiterated the governing principles 
  in <i>Deshane v. Deere &amp; Co. </i>(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 225 at 231-32 in the 
  following succinct excerpt:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span> </span>The principles governing appellate review of the verdict 
      of a jury have been laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>McLean 
      v. McCannell</i>, [1937] S.C.R. 341 at p.&nbsp;343, [1937] 2 D.L.R. 639, 
      so that “the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight 
      of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy 
      the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially 
      could have reached it”.  The principle has been re-affirmed in <i>Vancouver-Fraser 
      Park District v. Olmstead</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 831 at p.&nbsp;839, 51 D.L.R. 
      (3d) 416, where de&nbsp;Grandpr<span
lang=FR-CA>é</span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;J., delivering the judgment of the court, 
      stated:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span> </span>All of the relevant cases make it abundantly clear that 
          jury verdicts must be treated with considerable respect and must be 
          accorded great weight.  This does not mean however that they should 
          be regarded with awe.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was in that case also that the court, at p.&nbsp;836, rejected the suggestion 
      that a verdict should be “perverse”, implying moral turpitude, before it 
      could be set aside.  Instead, the court adopted a test that examines whether 
      the evidence so preponderates against the verdict as to show that it was 
      unreasonable and unjust.  There is a further principle enunciated by Laskin&nbsp;C.J.C. 
      delivering the majority judgment in <i>Cameron v. Excelsior Life Insurance 
      Co.</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 138 at p.&nbsp;142, 119 D.L.R. (3d) 257, and it 
      is that jury’s findings are “entitled to rational appreciation and to be 
      regarded in as favourable a light as the evidence supporting it”.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the verdict cannot 
  be maintained because the jury’s answer to question no.&nbsp;1 preponderates 
  against the evidence of all witnesses to the accident that the respondent was 
  driving his pickup truck in a manner that did not leave one-half of the road 
  clear for the appellant’s vehicle. The appellant further submits that the jury’s 
  findings in answer to question no.&nbsp;4 cannot be supported on the evidence 
  and, in any event, cannot constitute negligence at law. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the appellant’s first submission. It is my view 
  that the overwhelming weight of the evidence established that the respondent, 
  at the time of the collision, did not leave one-half of the road clear for the 
  appellant’s vehicle, as he was required to do pursuant to the<i> Highway Traffic 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;H-8, ss.&nbsp;148 and 149. Hence, on this circumstance 
  alone, a <i>prima facie</i> case of negligence was made out, and it became incumbent 
  upon the respondent to explain that the accident could not have been avoided 
  by the exercise of reasonable care: see <i>Graham v. Hodgkinson</i> (1983), 
  40 O.R. (2d) 697 (C.A.). In my view, the evidence at trial fell far short of 
  providing such an explanation. In these circumstances, the verdict of the jury 
  was unreasonable and unjust.  I am satisfied that the appellant has met the 
  test for appellate intervention and that the jury’s verdict on liability must 
  be set aside. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is my view, however, that while the jury’s verdict was unreasonable 
  in finding the appellant 100% liable for the accident, a finding of contributory 
  negligence can be supported on the evidence. However, the apportionment of negligence 
  is a matter best determined by the trier of fact.  This is not an appropriate 
  case for this court to grant judgment in substitution of the jury’s verdict 
  as requested by the appellant. There must be a new trial with respect to liability.  
  In light of this conclusion, I do not find it necessary, or advisable, to deal 
  with the appellant’s second submission concerning the jury’s specific findings 
  of fact in answer to question no.&nbsp;4.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent’s cross-appeal relates solely to the damages for 
  loss of future income. In defence to the appellant’s claim on this head of damages, 
  the respondent called Mr. Legault, the Director of Human Resources of the appellant’s 
  former employer, Dubreuil Forest Products. The respondent intended to elicit 
  evidence from Mr. Legault    that he would not have hired the appellant at Dubreuil 
  in 1995 if he had not had the injuries that he suffered because of the appellant’s 
  involvement in a previous incident while at work at Dubreuil when he was 16 
  years of age. Allegedly, the appellant would have had a run-in with some of 
  the other employees, would have taken off in a vehicle owned by the company 
  that was not in the best of condition, and would have been involved in an accident. 
  Mr.&nbsp;Legault did not have personal knowledge about the incident in question, 
  and, consequently, Mr. Legault’s testimony was objected to by counsel for the 
  appellant on the basis that it constituted inadmissible hearsay. At the conclusion 
  of a <i>voir dire</i> into the matter, the trial judge ruled that the proposed 
  evidence was inadmissible. The respondent submits that the trial judge erred 
  in so restricting Mr. Legault’s testimony. He submits further that he was prejudiced 
  by this ruling because the appellant’s claim for loss of future income was entirely 
  based on his inability to continue his job at  Dubreuil’s because of his injuries. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, Mr. Legault’s proposed testimony that he, as Director 
  of Human Resources at Dubreuil’s, would not have rehired the appellant in 1995 
  was <i>prima facie </i>relevant and admissible. However, the proposed evidence 
  was of limited value. Mr.&nbsp;Legault’s position appeared to be entirely based 
  on the appellant’s alleged conduct with respect to the previous incident. Mr. 
  Legault had no personal knowledge about this incident and there was no company 
  record about the matter. The appellant was never disciplined by his employer 
  in respect of the incident in question and, indeed, continued his employment 
  at Dubreuil’s and was still employed at the time of the accident which is the 
  subject-matter of this case. Finally, the appellant’s claim for future loss 
  of income was not entirely based on his inability to continue his employment 
  at Dubreuil’s as contended by the respondent. Rather, the actuarial report was 
  based on the assumption that the appellant would have been employed “at the 
  Dubreuil Forest Products Mill or in a forestry related employment” earning a 
  similar income. The real significance of the actuarial assumption, particularly 
  having regard to the appellant’s age, was not that it was likely that he would 
  have continued to work until retirement specifically at Dubreuil’s  but rather 
  that he would likely have been employed in similar kind of work. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the circumstances of this case, Mr. Legault’s proposed testimony 
  had little, if any, probative value and the trial judge would have been entitled 
  to instruct the jury accordingly.  Consequently,  I am not satisfied that the 
  trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion to exclude the evidence, 
  or that the exclusion of the evidence caused any prejudice to the respondent. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, 
  set aside the judgment, and dismiss the cross-appeal. Unlike the situation in 
  <i>Graham v. Hodgkinson</i>, there is no suggestion in this case that the jury’s 
  unreasonable conclusion on liability may have affected its findings on the question 
  of damages. Nor is there any other reason to interfere with the jury’s assessment. 
  Consequently, I would order a new trial on the issue of liability only. I would 
  grant the appellant his costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal, and reserve 
  the costs of the first trial to the presiding judge on the new trial. </span></p>
