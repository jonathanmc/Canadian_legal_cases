<p>On appeal from the summary conviction appeal by Justice Archie Campbell on 
  October&nbsp;11, 2000 dismissing an appeal from the conviction on December 8, 
  1999 imposed by Justice Gordon Hachborn.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals his conviction for driving with a blood/alcohol 
  level which exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The 
  sole ground of appeal is the assertion that the appellant was denied his right 
  to counsel in accordance with s.&nbsp;10(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms</i> before he gave his breath samples which formed the basis of 
  the conviction.</p>
<p> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial proceeded by defence counsel delineating for the judge three 
  issues to be decided including the s. 10(b) issue. The Crown then called the 
  arresting officer as the first witness. After the officer's evidence was completed, 
  counsel informed the judge that they were prepared to proceed with submissions 
  on the s. 10(b) issue. Although the appellant testified in his defence, he did 
  not testify during the s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> <i>voir dire</i> nor did he give 
  any evidence addressing that issue. </p>
<p> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The officer testified that when he placed the appellant under arrest 
  for impaired driving, he advised him of his right to counsel and asked him if 
  he understood. The appellant indicated that he did and that he had his own lawyer, 
  Mr. Cohen. At the station, the appellant was taken to the &quot;report room&quot; 
  to contact his lawyer. However, the officer was the one who called the number 
  which the appellant gave him, which was an office number. The time was 12:53 
  a.m. Understandably, there was no answer, and the officer left a message on 
  what he referred to as &quot;Mr. Cohen's service&quot;, which he later clarified 
  as his machine. He immediately then called and left a message for duty counsel, 
  and received a return call shortly thereafter. He explained to duty counsel 
  that the appellant did not wish to speak with duty counsel as he believed they 
  were only students. He also told the duty counsel that the appellant had been 
  unable to contact his own personal lawyer.</p>
<p> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> He then indicated to the appellant that duty counsel was on the phone 
  for him, and took the appellant into the booth where he spoke with duty counsel 
  for a little while. The appellant made no further requests to contact his own 
  counsel and did not complain after speaking to duty counsel, but voluntarily 
  gave the breath samples at 1:29 a.m. </p>
<p> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In cross-examination the officer agreed that beyond leaving the message 
  on the answering machine at Mr. Cohen's office, he took no other steps to assist 
  the appellant to try to contact Mr. Cohen. He agreed that he did not, for example, 
  offer to look up the lawyer’s home number or provide to the appellant a room 
  with a telephone and a telephone book in it. The officer also agreed that he 
  placed the call to duty counsel in the face of the appellant's specific objection 
  to speaking to duty counsel, although the appellant was misinformed about the 
  nature of the qualifications of duty counsel.</p>
<p> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The crux of the decision by the trial judge to dismiss the appellant’s 
  <i>Charter </i>application is the following finding:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I’ve been referred to some case law, which would indicate that a reasonable 
      opportunity must be given to an accused person to retain and instruct counsel, 
      or at least speak to a lawyer. And the cases vary because of circumstances.</p>
    <p>And in the circumstances here, I find that Mr. Littleford was not denied 
      his right pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter. He did get advice from a 
      lawyer that was a Legal Aid duty counsel. And that seemed to satisfy him 
      at the time.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>An appeal to the summary conviction appeal court was dismissed.</p>
<p> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that his s. 10(b) rights were violated because 
  he expressed the wish to speak to his own lawyer, and was not given a reasonable 
  opportunity to do so. The basis for this submission is his assertion that after 
  a perfunctory attempt was made by the officer to reach that lawyer, the officer 
  immediately contacted and put the appellant in touch with duty counsel, contrary 
  to his wishes and therefore contrary to his rights.</p>
<p style=' &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On a <i>Charter</i> motion, the onus is on the accused person to prove 
  a breach of his or her <i>Charter</i> rights on a balance of probabilities. 
  The difficulty with the appellant’s position in this case is that he did speak 
  to duty counsel before taking the breathalyzer test. He neither raised any concern 
  at the time, nor did he testify on the <i>voir dire</i> to suggest that he misunderstood 
  his rights at the time or that the conduct of the police officer affected his 
  ability to assert those rights. The trial judge made a finding that speaking 
  to duty counsel “seemed to satisfy him at the time.” There is no basis on the 
  record to disturb that finding.</p>
<p style=' &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In those circumstances, the appellant has not met the onus of proving 
  a breach of s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. Leave to appeal is granted but the 
  appeal is dismissed.</p>
