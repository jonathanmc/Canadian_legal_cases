<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John R. Jennings 
  dated December 31, 1999.</span></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants (plaintiffs) appeal the dismissal of their action 
  for damages for medical malpractice arising out of the delivery and birth of 
  the minor Luca Liuni.  The appellant Dalia Liuni gave birth to Luca by way of 
  an emergency caesarean section performed by the respondent Dr. Peters, the attending 
  obstetrician at the Markham Stouffville Hospital.  Luca is now eleven years 
  old.  He has cerebral palsy with athetoid dyskinesia and spastic quadriplegia.  
  He is essentially totally dependent for all aspects of his care.  He is non-verbal 
  but has a good understanding of his surroundings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The action proceeded to trial before Jennings J. only against 
  the respondent Dr.&nbsp;Christine J. Peters.  The action was settled or dismissed 
  against the other named defendants.  The parties agreed on the quantum of damages 
  and the trial proceeded on the issues of standard of care and causation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to make a finding on causation of Luca’s injury and that this failure affected 
  his conclusion on liability. They also contend that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence with respect to Dr.&nbsp;Peters’ arrival at Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni’s bedside, 
  the evidence of the appellants’ experts and the evidence of the information 
  and options available to Dr.&nbsp;Peters prior to the delivery. They submit 
  that the trial judge failed to apply the proper standard of care for a breech 
  delivery.  They further submit that Dr.&nbsp;Peters breached an undertaking 
  to Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni to perform a caesarean section at the first sign of fetal 
  distress.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant Mrs. Liuni had a normal and healthy second pregnancy.  
  However, the baby was in a breech position.  The period of time that was relevant 
  in this action was from the time of Mrs. Liuni’s admission at the hospital at 
  17:00 and the delivery of Luca at 18:50 on March 30, 1990.  More specifically, 
  the time between 18:05, when Dr.&nbsp;Peters was called to reassess the patient, 
  and approximately 18:30 when the decision to proceed with the caesarean section 
  was made, is especially pertinent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> All experts agreed that Dr.&nbsp;Peters’ initial assessment following 
  Mrs. Liuni’s admission was complete and appropriate.  There was no criticism 
  of Dr.&nbsp;Peters’ conduct at any time until after she was paged to reassess 
  the patient.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the bedside, there was little to assist Dr. Peters with fetal 
  heart rate.  There were technical difficulties with the hospital equipment in 
  monitoring the fetal heart rate and for a short time there was an absence of 
  useful tracing.  The experts’ opinions varied greatly on the question of when 
  fetal distress became apparent in this case.  The plaintiffs’ experts were inconsistent 
  among themselves on the question of when it occurred and on whether it required 
  immediate intervention.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Peters became concerned about possible fetal distress at 
  18:20 and decided at that time that delivery by the most expeditious route was 
  necessary.  As the active labour was progressing quicker than first anticipated, 
  she determined that a short trial vaginal delivery was indicated and in the 
  event of fetal distress or inadequate progress, a caesarean section would be 
  performed.  Numerous experts agreed that Dr. Peters’ decision was reasonable 
  and appropriate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When vaginal delivery did not succeed, Dr. Peters immediately 
  proceeded with a caesarean section.  Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni was prepared for the surgery 
  at 18:40 and the baby was delivered at 18:50.  There was no criticism of Dr. 
  Peters’ performance of the caesarean section.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is well accepted that in civil cases, appellate 
  courts will not interfere with the factual findings of the trier of fact “unless 
  it can be established that the learned trial judge made some palpable and overriding 
  error which affected his assessment of the facts”. See <i>Stein v. The Ship 
  “Kathy K”,</i> [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802 at 808.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As O’Connor J.A. stated in <i>Keljanovic Estate</i> 
  <i>v. Sanseverino</i> (2000), 186 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 481 at para. 25:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is well accepted that an appellate court will only interfere with a 
      finding of fact where a trial judge has made a clear or manifest error.  
      The requirement that errors be clear or manifest imposes a deferential standard 
      of reasonableness, not correctness.  This means that an appellate court 
      will not interfere simply because it disagrees with the finding of fact, 
      but only if it concludes that the finding is unreasonable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell v. Burnaby Hospital, </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 
  114 at 122, a malpractice case similar to the present case, McLachlin J. held 
  that “the principle of non-intervention of a Court of Appeal in a trial judge’s 
  findings of facts does not apply with the same force to inferences drawn from 
  conflicting testimony of expert witnesses where the credibility of these witnesses 
  is not in issue”.  However, she went on to note that “[t]his does not…change 
  the fact that the weight to be assigned to the various pieces of evidence is 
  under our trial system essentially the province of the trier of fact, in this 
  case the trial judge.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> One of the main grounds of appeal concerns the failure of the 
  trial judge to deal with the issue of causation.  The appellants maintain that 
  unless this court is disposed to make the necessary finding, this was an error 
  that requires a new trial.  They rely on the decisions of this court in <i>Meringolo 
  (Committee of ) v. Oshawa General Hospital,</i> [1991] O.J. No. 91 (Ont. C.A.) 
  and <i>Grass v. Weisberg, </i>[2001] O.J. No. 1766 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although it is usually preferable, whenever possible, to determine 
  causation explicitly in a medical malpractice action, there is no absolute rule 
  or legal prescription to this effect.  Whether the failure to determine causation 
  will constitute legal error will depend on the facts of each case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Meringolo</i>, the critical issue on liability was whether 
  the plaintiff’s brain damage suffered during the course of a surgical procedure 
  was caused by pulmonary embolism and resulting cardiac arrest or by the anesthetist’s 
  failure to ensure adequate ventilation.  If the cause was the latter, it would 
  give rise to an inference of negligence.  However, the trial judge dismissed 
  the action against the surgeon and the anesthetist without making any finding 
  on the issue of causation, finding that neither had breached his professional 
  duty.  On appeal, this court held that the trial judge had erred in failing 
  to make a finding on the issue of causation.  On its review of the medical evidence, 
  the court found that it was necessary to determine the issue of causation as 
  a preliminary matter before a proper assessment could be made on the appropriate 
  standard of care.  In the circumstances of that case, this court held that it 
  was in as good a position as the trial judge to make the necessary findings 
  and it proceeded to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Grass</span></i> was another case where there 
  were conflicting theories on causation.  The plaintiff’s theory was that the 
  misuse of forceps during delivery was the cause of the plaintiff’s brain damage.  
  The defendant took the position that the brain damage occurred prior to the 
  onset of labour.  The trial judge found it unnecessary to resolve this conflict 
  and dismissed the action on the basis that there had been no breach of standard 
  of care.  As in <i>Meringolo</i>, this court held that the “resolution of causation 
  might have led to different findings of fact … and to a different conclusion 
  with respect to negligence.”  Hence the court found that the trial judge had 
  erred in failing to make the critical finding on the issue of causation.  Unlike 
  <i>Meringolo</i>, the court did not find itself in a position to resolve the 
  conflict on the basis of the record and consequently ordered a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the present case, there was no issue as to the cause of the 
  injury to Luca.  Both parties agreed that it was due to oxygen deprivation during 
  labour.  While the parties at trial advanced conflicting positions as to when 
  the injury occurred, this conflict had no bearing on the trial judge’s assessment 
  of the evidence related to the appropriate standard of care.  The critical issue 
  remained whether, on the basis of all the evidence, Dr. Peters’ decision to 
  proceed first with a trial vaginal delivery before resorting to the caesarian 
  section met the requisite standard of care.  Further, it is implicit from the 
  trial judge’s reasons that he accepted the appellant’s position that the injury 
  occurred during the time that Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni was in Dr.&nbsp;Peters’ care and 
  not before she came to the hospital.  Otherwise, he would have dismissed the 
  action outright without considering the standard of care.  In my view, the issues 
  on appeal can be determined on the basis of the same implicit findings.  I would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence with respect to Dr.&nbsp;Peters’ arrival at Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni’s bedside 
  when she was paged to reassess the patient.  The evidence is quite clear that 
  she was paged at 18:05, as found by the trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants also submitted that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence of the plaintiffs’ experts in relation to the information available 
  to Dr. Peters when she returned to assess the patient at 18:05 and that as a 
  result, the trial judge discounted their evidence.  The trial judge commented 
  that the evidence of the plaintiffs’ experts was tainted because the experts 
  based their analysis on a script from the central monitor prepared months after 
  the accident and not on the basis of what was being seen at <b>the</b> bedside 
  by Dr. Peters.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The comment made by the trial judge does not indicate that he 
  misapprehended the evidence.  On the contrary, the trial judge carefully reviewed 
  the evidence of the experts, assessed the weight to be given to their evidence, 
  and for logical reasons he preferred the evidence of the defence experts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Much evidence was heard at trial and much was said on appeal 
  about the central monitor at the Markham Stouffville Hospital.  As mentioned 
  earlier, there were technical problems with the bedside monitor.  The appellants 
  argued that Dr. Peters should have obtained the information that would have 
  been available from the central monitor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was pointed out in the evidence that at 18:05 Dr. Peters was 
  coming back to a patient who had experienced a normal pregnancy.  She immediately 
  proceeded to examine the patient and took steps to do her own monitoring.  There 
  was evidence about the questionable reliability of electronic monitoring.  There 
  was also evidence that the doctor’s place was with her patient where she was 
  not running the risk of missing any signs that helped her assess the condition 
  of her patient.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In these circumstances, it was clearly open 
  to the trial judge to conclude that with respect to the issue relating to the 
  central monitor, Dr. Peters did not breach the acceptable standard of practice.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A similar issue was raised with respect to the failure of Dr. 
  Peters to take a blood sample of the baby in order to ascertain its condition.  
  It is uncertain, on the evidence, whether a blood sample would have assisted 
  Dr. Peters in her assessment of Mrs. Liuni.  First, there was a question whether 
  it would have been practical to take a blood sample because of the time involved 
  in getting the results back.  Second, there was evidence that it would be of 
  doubtful benefit to obtain a blood sample in a case of a breech presentation 
  of this kind.   In any event, in addition to the defence evidence, it was agreed 
  by one expert for the appellants that standard practice did not require that 
  a blood sample be taken.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants further contend that the trial judge erred in 
  failing to adopt the “Breech Plus Rule” as the appropriate standard of care.  
  The “Breech Plus Rule” provides that a trial of vaginal delivery in a breech 
  presentation is reasonable only if the labour is normal and there is no sign 
  of fetal distress.  The assertion of an absolute rule that vaginal delivery 
  instantly becomes inappropriate with a breech presentation at the first sign 
  of fetal distress is not consistent with the preponderance of the evidence.</p>

  </span></span> Finally, I see no merit in the appellants’ submission that Dr.&nbsp;Peters 
  had breached her undertaking to Mrs.&nbsp;Liuni that she would proceed to deliver 
  the baby by caesarean section at the first sign of fetal distress. There was 
  no pleading of a breach of undertaking nor was it argued at trial.  In any event, 
  there is cogent evidence that what was said was that Dr. Peters would proceed 
  with a caesarean section if she was concerned about fetal distress or inadequate 
  progress in labour.  That is exactly what she did.</p>

  </span></span> This case was essentially a factual one.  In the end, the trial 
  judge found no breach of the standard of care in relation to the diagnosis and 
  treatment of Mrs. Liuni on March&nbsp;30, 1990. This finding is reasonable and 
  it is amply supported by the evidence.</p>
