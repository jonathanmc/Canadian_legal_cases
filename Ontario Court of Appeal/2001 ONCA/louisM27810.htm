lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law moves 
  for an order under rule 13.03(2) granting it leave to intervene as a friend 
  of the court in this appeal by the plaintiffs from a judgment of Benotto J., 
  the reasons for which are reported at 54 O.R. (3d) 286 (S.C.J.).  The motion 
  has been argued in writing by the moving party and the respondent in the appeal.  
  The appellants have not filed a factum but have notified the court that they 
  support the motion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I am satisfied that sufficient has been shown 
  to grant the order sought subject to the conditions set forth at the conclusion 
  of this endorsement.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The basic matters to be considered on a motion 
  such as this are set forth in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic 
  &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada Ltd.</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164 at 167 (C.A.), 
  particularly “the issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being 
  able to make a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing 
  injustice to the immediate parties”. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As far as the issues in this appeal are concerned, it may be 
  noted from the appellants’ factum that the number of matters now in issue is 
  reduced from the number argued before, and decided by, the motions judge.  They 
  now all relate to the submitted fiduciary obligations of the defendant to the 
  plaintiffs and no longer include claims based on unjust enrichment or tort.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The moving party has been granted intervenor status in many previous 
  cases at all levels of tribunal and court.  In family law matters it has represented 
  youth who seek access to their siblings and it has significant experience representing 
  youth in support applications against their parents.  I refer now to some of 
  the basic submissions it would make on the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The moving party submits that the <i>Family Law Act</i> and the 
  <i>Divorce Act</i> are not “complete codes” with respect to support owed by 
  parents to their children.  In making these submissions, it would refer to rights 
  contained in the United Nations <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child </i>as 
  they inform and complement the concept of “best interests” and to the effect 
  of the ratification of the <i>Convention</i> on domestic law.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Article 4 of the <i>Convention</i> requires state parties to 
  undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for 
  the implementation of the rights recognized in the <i>Convention</i>.  Article 
  3 provides that in all actions concerning children, public and private institutions, 
  courts and administrative bodies and legislative bodies shall make the best 
  interest of the child a primary consideration.  Articles 5 and 12 outline the 
  responsibilities of parents with respect to their children and the right of 
  the child to be heard in proceedings affecting him or her.  Article 9 provides 
  that children have a right of access to their parents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The affidavit of Paul Wollaston, Chair of the 
  moving party, concludes: “If granted leave to intervene, the proposed intervenors 
  will rely on relevant domestic and international human rights obligations and 
  will make reference to relevant statutes and common law principles relating 
  to fiduciary duties, the best interests of children and the standing of children 
  in processes which affect them.”</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The moving party intends to submit that biological parents, as 
  such, without it being necessary to show they have assumed power (as held by 
  the motions judge), have the power or discretion of a fiduciary.  It intends 
  to rely on international documents to inform its argument on the nature and 
  scope of the relevant fiduciary obligations. On the same basis, it will submit 
  that children have the right to know the identity of their biological parents 
  unless it can be shown that it is not in their best interests that the identify 
  be disclosed.  In addition, once the identity of the parent is known, the child 
  should be allowed to seek support in a timely way.  Support entitlement should 
  be retroactive to at least the date on which the parent knows that he or she 
  is a parent, or reasonably ought to have known.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The moving party submits that the resolution of the issues in 
  this case, or, at least some of them, will have far-reaching consequences to 
  a number of children in Ontario.  In particular, all children are affected by 
  a decision as to whether parents owe a fiduciary obligation to their children 
  that exists independently of, and in addition to, any statutory duties with 
  respect to child support.  All children whose parents have separated are affected 
  by a custodial parent’s decision to waive child support.  Many children will 
  be deeply affected by any decision with respect to a parent’s obligation to 
  disclose his or her status as biological parent, if known.  Children cannot 
  (or can only with extreme difficulty) exercise their rights to support and access 
  to their parents if their parents do not disclose their status as parent to 
  the children.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The general position of the responding party is that the moving 
  party’s proposed submissions would be of no assistance in resolving the issues 
  on the appeal.  With respect, it appears to me that the thrust of the responding 
  party’s submissions in this regard is that the proposed submissions of the moving 
  party are not valid or are of little weight.  I wish to make it clear that in 
  granting intervenor status I do not express any view on the ultimate merit of 
  the moving party’s position.  I merely recognize that the moving party has considerable 
  experience in the subject matter of the appeal, or certain aspects of it, which 
  enable it “to place the issues in a slightly different perspective” (<i>Peel 
  (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada Ltd., 
  supra</i> at 167) from that of the appellants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While it may be that the actual decision of the court in this 
  appeal will have impact only on persons in exactly the same position as the 
  plaintiffs, I do not exclude the possibility that aspects of, or steps in, the 
  court’s reasoning could bear on the rights of other children and claims they 
  may have against their biological parents.  At the end of the day, the court 
  may not consider the moving party’s submissions to be of assistance.  As I have 
  just said, I express no opinion on the merits of its position.  What is important 
  is that the court, before making its decision on the correct result and on the 
  appropriate reasons that support this result, should have all of the relevant 
  possibilities brought to its attention, including submissions on the impact 
  on its judgment, not only on the parties, but on those not before the court 
  whose positions may be similar to but not the same as the parties. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I am satisfied that the intervention order can be made without 
  causing any injustice to the responding party.  It is true that the intervention 
  will expand the number of submissions to which the responding party will be 
  obliged to reply but this, which is for the potential benefit of the court, 
  is not an injustice.  Further, having regard to the conditions I attach to the 
  intervention order, the responding party may be compensated for any increased 
  costs resulting from the intervention but will not be liable for costs in connection 
  with it.</p>
