<p class=headingtitle><b>On appeal from the

<p class=headingtitle><b>DOHERTY J.A.:</b></p>

<p class=headingblank style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><b>I</b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant was tried with two other accused on a 31 count
indictment.  He was charged in seven of
the counts (counts 1, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31).  The charges were laid after an investigation of what the police
alleged was a widespread and sophisticated criminal enterprise involving
various criminal activities, including the large scale manufacture and sale of
forged credit cards. </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After a lengthy trial, the appellant was convicted on five
counts and acquitted on two counts (counts 1, 31).  The five convictions (counts 26-30) arose out of charges laid
under s. 369(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  These charges alleged that the appellant was
in possession of various machines and materials adapted for and intended to be
used to create forged credit cards.  The
trial judge imposed a total sentence of 11 months to be followed by one year
probation.  The appellant appeals his
convictions and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant challenges the constitutionality of two searches
executed by the police and contends that material seized in those searches,
including the material referred to in the five counts on which he was
convicted, should have been excluded from evidence.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the word “adapted” in s. 369(b) meant “suitable
for”.  The appellant submits that it
means “altered so as to be suitable for”. 
The material and machines referred to in counts 26, 28, 29, and 30 were
suitable for use in the making of forged credit cards but had not been altered
in any way.  If the appellant’s
submission is correct, he should have succeeded on his motion for a directed
verdict of acquittal on those counts. 
Some of the material referred to in count 27 was altered so as to make
it suitable for use in the creation of forged credit cards.  If the appellant’s submission is correct, he
is entitled to a new trial on that count. 
</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the appellant argues that the convictions arising out
of the alleged possession of material located at 230 Oak Street (counts 27, 28,
29, and 30) were unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would reject the submission that the seized material should
have been excluded, and the argument that four of the convictions were
unreasonable.  I do, however, agree with
the submission that the word “adapted” in s. 369(b) means “altered so as to be
suitable for”, and that the trial judge erred in telling the jury that it meant
“suitable for”.  </p>

<p class=headingblank align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><b>II</b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The grounds of appeal arising out of the execution of the
search warrant do not require detailed analysis.  The police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s residence
at 365 Gerrard Street in Toronto and found the material described in count
26.  Shortly after executing that
warrant, the police obtained and executed a second search warrant at 230 Oak
Street in Toronto.  That search led to
the discovery of the material referred to in count 27 and the machines
described in counts 28, 29, and 30.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was argued at trial that the searches contravened the
appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>
and that the evidence seized in those searches should be excluded under
s.&nbsp;24(2).  The trial judge found
that both search warrants were valid. 
She also found that the warrant to search the appellant’s residence was
executed in an unreasonable manner and thereby breached his rights under s. 8
of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge went on to hold, however,
that the evidence seized in that search should not be excluded under
s.&nbsp;24(2).  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge next decided that the police had effected an unauthorized
and unreasonable search at 230 Oak Street when, prior to obtaining a search
warrant for that location, they had tried a key found at the appellant’s
residence in the lock on the door to 230 Oak Street.  The trial judge found that this unauthorized search was
sufficiently connected to the seizure of the material found at 230 Oak Street
to require a consideration of the admissibility of the evidence under s. 24(2)
of the <i>Charter</i>,  even though the search warrant itself was
proper.  She concluded, however, that
the evidence was admissible.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Assuming the trial judge was correct in finding violations of
s. 8, the appellant has not established any of the grounds that could justify
this Court’s reversal of the trial judge’s conclusion that the evidence should
not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>R. v.
Belnavis</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405 at 422-23 (S.C.C.).  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The submission that the finding that the appellant was in
possession of material found at 230 Oak Street was unreasonable cannot succeed.  There was evidence from which it could be
inferred that the appellant was in possession of a key to 230 Oak Street.  His fingerprint was also found on one item
seized at 230 Oak Street and there was evidence connecting an item found in his
wallet to one of the items seized at 230 Oak Street.  This circumstantial evidence provided a basis upon which a
reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the appellant was in
possession of the items seized at 230 Oak Street and referred to in counts 27,
28, 29, and 30 of the indictment.</p>

<p class=headingblank align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><b>III</b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The meaning to be given to the word “adapted” in s. 369(b) is
a matter of statutory interpretation.  I
need not review the evidence.  It is
sufficient to say that there was evidence from which it could be inferred that the
material and machines referred to in the relevant counts were suitable for use
in the manufacture of forged credit cards. 
There was also evidence from which it could be inferred that the
appellant intended to use the materials and machines to manufacture forged
credit cards.  Finally, as observed
above, there was no evidence that the material or machines referred to in
counts 26, 28, 29, and 30 had been changed or altered in any way so as to make
them suitable for the manufacture of forged credit cards.  They could serve that purpose without any
alteration.  There was evidence that
some of the material referred to in count 27 had been altered by embossment so
as to make it suitable for the manufacture of forged credit cards.  </p>

</span>The conduct component of the offence created by s. 369(b)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 369(b) renders conduct criminal that is preparatory to
the commission of forgery.  It is
colloquially described as possession of “forgers’ tools”.  Section 369(b) is akin to the crime of
attempt or more exactly what Professor Ashworth describes as an “incomplete
attempt”:  A. Ashworth, <i>Principles of Criminal Law</i>, 2d ed.
(Oxford:  Clarendon Press 1995) at
443-44.  The rationale for the offence
created by s. 369(b), like the rationale for attempt, is preventative.  By criminalizing conduct short of actual
forgery engaged in by a person who intends to commit forgery, the state is able
to intervene before the harm caused by the completed crime occurs.  </p>

</span>The argument that “adapted” in s. 369(b) means “altered so as
to be suitable for” was made at trial on a motion for a directed verdict.  The trial judge, after referring to various
dictionaries, acknowledged that the word “adapted” had two recognized
meanings.  It could mean “suited for” or
it could mean “modified or altered so as to be suited for”:  see also <i>R.
v. Formosa</i> (1991), 92 Cr. App. R. 11 at 13 (C.A.).</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After referring to other sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in which the word “adapted” is used to make the point
that the word could have different meanings in different contexts, the trial
judge concluded:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>In my
view, where machines or other materials for forgery are usable for both illegal
and for legal purposes without any modification or alteration, then the most
logical and rational meaning to be given to the word “adapted” in s. 369(b) is
“suited” and not “altered”.  As noted
above, this word does add something to the section in that meaning because it
limits the eligible machines to those that are suited for forgery, which limits
the machines, dies or other material that would qualify.  Counsel have provided the recent Supreme
Court decision in <i>R. v. MacIntosh</i>
(1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 481 which deals with the principles of statutory
interpretation of the Criminal Code provisions.  I am satisfied that my analysis herein is consistent with the
principles set out in that case.</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>I
therefore find that there is no requirement that any of the charged material be
modified or altered in order to form the basis for a conviction under the
section.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The search for the meaning of the word “adapted” in s. 369(b)
is largely unfettered by prior judicial interpretation.  A review of the several annoted Criminal
Codes indicates that the section and its predecessor sections have attracted
little attention in the reported jurisprudence.  <i>R. v. Evans</i> (1962), 132
C.C.C. 271 at 273 (B.C. C.A.) offers some support for the trial judge’s
interpretation.  In <i>R. v. Evans, supra</i>, the Court held that certain forged documents
and an unemployment insurance card in the name of the intended fraudulent payee
of the cheques were “adapted” for use in the commission of forgery.  In reaching that conclusion, the Court did
not refer to the two possible meanings of the word “adapted” and did not
distinguish between the cheques which had been altered and the unemployment
card which had not been altered.  I do
not regard <i>R. v. Evans, supra</i>, as
persuasive authority and prefer to approach the interpretation of the word “adapted”
in s. 369(b) as a matter of first impression.<a

</span>Section 369(b) refers to “plate, die, machinery, instrument or
other writings or material”.  These
words have a very wide compass:  <i>R. v. Griffith</i> (1969), 7 C.R. (N.S.) 196
at 208 (Qc. C.A.).  If, as the trial
judge held, “adapted” means simply “suitable for”, then the prohibition created
by s. 369(b) is potentially very broad. 
An intention to commit forgery, combined with the possession of mundane
objects like a piece of paper or a pen would come within the reach of s.
369(b).  The criminalization of such
innocuous and harmless conduct, albeit joined with a criminal intent, comes
perilously close to imposing criminal liability based solely on the existence
of a criminal intention.  It has been a
fundamental principle of the criminal law for many centuries that criminal
liability should not rest solely on an accused’s intention, no matter how
worthy of censure that intention might be: 
D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law</i>,
3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto:  Carswell,
1995) at 71-72.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The ambit of s. 369(b) is significantly narrower on the
appellant’s interpretation. On that interpretation, something must be done to
the “plate, die, machinery, instrument, material or other writing” to make it
suitable for use in the commission of forgery. 
The appellant contends that the alteration provides a manifestation of
the criminal intention to commit forgery and moves an accused’s conduct beyond
the realm of mere intention.  Counsel
demonstrates his position by reference to the facts in this case.  He submits that criminalizing the possession
of a piece of plastic, albeit accompanied by an intention to commit forgery, is
in reality punishing an intention to commit forgery.  However, if that piece of plastic is altered, as for example by embossment,
so as to make it suitable for use in the making of a forged credit card, and
the accused knows that it has been so altered, then the accused’s possession of
the altered piece of plastic manifests his intention to commit the crime of
forgery.  The accused is no longer
punished for mere intention, but for doing something towards the achievement of
that intention.  </p>

</span>If the word “adapted” in s. 369(b) is ambiguous, then the
significant difference in the reach of that section, depending on which interpretation
of the word “adapted” is accepted, becomes important in determining the meaning
to be given to s.&nbsp;369(b). 
Ambiguity in the meaning of criminal statues has always been resolved by
choosing the meaning which is most favourable to the accused.  In <i>Marcotte
v. Canada (Deputy A.G.)</i> (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 257 at 261-62 (S.C.C.),
Dickson J. put it this way:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>Even
if I were to conclude that the relevant statutory provisions were ambiguous and
equivocal – a conclusion one could reach without difficulty on reading
[citations omitted] – I would have to find for the appellant in this case.  It is unnecessary to emphasize the
importance of clarity and certainty when freedom is at stake.  No authority is needed for the proposition
that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise, in the
construction and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a subject,
then that statute should be applied in such a manner as to favour the person
against whom it is sought to be enforced. 
If one is to be incarcerated, one should at least know that some Act of
Parliament requires it in express terms, and not, at most, by implication.</p>

</span>In <i>R. v. Paré</i>
(1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 106 (S.C.C.), Wilson J. described the principle
that true ambiguities in penal statutes must be construed in favour of the
person whose liberty is at stake as “one of ancient lineage”.  After observing that the rule had originally
served to soften the impact of draconian criminal laws, Wilson J. said:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>…
Criminal law remains, however, the most dramatic and important incursion that
the state makes into individual liberty. 
Thus, while the original justification for the doctrine has been
substantially eroded, the seriousness of imposing criminal penalties of any
sort demands that reasonable doubts be resolved in favour of the accused.</p>

McIntosh</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 495 (S.C.C.), Lamer C.J.C., for the
majority, said:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>The <i>Criminal Code</i> is not a contract or a
labour agreement.  For that matter, it
is qualitatively different from most other legislative enactments because of
its direct and potentially profound impact on the personal liberty of
citizens.  The special nature of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires an interpretative
approach which is sensitive to liberty interests.  Therefore, an ambiguous penal provision must be interpreted in
the manner most favourable to accused persons, and in the manner most likely to
provide clarity and certainty in the criminal law.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principle identified in these three cases and countless
others is justified on at least two grounds. 
Persons who are subject to the coercive and stigmatizing power of the
criminal law are entitled to fair notice of the conduct which will subject them
to that power.  Where a crime is defined
in ambiguous terms, fair notice is only given with respect to the conduct which
is captured by each of the meanings which are reasonably available upon a
reading of the statute:  A. Ashworth, <i>Principles of Criminal Law</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 76-78.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second justification underlying the principle arises out
of our commitment to individual liberty, particularly where the criminal law
power is engaged.  Canadian society
operates on the basis that individuals are free to do as they choose, subject
to constitutionally permissible limits on that liberty imposed by Parliament
(and not the courts).  Where it is
unclear whether Parliament has chosen to prohibit conduct by making it
criminal, the commitment to individual liberty commands that the doubt be
resolved in favour of the maintenance of individual liberty:  D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law</i>, <i>supra</i>,
at 37-40.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principle that ambiguous penal provisions must be
interpreted in favour of an accused does not mean that the most restrictive
possible meaning of any word used in the penal statute must always be the
preferred meaning.  The principle
applies only where there is true ambiguity as to the meaning of a word in a
penal statute:  <i>R. v. Hasselwander</i> (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 471 at 476-77
(S.C.C.)  The meaning of words cannot be
determined by examining those words in isolation.  Meaning is discerned by examining words in their context.  True ambiguities in a statute exist only
where the meaning remains unclear after a full contextual analysis of the
statute.  As Martin J.A. said in <i>R. v. Goulis</i> (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 347
at 351 (Ont. C.A.):</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>… I do
not think, however, that this principle always requires a word which has two
accepted meanings to be given the more restrictive meaning.  Where a word used in a statute has two
accepted meanings, then either or both meanings may apply.  The Court is first required to endeavour to
determine the sense in which Parliament used the word from the context from in
which it appears.  It is only in the
case of an ambiguity which still exists after the full context is considered,
where it is uncertain in which sense Parliament used the word, that the above
rule of statutory construction requires the interpretation which is the more
favourable to the defendant to be adopted. 
This is merely another way of stating the principle that the conduct
alleged against the accused must be clearly brought within the proscription.</p>

</span>Like the trial judge, I find nothing in the language of s.
369(b), nor the rest of s.&nbsp;369, that helps me discern which of the two
meanings of the word “adapted” Parliament intended.  Context, however, goes beyond the language of the specific
section in issue.  In <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 27 at 41, Iacobucci J., for the Court, observed that the process of
statutory interpretation cannot rest merely on the wording of the
legislation.  He quoted with approval
the observation of E. Driedger in <i>Construction
of Statutes</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: 
Butterworths, 1983) at 87:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>Today

</span>It is impossible to speak in terms of “the object” or “the
scheme” of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The <i>Code</i>
addresses procedural and substantive matters that run the gamut of the entire
criminal law process.  To the extent
that the <i>Criminal Code</i> creates
crimes, however, I would describe its objects as the prohibition of activity
that could reasonably be regarded as harmful or potentially harmful to society
in a way that puts everyone on notice of where the line between criminal and
non-criminal conduct has been drawn. 
These objects favour a restrained reading of <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions that create crimes so as to avoid
overreaching and uncertainty.  </p>

</span>Legislative history can sometimes help in resolving apparent
ambiguities.  Unfortunately, the
legislative history of s. 369(b) offers no insight into the meaning of the word
“adapted” in that section.  The word
first appeared in s. 312(b) of the <i>Criminal
Code</i>, S.C. 1953-54, c.&nbsp;51.  The
language of the present section is identical to the language of the former
s.&nbsp;312(b).  Prior to the enactment
of s. 312(b), there was no general prohibition against the possession of
“forgers’ tools”, although possession of certain specific kinds of material
used for certain kinds of forgeries was prohibited.  The widening of the criminal law net brought about by s. 312(b)
does not appear to have sparked any discussion in Parliament and has been
ignored by commentators who, erroneously in my view, saw s. 312(b) as no more
than a consolidation of previous forgery related provisions.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

</span>An apparent ambiguity can sometimes be resolved by reference
to other sections in the same enactment. 
This technique was used by the trial judge and by counsel in this
Court.  While this comparative process
can sometimes be helpful, it must be proceeded with cautiously for at least two
reasons.  First, different sections of
the <i>Criminal Code</i> were enacted at
different times over the last 110 years. 
I do not think it can be assumed that a word used in a provision of the <i>Criminal Code</i> necessarily has the same
meaning as it has in an entirely unrelated provision of the <i>Code</i> introduced many years earlier.</p>

</span> Second, comparisons
with other sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>
in which the word “adapted” appears are of limited value given that it is
accepted that the word can take on one of two meanings depending on the
context.  As the trial judge noted, the
conclusion that “adapted” has one meaning in a particular section of the <i>Criminal Code</i> may provide no assistance
in determining the meaning to be given to that word in another section.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge did find some assistance in the use of the
word “adapted” in s.&nbsp;458(d) of the <i>Criminal
Code</i>.  It provides that:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>Every one
who without lawful justification or excuse, the proof of which lies on him, …</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>(d)

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>any
machine, engine, tool, instrument, material or thing that he knows has been
used or that he knows is adapted and intended for use in making counterfeit
money or counterfeit tokens of value is guilty of an indictable offence …</p>

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She reasoned, at para. 8, that the word “adapted” in this
section must mean “suitable for”:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'>… It
would be illogical for the section to be interpreted to require for conviction
that machines be altered in some way if they had not yet been used, but not if
the same machines were used right out of the box if they had already been used
before the arrest of the accused.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not share the trial judge’s view that the distinction she
describes would be illogical.  If an
accused knows that a machine has been used to create counterfeit money, the
possession of that machine may manifest a criminal intention to engage in the
production of counterfeit money. 
Similarly, if an accused knows that a machine has been altered so that
it can be used to make counterfeit money, the possession of that machine is
arguably a manifestation of a criminal intention.  If, however, an accused has possession of a machine that could be
used to make counterfeit money without any alteration, then in my view, the
accused’s possession of that machine does not manifest a criminal intention in
the same way as does possession of a machine that an accused’s knows has been
used or has been altered to make it suitable for the manufacture of counterfeit
money.  Unlike the trial judge, I think
it is more consistent with the other forms of liability created in s. 458(d) to
interpret “adapted” as requiring some alteration of the machine so as to make
it suitable for use in the manufacture of counterfeit money.</p>

</span>I find some limited assistance in interpreting s. 369(b) in
the other sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>
which prohibit the possession of “tools” to be used in the commission of other
crimes.  Sections 351 and 352 prohibit
the possession of instruments which are “suitable for” the commission of the
crimes described in those sections.  It
is arguable that had Parliament intended to prohibit the possession of things
that were suitable for use in the commission of forgery, it would have used
those very words in s. 359(b), just as it did in ss. 351 and 352.  </p>

provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as it
stood at the time of trial of little help in discerning the meaning of
s.&nbsp;369(b).  Since the trial,

</span>The similarity between the two sections is self-evident.  The conduct alleged in this case falls
squarely within s. 342.01(1)(d).  Most
of the conduct which is criminalized by that section would also be an offence
under s. 369(b).  While s. 369(b)
targets possession of “forgers’ tools”, in general, the new section is aimed at
possession of those “forgers’ tools” used for the creation of fraudulent credit
cards.  Finally, both sections strike at
activity which is preliminary to the actual commission of forgery and do so by
prohibiting the possession of virtually anything that is “adapted” for use in
the commission of either forgery (s. 369(b)) or in forging credit cards (s.
342.01(1)(d)).  As both sections address
the same subject matter in very similar language, it would make sense for the
word “adapted” to have the same meaning in both sections.  </p>

important respect.  It prohibits
possession of anything which a person knows is adapted for use in forging
credit cards regardless of whether that person actually intends to use that
thing for the purpose of forging credit cards. 
Section 369(b) requires knowing possession of a thing adapted for use in
the commission of forgery combined with an intention to actually commit
forgery.  If the word “adapted” in s.
342.01(1)(d) means simply “suitable for”, then a person who is in possession of
a piece of plastic which he knows could be used to make a forged credit card is
guilty of a crime even if that person has no intention of using the piece of
plastic for that purpose.  This
interpretation imposes criminal liability for conduct which is not morally
blameworthy, causes no harm, and poses no risk.  In my view, interpreting “adapted” as meaning “suitable for” in
s. 342.01(1)(d) stretches the criminal law beyond all acceptable limits.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

as to be suitable for”, criminal liability is imposed by s. 342.01(1)(d) on
those who are in possession of something that they know has been altered to make
it suitable for use in forging credit cards. 
Possession with knowledge of the nature of the alteration is arguably
sufficiently culpable to warrant criminalization.  “Adapted” in s. 342.01(1)(d) must mean “altered so as to be

with the close connection between that provision and s. 369(b), pushes me close
to the conclusion that there is no ambiguity in s. 369(b) and that “adapted”
means “altered so as to be suitable for”. 
I stop short of that conclusion only because it assumes a consistency in

According to well-established authority, the interpretation which favours

</span>I would allow the appeal and quash the convictions on all
counts.  As there is no evidence that
the machinery or material referred to in counts 26, 28, 29, and 30 were
altered, I would enter acquittals on those counts.  There is evidence that some of the material referred to in count
27 was altered and I would direct a new trial on that count.</p>

judgment of the trial judge on the motion for a directed verdict is reported at
[1997] O.J. No. 5918 (Gen. Div.) online:

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref2"

in <i>R. v. Griffith, infra</i>, at 208
disagreed with <i>R. v. Evans, supra</i>,
although that disagreement does not assist in interpreting the word “adapted”.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref3"
name="_ftn3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> The
legislative history of the section is traced in <i>G. Rodrigues</i>, ed., <i>Crankshaw’s
Criminal Code of Canada</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> ed., vol. 2 (Scarborough:  Carswell, 1993) at 9-292 to 9-297;  see also J.C. Martin, Q.C., ed., <i>Martin’s Annual Criminal Code 1955</i>,
(Toronto:  Cartwright and Sons, 1955) at
540-542.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref4"
name="_ftn4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a> The section
was introduced into the <i>Criminal Code</i>
by the <i>Criminal Law Improvement Act 1996</i>:  S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 17 and proclaimed in
force on June 16, 1997.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref5"
name="_ftn5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a> Although the
parties did not raise any constitutional arguments, it is well understood that <i>Charter</i> principles should guide
statutory interpretation.  An
interpretation of s. 342.01(1)(d) that purported to criminalize innocuous
conduct absent any criminal intent would seem to be inconsistent with the
minimum fault requirements protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>:  see <i>R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.</i>,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154;  <i>R. v. Clay</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 276
at 288-291 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
