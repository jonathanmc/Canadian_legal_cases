<p>Motion for leave to appeal under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> 
  from the judgment of Justice R.G.E. Hunter dated August 30, 2001 at Goderich, 
  Ontario.</p>

  </span> Both the Conservation Authority and the Attorney General for Ontario 
  as intervenor, move for an order granting leave to appeal the decision of the 
  Provincial Court judge pursuant to s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> 
  which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>131(1)  A defendant or the prosecutor or the Attorney General by way of 
      intervention may appeal from the judgment of the court to the Court of Appeal, 
      with leave of a judge of the Court of Appeal on special grounds, upon any 
      question of law alone or as to sentence.</p>
    <p> (2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span>  No leave to appeal shall be granted under subsection (1) unless 
      the judge of the Court of Appeal considers that in the particular circumstances 
      of the case it is essential in the public interest or for the due administration 
      of justice that leave be granted.</p>
    <p> (3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      to appeal under subsection (1).</p>

<p> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The criteria to be met are: 1) special grounds; 2) a question of law 
  alone; 3) in the particular circumstances of the case it is essential in the 
  public interest or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted.</p>
<p> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The case involved a prosecution of the three respondents by the applicant 
  under s.&nbsp;3 of Reg. 22/91 of the <i>Conservation Authorities Act</i>. Sections 
  3 and 4 provide:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> 3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> Subject to section 4, no person shall,</p>
    <p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> construct 
      any building or permit any building to be constructed in or on a pond or 
      swamp or in any area susceptible to flooding during a regional storm;</p>
    <p> (b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> place or 
      dump fill of any kind or permit fill to be placed or dumped in any area 
      described in the Schedule whether the fill is already located in or upon 
      the area or brought to or on the area from some other place; or</p>
    <p> (c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> straighten, 
      change, divert or interfere in any way with the existing channel of  a river, 
      lake, creek, stream or watercourse.  </p>
    <p>4.  Subject to the <i>Ontario Water Resources Act </i> or to any private 
      interest, the Authority may permit in writing the construction of any building 
      or the placing or dumping of fill or the straightening, changing, diverting 
      or interfering with the existing channel of a river, lake, creek, stream 
      or watercourse to which section 3 applies if, in the opinion of the Authority, 
      the site of the building or the placing or dumping of fill or the straightening, 
      changing, diverting or interfering with the existing channel will not affect 
      the control of flooding or pollution or the conservation of land.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents obtained a building permit from the Township of Morris 
  for the construction of a liquid manure storage tank on certain lands under 
  the jurisdiction of the applicant Conservation Authority. When the Authority 
  learned of the construction, it determined that the building was located on 
  a swamp and therefore the construction contravened s.3 of the regulation as 
  no written permission to build had been obtained.</p>
<p> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the trial before the Justice of the Peace, the respondents moved 
  for a non-suit at the close of the prosecution case on the basis that the issuance 
  of the building permit is a complete defence to the charge. The reason is based 
  on the wording of s. 8(2)(a) of the <i>Building Code Act</i>. Section 8(2) provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 8(2) The chief building official shall issue a permit under subsection 
      (1) unless,</p>
    <p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the 
      proposed building, construction or demolition will contravene this Act or 
      the building code or any other applicable law;</p>
    <p> (b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> the applicant 
      is a builder or vendor as defined in the <i>Ontario New Home Warranties 
      Plan Act</i> and is not registered under that Act;</p>
    <p> (c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> the application 
      for it is incomplete; or</p>
    <p> (d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> any fees 
      due are unpaid.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The phrase &quot;applicable law&quot; is a defined term in O. Reg. 403/97 
  to the Act (s. 1.1.3.2.) which means:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Applicable Law</i> means, for the purposes of Section 8 of the Act, 
      any general or special Act, and all regulations and by-laws, enacted thereunder, 
      which prohibit the proposed <i>construction </i>or<i> demolition </i>of 
      the<i> building</i> unless the Act, regulation or by-law is complied with.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The argument of the respondents was that the Conservation Authority 
  did not apply under s. 25 of the <i>Building Code Act</i> for revocation of 
  the building permit. Therefore the respondents acted lawfully by building in 
  accordance with a permit, the effect of which is that the construction did not 
  contravene any other applicable law including the <i>Conservation Authority 
  Act</i>.      </p>
<p> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the non-suit motion, the Justice of the Peace denied this argument 
  and held that the building permit does not prevent other forms of redress by 
  the applicant against the respondents. However, he went on to grant the non-suit 
  on the basis that the prosecution had not proved that the construction occurred 
  on a swamp. The respondent appealed to the Provincial Court. Justice Hunter 
  agreed with the Conservation Authority that it had led sufficient evidence of 
  the swamp to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case and defeat the non-suit motion. 
  However, he went on to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the respondents 
  could successfully assert the defense of officially induced error as they were 
  entitled to rely on the building permit.</p>
<p> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The applicants seek leave to appeal this decision. The question of law 
  raised by this decision is the legal effect of a building permit and whether 
  it can act as a defence to prosecution for breach of another Act on the basis 
  of officially induced error, estoppel, due diligence or as a matter of law based 
  on the wording of the <i>Building Code Act</i>.</p>
<p> [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am satisfied that leave ought to be granted. The issue raised is a 
  question of law. The special circumstances, the public interest and the due 
  administration of justice criteria are met. There are many statutes whose enforcement 
  may be affected by the ruling. It is essential, as that term has been interpreted 
  in the case law of this court (<i>R. v. Zakarow </i>(1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 621; 
  <i>R. v. Blackbird Holdings Ltd.</i> (1991), 6 C.E.L.R.(N.S.) 116; <i>R. v. 
  Krukowski</i> (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 155), that the court consider the question 
  of law in the context of its ramifications, including the meaning and effect 
  of s. 8(2)(a) of the <i>Building Code Act</i> and the obligations regarding 
  compliance with other Acts, of every building permit applicant, and of every 
  Chief Building Official when building permits are issued by municipalities.</p>
<p> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents say that the Provincial Court judge found that there 
  was no evidence other than that they had acted throughout in good faith and 
  therefore the court should not allow the prosecution to proceed any further. 
  However, the question of law raised here, is, as it must be, one that transcends 
  the particular parties and has broad public significance. Furthermore, the respondents 
  were never called on to present a defence, so that the evidentiary issues cannot 
  yet be fully assessed.</p>
<p> [12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the result, leave to appeal is granted based on the issues of law 
  set out in these reasons. If there is any difficulty regarding the formulation 
  of the issues on which leave is granted, I may be spoken to. Order to go accordingly.</p>
