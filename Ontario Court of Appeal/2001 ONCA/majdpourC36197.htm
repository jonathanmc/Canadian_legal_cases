  purchased the assets of Moneysworth &amp; Best Shoe Care Inc. and Moneysworth 
  &amp; Best Shoe Repair (Canada) Inc. (“the franchisor”) after these two companies 
  declared bankruptcy on July 11, 2000.  Before the bankruptcy, the franchisor 
  had operated a shoe care and repair franchise system in many locations in Ontario.</p>

  Limited, Shariar Ghasemi, Mehrdad Tavakoli-Malayeri and Yadollah Ahmadi (“the 
  franchisees”) are each owners of a franchise.  They have owned their respective 
  franchises for several years.  Each franchisee executed a comprehensive franchise 
  agreement and a sub-lease in respect of the location where the franchise operated, 
  usually a major shopping centre.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the franchisor went bankrupt in July 2000, the franchisees 
  decided to take over the leases to their locations and negotiate leases directly 
  with the landlords, the shopping centre owners.  In pursuing this plan, they 
  purported to rely on s. 39(2) of the <i>Commercial Tenancies Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. L.7 (<i>“CTA”</i>) which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Rights of sub-tenants</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span> </span>(2) Where the assignor, or person or firm against whom 
          a receiving order has been made in bankruptcy, or a winding up order 
          has been made, being a lessee, has, before the making of the assignment 
          or such order demised any premises by way of under-lease, <i>approved 
          or consented to in writing by the landlord</i>, and the assignee, liquidator 
          or trustee surrenders, disclaims or elects to assign the lease, the 
          under-lessee, if the under-lessee so elects in writing within three 
          months of such assignment or order, stands in the same position with 
          the landlord as though the under-lessee were a direct lessee from the 
          landlord but subject, except as to rental payable, to the same liabilities 
          and obligations as the assignor, bankrupt or insolvent company was subject 
          to under the lease at the date of the assignment or order, but the under-lessee 
          shall in such event be required to covenant to pay to the landlord a 
          rental not less than that payable by the under-lessee to the debtor, 
          and if such last mentioned rental was greater than that payable by the 
          debtor to the said landlord, the under-lessee shall be required to covenant 
          to pay to the landlord the like greater rental. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> The italicized words proved contentious.  M&amp;B, which had 
  purchased the franchisor’s assets from the trustee in bankruptcy, wanted to 
  maintain the original franchise agreements and sub-leases.  It took the position 
  that the franchisees could not disclaim the sub-leases and enter into direct 
  leases with the shopping centre owners because the shopping centre owners had 
  never “approved or consented to in writing” the sub-leases.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  Thus the condition 
  precedent for the invocation of s. 39(2) by the franchisees was missing.</p>

  </span></span> The franchisees did not accept M&amp;B’s interpretation of s. 
  39(2) of the <i>CTA</i>.  They brought an application pursuant to rule 14.05 
  of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to clarify their 
  rights with respect to their sub-leases and, more broadly, to ascertain whether 
  their obligations under the franchise agreements continued with M&amp;B, the 
  new franchisor.</p>

  </span></span> The franchisees sought two declarations:  (1) a declaration that 
  the franchise agreements were null and void by reason of fundamental breach 
  or frustration of contract; and (2) a declaration that by operation of s. 39(2) 
  of the <i>CTA</i> they were each entitled to assume a direct tenancy with their 
  respective landlords.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application judge, Lederman J., dismissed the component of 
  the application based on an alleged fundamental breach or frustration of the 
  contract.  He held that, although there were defects and defaults in the franchisor’s 
  performance of its obligations, they did not rise to the level of fundamental 
  breach.  Moreover, he held that the franchise agreement contained a specific 
  provision dealing with breaches of material terms and that the franchisees were 
  required to follow the process set out in that provision before seeking relief 
  in the courts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> Lederman J. made the declaration sought by the franchisees relating 
  to their sub-leases.  He held that approval within s. 39(2) “is wider than written 
  consent and approval need not be in writing” and that the head landlords by 
  their conduct had impliedly consented to the sub-leases and thereby approved 
  the franchisees as sub-tenants.  Alternatively, he held that if s. 39(2) of 
  the <i>CTA</i> required approval or consent in writing by the landlords, the 
  landlords by their conduct had waived this statutory condition which was for 
  their benefit.</p>

  <u>M&amp;B’s appeal</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I begin with a word about terminology.  Since in this section 
  of these reasons I will be considering s. 39(2) of the <i>CTA</i>, I will call 
  the shopping centre owners ‘landlords’, the franchisor M&amp;B ‘the tenant’ 
  and the franchisees ‘the sub-tenants’.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The key question on M&amp;B’s appeal is whether the words “in 
  writing” in the phrase “approved or consented to in writing” modify <i>both</i> 
  “approved or consented to” or <i>only</i> “consented to”.  Put another way, 
  if a landlord has not consented in writing to the sub-lease with respect to 
  its premises, is it nevertheless possible for the landlord, through its conduct, 
  to approve of the sub-lease, thus permitting the sub-tenant to invoke s. 39(2)?  
  The application judge held that the words “in writing” modified only consent 
  and that it was open for a landlord to give an approval to a sub-lease that 
  “need not be in writing”.  I agree with the application judge’s interpretation, 
  for several reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, if the words “in writing” modified the entire phrase “approved 
  or consented to in writing”, it would render the word “approved” meaningless.  
  Such an interpretation would be contrary to the “presumption that a change of 
  wording denotes a change in meaning”:  see  <i>Maxwell on The Interpretation 
  of Statutes</i> (12th. ed.), at p. 282.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the main purpose of s.&nbsp;39(2) of the <i>CTA</i> is 
  to protect sub-tenants.  In a franchise context, the bankruptcy of the franchisor 
  puts its franchisees in a very vulnerable position.  In <i>Tenant’s Rights and 
  Remedies in a Commercial Lease:  A Practical Guide</i> (1998, Harvey M. Haber, 
  Q.C., ed.), Edward Levitt, the author of the chapter titled <i>Franchising</i>, 
  states, at pp. 55-56:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the most catastrophic events for a franchisee is the bankruptcy 
      of the franchisor.  This sets a sequence of events in motion, which can 
      end in the failure of the franchisee’s business as well or other less severe, 
      but equally unsatisfactory results. . . Upon the bankruptcy of a franchisor, 
      the franchisee must definitely shift into survival mode.</p>

  </span></span> In my view, in addition to protecting landlords, s. 39(2) is 
  intended to assist the sub-tenant in a situation where the tenant becomes bankrupt.  
  Given that purpose, as between two possible interpretations of the key words 
  in s. 39(2), one of which assists the sub-tenant to maintain its lease in difficult 
  times and the other of which would prevent the same result, I have no hesitation 
  adopting the first interpretation.  The purpose of s.&nbsp;39(2) is best served 
  by not requiring the sub-tenant to produce a document in writing from the landlord 
  in every case in order to succeed.</p>

  </span></span> Third, I agree with the analysis of s. 39(2) of the <i>CTA</i> 
  by Harvey M. Haber, Q.C.  in his text <i>Landlord’s Rights and Remedies in a 
  Commercial Lease: A Practical Guide</i> (1996), at p. 147:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A subtenant only acquires the rights afforded by s. 39(2) of the Act if 
      the sublease was “approved or consented to in writing by the landlord”.  
      But written consent is not necessarily a prerequisite to a subtenant’s rights 
      under s.&nbsp;39(2).  Specifically, if the lease permits a sublease without 
      the landlord’s consent, or if the landlord, by its conduct, implied consent 
      to the sublease, a court would likely find for the subtenant and consider 
      the sublease to have been “approved” and that such approval need not be 
      in writing.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> M&amp;B’s principal argument against the application judge’s 
  interpretation of s. 39(2) is that it is inconsistent with <i>Re Schulte-United 
  Limited,</i> [1934] O.R. 453 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1934] 4 D.L.R. 
  252 (S.C.C.) (<i>“Schulte-United”</i>).  In that case, Schulte-United Limited 
  (“Schulte”) obtained a 10-year lease from United Cigar Stores Limited (“UCS”) 
  for retail store premises in Toronto.  Schulte later assigned the benefits of 
  that lease to Louis K. Liggett Company Limited (“Liggett”).  Prior to the commencement 
  of the term of the occupation by Liggett, Schulte was adjudged bankrupt and 
  a trustee was appointed.  The trustee abandoned the head lease with UCS, notifying 
  Liggett of its actions.  Liggett did not attempt to invoke s. 38(2) of the <i>Landlord 
  and Tenant Act</i>, R.S.O. 1927, c. 190 (now s. 39(2) of the <i>CTA)</i>; rather, 
  it filed a claim for damages with the trustee for failing to be put in possession 
  of the premises under the terms of the agreement with Schulte.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the course of discussing the damages issue, 
  Davis J.A. of the Court of Appeal said, at p. 459:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, not having secured the approval or consent 
      in writing of the head lessor to its sub-lease, could not take the benefit 
      of the provisions of sec. 38 of The Landlord and Tenant Act which protect 
      the rights of the sub-tenant where a sub-lease has been consented to or 
      approved by the head lessor in writing.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>I acknowledge that this passage, because of its use of “approval 
  or consent in writing” at the start and the inverted use “consented to or approved 
  . . . in writing” near the end, supports M&amp;B’s interpretation of s.&nbsp;39(2) 
  of the <i>CTA</i>.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the Supreme Court of Canada, a single judge, Rinfret J., was 
  faced with the question of whether to grant leave to appeal from the decision 
  of the Ontario Court of Appeal on the damages issue.  He refused leave and said, 
  at pp. 254-55:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In this instance, the assignment or the underlease has not been “approved 
      or consented to in writing by the landlord,” the United Cigar Stores Ltd.  
      Such approval or consent by the landlord is an essential requirement for 
      the application of s-s.&nbsp;2 of s.&nbsp;38 of the Landlord and Tenant 
      Act.  The question is not, therefore, whether the Liggett Co. ought to have 
      taken advantage of s.&nbsp;38(2) and whether, having failed to do so, it 
      is thereby deprived of the right to rank for damages against the bankrupt 
      estate of the debtor.  The question as it presents itself really is that 
      s.&nbsp;38(2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act has no application here.  Under 
      those circumstances, the point can hardly be found sufficient to warrant 
      the granting of a special leave to appeal.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not think that this passage assists the appellant.  Rinfret 
  J. merely set out, but did not interpret, the meaning of the words “approved 
  or consented to in writing” because there was no issue relating to the landlord’s 
  approval – in any form – of the sublease.  That is because the sub-tenant quit 
  the leased premises as soon as the trustee disclaimed the head tenant’s lease.  
  The sub-tenant claimed its damages in the head tenant’s bankruptcy rather than 
  seek declaratory relief as the sub-tenants have done in the present case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, the interpretation of s.&nbsp;39(2) was <i>not</i> 
  in issue in <i>Schulte-United</i>.  Rinfret J. in the Supreme Court of Canada 
  said nothing about its interpretation.  Davis&nbsp;J.A. in the Court of Appeal 
  made a brief reference in a single sentence that suggests that he regarded the 
  words “in writing” as a modifier for both “approved” and “consented to”.  However, 
  in my view, this brief <i>obiter</i> reference is not sufficient to overcome 
  the three reasons I have set out in support of the application judge’s interpretation 
  of the provision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If, as I have determined, it is possible for a landlord to indicate 
  its approval of a sub-lease in an unwritten form, the question becomes:  have 
  the various landlords done so in this case?  The applications judge held that 
  “the head landlords, by their conduct have impliedly consented to the subleases 
  and the subtenants have thereby been approved”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with this conclusion.  The various landlords are all 
  large and sophisticated shopping centre owners.  There can be no doubt they 
  would know the identity of every business in their locations.  The affidavit 
  evidence of the sub-tenants establishes that they had regular contact with the 
  landlords.  Moreover, the landlords were given formal notice of these proceedings; 
  none appeared to take issue with the relief sought by the sub-tenants.  Accordingly, 
  it is obvious that the landlords approved of the franchisees as sub-tenants 
  before the franchisor’s bankruptcy; moreover, the landlords’ approval appears 
  to be a continuing one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The application judge provided an alternative 
  basis for making the declaration sought by the franchisee sub-tenants:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, the benefit of the statutory provision is for the head landlords 
      and for the sublessees.  The head landlords have not appeared on this application 
      and take no issue with any lack of approval or consent in writing.  Parties 
      may waive a statutory condition introduced for their benefit and thus, the 
      necessity for approval or consent in writing to the subleases by the head 
      landlords may be deemed to have been waived by them.  Accordingly, s.&nbsp;39(2) 
      applies in these circumstances.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with this analysis.  The maxim <i>quilibit potest renuntiare 
  juri pro se introducto</i> is explained in <i>Maxwell on The Interpretation 
  of Statutes, supra,</i> at p. 328:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Everyone has a right to waive and to agree to waive the 
      advantage of a law made solely for the benefit and protection of an individual 
      in his private capacity, which may be dispensed with without infringing 
      any public right or public policy.</span></p>

  </span></span> The intended beneficiaries of the requirement for approval or 
  consent in s. 39(2) of the CTA are head landlords.  Section 39(2) protects them 
  against ‘phantom’ sub-tenants who might emerge on the bankruptcy of a tenant 
  and assert the existence of a prior lease with the bankrupt tenant.  In the 
  present case, the knowledge and conduct of the landlords with respect to the 
  sub-tenants indicate that they do not have a concern about them.  Accordingly, 
  in the circumstances of this case, the landlords can be deemed to have waived 
  the statutory condition.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I make one final observation on M&amp;B’s appeal.  In addition 
  to the reasons I have set out for agreeing with the application judge’s interpretation 
  of s.&nbsp;39(2) of the <i>CTA</i>, I would state one further reason.  In my 
  view, it would be unconscionable to accede to M&amp;B’s argument on this issue.  
  Article 3.2(a) of the franchise agreement imposed an obligation on the franchisor, 
  acting as the franchisee’s agent, to negotiate the terms of the lease with the 
  landlord.  From a franchisee’s perspective, the landlord’s approval or consent 
  to the sub-lease pursuant to s.&nbsp;39(2) would be particularly important.  
  Accordingly, I would hold that the franchisor had a duty to ensure that the 
  landlords formally approved of the sub-leases between the franchisor and the 
  franchisees so that the franchisees would be in a position to invoke s.&nbsp;39(2) 
  of the <i>CTA</i> if the franchisor ever went bankrupt.  The franchisor did 
  not fulfil its important obligation in this case.  In my view, its neglect in 
  this regard disentitles it from attacking the sub-tenants’ attempts to invoke 
  s.&nbsp;39(2) of the <i>CTA</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, I would dismiss M&amp;B’s 
  appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The franchisees sought a declaration that the franchise agreement 
  was null and void because the franchisor, by its pre-bankruptcy conduct and 
  by the act of bankruptcy, had fundamentally breached the agreement. The application 
  judge refused to make the declaration on two bases:  (1) although the conduct 
  of the franchisor was deficient in several respects, the franchisees did receive 
  essentially what they had bargained for; and (2) the franchise agreement itself 
  had a specific process for dealing with breaches of material terms and termination 
  of the agreement and the franchisees were required to abide by its terms.  I 
  agree with the application judge’s analysis on both points.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is very difficult for a party to establish a fundamental breach 
  of a contract.  As Wilson J. explained in <i>Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude 
  Canada Ltd.</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 426 at 499 (<i>“Hunter Engineering”</i>), a 
  fundamental breach occurs if the conduct of one party deprives the other party 
  of “substantially the whole benefit” of the contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The application judge held that the franchisees 
  did receive essentially what they bargained for, including a shoe repair shop 
  in a location of their liking, a lease, use of the M&amp;B name, necessary fixtures, 
  equipment, tools, inventory and supplies, and a training and support program.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The franchisees assert that the application 
  judge erred by considering only what they received at the time of purchasing 
  their franchises; he failed to assess how the franchises actually operated.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I disagree.  After considering the evidence, the application 
  judge concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>They were able to carry on their franchise business in this fashion both 
      before and after the bankruptcy.  Accordingly, the commercial purpose of 
      the agreement was not destroyed, but carried on intact.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=No style='line-height:normal'>In short, the application judge considered 
  both the commencement and the continued operation of the franchise agreement.  
  In <i>Hunter Engineering</i>, Wilson J. described the deprivation of “substantially 
  the whole benefit of the contract” definition of fundamental breach as “a restrictive 
  definition and rightly so” (p. 499).  In my view, the application judge was 
  correct in concluding that the franchisees had not demonstrated that the franchisor’s 
  conduct came within this restrictive definition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Turning to the second basis for the application judge’s decision 
  on the fundamental breach issue, article 12.1 of the franchise agreement requires 
  a franchisee to give written notice to the franchisor of “breaches [of] a material 
  term”.  The franchisor is then given 60 days to “commence reasonable steps to 
  correct such breach”.  If the franchisee is not satisfied with the steps taken 
  by the franchisor, it must deliver a notice of termination to the franchisor 
  and the agreement would then terminate 30 days later.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The franchisees did not invoke article 12.1 of the franchise 
  agreement.  In my view, the application judge was correct to conclude that “this 
  militates against a finding that the alleged defaults constitute a fundamental 
  breach entitling the applicants to terminate the franchise agreement”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
