  </span> Mr. Manis requests an order pursuant to Rule 63.02(1) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, staying enforcement of a warrant of 
  committal. The warrant was signed on June 28, 2001 pursuant to an order of O’Connell 
  J. made June 13, 2001. Mr. Manis has delivered a notice of appeal of the June 
  13, 2001 decision.</p>

  me<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>. In his Reasons 
  for that decision, O’Connell J. stated the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Manis has failed to 
      comply with Justice Lane’s judgment in that he failed to provide the alternate 
      security for the mortgage and the line of credit. …</p>
    <p> Accordingly, having found that he’s in contempt, I’m committing him to 
      jail for a period of six months. The warrant will issue fifteen days from 
      the date of this order, that is on June the 28<sup><span>th</span></sup>, 
      2001, unless he purges his contempt. He may purge his contempt by removing 
      the mortgage registered against 313 Hillhurst Boulevard, Toronto (former 
      matrimonial home), and remove Ms. Manis’ name from the line of credit with 
      the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>

  </span> The judgment of Lane J. dated November 30, 2000 followed a four-week 
  trial under the <i>Family Law Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3<i>. </i>Among its 
  terms are paragraphs 8 and 9 which provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>8.            <b>THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES </b>that the Respondent 
      (Husband) shall take all steps as are necessary to remove and discharge 
      in full the mortgage currently registered against the matrimonial home, 
      being premises municipally known as 313 Hillhurst Boulevard, Toronto, Ontario 
      in favour of the Royal Bank, by attending upon the mortgagee and company 
      with a representative of the Petitioner (Wife), within the next two weeks, 
      to make arrangements for substitute security for it.</p>
    <p>9.            <b>THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES </b>that the Respondent 
      (Husband) shall further attend upon the Royal Bank, within the next two 
      weeks, to make arrangements for substitute security for the joint line of 
      credit in which the Petitioner (Wife) is jointly liable, as this debt is 
      a debt of the Respondent (Husband).</p>

  </span> Mr. Manis submits there is a serious question to be determined on appeal 
  concerning whether O’Connell J. erred in law both in making the finding of contempt 
  and in imposing a penalty of imprisonment for any contempt that was properly 
  found. He therefore requests that enforcement of the warrant of committal be 
  stayed pending the determination of the issues on appeal.</p>

  </span> In his Judgment dated November 30, 2000 Lane J. also ordered Mr. Manis 
  to pay Ms. Manis an equalization payment of $415,486, child support of $2,333 
  per month from May 1, 1997 (subject to credit for payments already made), and 
  spousal support of $4,750 per month<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> from February 14, 
  1997 (subject to credit for payments already made). He restrained Mr. Manis 
  from depleting his assets until the equalization payment is paid and the mortgage 
  is removed. He specifically noted in his Reasons that it had been conceded that 
  the mortgage on the matrimonial home is a debt of Mr. Manis secured on Ms. Manis’ 
  home.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The findings of Lane J. in his Reasons also included the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Counsel for Mrs. Manis attacked Mr. Manis’ credibility on several fronts. 
      On the whole, this attack succeeded and I have grave doubts about his testimony. 
      Part of the $5,000 arrears noted above arose from his taking the insupportable 
      position that he did not have to pay medical bills without being given the 
      original bill when the Order expressly stated he was to pay upon receipt 
      of copies. He unreasonably delayed production and answering undertakings 
      for years in what can only have been a deliberate effort to prevent Mrs. 
      Manis from obtaining adequate and timely information. He failed to disclose 
      his off-shore holdings in British West Indies Securities, and when some 
      information about them came to light, he refused to produce any documents 
      concerning them, while insisting that they were other people’s money which 
      he held in trust. To this day not one brokerage statement or other record 
      of these funds has been produced by him. He admits to owning two offshore 
      companies … but has produced no records of their financial dealing. The 
      rare documents we have are copies made by Mrs. Manis of papers she found 
      in his office in the matrimonial home. One of those documents reveals that 
      he was sending money overseas and it was being deposited in small amounts 
      because of the strictness of the laws against money laundering. No explanation, 
      no Bank statement, nothing, was produced regarding this document or the 
      account. Mr. Manis’ Financial Statement shows spending at the rate of some 
      $286,000 annually, yet he swore at the trial he had no income. On cross-examination, 
      his explanation that he was living off capital was challenged and he was 
      unable to show any withdrawals from his capital, never mind ones sufficient 
      to begin to account for his standard of living. The inference that he has 
      undisclosed income and assets is irresistible, and I draw it. In the witness 
      box, Mr. Manis was argumentative, often evasive and missed few chances to 
      take a shot at his wife on issue unrelated to the question. He was more 
      anxious to score points than get the facts out … It is clear that he was 
      not prepared to admit or disclose anything that Mrs. Manis did not already 
      know about. He was not a candid or reliable witness. </p>

  </span> Following delivery of the decision of Lane J., counsel for Ms. Manis 
  wrote to counsel for Mr. Manis on December 15, 2000 inquiring when arrangements 
  could be made to meet at the Royal Bank to make arrangements for removal of 
  the mortgage and release of Ms. Manis from liability on the guarantee. No arrangements 
  were made. Subsequent inquires were made by letters sent on January 18, 2001 
  and February 16, 2001. Counsel for Mr. Manis responded that Mr. Manis was seeking 
  to set aside the entire judgment of Lane J. on appeal and was unwilling to implement 
  any terms of the letter of February 16, 2001 “in isolation of an agreement to 
  resolve all issues…”. </p>

  28, 2000, however he did not perfect his appeal or apply for a stay of the judgment. 
  The appeal was ultimately dismissed for delay on May 18, 2001, after Mr. Manis

  from the Royal Bank indicating default had been made in payments owing on the 
  mortgage registered against the matrimonial home and demanding payment of the 
  outstanding balances on the mortgage and on the line of credit. The Royal Bank 
  subsequently commenced power of sale proceedings against the home. These proceedings 
  are ongoing.</p>

  credit for $90,000, trial expenses of about $110,000, $700,000 owing to a tax 
  shelter partnership under notes maturing in 2012, $50,000 owing to his mother 
  and $375,000 owing to Revenue Canada. On May 7, 2001 Cameron J. described the

  </span> On March 5, 2001 Cameron J. made an interim order on consent in the 
  matrimonial matter appointing Perry Krieger &amp; Associates Inc. as interim 
  receiver of Mr. Manis’ assets and vesting his assets in the interim receiver. 
  He also ordered that Mr. Manis pay the Interim Receiver $25,000 to be remitted 
  to Ms. Manis and varied the stay under s. 69 of the <i>BIA </i>to permit<i> 
  </i>Ms. Manis to proceed with a contempt motion.</p>

  2001. On that day he re-appointed Mintz as receiver of Mr. Manis’ assets and 
  directed the receiver to bring the mortgage on the matrimonial home into good 
  standing, to pay the arrears of child and spousal support, and to pay the monthly 
  support payments.</p>

  Receiver appointed Krieger &amp; Associates as trustee of the Estate. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On May 7, 2001Cameron J. dismissed a motion brought by Ms. Manis to 
  set aside the bankruptcy. The following comments form part of his Reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Lane J. found the Husband’s evidence unreliable and less than candid. This 
      is not a finding of fraud, even on a civil standard.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>The Husband ought not to be criticized for merely availing himself of his 
      right under BIA s. 49. The Husband’s failure to comply with the order of 
      Lane J. is the subject of the motion before O’Connell J. I do not have the 
      benefit of the findings which may be made on that motion and ought not to 
      prejudge the matter. The Husband says that since January 1999 he has had 
      only $3000 in income, is supported financially by his father and is overwhelmed 
      by indebtedness.</p>
    <p>The Wife alleges that the Husband must have hidden income to support his 
      lifestyle. The Husband’s 2000 income tax return suggests otherwise, notwithstanding 
      the finding of Lane J., based on negative inference, that the Husband’s 
      annual income is $205,000. The Husband says his expenses, including support 
      payments of $30,000 and loan carrying costs of $44,000, came from realization 
      of an RRSP and other capital assets of his own or in his company.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>It is suggested I should make the same finding as Lane J. respecting the 
      Husband’s credibility. In the context of a bitter matrimonial dispute and 
      the absence of cross-examinations on this motion, my view of the evidence 
      is filtered through a screen of healthy cynicism. The probable impact of 
      the recent stock market decline on the holdings of aggressive investors 
      and traders cannot be ignored. The recent expenses related to the 4-week 
      trial are not unreasonable.</p>
    <p>The Husband could probably have managed his debt although it is uncertain 
      for how long. The Husband says he no longer has an income. The Notice of 
      Intent to enforce had been served by the mortgagee. The Wife was the only 
      person apparently pressing for payment. …</p>
    <p>The timing of the Assignment seems to me to be as much related to the Husband’s 
      inability to obtain the Wife’s approval of his draft proposal as to any 
      disregard of a court order in order to “get even” with the Wife. Under the 
      consent order of March 5, the Wife approved the appointment of an interim 
      receiver and the vesting of his assets in that officer. She then turned 
      around and while the negotiation of the terms of the proposal was proceeding, 
      obtained on Friday, March 30, 2001, without notice to the Interim Receiver, 
      an order revoking the authority of Krieger as the Interim Receiver and reinstating 
      Mintz as the Receiver. The Wife was probably not bargaining in good faith 
      and was attempting to obtain a preference over the Husband’s other creditors. 
      The Husband could reasonably have felt exposed to all his creditors again…</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> O’Connell J.’s Reasons on the contempt motion include the following 
  statements:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>At the conclusion of the trial on October 30<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Justice 
      Lane made a non-dissipation order, restraining Mr. Manis from depleting 
      his assets or removing them from the court’s jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Lane 
      released his judgment on November 30<sup>th</sup>, 2000 and Mr. Manis was, 
      again, ordered not to deplete his assets…</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Mr. Manis failed to obey this order and, in fact, as the evidence demonstrates, 
      he flagrantly and repeatedly disobeyed the order of Justice Lane. He didn’t 
      designate Ms. Manis and their children as the beneficiaries of the policies, 
      an issue that came up in argument, which is now resolved.</p>
    <p>On the same day that Mr. Justice Lane forbid him from depleting his assets, 
      he withdrew capital totalling $30,000...</p>
    <p>He was ordered to provide alternate security within two weeks of the release 
      of Mr. Justice Lane’s judgment for the mortgage registered against the matrimonial 
      home and the joint line of credit:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>[114]            It is conceded that the mortgage on the matrimonial 
          home is a debt of Mr. Manis secured on Mrs. Manis’ home. It must be 
          removed and Mr. Manis is directed to attend upon the mortgagee, in company 
          with a representative of Mrs. Manis, within the next two weeks, to make 
          arrangements for substitute security for it and for a joint line of 
          credit on which Mrs. Manis is jointly liable although the debt is Mr. 
          Manis’.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Manis failed to comply with this aspect of the order. Moreover, he 
      has defaulted on both the mortgage and the line of credit. The Royal Bank 
      of Canada has issued a demand for the line of credit. Further, the Royal 
      Bank of Canada has started power of sale proceedings.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Subsequent to the reasons being released by Justice Lane on December the 
      29<sup><span>th</span></sup>, Mr. Manis filed a notice of appeal. He did 
      not perfect the appeal, he did not order transcripts, nor did he apply to 
      the Court of Appeal to stay the judgment. Ms. Manis alleges, and I believe, 
      that he filed a notice of appeal solely as a delay tactic.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>On February 27<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Justice Ferrier granted an order appointing 
      Mintz and Partners Limited a receiver of his assets. This order was made 
      to stop him from depleting his assets. On March the 1<sup>st</sup>, Mr. 
      Manis filed a Notice of Intention to file a proposal pursuant to s. 50.04 
      of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. This notice … stayed Ferrier J.’s 
      order as per s. 69 of the <i><span>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</span></i>. 
      As such, Mr. Manis was free to deal with his assets as he pleased.</p>
    <p>On March 29<sup>th,</sup> Mr. Manis wrote to Perry Kreiger &amp; Associates, 
      stating that he sold 25,000 shares of GIVEX Corp. in February 2001. Ms. 
      Manis contends that these shares were not disclosed at or prior to trial. 
    </p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Mr. Manis has repeatedly failed to comply with Mr. Justice Lane’s judgment. 
      In fact, it appears he has no interest whatsoever in obeying that judgment. 
      His actions are deliberate and wilful. He has not breached one aspect of 
      the judgment but has breached several and enough is enough.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>On the evidence before me and the submissions, I am satisfied beyond a 
      reasonable doubt that Mr. Manis has failed to comply with Justice Lane’s 
      judgment in that he failed to provide the alternate security for both the 
      mortgage and the line of credit. In that regard, with respect to the line 
      of credit, all he need have done is gone to the bank and consented, as I 
      understand the submissions, to have Ms. Manis’ name removed from that line.</p>
    <p>I am satisfied that, notwithstanding your submissions, Mr. Cozzi, that 
      your client, Mr. Manis, honestly believed that he was insolvent after he 
      received the judgment, that, that submission, if it had merit and if it 
      had any meaning, would underline the fact that Mr. Manis had no reason to 
      file a notice of appeal and that he has not deprived himself of a lifestyle 
      that accompanies that of a person being a chartered accountant, a licensed 
      security dealer, both of which he stands to lose – those designations – 
      as a result of this bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>I agree with counsel’s submission for Ms. Manis that the assignment by 
      Mr. Manis was a malicious and voluntary act, especially when I consider 
      his business background as a chartered accountant and a securities dealer, 
      and his continuing lifestyle.</p>
    <p>If you look at his financial statements, that assignment involved a $600,000 
      R.R.S.P., which could have easily been rolled over to satisfy the equalization. 
    </p>
    <p>Many things he could have done he didn’t do. He had no intention of doing 
      anything. The three year litigation confirms that no intention and confirms 
      the fact that almost $150,000 was spent in legal costs and equalization 
      experts’ fees, resulting in a judgment of $456,000, plus support.</p>
    <p>As well, there is much to be said about his debts that are listed and whether 
      they are, in reality, factual. I consider the fact that he was never in 
      arrears of support until after the judgment. He paid up until February. 
      It appears to me that in consideration of his business acumen, he might 
      have considered his proposal and subsequent bankruptcy at or before trial 
      instead of relying on a declining stock market as the cause of change to 
      his approach.</p>
    <p>Why would he have an honest belief that he was insolvent after he received 
      Justice Lane’s judgment. Why would he wait for the judgment to make that 
      belief? The market was in decline before that. It was in decline during 
      the trial. There was just no merit to that submission.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Accordingly, having found that he’s in contempt, I’m committing him to 
      jail for a period of six months. The warrant will issue fifteen days from 
      the date of this order, that is on June the 28<sup>th</sup>, 2001, unless 
      he purges his contempt. He may purge his contempt by removing the mortgage 
      registered against 313 Hillhurst Boulevard, Toronto (former matrimonial 
      home), and remove Ms. Manis’ name from the line of credit with the Royal 
      Bank of Canada. <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Manis submits that there are several serious questions to be tried.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Whether O’Connell J. Erred 
  in Law in Making the Specific Findings of Contempt that He Made</b></p>
<p class=headingsubtitle style='line-height:normal'><b>Error in Law Re Insolvency</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Manis says he was insolvent from the date of Lane J.’s judgment 
  through to the date he made an assignment in bankruptcy. He says he was prohibited 
  from complying with the terms of the judgment because any transfer of security 
  to the Royal Bank while he was insolvent would have amounted to a fraudulent 
  preference pursuant to s. 4(2) of the <i>Assignment and Preferences Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. A.33 and s. 95 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>. 
  He says it was therefore an error in law to find him in contempt for non-compliance 
  with the specific provisions of paragraph 8 and 9 of the Judgment. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This question addresses the time frame from November 30, 2000 to April 
  2, 2001. Mr. Manis contends it was conceded before Cameron J. in May 2001 that 
  he was insolvent during this particular period. Ms. Manis contests that assertion 
  and says the only concession made related to Mr. Manis’ status as of April 2, 
  2001, and that concession was based solely on Mr. Manis’ assets <i>as disclosed</i>. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I find it unnecessary to address this factual dispute, as I do not consider 
  this issue raises a serious question to be determined. Apart from the statutory 
  provisions, Mr. Manis filed no authority in support of his position. In my view, 
  absent a successful appeal, or an order staying the judgment pending an appeal, 
  Mr. Manis was obliged to comply with the order of Lane J. in accordance with 
  its terms. McIntyre J. expressed this principle in <i>Wilson v. The Queen</i> 
  (1983), 2 S.C.R. 594 at p. 599, in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It has long been a fundamental rule that a court order, made by a court 
      having jurisdiction to make it, stands and is binding and conclusive unless 
      it is set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed. It is also well settled in 
      the authorities that such an order may not be attacked collaterally - and 
      a collateral attack may be described as an attack made in proceedings other 
      than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification 
      of the order or judgment ...</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Iacobucci J., writing for the majority in <i>R. v. Litchfield</i>, [1993] 
  4 S.C.R. 333 at p. 349, concluded his discussion of the rationale for the rule 
  against collateral attack with the observation that “‘the orderly and functional 
  administration of justice’ requires that court orders be considered final and 
  binding unless they are reversed on appeal.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I find it unnecessary to consider the validity of Mr. Manis’ submission. 
  In my view, it is not now open to Mr. Manis to claim he should be excused from 
  performance of obligations imposed in the judgement of Lane J. by virtue of 
  statutory provisions he chose not to assert directly by seeking a stay of the 
  judgment and diligently pursuing an appeal. To hold otherwise would be to allow 
  litigants to decide whether or not to obey a court order depending on whether 
  they perceive a basis for questioning the judgment and would amount to permitting 
  an improper collateral attack on a valid and binding judgment of the court.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a> Although the threshold for establishing a serious question to 
  be determined is low, I do not consider Mr. Manis has met it, in light of the 
  principle forbidding collateral attack.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Error in Law Based on Claim 
  that Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Judgment dated November 30, 2000 Amounted to 
  Judgments for the Payment of Money</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Rule 60.11(1) provides as follows:</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A contempt order to enforce 
  an order requiring a person to do an act, <i>other than the payment of money</i>, 
  or to abstain from doing an act, may be obtained only on motion to a judge in

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Manis says paragraphs 8 and 9 of the judgment dated November 30, 
  2000 are in the nature of orders for “payment of money” and that he is not therefore 
  subject to contempt proceedings for non-compliance with these orders based on 
  R. 60.11(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Again, Mr. Manis filed no authority in support of his contention. In 
  my view, the analysis of Morden J.A. in <i>Forest v. Lacroix Estate</i> (2000), 
  48 O.R. (3d) 619 (C.A.) excludes the viability of this contention. Although 
  the case deals with use of contempt powers to enforce payment of an order for 
  support it is helpful because of the thorough review of the law in relation 
  to the exception relating to judgments for “payment of money”. Morden J.A. stated 
  the following at page 636:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[61] Beaulieu J. then referred at pp. 166-67 to the judgment of Smith J. 
      in <i>Merklinger v. Merklinger</i>, May 3, 1993 (Ont. Gen. Div., No. 58885/90Q) 
      in which she sentenced Mr. Merklinger to 90 days in jail for contempt, which 
      judgment was upheld by this court on May 26, 1993 (Doc. C.A. C15269). It 
      appears that the contempt in that case involved the non-discharge of an 
      encumbrance on property. Accordingly, it would appear that the money judgment 
      exception in the rules would not be applicable: see <i>Berry v. Donovan</i> 
      (1893), 21 O.A.R. 14.</p>

  </span> Mr. Manis submits O’Connell J.’s decision amounted to a finding that 
  Mr. Manis would be in contempt only in the event he failed to satisfy certain 
  conditions. He says he had no ability in law to satisfy the conditions because 
  his property had vested in the Trustee in Bankruptcy as of April 2, 2001. He 
  says O’Connell J. erred in law by deciding he would be in contempt if he failed 
  to satisfy the conditions. He submits the imposition of the conditions nullifies 
  the finding of contempt. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not accept Mr. Manis’ position. O’Connell J. made a clear finding 
  of contempt and ordered Mr. Manis committed to gaol. He then afforded Mr. Manis 
  an opportunity to purge the contempt. That opportunity in no way affects or 
  displaces the validity of the original finding. Mr. Manis’ status as an undischarged 
  bankrupt does not affect any failure to comply with the terms of paragraphs 
  8 and 9 of the Judgment prior to April 2, 2001. I do not accordingly consider 
  that this issue raises a serious question to be determined concerning the validity 
  of O’Connell J.’s finding of contempt. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Error in Law in Imposing

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Manis submits he was incapable of complying with the conditions 
  imposed to permit him to purge his contempt as a matter of law. He relies on 
  the fact that his Trustee in Bankruptcy has control of his assets as well as 
  the fact that compliance with the conditions would amount to him conferring 
  an unlawful preference. He says O’Connell J. erred in law by imposing such conditions 
  and that this error invalidates the finding of contempt because he was left 
  without an opportunity to remedy it. In addition, Mr. Manis submits it was an 
  error in law to impose imprisonment as a penalty for any contempt that was properly 
  found. Again, he relies on the fact that he presently has no effective ability 
  as a matter of law to remedy the contempt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Manis also says the disputed facts and circumstances of this case 
  give rise to a serious question to be determined concerning the propriety of 
  the finding of contempt as well as the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment. 
  Finally, he says the conditions imposed by O’Connell J. were different from 
  the conditions in the Judgment. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I find no merit in the last submission. I will deal with the first three 
  submissions under a combined heading because I see them as being interrelated. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While acknowledging that the court has an inherent power to control 
  its own process and ensure that its orders are obeyed, Mr. Manis submits the 
  power to imprison an individual is to be used as a last resort and only in the 
  face of a party knowingly and continually being in contempt of a court order. 
  He submits that prior to imprisoning an individual the court will normally allow 
  a party a number of opportunities to purge their contempt. He relies on <i>Surgeoner 
  v. Surgeoner</i> (1991), 6 C.P.C. (3d) 318 (Ont.Ct.Gen.Div.) where the court 
  made a finding of contempt, adjourned the matter for three weeks to permit the 
  contemnor to purge, and then granted a further adjournment to permit a further 
  opportunity to purge. He says that in this case, by imposing conditions he was 
  incapable of performing and by ordering imprisonment when he failed to perform 
  conditions he could not perform, the court departed from the principle of last 
  resort and also imposed an entirely inappropriate penalty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the overall facts and circumstances of the case, Mr. Manis relies 
  in particular on the findings of Cameron J., some of which differ from the findings 
  of O’Connell J., in support of the contention that there is at least a serious 
  question to be determined concerning the correctness of the decision. He relies 
  in addition on his evidence as to his financial situation. Finally, he also 
  says the finding of O’Connell J. that “all he need have done is gone to the 
  bank and consented” is questionable in light of the nature and extent of the 
  evidence on that point. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Manis accepts that it is a legal reality that Mr. Manis could not 
  himself satisfy the conditions imposed to purge his contempt. She asserts however, 
  that the conditions were directed at having Mr. Manis satisfy Justice Lane’s 
  order by creative means, such as engaging the assistance of friends or family 
  to fulfill his obligations, and that Mr. Manis’ bankruptcy therefore raises 
  no issue in relation to the propriety of the conditions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not accept Ms. Manis’ submissions as an appropriate basis for rejecting 
  any concerns about the propriety of the conditions imposed. It seems to me that 
  it is at least an arguable proposition that one must have it within one’s own 
  power to satisfy conditions properly imposed to purge one’s contempt. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By the same token, assuming, without deciding, that O’Connell J. erred 
  in imposing conditions that were incapable of performance as a means of purging 
  contempt, I am not persuaded that such error or the overall facts and circumstances 
  of the case raise a serious question for determination either in relation to 
  the finding of contempt or the imposition of imprisonment as a penalty. Rather, 
  in my view, these matters go only to the issue of the appropriate term of incarceration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Though framed around the principle of last resort, Mr. Manis’ first 
  and second submissions amount, in part, to an assertion that a finding of contempt 
  should not be made and the penalty of imprisonment should not be imposed where 
  the contempt cannot be purged. In my view, the authority submitted by Mr. Manis 
  does not go that far, either in terms of the finding or the remedy. Moreover, 
  the proposition would foreclose both the finding and the penalty of imprisonment 
  where contemptuous conduct is, by its nature, not of a continuing character. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> O’Connell J. made a variety of findings which indicate he was satisfied 
  that prior to his bankruptcy Mr. Manis wilfully declined to undertake compliance 
  with paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Judgment and that the consequences of non-compliance 
  would be significant to Ms. Manis. Viewed from the perspective of November 30, 
  2000, the potential consequences of non-compliance with paragraphs 8 and 9 of 
  the Judgment were significant to Ms. Manis. Absent a stay pending appeal, the 
  Judgment required Mr. Manis to remove the jeopardy to Ms. Manis arising from 
  a mortgage on the home and liability on the line of credit on a timely basis. 
  In my view, the fundamental determination of O’Connell J. is that Mr. Manis 
  made no effort to comply. The submission that O’Connell J. may have erred concerning 
  what steps Mr. Manis may have had to take in order to relieve Ms. Manis from 
  liability on the line of credit does not undermine his finding of lack of effort. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Faced with the Judgment of November 30, 2000, and in light of the potential 
  consequences for Ms. Manis and their children, it was not for Mr. Manis to conclude 
  he could not succeed and refrain from efforts to comply. The reasons of Cameron 
  J. and Mr. Manis’ evidence concerning financial downturns raise no issue about 
  Mr. Manis’ ability to make an effort. I accordingly see no basis for challenging 
  the finding of contempt based on non-compliance prior to April 2, 2001. Similarly, 
  in my view, the fact that Mr. Manis may have become incapable of remedying the 
  non-compliance as of April 2, 2001 does not render imprisonment inappropriate 
  as a sanction for his previous lack of effort. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the result, I am not persuaded Mr. Manis has raised a serious question 
  concerning the propriety of the finding of contempt or the imposition of a penalty 
  of imprisonment. That said, I accept that the matters raised by Mr. Manis constitute 
  a serious question for determination concerning the period of imprisonment imposed. 
  If O’Connell J. erred in imposing the impugned conditions, it may not be clear 
  to what extent he considered the contempt to be continuing, and therefore an 
  aggravating factor. I will go on therefore to consider the remaining parts of 
  the test for granting a stay, but solely in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Irreparable Harm</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> ‘Irreparable’ refers to the nature of the harm suffered rather than 
  its magnitude. It is harm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms 
  or which cannot be cured…: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>, supra, at p. 341. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the nature of the penalty imposed creates an obvious risk 
  of irreparable harm. In this case however, irreparable harm will only arise 
  if Mr. Manis serves a period of incarceration in excess of that properly imposed, 
  in the event it is determined O’Connell J. erred. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Balance of Convenience</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Manis does not contend that refusing the stay will cause harm to 
  her in the sense of changing the circumstances she faces, rather she says she 
  will be compelled to endure the consequences of Mr. Manis’ conduct by virtue 
  of the sale of the home prior to Mr. Manis facing any consequences in the event 
  that a stay is granted. While I understand Ms. Manis’ concern, I am not persuaded 
  this is the type of harm contemplated on this issue. However, given my conclusions 
  that the serious questions raised by Mr. Manis go only to the period of incarceration 
  imposed and that irreparable harm will arise only if he serves a period of incarceration 
  in excess of that properly imposed, I consider the public interest in ensuring 
  that orders of the court are complied with dictates that the appropriate remedy 
  is to expedite the appeal. As stated in <i>Ontario (Attorney General) v. Paul 
  Magder Furs Ltd.</i> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 46 at p. 53 (C.A.): “[a finding of 
  contempt of court] transcends the dispute between the parties, it is one which 
  strikes at the very heart of the administration of justice in this country and

  </span> For the reasons given, it is ordered that the appeal be expedited and, 
  for that purpose, that the appellant perfect the appeal on or before July 16, 
  2001, and that the respondent deliver her factum as soon as possible following 
  the date on which the appellant’s material to perfect the appeal is served, 
  but in any event, no later than 21 days thereafter. The parties are at liberty 
  to apply by motion to any judge of this court for directions concerning obtaining 
  an expedited hearing date should that become necessary. The parties may speak 
  to the question of costs on August 7, 2001, being the date to which Ms. Manis’

    was not in contempt during the period from November 30, 2000 to May 18, 2001

    of the two rules, I would not envisage any different result.</p>
