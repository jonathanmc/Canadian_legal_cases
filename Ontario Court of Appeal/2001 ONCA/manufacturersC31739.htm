<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground dated February 16, 1999 
  [1999] O.J. No. 491.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>OSBORNE

<p class=headingtitle>OVERVIEW</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant mortgagee, Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (“Manulife”), 
  held two mortgages over lands owned by the respondent mortgagor, Granada Investments 
  Limited (“Granada”).  After a 12-day trial, Ground J. held that Manulife, whose 
  mortgages had matured, could only recover from Granada and the guarantor, Joseph 
  Shaw, the amount of the mortgage debt as of October 31, 1996, not as of October 
  1, 1997 when the lands secured by Manulife’s mortgages were sold by way of auction 
  under the power of sale rights contained in Manulife’s mortgages.  The basis 
  of the trial judge’s finding in effect freezing the mortgage account at October 
  31, 1996 was his conclusion that from March, 1996 Manulife was subject to a 
  duty to mitigate its losses.  The trial judge held that Manulife did not discharge 
  that duty because it could and should have sold the property secured by the 
  mortgages between March and October, 1996.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Manulife appeals.  Its appeal requires the court to consider when Manulife 
  went into possession and the duty of a mortgagee in or out of possession to 
  mitigate its losses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These issues arise against the background of two mortgages on golf course 
  properties from the mortgagor, Granada, to the mortgagee, Manulife.  Joseph 
  Shaw, the president of Granada, guaranteed the mortgages.  Granada leased the 
  two golf courses to Aurora Highlands Golf Club (“Aurora Highlands”).  Payments 
  under the Aurora Highlands lease constituted Granada’s only revenue.  For the 
  purposes of this action, it was accepted that the mortgages matured on January 
  1, 1995 and that Granada did not pay the loans secured by the mortgages.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Manulife, through its receiver KPMG, operated the two golf courses from 
  August 31, 1996 until October, 1997 when the golf courses were sold at auction.  
  The trial judge found that although Manulife’s receiver, KPMG (not a party to 
  this appeal), properly managed the two golf course properties, Manulife was 
  nonetheless required to sell the golf courses when the mortgage account, including 
  the receiver’s costs, was equal to or lower than the assumed value of the properties 
  secured by the mortgages.  In reaching that conclusion, the trial judge held 
  that Manulife “did not act reasonably in taking no steps to attempt to sell 
  the properties during the period from March, 1996 to October, 1996”.  He viewed 
  Manulife’s decision to sell later to be unreasonable, with the result that he 
  found that Manulife failed to mitigate its losses. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Manulife contends that the trial judge erred in the following respects:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> By finding that Manulife should have offered the golf courses 
      for sale when it was not in possession.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> By imposing a duty on Manulife as a mortgagee-in-possession, 
      based on its duty to mitigate its losses, to sell the properties secured 
      by its two matured mortgages by the date when the mortgage debt was less 
      the value of the properties secured by the mortgages.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> By imposing a duty on Manulife to expose the golf courses 
      for sale and sell them by October 31, 1996, within two months of the date  
      when Manulife contends it was first in possession of the golf courses.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Granada and Shaw submit that the trial judge was correct in concluding 
  that Manulife was required to mitigate its losses from the time it took possession 
  in March, 1996.  They rely on findings of fact made by the trial judge on the 
  general issue of the reasonableness of Manulife’s conduct as mortgagee.  Granada 
  accepts that it sought further opportunities to redeem the mortgage properties.  
  However, Granada contends that litigation and other steps it took to prevent 
  the sale of the properties are of no significance because those steps were for 
  the most part undertaken after the time frame during which the trial judge held 
  that the mortgagee, acting reasonably, should have sold the two golf course 
  properties.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>THE EVIDENCE</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although there is some dispute in the evidence, the central features 
  of the evidence are not in dispute.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Granada owned two golf courses in Aurora, Ontario, one on the east side 
  and the other on the west side of Bathurst Street.  The golf courses were referred 
  to in the evidence as the East Course and the West Course.  Both of the golf 
  courses were leased to Aurora Highlands.  To obtain financing, Granada mortgaged 
  both courses to Manulife in two separate mortgages, a first mortgage for $2 
  million on the West Course and a second mortgage also for $2 million on the 
  East Course.  When the West Course mortgage was granted, a house owned by Granada 
  but occupied by the respondents, Joseph Shaw and Barbara Allan Shaw, formed 
  part of the West Course.  After a severance, Granada transferred the Shaw residence 
  lands to Joseph Shaw, who gave Granada a mortgage back for $600,000.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the two golf course mortgages matured in January, 1995, Manulife 
  demanded payment of both loans.  When payment was not forthcoming, Manulife 
  gave notice of the exercise of its power of sale rights over the East and West 
  Courses, including the Shaw residence.  This notice was dated August 9, 1995.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Various discussions and negotiations then took place, primarily concerning 
  Granada’s efforts to refinance the golf courses.  These negotiations resulted 
  in a formal standstill agreement dated October 11, 1995.  This agreement was 
  in force until January 1, 1996.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Since Granada was unsuccessful in its attempts to secure financing, 
  on March 13, 1996, shortly after the standstill agreement expired, Manulife 
  appointed KPMG as receiver of Granada under the East and West Course mortgages.  
  On April 8, 1996, KPMG gave notice to the tenant, Aurora Highlands, of the termination 
  of the lease of the golf course properties for non-payment of rent.  On the 
  same day KPMG employees attended at the golf course properties, intending to 
  take possession and control of them.  However, as a KPMG representative put 
  it, they were “kicked out”.  That is to say, KPMG and Manulife were not able 
  to secure possession of the two golf courses at that time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To further complicate matters, in addition to resisting KPMG’s attempt 
  to take possession, on April 18, 1996, Aurora Highlands commenced an action 
  against Manulife and KPMG in which it sought declarations that its lease with 
  Granada was valid, enforceable, binding and in good standing and that KPMG’s 
  notice of termination of the East and West Course leases was invalid and of 
  no force and effect.  Aurora Highlands also sought damages of $5,000,000.  On 
  the same date, April 18, 1996, Granada sued Manulife and KPMG for damages in 
  the amount of $15,000,000.  Granada also sought declarations that:</p>

      </span></span> Since the notice of intention to enforce the security had 
      lapsed and was of no force and effect, Manulife and KPMG were estopped from 
      commencing or continuing any enforcement proceedings;</p>

      </span></span> Manulife’s notice of sale under the mortgages dated August 
      9, 1995 was invalid, void and of no force and effect.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the two actions, both commenced on April 18, 1996, Aurora Highlands 
  and Granada were represented by the same solicitors.  Manifestly, the Granada/Shaw 
  strategy was to prevent, or at the very least delay, the sale of the two golf 
  course properties so that Granada could obtain refinancing and redeem them.  
  Indeed, Joseph Shaw admitted that he never wanted Manulife to sell the two golf 
  courses.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On May 28, 1996, Manulife commenced proceedings to confirm KPMG’s appointment 
  as Granada’s receiver.  It also sought an order permitting it to go into possession 
  of the golf courses, including the Shaw residence.  On June 20, 1996, Manulife 
  applied for a court appointed interim receiver of Aurora Highlands. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While all of this was going on, to assist it in obtaining refinancing, 
  Granada asked Gene Dwelsdorf to prepare an appraisal of the golf course properties.  
  Dwelsdorf’s appraisal, dated June 24, 1996, showed a value for both golf courses 
  of $10,400,000.  The trial judge did not accept Mr. Dwelsdorf’s opinion of value.  
  However, Manulife, which was advised of this appraisal during the summer of 
  1996, knew at that time that the value of the two golf courses from Granada’s 
  standpoint was more than $10,000,000.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The various proceedings by Granada, Aurora Highlands and Manulife were 
  in the Commercial List in Toronto where matters are subjected to vigorous case 
  management, which includes establishing reasonable timelines.  Consistent with 
  the agreement of the parties, a timetable for the filing of any further affidavits 
  and cross-examinations on these affidavits was established.  There was also 
  agreement on the terms under which KPMG would monitor the operations of Granada 
  until the proceedings could be heard.  Consistent with the timetable established, 
  cross-examinations on affidavits were heard in early July, 1996 and August 1, 
  1996 was fixed as the return date for Manulife’s application.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> KPMG reported to Manulife on July 26, 1996 respecting its monitoring

      </span></span> KPMG was appointed as court appointed interim receiver of 
      Aurora Highlands for 30 days to allow Granada additional time to arrange 
      refinancing and redeem.  The order provided that KPMG was to monitor Aurora 
      Highlands’ operations and that Manulife and KPMG were not in possession

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Also on August 1, 1996, the parties, through their solicitors, signed 
  a consent to a draft order which was attached to the consent.  The consent has 
  to be read with the August 1, 1996 orders of Farley J.  In summary form, the 
  parties’ deal gave Granada 30 more days to redeem and KPMG, as Aurora Highlands’ 
  court appointed interim receiver, the right to monitor Aurora Highlands’ operations.  
  If Granada did not redeem, the consent provided that an order would issue declaring 
  that Aurora Highlands’ lease was terminated and granting Manulife and KPMG possession 
  of the two golf courses, except for the Shaw residence West Course lands.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As it turned out, Granada did not redeem the properties because it could

  to which I have referred, Spence J. ordered that the Aurora Highlands lease 
  be terminated and that possession of the East and West Courses be surrendered 
  to KPMG.  He further ordered that the court appointed receivership of Aurora 
  Highlands be terminated and that there be the trial of the issue of Manulife’s 
  right to a writ of possession regarding the Shaw residence lands. Consistent 
  with Spence J.’s August 30, 1996 order, Aurora Highlands gave up possession 
  of the golf course properties.  The August 1, 1996 orders of Farley J., the 
  parties August 1, 1996 consent and the August 30, 1996 order of Spence J., in 
  my view, provide considerable support for Manulife’s submission that it was 
  not in actual or constructive  possession of the two golf courses until August 
  30, 1996.</p>

  </span> KPMG and Manulife discussed the pros and cons of an immediate sale, 
  among many other things, in considerable detail.  After Manulife went into possession 
  on August 30, 1996, its general understanding was that there was no longer a 
  golf club actually operating on the mortgaged properties, that there were many 
  maintenance issues outstanding and that there was a need to evaluate the condition 
  of the two golf courses to ensure that the highest value would be obtained on 
  a sale.  To that end, KPMG had to assemble more accurate financial information.

  </span> As is apparent from the evidence of Simon Kinnaird, Manulife specifically 
  inquired if selling the properties immediately (that is, some time in the fall 
  or winter of 1996) was a sensible option.  The answer to that inquiry from KPMG 
  and its golf experts was that an immediate sale was not a viable option since 
  a sale in that time frame would not be commercially reasonable having regard 
  to the interests of Manulife, Granada and subsequent mortgagees.  Mr. Kinnaird 
  testified that, after receiving advice from KPMG, it was Manulife’s intention 
  to sell the golf courses in the spring of 1997.  Manulife rejected the strategy 
  of a long term hold unless it did not receive adequate offers to purchase the 
  golf courses.  In the fall of 1996, Manulife decided to ready the golf courses 
  for sale and to sell them in March, 1997.  In early January, 1997, Manulife 
  obtained an appraisal and retained C.B. Commercial Realtors to list the golf 
  course properties for sale in the spring of 1997.</p>

  </span> After August 30, 1996, Manulife had to make arrangements to obtain inventory 
  since much of the existing inventory had been seized by Revenue Canada.  Since 
  there was no liquor licence, an application for a licence had to be made.  New 
  employees had to be installed in key positions, including a golf professional, 
  a general manager, a food and beverage manager and employees who could provide 
  accounting and administrative support.  Furthermore, Manulife had to make arrangements 
  for golf course maintenance and golf carts since Aurora Highlands’ golf carts 
  had been repossessed.  In the fall of 1996, Manulife and KPMG were labouring 
  under the difficulty of having no current or reliable financial information.  
  No financial statements were completed for 1996.  </p>

  </span> Steven Johnston, KPMG’s lead partner responsible for its golf industry 
  national practice group, provided specific advice to Manulife about the operation 
  of the two golf courses and an opinion as to their market value.  He concluded 
  that the market value of the two courses was $6.5 to $7 million.  Johnston worked 
  in tandem with another KPMG partner, John Walker, who was part of KPMG’s financial 
  advisory services group.  Walker oversaw the receivership, while Johnston was 
  responsible for the implementation of KPMG’s (and Manulife’s) strategic approach

  </span> All concerned, including Granada, accepted that the properties should 
  be sold as golf courses.  Johnston stated that golf course properties are generally 
  valued, and thus bought and sold, on the basis of the cash flow before debt 
  service and capital maintenance.  According to Johnston’s evidence, the cash 
  flow multiple used is typically 6 to 10.  Assuming a cash flow of $700,000 and 
  using a multiple of 8 would yield a value of $5,600,000 for the two golf courses.</p>

  He opined that an “as is” sale would result in a value of about $5,600,000.  
  He concluded that the better approach was to ready the two golf courses for 
  the 1997 golf season and to operate them until March 1, 1997, at which time 
  a decision could be made as to whether the properties should be held on a longer 
  term basis or whether they could be made available for an immediate sale shortly 
  before the commencement of the 1997 Ontario golf season.</p>

  </span> Johnston testified that in the fall of 1996, in light of the uncertainties 
  respecting revenue, serious problems with respect to irrigation, the design 
  of the West Course and the absence of real business records, the value of the 
  golf courses could be below $5,600,000, and possibly as low as $4,000,000 if 
  the golf courses were sold on an “as is” or fire sale basis.  Johnston recognized 
  that in the fall, when the golf season is coming to an end or has ended, there 
  are considerable expenses and little revenue being generated.  He thus concluded 
  that it would be unwise to attempt to package the golf courses for sale during 
  the winter of 1996-97.</p>

  fall of 1996 except on a distress sale basis.  Thus, Manulife and KPMG opted 
  not to sell in the fall of 1996.  Johnston testified that existing problems 
  with the golf courses had to be resolved to arrive at a point where a purchaser 
  would consider a cash flow multiple of 10, which would yield a value of $6.5 
  to $7 million on a non-distress, full disclosure basis. </p>

  to KPMG expressing interest, but advising KPMG that “a number of hurdles” had 
  to be removed before the golf courses were “truly salable”.  Palmer’s letter 
  went on to advise that it would offer $5.75 million subject to a due diligence 
  review concerning a required severance, the resolution of the East Course clubhouse

  golf course properties were to be offered for sale, Shaw, as president of Granada 
  and personally, caused a notice to be distributed to potential purchasers.  
  The notice was similar to Granada’s May, 1997 letter to Palmer.  The notice 
  concluded by stating that “[t]he outcome of these events [the appeals from Cameron 
  J.’s two orders and a motion to stay the September 29, 1997 order of Blair J.] 
  may effect [<i>sic</i>] the validity of the auction or any sale, and any claims

  make brief reference to the positions asserted by Granada and Joseph Shaw in 
  their statement of defence in this action.  In so far as possession is concerned, 
  in paragraphs 68 and 69 of their statement of defence, Granada and Shaw alleged 
  that Manulife and KPMG were given possession of the golf course properties on 
  August 30, 1996, not in March, 1996 as Granada and Shaw alleged at trial and 
  on this appeal.  The statement of defence also alleges that March, 1997 was 
  “not an opportune or commercially reasonable time to sell the Golf Course Property…”.  
  It does not allege that Manulife sold the golf course properties too late.  
  Quite the contrary, to the extent that the timing of the sale is dealt with, 
  the October, 1997 sale was referred to as “quick”, meaning that it was undertaken 
  too soon.  The statement of defence alleged that a “quick sale” was effected 
  to hide the mismanagement of KPMG and to take advantage of the fact that Granada 
  at the time did not have counsel.</p>

  </span> In summary, the strategy of Granada and Joseph Shaw throughout was to 
  frustrate and thus delay the sale of the golf courses.  That strategy continued 
  to be employed even after the golf courses were listed for sale in early 1997.  
  Joseph Shaw admitted that when he learned that the golf courses were actually 
  for sale, he started an action to prevent the sale.  He said “I never wanted 
  Manulife to sell”.</p>

  have exposed the golf courses for sale and sold them between March, 1996 and 
  October, 1996.  As a result of this finding, the trial judge in effect froze 
  the mortgage account at $5,726,911, the account balance as at October 31, 1996.  
  It is not clear to me why the trial judge picked October 31, 1996 as the date 
  by which Manulife ought to have sold the two golf course properties for the 
  purposes of establishing the shortfall owed to Manulife by Granada and the guarantor, 
  Joseph Shaw.  It appears likely that the trial judge decided that October 31, 
  1996 was the date when the mortgage account, including all costs of possession, 
  was below the value of the property secured by the two mortgages.  </p>

  properties should have been exposed to the market and sold was his acceptance 
  of Granada’s submission that from March, 1996 onward, when Manulife appointed 
  KPMG as Granada’s receiver, Manulife was under a duty to mitigate its losses.

  as receiver was not imprudent or negligent.  He also accepted that steps taken 
  by KPMG and Manulife during the management of the two golf courses did not have 
  “a negative impact” on the value of the two golf courses.  Finally, the trial

  regarding the condition of the golf courses could have been addressed at the 
  due diligence stage of a transaction and, if necessary, accounted for “in negotiating 
  terms of sale”.  According to the trial judge, the fact that neither Granada

  sale of the properties, could not “… have prohibited the plaintiffs from proceeding

  </span> It is against that background that the trial judge concluded that a 
  sale of the golf courses was possible in the March to October, 1996 period and 
  that if a sale were concluded, it probably would have been for a purchase price 
  equal to or minimally less than the total mortgage debt.  He put it this way: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… a sale of the golf club properties was possible in the period from March 
      , 1996 onwards and … a sale of the properties, at least during the period 
      between March 1996 and October 1996, would probably have resulted in payment 
      in full of the mortgage debt, the realty taxes and the cost of sale or would 
      have resulted in only a minimum shortfall.  </p>

      no steps to attempt to sell the properties during the period from March,

  2394 (C.A.), recognized that a mortgagee can exercise its power of sale “whenever

  as authority permitting a mortgagee in possession to choose a date for sale 
  “… without regard to the interests of the mortgagor or of a guarantor of the 
  mortgage and the risk of increasing the exposure of the mortgagor or guarantor

  </span> It is not entirely clear to me what the trial judge found with respect 
  to the timing of Manulife’s possession of the two golf course properties secured 
  by its mortgages.  In his review of the history of the mortgages on the East 
  and West Courses, the trial judge stated that Manulife, through KPMG, took possession 
  of the two golf courses on August 31, 1996.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>On August 31, 1996, KPMG took over possession of the East Course and 
      the West Course</u> and commenced to operate the golf club operations on 
      both properties under the name of Aurora Golf and Country Club.  KPMG operated 
      the golf clubs until the sale of the properties.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> However, later in his reasons, the trial judge seems to have concluded 
  that Manulife was in possession in March, 1996, once it appointed KPMG as Granada’s 
  receiver under the mortgages, or that Manulife could have gone into possession 
  at any time in the March to August, 1996 period.</p>

  </span> For the reasons that follow, although I accept Cusinato J.’s statements 
  in <i>Canada Trustco</i> as to the general duties of a mortgagee in possession, 
  I do not accept that a mortgagee is under a duty to mitigate its loss, as that 
  term is understood in the context of contract and tort damage claims.  Furthermore, 
  in my view, the trial judge erred in concluding that Manulife was in possession 
  before August 31, 1996, or in concluding that, although Manulife was not in 
  possession until August 31, 1996, for purposes of imposing a duty to mitigate, 
  it could have gone into possession any time after March, 1996 when it appointed 
  KPMG as Granada’s receiver.  </p>

  </span> A mortgagee enters into possession when it deprives the mortgagor of 
  control and management of the mortgaged property.  See  Rayner and McLaren, 
  <i>Falconbridge on Mortgages</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (1997), at p.&nbsp;643.  
  The right of a mortgagee to possession arises when the mortgagor defaults.  
  However, there is no obligation on the mortgagee to take possession at the time 
  of default, or at all.  See <i>Bennett on Power of Sale</i>, 1997 ed. (1996), 
  at p. 51.</p>

  </span> From March through August 1, 1996, Granada and Aurora Highlands resisted 
  possession directly when Aurora Highlands refused to permit KPMG employees to 
  enter into possession and when Granada and Aurora Highlands commenced the litigation 
  to which I referred earlier.  In that litigation, Granada and Aurora Highlands 
  took the position that Manulife was not entitled to possession of Aurora Highlands.  
  They contended that the lease from Granada to Aurora Highlands was not in default 
  and that Manulife’s notice of termination of the lease was invalid.</p>

  </span> Things changed somewhat on August 1, 1996.  Farley J. issued two orders 
  and the parties consented to an order that became Spence J.’s August 30, 1996 
  order terminating the lease and giving Manulife and KPMG possession of the two 
  golf courses.</p>

  </span> It is apparent that in the August, 1996 redemption period and before, 
  the parties accepted that Aurora Highlands, not Manulife or KPMG, was in possession 
  of the two golf courses secured by Manulife’s mortgages.  On August 1, 1996, 
  Granada, Manulife, Aurora Highlands and Joseph Shaw agreed that Granada would 
  be given 30 more days to redeem.  The parties  further agreed that if Granada 
  did not redeem by August 30, 1996 an order would issue on consent declaring 
  that the Aurora Highlands lease is terminated effective August 1, 1996 and that 
  Aurora Highlands forthwith surrender immediate possession of the two golf courses 
  to Manulife and KPMG.  </p>

  </span> Manulife’s attempt to take possession of the golf courses failed in 
  April, 1996 when its receiver’s representatives were “kicked out”.  From April, 
  1996 until August 30, 1996, Aurora Highlands, not Manulife, was in control of 
  the golf club operations.  In the spring of 1996, Granada and Aurora Highlands 
  challenged Manulife’s right to possess and sell the golf courses.  Granada did 
  not abandon the golf courses at any time in the March to August 30, 1996 period.  
  Nor did Aurora Highlands pay rent to Granada in that period.  Thus, the Aurora 
  Highlands lease was in default.  Furthermore, on August 1, 1996, Granada and 
  Joseph Shaw plainly accepted that Manulife was not in possession of the golf 
  courses.  At that time, by agreement, Granada and Aurora Highlands were given 
  a 30-day reprieve, subject to the right of KPMG to monitor Aurora Highlands’ 
  operations as court appointed interim receiver.  Granada’s consent and Spence 
  J.’s August 30, 1996 order giving effect to the consent were premised on Manulife 
  not being in possession on August 1, 1996 and on Manulife’s right to possession 
  on August 30, 1996 being dependent on Granada’s failure to redeem between August 
  1, 1996 and August 30, 1996.</p>

  </span> I acknowledge that Manulife could have gone into possession once it 
  determined that Aurora Highlands had not remitted the required lease payments 
  to Granada.  However, as I have noted, KPMG was “kicked out” when it attempted 
  to enter into possession on Manulife’s behalf.  Throughout the March to August, 
  1996 period, Granada and Aurora Highlands were actively challenging Manulife’s 
  right to sell the golf courses.  It was not until August, 1996 that Granada, 
  Joseph Shaw and Aurora Highlands <u>agreed</u> to give Manulife possession as 
  of August 30, 1996 if Granada was not able to redeem by August 30, 1996.  In 
  my view, Manulife was not in possession until August 30, 1996.</p>

  </span> As a general proposition, although Manulife could have asserted rights 
  to possession under the mortgage before August 30, 1996, it was not under any 
  duty to do so in the March through August, 1996 period.  See <i>Modern Realty 
  Co., Ltd. v. Shantz</i>, [1928] S.C.R. 213 at 221.  Manulife was entitled to

  </span> There is no issue in this case with respect to Manulife’s duty to account 
  and, as I have said, the trial judge found that KPMG’s management of the properties 
  was not improvident.  A mortgagee in possession must take reasonable care to 
  manage the property in question prudently, since the property must be returned 
  to the mortgagor if the mortgagor pays the mortgage debt.  Only reasonable costs 
  attendant on the management of the property are properly added to the mortgage 
  debt.  </p>

  </span> In <i>Oak Orchard, supra</i>, a case in which the mortgagor contended 
  that the mortgagee sold the mortgaged property for an insufficient price, Saunders 
  J. extracted six propositions from the decided cases:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>1.         <u>A mortgagee selling under a power of sale is under a duty 
      to take reasonable precautions to obtain the true market value of the mortgaged 
      property at the date on which he decides to sell it.</u>  This does not 
      mean that the mortgagee must, in fact, obtain the true value.</p>
    <p>2.         The duty of the mortgagee is only to take reasonable precautions.  
      Perfection is not required.  Some latitude is allowed to a mortgagee.</p>
    <p>3.         In deciding whether a mortgagee has fallen short of his duty, 
      the facts must be looked at broadly and he will not be adjudged to be in 
      default of his duties unless he is plainly on the wrong side of the line.</p>
    <p>4.         <u>The mortgagee is entitled to exercise an accrued power of 
      sale for his own purposes whenever he chooses to do so.  It matters not 
      that the moment may be unpropitious and that by waiting, a higher price 
      could be obtained.</u></p>
    <p>5.         The mortgagee can accept the best price he can obtain in an 
      adverse market provided that none of the adverse factors are due to fault 
      on his part.</p>
    <p>6.         Even if the duty to take reasonable precautions is breached, 
      the mortgagor must show that a higher price would have been obtained but 
      for the breach in order to be compensated in damages.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> The issue when a mortgagee must exercise its power of sale rights was

  96 (Ont. H.C.J.), aff’d, (1989), 67 O.R. (2d) 735 (C.A.).  In <i>Hausman</i>, 
  the mortgagor contended that the mortgagee sold too quickly and for too low 
  a price.  Anderson J. referred to and adopted Salmon L.J.’s statement in <i>Cuckmere 
  Brick Co. Ltd. et al. v. Mutual Finance Ltd.</i>, [1971] Ch. 949 at 965:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      not that the moment may be unpropitious and that by waiting a higher price 
      could be obtained.  He has the right to realise his security by turning 
      it into money when he likes.</u>  Nor, in my view, is there anything to 
      prevent a mortgagee from accepting the best bid he can get at an auction, 
      even though the auction is badly at ended [<i>sic</i>] and the bidding exceptionally 
      low.  Providing none of those adverse factors is due to any fault of the 
      mortgagee, he can do as he likes.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> In <i>British Columbia Land and Investment Agency Ltd. v. Ishitaka</i> 
  (1911), 45 S.C.R. 302, a chattel mortgage case, the mortgagor contended that 
  the property secured by the mortgage was sold for less than market value.  Duff 
  J. considered the duty of a mortgagee and said at pp. 316-17:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It is to be observed that the duty of a mortgagee in exercising a power 
      of sale (as touching the measures to be taken to secure a good price for 
      the property sold), has in recent years been stated by a very high authority, 
      (<i>Kennedy v. DeTrafford</i> … The sum of the matter appears to be this.  
      He is bound to observe the limits of the power and he is bound to act in 
      good faith, that is to say, he is bound to exercise the power fairly for 
      the purpose for which it was given.  If the mortgagee proceeds in a manner 
      which is calculated to injure the interests of the mortgagor and if his 
      course of action is incapable of justification as one which in the circumstances 
      an honest mortgagee might reasonably consider to be required for the protection 
      of his own interests; if he sacrifice the mortgagor’s interests “fraudulently, 
      wilfully or recklessly,” then, as Lord Herschell says, it would be difficult 
      to understand how he could be held to be acting in good faith.  But that 
      is a vastly different thing from saying that he is under a duty to the mortgagor 
      to take, (regardless of his own interests as mortgagee,) all the measures 
      a prudent man might be expected to take in selling his own property.</p>

  </span> There is no issue in this case concerning the steps taken by Manulife 
  to sell the property, apart from the timing of the sale.  In my opinion, Manulife 
  acted in good faith.  It was entirely reasonable for Manulife to have accepted 
  the advice of KPMG’s golf expert, Johnston, not to sell the golf course properties 
  on an “as is” basis, but rather to ready them for sale as going concerns in 
  the spring of 1997.  This advice required the mortgagee and its receiver to 
  take steps to generate a cash flow from the golf course operations.  Once a 
  decision to proceed with a sale was made, the golf courses were exposed to the 
  market in a reasonable way and, in October, 1997, sold for a reasonable price.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In theory, Manulife could have entered into possession and exposed the 
  golf course properties for sale in the spring of 1996.  Apart from the strategic 
  decision to develop a revenue stream from the golf courses to secure a higher 
  price in their sale, the uncontradicted evidence indicates that because of Granada’s 
  and Joseph Shaw’s efforts to frustrate any sale of the golf course properties, 
  it is highly unlikely that any purchaser would have been interested in buying 
  the properties except on a fire sale price basis. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s conclusion limiting Manulife’s claim to the mortgage 
  account as at October 31, 1996 assumes that the golf courses could have been 
  sold for at least the October 31, 1996 mortgage account balance in the March 
  to October, 1996 period, or for a purchase price minimally less than the mortgage 
  debt.  There is no evidence that in that period a purchaser would have been 
  prepared to resolve, or ignore, the various impediments set in place by Granada, 
  Joseph Shaw and Aurora Highlands.  In my view, the trial judge was unrealistically 
  dismissive in failing to take into account how any reasonable purchaser would 
  have reacted to these impediments. </p>

line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The net result of the actions of Granada, Joseph Shaw and Aurora Highlands 
  was to substantially increase the mortgage debt by fighting KPMG and Manulife 
  at every step.  Joseph Shaw’s goal was to redeem so long as the sale of the 
  golf courses could be deferred and the possibility of redemption remained extant.  
  To give credit to Granada and Joseph Shaw, they were at least consistent.  They 
  were vehemently opposed to the sale of the golf course properties throughout.

  </span> Lastly, in my opinion, as a general proposition, mitigation does not 
  apply to an action for a fixed debt as it does to tort and contract damage claims.  
  The mitigation issue in a mortgage remedy context arose in <i>Pacific &amp; 
  Western Trust Corp. v. Gretchen Enterprises Ltd.</i> (1989), 63 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  764 (Sask. Q.B.).  In that case, the mortgagor’s position was that since the 
  value of the mortgaged land was equal to or greater than the amount of the mortgage 
  debt, the mortgagee had a duty to mitigate its losses by accepting an offer 
  from the mortgagor to transfer the mortgaged property to the mortgagee in satisfaction 
  of the debt.  At pp. 765-66, Estey J., after referring to <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 
  24<sup>th</sup> ed., vol. 1 (1977), at pp. 727-28 and Anson, <i>Principles of 
  the English Law of Contract</i>, 21<sup>st</sup> ed. (1959), at p. 459, concluded 
  that a mortgagee in an action for debt is under no duty to mitigate the mortgage 
  debt by accepting a transfer of the mortgaged land.  He concluded that doctrines 
  such as remoteness and mitigation, which place limits on the recovery of damages, 
  do not apply to a debt.  I agree.  The principle of mitigation has no application 
  to Manulife’s claim for repayment of its loans to Granada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although mitigation as it is known to tort and contract law does not 
  apply to an action for a debt, the mortgagee is constrained by duties imposed 
  by the law.  A mortgagee in possession is required to account and may only add 
  expenses to the mortgage debt that are reasonably incurred in all of the circumstances.  
  Taken that far, I have no problem with the comments of Cusinato J. in <i>Canada 
  Trustco, supra</i>.  In that case, expenses incurred after Canada Trustco went 
  into possession caused the mortgage debt to increase significantly beyond the 
  value of the property.  The mortgagee took no steps for five years to sell in 
  a depressed market.  I agree with the proposition as set out in <i>Canada Trustco 
  </i>that a mortgagee in possession must take reasonable precautions to obtain 
  the true value of the mortgaged property and should not incur expenses as a 
  mortgagee in possession that are unreasonable.  I do not, however, agree with 
  Cusinato J.’s observations about the application of the principle of mitigation.  
  That part of <i>Canada Trustco </i>should not be followed. </p>

  </span> The trial judge found that KPMG’s expenses were not unreasonable.  I 
  see no basis in the evidence and the trial judge’s findings of fact to attack 
  those expenses through the back door by imposing a broad duty to mitigate on 
  the basis that the mortgage account would have been lower if the golf courses 
  had been sold sooner.</p>
