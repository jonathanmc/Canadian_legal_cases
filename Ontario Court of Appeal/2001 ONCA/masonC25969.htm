style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal from the judgment of Humphrey J. on December 
  12, 1995 declaring the appellant to be a dangerous offender and imposing a sentence 
  of indeterminate detention.  This appeal first came before the court in 1999.  
  At that time, the court was concerned about the lack of current information 
  about the status of the appellant and whether he was receiving any treatment 
  within the penitentiary.  This was a particular concern in this case because 
  the appellant had been in the penitentiary system since 1991 and was only nineteen 
  when he committed the predicate offences that founded the dangerous offender 
  application.  We have now been provided with comprehensive reports from the 
  penitentiary service as well as an expert report from a psychiatrist, Dr.&nbsp;D. 
  Eaves.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss 
  the appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>The evidence at the dangerous offender 
  hearing</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In October 1991, the appellant pleaded guilty to sexual assault 
  with a weapon and was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.  The facts of 
  the offence were very serious.  In July 1991, the appellant broke into a home 
  and raped a woman at knifepoint.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the appellant was serving this sentence, the police were 
  able to link him to a similar incident that occurred in October 1990.  On this 
  occasion, the appellant broke into a home and raped the complainant at gunpoint.  
  Following the assault, the appellant stole some money from the complainant and 
  left.  The appellant pleaded guilty to sexual assault with a weapon and robbery.  
  These were the predicate offences that gave rise to the dangerous offender application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant had a prior conviction as a young offender for 
  break and enter with intent to commit sexual assault.  The appellant attempted 
  to break into a woman’s home but he ran away when the complainant was able to 
  call the police.  Evidence was also adduced at the dangerous offender hearing 
  of two other sexual assaults in 1989 that were not the subject of convictions.  
  Humphrey&nbsp;J. found that one of these assaults took place.  This offence 
  was also a rape at knifepoint.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Two psychiatrists testified at the dangerous offender hearing.  
  There was little disagreement between them.  The appellant suffers from two 
  sexual paraphilias, voyeurism and, more seriously, preferential rape pattern.  
  The appellant also suffers from alcohol abuse disorder and mixed personality 
  disorder.  Neither psychiatrist would diagnose the appellant as a psychopath.  
  Dr. Klassen, the psychiatrist nominated by the Crown, testified that the appellant 
  met the dangerous offender classification.  He was of the view that despite 
  the appellant’s young age, his personality had already been formed.  In his 
  view, the community could only be protected if the appellant was incarcerated 
  or if he took sex-drive-reducing medication in perpetuity.  He did not believe 
  that the appellant could benefit from less invasive treatment and he felt that, 
  in any event, the appellant lacked motivation for treatment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Ben-Aron, who was nominated by the defence, was initially 
  somewhat more optimistic.  He felt that the appellant was genuinely motivated 
  to accept treatment.  He also emphasized the impact of an incident in the penitentiary 
  when the appellant was raped by another inmate.  Dr. Ben-Aron was of the view 
  that this gave the appellant some insight into the plight of his victims and 
  was the beginning of an ability in the appellant to empathize with his victims.  
  However, in his report and at trial, Dr. Ben Aron placed a significant caveat 
  on this opinion because of the appellant’s involvement in an escape plot while 
  he was at METFORS (the forensic psychiatry unit at the Clarke Institute).  As 
  he said in his report:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>This expression of sensitivity for others, however, must be given an 
    appropriate weighting, and it is necessary to take into consideration the 
    alleged planned escape in which he was reported to have participated while 
    in his recent stay in METFORS.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The admissibility and use of the evidence of the escape plot 
  is at the core of the appellant’s appeal.  He submits that this evidence was 
  inadmissible and should not have been relied upon by the psychiatrists in forming 
  their opinions.  The appellant was sent to METFORS in early 1995 for a dangerous 
  offender assessment.  During this time, another patient informed staff of an 
  upcoming escape attempt involving himself, the appellant and a third patient.  
  As a result of this report, the appellant was removed to a secure room and searched.  
  The staff found a piece of paper containing details of an escape attempt.  Using 
  information from this paper, the staff located some metal bars that, according 
  to the informant, were to be used to subdue at least one staff member.  A staff 
  member overheard the appellant speaking to the third patient and mentioning 
  the word “bar”.  The informant patient was an unsavoury witness.  The appellant 
  testified that he was not sure whether he was planning to escape.  He admitted 
  that the discussion about the escape at least included threatening nurses with 
  a fire extinguisher.  He stated that he had nothing to do with the metal bars.  
  I will return to the question of the use of the escape plan evidence below.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As indicated, Humphrey J. found the appellant to be a dangerous 
  offender.  He held that the appellant fit within the definition in former s. 
  753(b), which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>753.  Where, on an application made under this Part following the conviction 
      of a person for an offence but before the offender is sentenced therefor, 
      it is established to the satisfaction of the court</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span>            </span>(b)  that the offence for which the offender has 
      been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph 
      (b) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender, 
      by his conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission 
      of the offence for which he has been convicted, has shown a failure to control 
      his sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil 
      to other persons through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses,</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>the court may find the offender to be a dangerous offender and may 
      thereupon impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate 
      period, in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence 
      for which the offender has been convicted.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Humphrey J. recognized that he had a discretion to impose a definite 
  sentence notwithstanding the dangerous offender finding.  He held, however, 
  that in view of the evidence that there was no realistic expectation that the 
  appellant’s preferential rape pattern paraphilia could be cured or abated within 
  any prescribed time frame, there was no option but to impose an indeterminate 
  sentence.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>The fresh evidence</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For reasons that are not material to this appeal, the appellant 
  was transferred to British Columbia while he was serving the initial seven-year 
  sentence and he was returned there after he was declared a dangerous offender 
  in 1995.  At the request of this court, a British Columbia psychiatrist, Dr. 
  Eaves, conducted an assessment of the appellant.  That assessment was completed 
  in January 2000.  Dr. Eaves’ report is detailed and comprehensive.  His report, 
  together with the more recent reports from the penitentiary service, describes 
  the treatment that the appellant has had to date and provides an assessment 
  of the risk he presents at this time.  While I will provide further details 
  below, in summary, the appellant still represents a medium high to high risk 
  to reoffend if released into the community.  Further, while the appellant has 
  undergone some treatment and made some progress he has also resisted other treatment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Eaves’ diagnosis of the appellant is similar to that of the 
  psychiatrists who testified before Humphrey J.  According to Dr. Eaves, the 
  appellant has serious problems of alcohol abuse, dependence, and mixed paraphilia.  
  He has a personality disorder of a mixed type, with narcissistic and borderline 
  features.  Dr. Eaves used a number of accepted risk assessment instruments to 
  come to his conclusion that the appellant presents a moderately high to high 
  risk of re-offending.  It is worth reproducing the final paragraph of Dr. Eaves’ 
  report:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I would conclude that Mr.&nbsp;Mason presents a moderately high to high 
      risk of re-offending.  This risk may be attenuated by a positive response 
      to treatment intervention, and there is some evidence that he is positively 
      motivated to conclude his current treatment programme and benefit from it, 
      in contrast to his poor performance in the past.  All the instruments that 
      I have utilized indicate a high risk of recidivism.  His personality characteristics 
      are of most concern, since narcissism and grandiosity are antithetical to 
      the development of true rapport and, hence, empathy.  It is generally considered 
      that the ability to form empathy is a critical item in determining whether 
      a sex offender recidivates or not.  His early childhood experiences may 
      have blunted his affective (emotional) state to some extent, and, as Dr.&nbsp;Ben-Aron 
      pointed out at trial, this is an area where therapeutic interventions can 
      be focussed with consequent benefit.  <u>It is encouraging that Mr.&nbsp;Mason 
      now seems motivated to take part in a treatment programme, but it is too 
      early to say whether he has the capacity to truly benefit from it.  Should 
      he do so, then there would be reasonable likelihood that he could re-enter 
      the community at some future point, given highly structured supervision 
      and an ongoing treatment programme</u>.  Most of the intensive treatment 
      programmes, such as those at the RHC [Regional Health Centre], are followed 
      by relapse prevention programmes which identify a person's crime cycle, 
      the circumstances in which persons are vulnerable to recidivism, and the 
      steps they can take to render themselves safe.  It would be imperative that 
      Mr.&nbsp;Mason take part in such relapse prevention programmes prior to 
      consideration of release on parole.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As indicated in the emphasized part, there is some suggestion 
  that with appropriate treatment, the appellant might be able to enter the community 
  at some point, under very strict controls.  However, that point had not yet 
  been reached in early 2000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The various progress reports from the penitentiary detail the 
  treatment afforded to the appellant and his progress.  The most recent report 
  is dated March 2001.  Following the preparation of Dr. Eaves’ report, the appellant 
  completed the Intensive Treatment Programme for Sex Offenders at the Regional 
  Health Centre and participated in the Sex Offender Relapse Prevention Programming.  
  The appellant is reported to have made significant gains through the Treatment 
  Programme, although there was some “back-sliding” in his behaviour.  The penitentiary 
  consultants suggested that the appellant again participate either in the Intensive 
  Treatment Programme for Sex Offenders at the Regional Health Centre or the moderate 
  intensity treatment programme at Mountain Institution.  They also recommended 
  that the appellant participate in another alcohol abuse treatment programme.  
  The appellant was reluctant to undertake these further treatments.  Thus, while 
  the appellant professes that he wishes to change his behaviour and has participated 
  in several treatment programmes for that purpose, he lacked insight into the 
  need for further treatment.  An excerpt from one of the reports will give some 
  indication of the difficulties that the appellant still presents:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr.&nbsp;Mason's violent sexual behaviour and voyeuristic behaviour started 
      at a very early age.  Continued treatment is recommended before this offender 
      can be deemed an acceptable risk to the community.  Mr.&nbsp;Mason has made 
      some very impressive gains towards lowering this risk however release at 
      this time would appear to be premature as he has only recently been able 
      to accept the harm he has invoked on his victims.  <u>He reportedly maintained 
      a lack of empathy for his victims even after his own experience of being 
      sexually assaulted while incarcerated at Millhaven Institution.</u></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Mason's crimes warrant caution as his victims suffered not only 
      physical harm but as well the psychological trauma of being victimized in 
      their own homes.</span></p>
    <p><u>Currently Mr.&nbsp;Mason has regressed in his behaviour and has allowed 
      his frustration to control him instead of him controlling his frustration.  
      It is clear that Mr.&nbsp;Mason is not utilizing the skills taught to him 
      through the various programs which is of grave concern to the Case Management 
      Team.</u><span>  </span>Mr.&nbsp;Mason must learn to work through his problems 
      in a positive manner and not to digress into old patterns of behaviour when 
      things don't go his way.  Mr.&nbsp;Mason has not made an attempt to understand 
      why further program recommendations have been made or even to effectively 
      communicate with his Case Management Team.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> The most recent psychological report also provides important 
  information on the appellant’s treatment potential.  In this report, the author, 
  after detailing some quite significant and impressive progress, wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Having said that, significant concerns remain and I will highlight two.  
      First, it is evident that, even after intensive treatment, Mr.&nbsp;Mason 
      has found it difficult (especially during times of emotional strain) to 
      control his urges to exhibit himself (i.e. arranging to be 'caught' masturbating 
      at night-time count).  Since his return to Mountain Institution earlier 
      this year, by his own admission, he has engaged in this sort of exhibitionism 
      a few times.  I understand that Mr.&nbsp;Mason has not incurred any charges 
      for this.  <u>Although to his credit Mr.&nbsp;Mason is being open about 
      these urges and seems to be taking appropriate steps to gain control over 
      them (e.g. through individual and group therapy, and through investigating 
      pharmacological options), it is still apparent that Mr.&nbsp;Mason has a 
      considerable way to go.</u>  Second, surrounding the two sexual allegations 
      dating back to 1989 that led to no sustained charges, it is interesting 
      that Mr.&nbsp;Mason remains somewhat defensive -- emphasizing that these 
      complaints were bogus, and saying that &quot;it really upsets [him]&quot; 
      that people continue to doubt his innocence.  While I obviously can't and 
      won't dispute his innocence (as he wasn't convicted of anything), it is 
      likely that Mr.&nbsp;Mason acted in ways that were forceful, intrusive, 
      and upsetting to those complainants (and probably other women as well).  
      Moreover, it is troubling that Mr.&nbsp;Mason admittedly put a knife to 
      the throat of one of these complainants to stop her from lashing out at 
      him.  Rather than being defensive about these sexual allegations, Mr.&nbsp;Mason 
      could take a closer look at how, more generally in his life, he has mistreated 
      and used women.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Use of the escape plan evidence</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred 
  in admitting and relying upon the evidence of the escape plan.  He argues that 
  the Crown failed to prove the plan beyond a reasonable doubt and that, in any 
  event, the evidence was inadmissible.  The court did not call upon the Crown 
  to respond to these submissions.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As to the first point, there was a body of evidence upon which 
  the trial judge could properly find that the important elements of the plan 
  had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Further, despite his reservations 
  about the credibility of the patient informer, the trial judge was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that there was such a plan, that the appellant was 
  a participant, and that the plan envisaged the use of violence towards staff 
  members.  While it is clear that the trial judge would not have made those findings 
  based solely on the informant’s evidence, the informant’s testimony was corroborated 
  by independent evidence.  The trial judge concluded that the evidence proved 
  “Mason’s escape plan required at least threats of violence and confinement of 
  staff in order to be viable”.  There is evidence to support that finding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s second argument is that the evidence of the escape 
  plot was inadmissible because it was, in law, irrelevant to the psychiatrists’ 
  expert assessments.  This submission is based on the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Howard</i> (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 38.  The importance 
  of this evidence to Dr. Ben-Aron’s ultimate opinion cannot be doubted.  Without 
  it, Dr. Ben-Aron was of the view that it was premature to classify the appellant 
  as a dangerous offender.  He thought that the appellant’s own victimization 
  in the penitentiary might be a sufficient impetus for the appellant to change, 
  accept treatment, and significantly diminish his dangerousness.  However, as 
  he testified in chief in response to questions from the appellant’s lawyer, 
  these hopes were dashed when the respondent took part in the escape plot.  To 
  quote Dr.&nbsp;Ben-Aron, “It suddenly diminishes the significance of his being 
  terrorized in prison, diminishes the significance of his being empathetic to 
  possible victims of assault”.  In the result, Dr. Ben-Aron shared Dr.&nbsp;Klassen’s 
  opinion that the appellant met the dangerous offender classification.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The emphasis that the trial judge put on this evidence also cannot 
  be doubted.  It was an important consideration in his decision not to exercise 
  his discretion to impose a definite sentence.  As he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>For reasons mentioned in his report, [Dr. Klassen] is not optimistic that 
      Mason will or could successfully undergo treatment.  I hope he is wrong.  
      <u>Everybody, including the accused, believes he is a dangerous person, 
      except for that one hopeful note of Dr. Ben-Aron which I read and which 
      he abandoned after hearing of the escape.  I am driven to conclude that 
      there is no realistic expectation that Mason’s preferential rape pattern 
      paraphilia will be curbed or abated within any prescribed time frame, if 
      ever</u>.  Therefore, I have no option but to impose an order detaining 
      the accused in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the escape plot evidence was admissible and could 
  be taken into account by the psychiatrists in forming their opinions.  This 
  case is different from <i>Howard</i>.  In <i>Howard,</i> the accused was tried 
  for first degree murder.  Prior to that trial, his alleged accomplice pleaded 
  guilty to second degree murder.  At his own trial, the accused testified that 
  he was with the accomplice the entire evening when the killing occurred and 
  gave a detailed account of his whereabouts. He denied that he and the accomplice 
  had killed the deceased or had been with the deceased that evening. The accused 
  then proposed to call an expert on footprints to testify that footprints found 
  near the body could not have been made by the co-accused.  The trial judge ruled 
  that Crown counsel would be permitted to cross-examine the witness on whether 
  or not he had taken into account the fact that the co-accused had pleaded guilty 
  and at the sentence hearing had admitted that the footprints were his.  As a 
  result of this ruling, the defence did not call their expert and the accused 
  was convicted.  The Supreme Court of Canada held that the trial judge erred 
  in ruling that these questions could be put.  The appellant relies upon the 
  two propositions stated by Lamer J., for the majority, at p. 46 of the <i>Howard</i> 
  decision.  I will deal with each in turn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, Lamer J. held that the fact the accomplice had pleaded 
  guilty and had acknowledged that the footprint was his was “not at the time 
  the question was intended to be put to the expert, and was not going to become, 
  a fact adduced in evidence; nor was it a fact that could fairly be inferred 
  from the facts in evidence”.  The evidence of the escape plot is entirely different.  
  It is evidence of the appellant’s background and character.  Section 757 of 
  the <i>Criminal Code</i> expressly provides for the admissibility of evidence 
  of character at the instance of the Crown.  At Howard’s trial, evidence that 
  his alleged accomplice had pleaded guilty and admitted certain facts was hearsay 
  and irrelevant.  The escape plot evidence in this case was evidence of the appellant’s 
  own conduct and relevant to the issues on the dangerous offender application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second proposition set forth in <i>Howard</i> is that “an 
  expert cannot take into account facts that are not subject to his professional 
  expert assessment, as they are irrelevant to his expert assessment; <i>a fortiori</i>, 
  as injecting bias into the application of his expertise, he should not be told 
  of and asked to take into account such a fact that is corroborative of one of 
  the alternatives he is asked to scientifically determine”.  In <i>Howard</i>, 
  the defence expert was skilled in comparing shoe imprints.  He obviously had 
  no skill in evaluating the validity of a guilty plea and the facts read in to 
  support the plea.  The use of the escape plot evidence in this case is different.  
  The psychiatrists’ expertise extends to assessing the patient’s previous behaviour 
  and using that and other information to predict future behaviour.  It was well 
  within Dr. Ben-Aron’s expertise to determine the importance of the escape plot 
  information.  Had the trial judge found that the plot was not proven, this would 
  have impacted on the value of Dr. Ben-Aron’s ultimate opinion.  However, as 
  I have noted, the trial judge found that the essential elements of the plot 
  had been proven.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in admitting the escape 
  plot evidence and relying upon that evidence in concluding that the appellant 
  was a dangerous offender.  The evidence was also properly taken into account 
  by the trial judge in deciding that he should not exercise his discretion against 
  imposing an indeterminate sentence.  I can see no basis for interfering with 
  those decisions.  They are reasonably supported by the evidence: <i>R. v. Currie</i>, 
  [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260 at 279.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have set out in summary form the fresh evidence tendered by 
  the parties on this appeal.  The appellant submits that based on this evidence, 
  this court should set aside the dangerous offender finding and the indeterminate 
  sentence and designate the appellant as a long-term offender in accordance with 
  s. 759(3)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, or in the alternative order a new 
  hearing under s. 759(3)(a)(iii) at which the judge could consider whether an 
  order should be made that the appellant is a long-term offender.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The long-term offender provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  came into force in 1997 several years after the hearing before Humphrey J.  
  The submission that this court should find the appellant is a long-term offender 
  or order a new hearing to permit the judge to consider such a disposition thus 
  raises an important question as to whether these provisions should be given 
  retrospective effect.  Counsel for the appellant and the respondent made very 
  helpful submissions on this issue and provided us with most, if not all, the 
  cases that have dealt with the issue.  However, I need not decide that issue, 
  since I am satisfied that the fresh evidence does not provide a basis for this 
  court to find that the appellant should be declared a long-term offender or 
  order a new hearing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Under s. 759(3)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, on an appeal 
  against a finding that an offender is a dangerous offender, this court may “find 
  that the offender is not a dangerous offender, find that the offender is a long-term 
  offender” and impose a minimum sentence of imprisonment for two years and order 
  the offender to be supervised in the community for up to ten years.  Thus, it 
  is a prerequisite to this court exercising its jurisdiction that we find that 
  the offender is not a dangerous offender.  While this court was provided with 
  considerable evidence about the appellant’s progress, I cannot find that the 
  appellant is not a dangerous offender.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I am also not persuaded that this is a proper case to order a 
  new hearing so that the appellant can seek to establish he should be declared 
  a long-term offender.  Section 753.1 describes the prerequisites for a long-term 
  offender finding:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>753.1 (1) The court may, on application made under this Part following 
      the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find an offender 
      to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a) it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of 
      two years or more for the offence for which the offender has been convicted; 
      </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b) there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend; and</span></p>
    <p>(c) <u>there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk 
      in the community</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The important consideration for this case is the emphasized portion 
  that, “there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in 
  the community”.  The appellant has made some progress while in prison and the 
  proposed fresh evidence shows reason for greater optimism concerning the appellant’s 
  amenability to treatment than was the case at trial.  On the other hand, the 
  fresh evidence also tends to diminish the impact of the appellant's experience 
  as a victim on his ability to show empathy to his own victims.  Regrettably, 
  at this point the evidence also shows that the possibility that the appellant’s 
  behaviour can be controlled in the community is no more than speculative.  On 
  the basis of the extensive material placed before this court, I simply cannot 
  say, at this time, that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control 
  of the risk in the community.  Despite the appellant’s participation in several 
  programmes, he remains a moderately high to high risk to reoffend and commit 
  offences of extreme gravity.  Speculation is not a sufficient basis for setting 
  aside a dangerous offender finding that was fully supported by the evidence 
  at the time and almost six years later remains supported by the evidence.  In 
  summary, I am satisfied that there is not a realistic prospect of management 
  of the risk in the community, following the serving of a determinate custodial 
  sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In view of this conclusion, I need not consider the question 
  of interpretation of the relationship between the dangerous offender and long-term 
  offender provisions and whether the new provisions give the judge a discretion 
  not to make a finding that the accused is a dangerous offender because he or 
  she meets the long-term offender pre-requisites.  See <i>R. v. Payne</i>, [2001] 
  O.J. No.&nbsp;146 (S.C.J.); <i>R. v. Lyons</i> (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) 
  at 29; <i>R. v. Neve</i> (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Alta. C.A.) at 175-80.</p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.  I cannot conclude this 
  appeal without making these observations.  This is a tragic case for all concerned, 
  the many victims and the appellant.  The appellant was brutally treated as a 
  child and it should come as little surprise that he has emerged as a badly damaged 
  and dangerous individual.  Nevertheless, there is at least now some hope that 
  with time and appropriate treatment the appellant can be released.  These reasons 
  should not be read as a finding that the appellant can never be released.  To 
  the contrary, the members of the court were encouraged by the information that 
  after this appeal was adjourned the appellant was able to participate in intensive 
  treatment programmes and to make some progress.  However, the Parole Board will 
  be in the best position to decide when to release the appellant into the community.  
  Finally, I wish to thank counsel for their assistance in this case.</p>
