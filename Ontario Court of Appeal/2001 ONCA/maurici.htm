</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is an appeal from the judgment of
The Honourable Mr. Justice O’Connell in which he dismissed the appellant’s
application for an equalization of family assets and awarded her a lump sum
payment of $50,000 for spousal support. 
There were also orders relating to child support that are not in issue
in this appeal.  The respondent
cross-appeals the order for spousal support.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
his decision, the trial judge chronicled the lengthy matrimonial litigation
between these parties and presented a detailed outline of all prior litigation.
While it is not necessary for this court to recite the entire chronology,
certain of the important dates and events highlighted by the trial judge are
worth reproducing:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0 style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>[4] The parties
were married in 1960.  They have two
sons: Frank, born in 1961, and Paul, born in 1964.  Paul has Down’s Syndrome, and Mrs. Maurici continues to be his
primary caregiver.  The parties were
separated in 1978, and Mr. Maurici petitioned for divorce in 1981.  A <i>decree
nisi</i> was granted in October 1981.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[11] Mr. Maurici
commenced a petition for divorce in 1981, in which he acknowledged the 1978
child support order made by the Provincial Court.  The petition did not seek any corollary relief.  Mrs. Maurici did not file any answer or
counter-petition, nor did she request spousal support.  A <i>decree
nisi</i> was granted in October 1981 and the decree absolute was granted on
February 3, 1982.  The <i>decree nisi</i> was silent on the issue of
spousal support.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[12] In 1981,
Mrs. Maurici commenced a notice of application in which she requested, <i>inter alia</i>, spousal and child support,
and to vary the terms of the <i>decree nisi</i>.  On September 24, 1985, Pennell J. made an
order dismissing the <u>application for variation in child and spousal support.</u>
[emphasis added]</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[13] On October
22, 1985, McKinlay J. directed that the issues of child and spousal support be
directed to trial.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[14] In January
1987, Mrs. Maurici attempted to obtain spousal support by way of motion.  Campbell J. adjourned the file, including
the motion, concluding that it was “hopeless.”</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[17] Another application,
commenced in September 1990, was dismissed by Walsh J. on November 19,
1990.  Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Maurici
commenced two new proceedings, both of which involved claims for division of
property and other relief.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[18]  Coo. J. first heard all outstanding claims
in June 1991.  According to a transcript
of the motion argued on June 18, 1991, Mr. Justice Coo told Mrs. Maurici that
she was “going to have great difficulty” in making a claim for spousal support.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>[19] Coo J.
rendered final judgment on August 11, 1992. 
He dismissed all outstanding litigious processes that were before the
court, and ordered Mr. Maurici to make limited financial provisions for Paul
Maurici.  In his reasons for judgment,
Coo J. said that the equalization issue had long ago been dealt with by Dupont
J.  <u>On the issue of spousal support,
he stated that there was “no suggestion of any kind of change in circumstances
on which I would be prepared to rely in regard to issues of support for the
wife</u>.” [emphasis added]</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE0><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is also noteworthy that O’Connell
J. found that the respondent was less than forthcoming about his financial
circumstances and was neglectful in meeting the modest orders required of him
by the court.  This court made similar
findings about the respondent in its judgment of August 9, 1996 with respect to
non-compliance with orders made by Coo J.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></b></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>As indicated, the litigation has been
both lengthy and contentious and it is difficult to determine what disputes
were ultimately disposed of by the court. 
However, it is clear, as found by O’Connell J., that the claim for
equalization was disposed of and cannot be further litigated. The appeal is
therefore dismissed.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In terms of the cross-appeal related
to spousal support, the problem faced by O’Connell J. was to determine, if
possible, the judicial history of the protracted proceedings between the
appellant and the respondent which commenced over 20 years ago. O’Connell J. is
to be commended for his diligence in setting out the chronology of events,
since the file in this case has repeatedly been described as a “mess” by courts
below.  We are satisfied that he did the
best he could in preparing his chronology on the basis of the materials which
were in the record before him.  However,
it is apparent from his analysis of the appellant’s claim for spousal support
that he was uncertain whether he was dealing with a variation of a spousal
support order under s. 17 of the <i>Divorce
Act</i>, or whether he was dealing with an application for support under s.
15.2(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  Whether under s. 17 or s. 15.2(1), O’Connell
J. was satisfied on the evidence before him that the appellant was entitled to
lump sum spousal support in the amount of $50,000.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are in no better position than was
O’Connell J. as to the precise judicial history that preceded the application
which he decided. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the judicial
chronology developed by O’Connell J. and his inability to come to a finding in
respect to the determination of previous claims for spousal support made by the
appellant.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent has taken no issue with
the amount of spousal support awarded by O’Connell J., whether pursuant to s.
17 or s. 15.2(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  His only submission was that there was no
legal basis on which the award could be made. 
However the respondent was unable to provide any orders or judgement
that might clarify, or amplify the chronology developed by O’Connell J.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>We acknowledge that the circumstances
of this case are very unusual and that it is highly unlikely that there will be
other cases in which it is impossible for the parties to reconstruct the
judicial history of a case.  In light of
this observation, we are not prepared to interfere with the judgment of
O’Connell J. awarding spousal support.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the cross-appeal is also
dismissed.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
