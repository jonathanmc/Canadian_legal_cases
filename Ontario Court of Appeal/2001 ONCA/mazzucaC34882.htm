<p style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the orders of Justice Anne M. Molloy 
  dated April 17, 2000.</p>
<h3>CRONK J.A.:</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This appeal concerns 
  the jurisdiction of a court under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to permit 
  the amendment of a pleading, after expiry of a limitation period, to substitute 
  a corporate plaintiff for an individual plaintiff in an action framed in negligence 
  and involving claims for damages arising from a business premises fire.  Molloy 
  J. granted the motion to amend the pleading.  Silvercreek Pharmacy Limited (“Silvercreek”) 
  appeals.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Silvercreek’s principal 
  submission is that this is not a case of “misnomer” and, since the original 
  plaintiff allegedly had no cause of action, it was not open to the motions judge 
  to substitute the corporate plaintiff once the limitation period intervened.  
  To address the misnomer aspect of the appellant’s argument, it is necessary 
  to examine the facts in some detail.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On February 8, 1993, 
  a fire occurred at premises leased by Silvercreek.  The inventory of an adjacent 
  clothing and lingerie business was damaged by the fire.  On June 5, 1998, shortly 
  before expiry of the applicable six-year limitation period under the <i>Limitations 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, Elsa Mazzuca commenced proceedings against Silvercreek 
  for damages to inventory and for loss of income during a period of business 
  interruption, in the amount of $150,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The statement of claim 
  was served on Silvercreek in mid-June 1998. In mid-December 1998, the plaintiff 
  provided the defendant with a copy of a proof of loss form supported by an adjusters’ 
  inventory showing a total claim in the amount of $275,588.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In early January 1999, 
  prior to expiry of the limitation period, Silvercreek’s solicitor requested 
  receipt of copies of the plaintiff’s tax returns and financial statements for 
  the six years prior to the fire.  Examinations for discovery were scheduled 
  for August 27 and September 1, 1999.  On the day prior to the commencement of 
  the discoveries and more than six months after expiration of the limitation 
  period, financial statements for a company known as “La Gondola Ladies Boutique 
  and Lingerie Ltd.” (“La Gondola Ltd.”) were produced to Silvercreek’s solicitor.  
  Financial statements for the named plaintiff, Elsa Mazzuca, were not provided.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> During the discoveries, 
  it emerged that the proper principal claimant for the damages sustained in the 
  fire was La Gondola Ltd. and not Elsa Mazzuca in her personal capacity.  It 
  was also confirmed that La Gondola Ltd. owned the store that operated the clothing 
  and lingerie business. Elsa Mazzuca was the sole shareholder, director and officer 
  of La Gondola Ltd.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Silvercreek was involved 
  in several actions arising out of the fire and was aware of heat and smoke damage 
  caused to other businesses or tenants in the area.  The fire loss was investigated 
  by Silvercreek’s insurer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The operative policy 
  of insurance relating to the clothing and lingerie business, issued by State 
  Farm Fire and Casualty Company (“State Farm”), referred to “Mazzuca, Elsa [doing 
  business as] La Gondola Ladies Boutique and Lingerie” as the named insured.  
  No reference was made in the insurance policy to an incorporated entity.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Three proof of loss 
  forms were prepared.  Two of the forms referred to the business as “Elsa Mazzuca 
  [doing business as] La Gondola Ladies Boutique and Lingerie”.  The third form 
  identified the named insured only as “Elsa Mazzuca”.   All three forms were 
  signed by Elsa Mazzuca.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Business records existing prior to or generated in consequence of the 
  fire, and documents created for the purpose of establishing the losses occasioned 
  by the fire, referred variously to “Elsa Mazzuca”, “Elsa Mazzuca, [doing business 
  as] La Gondola Ladies Boutique and Lingerie” or La Gondola Ltd.  An accounting 
  report in relation to the fire damage, obtained on behalf of State Farm, referenced 
  the claimant as “Elsa Mazzuca, [doing business as] La Gondola Ladies Boutique 
  and Lingerie Ltd.”  A second report, by adjusters commissioned by Ms. Mazzuca, 
  made no reference to an incorporated entity.  Various cheques issued by the 
  business identified either La Gondola Ltd. or “La Gondola Ladies Boutique” as 
  the account holder.  Cheques issued by State Farm in respect of the claim were 
  payable to “Elsa Mazzuca”.  Invoices from various suppliers to the business 
  were issued under one of several names, including “La Gondola Boutique” and 
  “La Gondola”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As part of an office move in 1995, two years after the fire and three 
  years before the statement of claim was issued, the accountants for the clothing 
  and lingerie business shredded various tax returns, financial statements and 
  supporting documents relating to the business.  Subsequently, financial statements 
  and tax returns relating to La Gondola Ltd. were located and provided to Silvercreek; 
  however, the source documents used to prepare the financial statements were 
  no longer available due to their earlier destruction.   There was no evidence 
  on the record suggesting that this destruction of records occurred other than 
  in the normal course of business.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to the evidence of Ms. Mazzuca’s solicitor, he had no knowledge 
  that Ms. Mazzuca had incorporated the clothing and lingerie business, and was 
  no longer operating it as a sole proprietorship, until after Ms. Mazzuca’s examination 
  for discovery in the fall of 1999.  While he acknowledged receipt of the relevant 
  policy of insurance, the various proof of loss forms and the adjusters’ report 
  commissioned by Ms.&nbsp;Mazzuca, these documents did not indicate that the 
  business was conducted through an incorporated entity.  Upon his receipt of 
  the file in 1994, he also received a copy of the accounting report prepared 
  on behalf of the insurer which did make reference to Elsa Mazzuca doing business 
  as “La Gondola Ltd”.  The file also contained some cheques which showed the 
  incorporated entity as the account holder.  He did not receive any of the financial 
  statements for La Gondola Ltd. prior to the discoveries.</p>
<h3>THE DECISION UNDER APPEAL </h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On February 1, 2000, following her examination for discovery the previous 
  fall, the plaintiff brought a motion seeking an order permitting her to amend 
  the statement of claim to substitute La Gondola Ltd. as the named plaintiff, 
  in her stead.  Silvercreek brought a cross-motion in late March 2000 seeking 
  an order dismissing the plaintiff’s claim, in the event that she was unsuccessful 
  in obtaining an order permitting the requested amendment, on the basis that 
  Ms. Mazzuca had no cause of action against Silvercreek in her personal capacity.  
  The motions judge granted the plaintiff’s motion.  In consequence, the premise 
  of Silvercreek’s cross-motion disappeared.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge concluded that the error in naming Ms. Mazzuca as 
  the original plaintiff was a misnomer, Silvercreek had not been misled as to 
  the nature of the claim being advanced against it, and it would not be prejudiced 
  by an amendment to correct a simple error by counsel. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Silvercreek argued before the motions judge that it would be significantly 
  prejudiced by the requested amendment because of the destruction in 1995 of 
  various records of the clothing and lingerie business.  In particular, Silvercreek 
  argued that the destroyed records would be useful to it because the value ascribed 
  to the business inventory in the financial statements of La Gondola Ltd. was 
  significantly lower than the value placed on the inventory by independent adjusters 
  shortly after the fire.  In disposing of this argument, the motions judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I accept that the destruction of those documents might give rise to prejudice.  
      However, it is prejudice which arose in 1995, prior to the expiration of 
      the limitation period.  Therefore, if the action had been commenced in 1998 
      by La Gondola (rather than by Ms. Mazzuca), the defendant would be in precisely 
      the same position with respect to those documents as it is now.  The prejudice 
      contemplated by the Rules is one arising from the amendment sought: <i>Hanlan 
      v. Sernesky</i> (1996), 39 C.C.L.I. (2d) 107 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Lambkin v. 
      Chapeskie</i> (1983), 37 C.P.C. 158 (Ont. Co. Ct.).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this appeal Silvercreek advanced various arguments in opposition 
  to the requested amendment.  It asserted that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (i)         Rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) are procedural in nature, and cannot 
      be interpreted to deprive a litigant of a statutorily conferred right in 
      the nature of a limitation defence;</p>
    <p> (ii)       the proper characterization of the error in this case was not 
      “misnomer”, in the sense of a misnaming of the right party, but rather, 
      was a mistake of naming the wrong party;</p>
    <p> (iii)      the decision of this court in <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd. 
      et al. v. Price et al.</i> (1974), 1 O.R. (2d) 501 (C.A.) was binding on 
      the motions judge and required denial of the amendment.  In reliance on 
      this case, Silvercreek argued that no substitution of a plaintiff may be 
      made where the originally named plaintiff had no cause of action against 
      the defendant, and must be denied where non-compensable prejudice is made 
      out; and</p>
    <p> (iv)       in any event, no such amendment may be made after expiry of 
      a limitation period unless the moving party establishes the existence of 
      “special circumstances” warranting the amendment, which were not made out 
      in this case.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I turn now to consideration of these assertions.</p>
<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As noted, the action in this case is framed in negligence.  It is common 
  ground between the parties that a six-year limitation period applies.  Accordingly, 
  as the fire occurred in early February 1993, the limitation period expired in 
  February 1999.  The statement of claim, naming the wrong plaintiff, was issued 
  in June 1998, more than seven months prior to expiry of the limitation period.  
  The motion to amend the statement of claim was brought five months after discovery 
  of the error, and more than one year after expiry of the limitation period.  
  The issue thus arises whether the amendment should be permitted, notwithstanding 
  the expiration of the limitation period, in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><b>(1)            <u>The Framework of the Rules</u></b></h3>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This issue requires consideration of rules 26.01, 5.04(2) and 1.04(1) 
  of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended, and 
  related jurisprudence.  Rule 26.01, in its current form, was introduced in 1984.  
  It provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>26.01  On motion at any stage of an action the court shall grant leave 
      to amend a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result 
      that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The mandatory character of Rule 26.01 has been recognized on numerous 
  occasions (see, for example, <i>Barker v. Furlotte et al.</i> (1985), 12 O.A.C. 
  76 (Div. Ct.)), as has the reality that a Rule 26.01 motion necessarily requires 
  a balancing to give effect to the purposes of statutory limitation periods and, 
  at the same time, to the purposes underlying the power of amendment.  A useful 
  articulation of this balancing exercise was provided by Bayda C.J.S. of the 
  Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>G. &amp; R. Trucking Ltd. v. Walbaum</i>, 
  [1983] 2 W.W.R. 622 in connection with a similar, although not identical, rule 
  in that province.  He stated at 635-636:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…The purpose behind the power of the amendment is to correct an injustice 
      that would otherwise ensue as a result of a mistake, often of an informational 
      or procedural nature, and usually made unwittingly and not by the person 
      most likely to suffer, that is, the litigant.  The English courts have adopted 
      a conservative, strict, constructionist approach, placing emphasis on the 
      limitation periods.  The Canadian courts, on the other hand – particularly 
      as demonstrated in the more recent cases – have sought to balance the two 
      principles of law involved here and have perhaps adopted a more evenhanded 
      approach.  In so doing, they have been more lenient in allowing amendments 
      where no <u>real</u> prejudice resulted to the opposite party (apart from 
      the right to rely on the statute of limitations), but at the same time, 
      have been careful not to unfairly attenuate the exacting force of the limitation 
      periods.  That approach, in my respectful view, is the right one.</p>

  Monnin C.J.M. at 677.)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although reference to Rule 26.01 was made by counsel for both parties 
  on this appeal, emphasis was placed on subrule 5.04(2) which specifically provides 
  for the addition, deletion or substitution of parties in defined circumstances:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>5.04(2)  At any stage of a proceeding the court may by order add, delete 
      or substitute a party or correct the name of a party incorrectly named, 
      on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not 
      be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, subrule 1.04(1) provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.04 (1)  These rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, 
      most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding 
      on its merits.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The rule of interpretation established by subrule 1.04(1) provides the 
  basis for a proper construction of all the other rules.  In my view, the combined 
  effect of Rules 26.01, 5.04(2) and 1.04(1), generally, is to focus the analysis 
  on the issue of non-compensable prejudice, in the wider context of the requirement 
  that a liberal construction be placed on the rules to advance the interests 
  of timely and cost effective justice in civil disputes.</p>

  </span> Under both rules, a pleadings amendment is not to be made if non-compensable 
  prejudice would result.  In contrast to Rule 26.01, however, the language of 
  subrule 5.04(2) imports a discretionary power rather than a mandatory direction.  
  The inter-relationship of the two rules is described in Holmested and Watson, 
  <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i>, Volume 2 (Carswell: 1993), at 5-34 to 5-35:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[Subrule 5.04(2)] is part and parcel of the court’s broad power of amendment.  
      The general power is found in rule 26.01.  The relationship between rule 
      26.01 and rule 5.04(2) and the breadth of the amendment power was dealt 
      with in <i>Seaway Trust Co. v. Markle</i> (1988), 25 C.P.C. (2d) 64 (Ont. 
      Master), affirmed (1990), 40 C.P.C. (2d) 4 (Ont. H.C.) (<i>The same threshold 
      test applies to a motion to amend under either rule 26.01 or rule 5.04(2) 
      and the moving party must demonstrate that no prejudice would result from 
      the amendment that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment; 
      once this threshold test is met, under rule 26.01 the granting of leave 
      is mandatory; however, where it is sought to add parties under rule 5.04(2)  
      the court has a discretion whether to allow the amendment, notwithstanding 
      that the threshold test is satisfied; the discretion is to ensure procedural 
      fairness</i> and consideration has to be given to such matters as the state 
      of the action, whether the trial is imminent, whether examinations for discovery 
      of all parties have already been held, whether it would be a proper joinder 
      of a new cause of action, whether the purpose in adding a party defendant 
      was improper (such as simply to obtain discovery of the party added), whether 
      the proposed added party was a necessary or proper party, and whether a 
      variety of special rules were observed such as those respecting class actions, 
      representation orders, trade unions, assignees, insurance, trustees, infants, 
      persons under disability, <i>amicus curiae</i>, accrual of the cause of 
      action and limitations).</p>
    <p><i>Rule 5.04(2) is subject to common law restrictions regarding adding 
      parties after the expiry of a limitation period.  However, it is frequently 
      possible to add parties after expiry if there are “special circumstances” 
      as discussed in Basarsky v. Quinlan</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 380 (S.C.C.), or 
      if the requirements of s. 2(8) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> are met in cases 
      governed by that statute (e.g. <i>Gatterbauer v. Ballast Holdings Ltd.</i> 
      (1986), 9 C.P.C. (2d) 273 (Ont. Div. Ct.))…. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> As suggested in this passage, the amendment authority under both rules 
  is restricted in application to those cases where the prejudice to be occasioned 
  by the amendment is compensable.  The difference in language between the two 
  rules, however, suggests that the drafters of the rules intended to preserve 
  for the courts under subrule 5.04(2) a discretion to permit or deny amendments 
  relating to a change of parties, while the authority under Rule 26.01 was to 
  be further constrained by the language of mandatory direction.  It must be assumed, 
  in my view, that this distinction was purposive.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>  That this is so, is confirmed by examination of the development 
  of the two rules.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Former Rule 132, the predecessor rule to current Rule 26.01, was discretionary 
  in nature.  It provided that an amendment “may be made by leave of the court, 
  or of the judge at the trial, …”.  In contrast, upon introduction in 1984, Rule 
  26.01 provided that leave shall be granted to amend a pleading unless non-compensable 
  prejudice would result.  The mandatory language of Rule 26.01 thus signalled 
  a change in the general approach to pleading amendments and narrowed the broad 
  discretion previously afforded the courts regarding amendment requests.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The predecessor rule to subrule 5.04(2) similarly was discretionary 
  in nature.  Former subrule 136(1) provided:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>136(1) The court may, at any stage of the proceedings, order that the name 
      of a plaintiff or defendant improperly joined be struck out, and that any 
      person who ought to have been joined, or whose presence is necessary in 
      order to enable the court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon 
      the questions involved in the action, be added or, where an action has through 
      a bona fide mistake been commenced in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff 
      or where it is doubtful whether it has been commenced in the name of the 
      right plaintiff, the court may order any person to be substituted or added 
      as plaintiff.</p>

  </span> In 1980, the Civil Procedure Revision Committee, chaired by the late 
  Walter B. Williston, Q.C., reported on proposed comprehensive changes to the 
  rules and recommended that a new rule concerning misjoinder and non-joinder 
  specifically require that leave be given, on such terms as might seen just, 
  when leave to add, delete or substitute a party was sought, unless non-compensable 
  prejudice would result.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  The proposed rule 
  ultimately became subrule 5.04(2).  When the new rules were introduced in 1984, 
  including Rule 26.01, this recommendation was not acted upon and, in contrast 
  to Rule 26.01, new subrule 5.04(2) was not expressed in mandatory terms.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In these circumstances, having regard to the legislative history of 
  Rules 26.01 and 5.04(2), I conclude that in motions under subrule 5.04(2) the 
  courts do retain a discretion to deny an amendment in a proper case, even in 
  the absence of non-compensable prejudice, when it is sought to change the parties 
  to a proceeding.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As observed by Holmested and Watson, <i>supra</i>, the caselaw reveals 
  numerous instances in which the rules have been utilized in “special circumstances” 
  to permit a change of parties to a proceeding after the expiry of a limitation 
  period.  At common law, it has long been settled that in special circumstances 
  pleading amendments may be permitted by the courts notwithstanding the intervention 
  of a limitation period.  This possibility was recognized in the early case of 
  <i>Weldon v. Neal</i> (1887), 19 Q.B.D. 394 and subsequent jurisprudence.  In 
  an oft-quoted passage from that case, Lord Esher, M.R. stated at 395:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We must act on the settled rule of practice, which is that amendments are 
      not admissible when they prejudice the rights of the opposite party as existing 
      at the date of such amendments.  If an amendment were allowed setting up 
      a cause of action, which, if the writ were issued in respect thereof at 
      the date of the amendment, would be barred by the Statute of Limitations, 
      it would be allowing the plaintiff to take advantage of her former writ 
      to defeat the statute and taking away an existing right from the defendant, 
      a proceeding which, as a general rule, would be, in my opinion, improper 
      and unjust.  <i>Under very peculiar circumstances the Court might perhaps 
      have power to allow such an amendment, but certainly as a general rule it 
      will not do so.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, as a general rule, amendments to pleadings which had the effect 
  of relieving against a limitation period, were not allowed.  This did not mean, 
  however, that in every case such amendments were to be denied.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The exception to the general rule, which contemplated the allowing of 
  an amendment in a proper case notwithstanding the intervention of a limitation 
  period, was expressly recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Basarsky 
  v. Quinlan, supra,</i> in which Hall J. observed at 385:  “The adjective ‘peculiar’ 
  in the context of Lord Esher, M.R.’s judgment and at the date thereof may be 
  equated with ‘special’ in current usage”.  This decision, and the undertaking 
  of a special circumstances analysis, have been followed in numerous subsequent 
  cases.  In some instances this has occurred in the context of the operation 
  of particular limitation periods where special considerations may apply, or 
  legislative regimes which expressly provide for the extension of time periods 
  established by statute.  In other cases, the analysis of special circumstances 
  has been undertaken when a change of parties is sought, as a discretionary matter, 
  under the rules.</p>

  </span> In <i>Swain Estate v. Lake of the Woods Hospital</i> (1992), 9 O.R. 
  (3d) 74 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1993), 
  19 C.P.C. (3d) 25 (note) (S.C.C.),  this court considered an amendment request 
  to add two defendants after expiry of the relevant limitation period in a negligence 
  action in which damages were claimed for the death of a 14-year-old patient 
  in a hospital.  The case turned on consideration of s.&nbsp;47 of the <i>Limitations 
  Act, supra</i>, and ss. 38 and 17, respectively, of the <i>Trustee Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1980, c. 512 (now R.S.O. 1990, c. T. 23) and the <i>Health Disciplines 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 196, and did not involve the interpretation or application 
  of Rules 26.01 and 5.04(2).  In that case, the estate of the deceased patient 
  sued the hospital for damages through her administrators, and various family 
  members sought to advance derivative claims under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, 
  1986, S.O. 1986, c. 4 (now R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3).  The requested amendment, which 
  sought to add two physicians as defendants, was held to be statute-barred, but 
  was permitted in any event because of the existence of special circumstances 
  and the absence of prejudice.  Arbour J.A., for the court, concluded that in 
  special circumstances the court has a discretion to permit an amendment to add 
  defendants notwithstanding the expiry of a limitation period.   </p>

  725 (C.A.), in which this court considered the particular regime set out under 
  the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 152 for extension of limitation 
  periods to permit dependants’ relief claims, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. stated with 
  reference to “special circumstances” at 729&#8209;30:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A number of courts have made rather heavy weather out of the meaning of 
      “special circumstances” and have sought to establish conditions or detailed 
      guide-lines for the granting of relief after the expiry of the limitation 
      period.  This is a discretionary matter where the facts of the individual 
      case are the most important consideration in the exercise of that discretion.  
      While it is true that the discretion is not one that is to be exercised 
      at the will or caprice of the court, it is possible to outline only general 
      guide-lines to cover the myriad of factual situations that may arise.</p>

  </span> In <i>Swain Estate v. Lake of the Woods Hospital, supra</i>, various 
  special circumstances were held to apply which, viewed cumulatively, supported 
  the plaintiff’s entitlement to the pleadings amendment.  Arbour J.A. distinguished 
  between cases in which the circumstances fully explained the failure by the 
  plaintiff’s solicitors to sue earlier the parties sought to be added by the 
  amendment, from cases in which the evidence suggested that a deliberate decision 
  had been made by the plaintiff’s solicitors not to sue the parties subsequently 
  sought to be added.  In the first category of case, the establishment of such 
  circumstances would justify a late amendment of the pleadings in contrast to 
  cases in the latter category, where an amendment would be denied.  This approach 
  is consistent with earlier judicial decisions.  (See, for example, <i>London 
  (City) Commissioners of Police v. Western Freight Lines Ltd., </i>[1962] O.R. 
  948 (C.A.),  which held that the suggestion of a simple error or misnomer, as 
  explanation for the failure to name the proper party in the first instance, 
  was defeated in the face of evidence of a deliberate selection by the plaintiff’s 
  solicitors among potential defendants at the time of the commencement of the 
  proceedings.)</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision in <i>Swain Estate v. Lake of the Woods Hospital, supra</i>, 
  confirms that where a change of parties to a proceeding is sought, amendment 
  requests are to be assessed with regard both to evidence of actual prejudice 
  to the party opposing the amendment and in light of any special circumstances 
  which may justify the amendment.  The absence of the former will not establish 
  the latter.  Further, while neither factor alone will be determinative, taken 
  together these features will dictate a principled outcome.  Arbour J.A. stated 
  at 85:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the present case, the existence of the third party claim against the 
      doctors has provided them with enough notice and exposure to remove any 
      significant prejudice.  The doctors have filed a statement of defence to 
      the third party claim, as well as a statement of defence to the statement 
      of claim of the plaintiffs.  In the special circumstances of this case, 
      it would be a vindication of form over substance to allow the doctors to 
      defend without being defendants.  I wish to stress that no single factor, 
      neither the lack of real prejudice nor any one of the special circumstances 
      of this case, would have in itself sufficed to displace the defendants’ 
      entitlement to rely on the limitation period. However, considering all the 
      circumstances, I think that this is a case where the interests of justice 
      are better served by allowing the amendment.</p>

  </span> In the subsequent case of <i>Swiderski et al. v. Broy Engineering Ltd. 
  et al</i>. (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 594 (Div. Ct.), Adams J. expressed the relationship 
  between the absence of proof of prejudice and the establishment of special circumstances, 
  in the following terms  at 601:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the facts at hand, Justice O’Brien has noted the candid admission of 
      the defendant’s counsel that he cannot claim to be prejudiced despite the 
      statement of MacKinnon A.C.J.O. in <i>Deaville v. Boegeman</i> … that prejudice 
      may be presumed.  Nevertheless, in <i>Swain</i> the Court of Appeal did 
      not equate the absence of prejudice with the presence of special circumstances.  
      Rather, both features are generally required although they may overlap in 
      certain respects.  There is no automatic right to an amendment simply because 
      the respondent cannot establish prejudice.  Were it otherwise, the expiration 
      of a limitation period would never have any reliable consequence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the present case, the motions judge stated as follows with respect 
  to the requirement of “special circumstances”:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The courts have refused to add parties to an action after the expiry 
      of a limitation period unless “special circumstances” are shown:  <i>Swain 
      Estates v. Lake of the Woods, supra</i>; <i>Swiderski v. Broy, supra</i>; 
      <i>Knudsen v. Holmes</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 160 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).  
      However, the same considerations do not apply to a person who was formally 
      put on notice of a claim and made a party to an action within the limitation 
      period.  <i>In my opinion, it is not necessary to show special circumstances 
      in order to substitute a plaintiff for an existing plaintiff when no prejudice 
      is caused by the amendment</i>.  However, if special circumstances are required, 
      they exist in this case.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To the extent that this conclusion suggests, in the absence of proof 
  of actual prejudice to a defendant, that generally it will be less difficult 
  to substitute or add a new plaintiff for an originally named plaintiff than 
  might be the case with respect to the addition of a new or different defendant, 
  I agree.  However, I respectfully do not agree that proof of special circumstances 
  will never be required absent proof of prejudice when it is sought under subrule 
  5.04(2) to add or substitute a new plaintiff.  In my view, subrule 5.04(2) contemplates 
  that the existence or absence of special circumstances warranting the amendment 
  should be considered as one of the factors to be taken into account in determining 
  whether a discretionary amendment is to be permitted or denied after expiry 
  of a relevant limitation period.  There may well be circumstances where, by 
  virtue of the original plaintiff’s conduct or the demonstrated knowledge of 
  counsel at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, an amendment under 
  subrule 5.04(2) should be denied.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The established principles concerning Rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) confirm 
  the continuing importance, as a base consideration, of the issue of actual prejudice 
  in determining applications to amend pleadings, including those designed to 
  add, delete or substitute parties, after the expiry of a limitation period.  
  The centrality of this issue is also confirmed by the express language of Rules 
  26.01 and 5.04(2) in their current form. Both the related jurisprudence and 
  the rules themselves thus underscore a simple, common sense proposition:  that 
  a party to litigation is not to be taken by surprise or prejudiced in non-compensable 
  ways by late, material amendments after the expiry of a limitation period.  
  If such surprise or actual prejudice is demonstrated on the record, an amendment 
  generally will be denied.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the same time, proof of the absence of prejudice will not guarantee 
  an amendment.  Rather, when a change of parties is sought after the expiry of 
  a limitation period, the circumstances of all affected parties should be examined 
  to determine, on the facts of the individual case, whether sufficient special 
  circumstances are present to support the requested amendment.  In those cases 
  where leave is sought to add, delete or substitute a new party, the examination 
  of special circumstances involves consideration of the knowledge of both the 
  moving party and her agents at the time of the commencement of the proceedings 
  regarding the proper parties to be named and of the opposing party in relation 
  to the nature of the true claim intended to be advanced.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One of the arguments made by Silvercreek raises a threshold issue.  
  This concerns the suggestion that the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> are procedural 
  in nature and cannot be interpreted to displace a limitation period defence 
  conferred by statute.  If this is so, it would dispose of this appeal.  However, 
  this argument may be dealt with summarily because, in my opinion, the proposition 
  conflicts with the approach followed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Basarsky 
  v. Quinlan, supra</i>, and with that court’s decision in <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth</i>, 
  [1974] S.C.R. 1111, discussed in the reasons which follow.  Accordingly, it 
  is not well founded, and I reject it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I note also that in Ontario, in addition to the common law, the Civil 
  Rules Committee is authorized by s. 66 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, to make rules for the Court of Appeal and the Superior 
  Court of Justice in relation to the practice and procedure of those courts in 
  all civil proceedings even though such rules may alter the substantive law.  
  Further, under s. 66(3), while such rules cannot conflict with a statute, they 
  may supplement the provisions of a statute in respect of  practice and procedure.  
  The joinder of claims and parties, and pleadings, are among the specifically 
  enumerated subjects in relation to which the Committee may make such rules.  
  These provisions provide authority for Rules 26.01, 5.04(2) and 1.04.  The entirety 
  of the rules are embodied in regulation form.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, it is permissible at law for the rules to provide for the 
  addition, deletion or substitution of parties to a proceeding and the circumstances 
  under which such a change of parties is to be permitted.</p>

  The Concept of Misnomer</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Silvercreek also asserted that the error in this case was not “misnomer”, 
  in the sense of a misnaming of the right party.  For this reason, it argued 
  that the requested amendment could not be permitted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As noted, subrule 5.04(2) provides, in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>At any stage of a proceeding the court may by order … correct the name 
      of a party incorrectly named, …</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This language addresses misnomer situations and, in the absence of non-compensable 
  prejudice, permits an amendment where it was intended to commence proceedings 
  in one name but, in error, the proceedings were commenced in another name.  
  Similarly, this aspect of the subrule may apply in situations where the plaintiff 
  intended to sue one person but, in error, sued the wrong person.  Such cases 
  reflect an irregularity in the nature of a misnomer, which may be relieved against 
  in proper circumstances.</p>

  </span> This is not a case of misnomer in the narrow sense of a misdescription 
  of the person suing, but rather, is a case of mistake as to the identity of 
  the person who should have brought suit.  However, that does not end the matter.  
  Properly characterized, the motion in this case sought to delete one party to 
  the action and to substitute another.  An amendment request for this purpose 
  engages a different aspect of subrule 5.04(2) which need not depend for success 
  on proof of a misnomer in the nature of a misdescription of a party.  Stated 
  differently, the power conferred under subrule 5.04(2) to amend a pleading to 
  change parties is not confined to misnomers of the misdescription type.  It 
  extends to the power to substitute parties and, as well, to correct in proper 
  cases the naming of a party by mistake.  Silvercreek’s argument on this ground, 
  therefore, must fail.</p>

  The Decision in <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd.</i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Silvercreek relied upon many cases decided prior to the introduction 
  in 1984 of the mandatory language of Rule 26.01.  Such cases must be regarded 
  with caution, as they were decided in a different context, when an exclusively 
  discretionary approach to pre-trial amendments governed the balancing exercise 
  made necessary when a pleadings amendment was sought after the expiry of a limitation 
  period.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As noted, Silvercreek argued that the decision of this court in <i>W.J. 
  Realty Management Ltd., supra</i>, was dispositive of the plaintiff’s motion, 
  so as to deny amendment of the statement of claim.  That case involved a small 
  claims court action for damages for breach of a lease commenced in the name 
  of the corporate manager of the affected property, rather than in the name of 
  the corporate landlord.  The relevant section of the <i>Small Claims Court Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1970, c. 439, provided for the addition or substitution of a plaintiff, 
  on a discretionary basis, where the wrong person had mistakenly been named as 
  a plaintiff.  Relying on the earlier cases of <i>Colville v. Small </i>(1910), 
  22 O.L.R. 426 (Div. Ct.) and <i>Croll v. Greenhow </i>(1930), 38 O.W.N. 101 
  (C.A.), among others, the court held that where the original plaintiff had no 
  cause of action, a new plaintiff who was alleged to have a cause of action could 
  not be substituted for the original plaintiff after expiry of a limitation period.  
  Similar results obtained in <i>Turgeon et al. v. Border Supply (EMO) Ltd</i>. 
  (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 43 (Div. Ct.) and in the more recent case of <i>T.K. Group 
  and Associates v. Wolfe et al</i>. (1998), 21 C.P.C. (4th) 366 (Ont. Gen. Div.), 
  which followed the decision in <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd., supra</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In a second line of cases, also developed prior to 1984, the courts 
  emphasized the facts known to the plaintiff, or counsel, at the time of the 
  commencement of the proceedings to determine whether the naming of the incorrect 
  plaintiff was the product of deliberate choice or simple, innocent error.  In 
  the latter event, the mistake was characterized as a “misnomer” and an amendment 
  was generally allowed.  (See <i>London (City) Commissioners of Police v. Western 
  Freight Lines</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Bank of Montreal v. Ricketts et al</i>. 
  (1990), 44 B.C.L.R. (2d) 95 (B.C.C.A.)).</p>

  </span> Thus, in <i>Dill v. Alves</i>, [1968] 1 O.R. 58 (C.A.), proceedings 
  were commenced in the name of the operator of a motor vehicle who had not suffered 
  any injuries as a result of an accident, rather than in the name of the operator’s 
  father who was actually the injured party.  In permitting the requested amendment 
  to allow substitution of the name of the operator’s father as plaintiff, this 
  court set out the relevant test at 59:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The test is whether or not the naming of the plaintiff in the writ and 
      proceedings which are sought to be amended was a misnomer.  Clearly on the 
      facts here we think it was a misnomer.  That it was such and that it was 
      treated as such is clearly indicated we think, by the conduct of the defendant 
      who knew that no claim was being advanced by the son whose name appears 
      in the writ, who negotiated with respect to the injuries of the father, 
      the injured party, and who, knowing that the named plaintiff had no claim, 
      paid into Court moneys with the defence to answer in reality the claims 
      for injury of the father.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> No issue concerning the father’s status to sue, or the existence of 
  a cause of action personal to him, was considered.  Instead, the lack of prejudice 
  to the defendant to be occasioned by the amendment and the evidence establishing 
  that the defendant had not been misled by the error, governed the outcome.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This approach was followed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Ladouceur 
  v. Howarth, supra</i>, a negligence action similar on the facts to those in 
  <i>Dill v. Alves, supra</i>, in which proceedings were commenced in the name 
  of the father, the owner and operator of a motor vehicle who had not sustained 
  injuries in the relevant accident, rather than in the name of the injured son 
  who had been a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the accident.  Once again, 
  the analysis centred on the knowledge of both the named plaintiff’s solicitor 
  and the defendant concerning the identity of the proper claimant.  The record 
  established that the plaintiff’s solicitor knew that he did not act for the 
  father and that the son alone had sustained personal injuries.  The defendant’s 
  insurer, with whom the plaintiff’s solicitor had been dealing, also knew this 
  and continued to negotiate for a compromise of the claim notwithstanding the 
  failure to name the son as the original plaintiff.  In reliance on the test 
  propounded in <i>Dill v. Alves, supra</i>, the court concluded that the case 
  was a typical example of a misnomer and the defendant had not been misled by 
  the error.  In the result, the amendment was allowed under then subrule 136(1) 
  (now subrule 5.04(2)), after expiry of the applicable limitation period although 
  the originally named plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the case on appeal, the motions judge considered this caselaw and 
  concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the case before me, <i>the action was mistakenly brought in the name 
      of Ms. Mazzuca</i>.  This is not a situation in which a conscious decision 
      was made to sue in her name rather than in the name of her company, La Gondola 
      [Ltd.].  <i>It was simply an error</i>.  Counsel always intended, and indeed 
      was instructed, to bring the action to recover damages sustained to the 
      business.  <i>The defendant always understood that it was the owner of the 
      business who was suing for damages and defended on that basis.  Correcting 
      the misnomer has no impact on the defendant.  There is no new cause of action 
      being asserted and no new facts are alleged</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with these conclusions by the motions judge.  In my opinion, 
  she considered and properly applied the governing principles in her assessment 
  of these issues.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge also correctly pointed out that the court in <i>T.K. 
  Group and Associates v. Wolfe, supra</i>, does not appear to have been directed 
  to the binding decisions in <i>Dill v. Alves, supra</i>, and <i>Ladouceur v. 
  Howarth, supra</i>.  To this I would add that <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth</i>, <i>supra</i>, 
  although decided some months prior to <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd., supra</i>, 
  was not reported until the following year.  Perhaps for this reason, it was 
  not considered in the latter case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To the extent that <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd., supra</i>, established 
  the principle that a new plaintiff, with a proper cause of action, can never 
  be substituted following expiry of a limitation period for an originally named 
  plaintiff who had no cause of action against the defendant, I conclude that 
  the case and those which subsequently followed it were implicitly overruled 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth, supra</i>.  It follows 
  that Silvercreek’s assertion that the former case was dispositive of the plaintiff’s 
  motion to amend, is not sustainable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Of continuing interest, however, is the focus in many of these cases 
  on the issue of proof of actual prejudice to the party opposing the amendment.  
  The issue of prejudice to be occasioned by the amendment sought, and the question 
  whether the defendant was misled by an error in the naming of the original plaintiff, 
  drove the decisions in both <i>Dill v. Alves, supra </i>and <i>Ladouceur v. 
  Howarth, supra</i>.  The same theme dominated the analysis in <i>T.K. Group 
  and Associates v. Wolfe, supra</i>.  In this important sense, there is no inconsistency 
  in the judicial reasoning in these cases.  As indicated by Spence J. in <i>Ladouceur 
  v. Howarth, supra, </i>at 1116, referring to the 1950 decision in <i>Williamson 
  et al. v. Headley</i>, [1950] O.W.N. 185 and quoting Middleton J. in a still 
  earlier case, it has long been recognized that the prime principle in dealing 
  with irregularities in a style of cause (or, in the current terminology, a style 
  of proceedings) concerns evidence, or lack thereof, of prejudice:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The general principle underlying all the cases is that the court should 
      amend, where the opposite party has not been misled, or substantially injured 
      by the error.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  by subrule 5.04(2).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cases decided since 1984 have continued to affirm the base requirement 
  of proof of prejudice to support the denial of amendments.  Where the evidence 
  establishes that the party to be affected by the amendment has not been misled, 
  and will not suffer non-compensable prejudice other than that occasioned by 
  the inability to rely on the limitation defence, amendments to pleadings have 
  been permitted following the expiry of limitation periods, including amendments 
  designed to add, delete or substitute plaintiffs or defendants.   (See <i>Carachi 
  v. World Cheque Control Inc.</i> (1986), 12 C.P.C. (2d) 43 (Ont. Dis. Ct.); 
  <i>Swain Estate v. Lake of the Woods Hospital, supra</i>; <i>Kings Gate Developments 
  Inc. v. Colangelo</i> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 841 (C.A.); and <i>Hanlan v. Sernesky,

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Many of the cases also emphasize, even absent proof of prejudice to 
  the party to be affected by the amendment, the requirement that the applicant 
  establish special circumstances to support the amendment sought and to displace 
  the opposing party’s entitlement to rely upon a limitation period established 
  by statute.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having found that the decision in <i>W.J. Realty Management Ltd., supra</i>, 
  does not determine the plaintiff’s entitlement in this case to the amendment 
  sought, it remains necessary to address the issues of prejudice and special 
  circumstances in this case. </p>

  </span> The prejudice alleged by Silvercreek concerns the destruction in 1995 
  of various records of the clothing and lingerie business.  Copies of most, although 
  not all, of the destroyed records were subsequently located or obtained from 
  other sources and provided to Silvercreek.  The only outstanding documentation 
  appears to be the source documents relating to La Gondola Ltd.’s financial statements, 
  which were among the documents destroyed in 1995 and which were not subsequently 
  replicated.  I agree with the motions judge’s conclusion that, although the 
  destruction of the source documents relied upon for preparation of the financial 
  statements conceivably might give rise to some element of prejudice, this prejudice 
  would have existed, in any event, if the action had named La&nbsp;Gondola Ltd. 
  as plaintiff from the outset.  I also agree with her observation that had the 
  proper parties been named at the time of the commencement of the action, Silvercreek’s 
  position in respect of the missing records would be precisely the same as it 
  is today.  This cannot be viewed as prejudice arising from the requested amendment. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The amendment sought is confined to the substitution of La Gondola Ltd. 
  for the named plaintifff, Elsa Mazzuca, and the addition to the statement of 
  claim of a description of the corporate status of La Gondola Ltd.   No alteration 
  of the nature of the claim is proposed, no new facts are alleged, no new causes 
  of action are sought to be added, and no new relief is requested.  From initiation 
  of the litigation the claim concerned damages allegedly occasioned to the business 
  adjacent to Silvercreek’s premises.  This would not change under the proposed 
  amendment.  Further, Silvercreek’s insurer investigated the fire loss and Silvercreek 
  was involved in other actions arising out of the same fire concerning heat and 
  smoke damage to other businesses or tenants in the area.  In all of these circumstances, 
  except for the loss of the ability to rely on the limitation period, it cannot 
  be said that Silvercreek would be prejudiced by the proposed amendment, nor 
  can it be said that Silvercreek has been misled or taken by surprise.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence indicated that the plaintiff’s solicitor was retained to 
  recover damages for the losses to the clothing and lingerie business sustained 
  as a result of the fire.  This was the claim in fact advanced from the beginning.  
  Most of the documents provided to the plaintiff’s solicitor upon receipt of 
  the file, including those related to the fire loss claim, made no reference 
  to operation of the business through an incorporated entity.  Although some 
  documents made reference to La Gondola Ltd., most did not, and the plaintiff’s 
  solicitor was unaware that the business was actually operated through an incorporated 
  entity until he received, for the purpose of the discoveries, the income tax 
  returns of  La Gondola Ltd.  There is no evidence that the plaintiff’s solicitor 
  appreciated, prior to the fall of 1999, the possibility that Ms. Mazzuca’s sole 
  proprietorship had been replaced by a corporation, or that he lent his mind 
  to the issue at all before receipt of the tax returns for La Gondola Ltd.  On 
  these facts, it cannot be concluded that the plaintiff’s solicitor made a deliberate 
  and informed choice among several known alternatives when initiating the proceedings 
  to sue in the name of Ms.&nbsp;Mazzuca in preference to La Gondola Ltd.  I see 
  no reason to interfere, therefore, with the view of the motions judge that the 
  error in the present case was a simple and unintentional mistake.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This action was commenced within the relevant limitation period involving 
  Silvercreek in the same capacity as is now proposed and, as observed by the 
  motions judge, “in respect of exactly the same claim.”  Further, there is no 
  evidence of lack of good faith on the part of the plaintiff’s solicitor in commencing 
  the proceedings or of delaying in any material sense to seek the required amendment 
  once the need to do so became apparent at the discovery stage.  No deliberate 
  and informed decision to refrain from naming La Gondola Ltd. was made, and the 
  company has a cause of action against Silvercreek.  Moreover, as some of the 
  damaged inventory was allegedly purchased by Ms. Mazzuca in her personal capacity, 
  it is not clear that the originally named plaintiff did not also enjoy a cause 
  of action against Silvercreek.  She is free, of course, not to seek relief in 
  respect of that cause of action, if such exists.  In these circumstances, a 
  sufficient explanation has been advanced for the failure to name La Gondola 
  Ltd.  in the first instance.  Moreover, viewed cumulatively, these factors constitute 
  sufficient special circumstances to justify the proposed amendment in the interests 
  of justice.</p>

  </span> Cronk J.A. concludes that when a plaintiff wants to add a party or substitute 
  one party for another after the expiry of a limitation period, showing an absence 
  of non-compensable prejudice is not enough.  The plaintiff must also show that 
  special circumstances are present to justify the amendment.  I take a different 
  view.  I accept that unlike rule 26.01 which governs motions to amend proceedings, 
  rule 5.04(2) gives the court discretion to refuse to add or substitute a party 
  even absent non-compensable prejudice.  But I see no reason to burden that discretion 
  with a “special circumstances” component.  Requiring “special circumstances” 
  is unnecessary, contrary to the underlying philosophy of the rules and in some 
  cases may have impose a heavier burden on the moving party than called for by 
  rule 5.04(2).  In my view, courts ought to be guided by the principle that ordinarily 
  an amendment should be granted “where the opposite party has not been misled 
  or substantially injured by the error”, or in other words, has not suffered 
  prejudice that cannot be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.  See <i>Ladouceur 
  v. Howarth</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 1111 at 1116.  Although the court still has discretion 
  to refuse the amendment, that discretion should not often be exercised.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The so-called special circumstances test first arose, in the Canadian 
  context, in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i>, 
  [1972] S.C.R. 380.   The prevailing philosophy of the day was that the running 
  of a limitation period was an absolute bar to the granting of an amendment to 
  add a new cause of action.  That philosophy was reflected in the lower court 
  decisions in <i>Basarsky</i>.  The Supreme Court of Canada broke new ground 
  by developing a test – special circumstances – to allow an amendment despite 
  the expiry of a limitation period.<a href="#_ftn3"

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

  </span> <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i> was an action for damages brought by the 
  estate of a man killed in a car accident.  The administrator of the estate sought 
  an amendment to his pleading to add a new cause of action, a claim under <i>The 
  Fatal Accidents Act </i>of Alberta, though the two-year limitation period under 
  that statute had expired.  The Supreme Court of Canada held that special circumstances 
  justified the amendment.  In practice, these special circumstances amounted 
  to a showing that the defendant would not be prejudiced by the amendment.  The 
  plaintiff had pleaded all of the facts relevant to the  new cause of action, 
  the defendants had admitted liability for the death, and the defendant’s counsel 
  had examined the deceased person’s widow on matters relevant to a claim under 
  <i>The Fatal Accidents Act</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under our current rules, the <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i> special circumstances 
  test for adding a new cause of action after the expiry of a limitation period 
  has been displaced by the mandatory provisions of rule 26.01. Absent non-compensable 
  prejudice, an amendment must be granted.  The special circumstances test has 
  no role to play.  Indeed, the current rules reflect quite a different philosophy 
  from their predecessors, a philosophy captured by the general interpretative 
  principle in rule 1.04(1):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>These rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious 
      and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.</p>

'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, when it comes to amendments under rule 26.01, the focus is on 
  whether non-compensable prejudice would result.  And, importantly, the mere 
  expiry of a limitation period by itself is not the kind of prejudice that would 
  defeat an amendment.  Instead, the court must evaluate prejudice in light of 
  the two main purposes of a limitation period:  first, defendants should have 
  a fair opportunity to prepare an adequate defence and at some point should no 
  longer have to preserve or seek out evidence for that defence; and second, at 
  some point defendants should be free of claims that might affect their economic, 
  social or personal interests.  See Garry D. Watson, “Amendment of Proceedings 
  After Limitation Periods” (1975), 53 <i>Can. B. Rev.</i> 237 at 272-73.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Take a case where a plaintiff moves to add a new cause of action after 
  the limitation period has expired.  If evidence relevant to the new claim was 
  lost before the motion was brought but after the limitation period expired, 
  that loss of evidence might give rise to non-compensable prejudice sufficient 
  to defeat the proposed amendment.  Absent this kind of prejudice, however, the 
  motion under rule 26.01 must be granted.  If “special circumstances” refers 
  to something more than the absence of non-compensable prejudice, then a plaintiff 
  need not show them.  The rule has done away with this requirement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> But several cases, including some decisions of this court, have invoked 
  the need for special circumstances on motions to add or substitute a party.  
  And they have done so not only on motions under provincial legislation like 
  the <i>Family Law Act</i>, but also on motions under rule 5.04(2), no doubt 
  because the legislation and the rule are discretionary not mandatory.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Unquestionably, the judge or master hearing a motion to add or substitute 
  a party under rule 5.04(2) has a discretion to refuse the amendment even where 
  no non-compensable prejudice would result from allowing it.  But, imposing a 
  special circumstances requirement needlessly and improperly fetters that discretion, 
  is inconsistent with the philosophy of the current rules and may, as I said 
  earlier, suggest a more onerous burden on the party seeking the amendment than 
  the rule calls for.  If precedent matters, it seems to me, respectfully, that 
  what the cases invoking the special circumstances requirement have overlooked 
  is the controlling authority of <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth, supra</i>, and <i>Witco 
  Chemical Co. Canada Ltd. v. Town of Oakville</i> (1974), 43 D.L.R. (3d) 413, 
  both Ontario cases decided by the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Ladouceur</i> is discussed by Cronk J.A. in her reasons.  In brief, 
  a father and son were in a car accident.  The son was injured but the father 
  was not.  The son’s lawyer mistakenly started the action in the father’s name.  
  After the limitation period had expired, the lawyer realized his mistake and 
  brought a motion to substitute the son as plaintiff.  The applicable rule, Ontario 
  rule 136(1) gave the court discretion to substitute or add a person as plaintiff 
  “… where an action has through a <i>bona fide</i> mistake been commenced in 
  the name of the wrong person as plaintiff…”.  Although the mistake in <i>Ladouceur</i> 
  was bona fide the local master, a high court judge and this court all refused 
  the amendment.  The Supreme Court of Canada, however, allowed the appeal and 
  permitted the son to be substituted as plaintiff.  Spence J. relied on the following 
  salutary general principle, at p. 1116: “[t]he general principle underlying 
  all the cases is that the court should amend, where the opposite party has not 
  been misled, or substantially injured by the error.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Spence J. did not suggest that the plaintiff had to show “special circumstances”.  
  Indeed, the phrase “special circumstances” does not appear in his judgment.  
  Instead, what the Supreme Court of Canada in effect said was that, in general, 
  the court should add or substitute a plaintiff even after the expiry of a limitation 
  period unless the other side would be prejudiced by the amendment.  Implicitly, 
  the court found that the discretion to refuse the amendment, absent prejudice, 
  should rarely be exercised.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To the same effect is <i>Witco</i>, where the plaintiff’s lawyer did 
  not realize until after the relevant limitation period that his client had amalgamated 
  with another company under the latter’s name.  Again, Spence J., writing for 
  the court, allowed the amendment, concluding at p. 418 that “the defendants 
  could not have been in any way misled or prejudiced.”  Again, he made no mention 
  of any need to show special circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The approach to motions to add or substitute a plaintiff taken by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Ladouceur</i> and <i>Witco</i> is a reasonable 
  approach to motions under rule 5.04(2).  Indeed, the case for doing so under 
  the current rule is even stronger because it, unlike former rule 136(1), expressly 
  focuses on whether the proposed amendment would prejudice the other side.  This 
  approach strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of the plaintiff 
  and the interests of the defendant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Admittedly in <i>Ladouceur</i>, Spence J. characterized the plaintiff’s 
  lawyer’s error as a “misnomer” and this characterization influenced the result 
  in that case.  But the general principle invoked by Spence J. should apply regardless 
  of how the error is characterized.  As Cronk J.A. points out in her reasons, 
  the court’s power under rule 5.04(2) is not limited to correcting misnomers.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would eliminate “special circumstances” from the lexicon for motions 
  under rule&nbsp;5.04(2).  Absent non-compensable prejudice, these motions should 
  ordinarily be granted.  The court retains a discretion to refuse the motion, 
  but that discretion should not be invoked often.  Courts should work out when 
  it is appropriate to do so case by case.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>2.            <u>Deliberate and 
  Unintentional Mistakes</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Typically, as was the case here, motions to add or substitute a party 
  after the expiry of a limitation period arise because a lawyer has mistakenly 
  named the wrong plaintiff.  In deciding these motions, the case law has distinguished 
  between different kinds of mistakes:  between mistaking the correct name of 
  the plaintiff and mistaking who had the right to sue, and between deliberate 
  and unintentional mistakes.  It seems to me that these distinctions are problematic, 
  even confusing, and have not been consistently applied.  We should be concerned 
  not with the kind of mistake the lawyer has made but with the effect of the 
  mistake, with whether the mistake has prejudiced the defendant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The courts have regularly granted relief in cases of “misnomer”, that 
  is a misnaming of the correct plaintiff.  But as <i>Ladouceur</i> demonstrates, 
  they have also granted relief in cases where the wrong plaintiff was chosen, 
  by characterizing that mistake too as a misnomer.  I find it difficult to characterize 
  the mistake in <i>Ladouceur</i> – naming the father instead of the son – as 
  a misnomer, but the Supreme Court of Canada was undoubtedly correct in focusing 
  on the effect of the mistake and in finding that it did not prejudice the defence.  
  Moreover, I agree with my colleague that little turns on the distinction between 
  misnaming the right plaintiff and choosing the wrong plaintiff, because in either 
  case the court may grant an amendment under Rule 5.04(2).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, in deciding whether an amendment should be granted, Cronk J.A. 
  stresses the importance of considering whether the mistake in naming the wrong 
  plaintiff was unintentional or a “deliberate and informed” decision.  If the 
  former, presumably the motion to add or substitute a plaintiff will likely succeed; 
  if the latter the motion will likely fail.  Although this distinction has been 
  made in other cases, I do not find the distinction helpful and I do not agree 
  that it should dictate the result.  Again, the focus should be on the prejudice 
  caused by the mistake regardless of its characterization.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The idea that a deliberate mistake in naming the plaintiff should defeat 
  a motion to substitute the proper plaintiff seems to have originated with this 
  court’s decision in <i>Board of Commissioners of Police of Corporation of Township 
  of London v. Western Freight Lines Ltd. and</i>  <i>Ulch</i>, [1962] O.R. 948.  
  In that case, a police car was damaged by a car owned by Western Freight.  The 
  plaintiff’s lawyer started the action for damage to the police car by naming 
  The Board of Commissioners of Police of the Corporation of the Township of London 
  as the plaintiff.  After the limitation period had expired, the lawyer discovered 
  that The Corporation of the Township of London owned the police car and that 
  the Board was merely a bailee.  The lawyer brought a motion to substitute the 
  Corporation of the Township as plaintiff.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the defendant did not suggest that it was misled or prejudiced 
  by the proposed change, a majority of this court refused to allow the amendment.  
  Writing for the majority, Laidlaw J.A. held that the lawyer was aware of the 
  existence of two separate entities and “deliberately” chose the wrong one as 
  plaintiff.  In his view, this was not an error in naming the plaintiff and the 
  proposed amendment could not be characterized as correcting a misnomer.  Mackay  
  J.A. dissented.  He would have allowed the amendment because the defendant was 
  always aware of the claim and was not misled or prejudiced by the misnaming 
  of the owner of the damaged car.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The result in the <i>Western Freight</i> case gave effect to the technical 
  pleading arguments that at times held sway in this province 30 to 40 years ago.  
  I cannot conceive that a modern court faced with a similar motion under rule 
  5.04(2) would reach the same result.  The dissenting reasoning of Mackay J.A. 
  is surely correct.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, how can it be said that the lawyer’s mistake in <i>Western 
  Freight</i> was in any real sense “deliberate”?   He did not deliberately choose 
  to name a plaintiff that had no cause of action.  He made a mistake because 
  he did not appreciate which entity, the Board or the Township, owned the car 
  until after the limitation period had expired, a mistake, I might add, that 
  is perhaps understandable.  Was his mistake any more deliberate than the mistake 
  in <i>Ladouceur v. Howarth</i>, where the lawyer was aware of the existence 
  of both the father and the son?  Or really any more deliberate than the lawyer’s 
  mistake in this case in naming Elsa Mazzuca instead of La Gondola Ltd. as the 
  plaintiff because he did not appreciate who owned the business?  I would have 
  thought that the answer to these questions is “no”.  Holding that motions under 
  rule 5.04(2) may turn on whether the lawyer’s mistake is deliberate or unintentional 
  is bound to produce some unjust results, results that in my view would be inconsistent 
  with the philosophy of our current rules.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reasons of the motions judge Molloy J. and of my colleague Cronk 
  J.A. amply demonstrate that substituting La Gondola Ltd. for Elsa Mazzuca would 
  not prejudice the defendant Silvercreek Pharmacy Limited, and no other considerations 
  warrant refusing the amendment.  I too would dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>

    J. (as he then was) commented:  “Legislative changes may reasonably be viewed 
    as purposive, unless there is internal or admissible external evidence to 
    show that only language polishing was intended”.  This interpretation of Rules 
    26.01 and 5.04(2) is also consistent with the rule of statutory interpretation 
    that the drafters of legislation are assumed to avoid stylistic variation, 
    and to strive for uniform and consistent expression.  Thus, it was held by 
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment 
    and Immigration)</i> (1989), 57 D.L.R. (4th) 663 (S.C.C.), that when the legislature 
    wishes to deprive adjudicators of discretion, it does so by giving them an 
    express and mandatory direction.  As Driedger points out in his text <i>Driedger 
    On the Construction of Statutes</i>, 3rd Ed., (Butterworths: 1994), at 170-171, 
    if the legislature is consistent, it will use the same pattern each time it 
    intends this result.  Where it does not do so, the legislature must be taken 
    as not having intended to deprive adjudicators of discretion.</p>
