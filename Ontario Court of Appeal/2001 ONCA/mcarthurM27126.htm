      <p>On appeal from the orders of Jenkins J. dated November 24, 2000 and January

        </span> This appeal concerns the estate of William James McArthur (the 
        “deceased”), who died on April 16 1996.  The deceased left a will executed 
        November 1992 which appointed the respondents (plaintiffs by cross-appeal), 
        his two great-nieces Judy and Nancy McArthur (&quot;Judy&quot; and &quot;Nancy&quot;), 
        joint estate trustees and sole beneficiaries.  The appellant (defendant 
        by counterclaim) William Osler is the deceased’s nephew and Judy and Nancy 
        McArthur's father.  Bonnie McArthur (&quot;Bonnie&quot;) is William Osler's 
        spouse, and also a defendant by counterclaim.  I will refer to William 
        Osler McArthur as the appellant.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The deceased’s estate includes three farm properties known as 
        Lot 2, Lot 6 and Lot 9.  Prior to his death, the deceased undertook an 
        estate plan to carry out his intention to &quot;skip a generation&quot; 
        and leave his estate to his great-nieces.  Part of that plan was to execute 
        his will.  The other part was to effect <i>inter vivos</i> transfers of 
        the three farm properties to his great-nieces.  In May 1993 the deceased 
        transferred Lots 2 and 9 to his great-nieces as joint tenants retaining 
        a life-interest to himself and a subsequent life-interest to his nephew, 
        the appellant.  In 1994, he transferred Lot 6 to Judy and Nancy, retaining 
        a life-interest for himself.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> There is a fourth property belonging to the estate known as Lot 
        1.  It was purchased by the appellant and the deceased in 1966.  In March 
        1992 the deceased transferred his one-half interest in Lot 1 to the appellant 
        for nominal consideration.  In October 1992 the appellant transferred 
        his whole interest in the property to his daughter Judy.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The estate also includes farm equipment and cattle (the &quot;Inventory&quot;) 
        and a GIC.  The estate’s probate value was $190,000.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In February 1994, after receiving independent legal advice, the 
        appellant quitclaimed his life interest in Lots 2 and 9.  In 1996 he commenced 
        proceedings against the estate and his daughters, attacking the <i>inter 
        vivos</i> transfers and challenging the 1992 will.  During this time, 
        the appellant retained and discharged several solicitors who undertook 
        numerous interlocutory proceedings in his 1996 action.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> By March 1997, the appellant’s then-solicitors commenced this 
        action in June 1997.  It was consolidated with the 1996 action by a consent 
        order.  This action alleges, in part, that:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>(i)        the <i>inter vivos</i> transfers were invalid;</p>
          <p>(ii)       the 1992 will was a fraud, forged by the solicitor who 
            prepared it;</p>
          <p> (iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span> the 1992 will was invalid on the grounds of undue influence, 
            lack of testamentary capacity and improper execution; and</p>
          <p>(iv)      that the farm equipment and cattle belonged to William 
            Osler.</p>

      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Pending resolution of this litigation, Judy and Nancy offered 
        to let their father, the appellant, live in the house on Lot 1 rent and 
        tax-free.  The appellant accepted, and this arrangement was subsequently 
        confirmed by two orders of Justice Stong, dated October 7 and 27, 1997.  
      </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The action eventually proceeded to discoveries.  A trial before 
        Jenkins J. was scheduled and then adjourned because the appellant retained 
        new counsel.  The trial was rescheduled for May, 1999 and lasted 12 days.  
        During that time, only the examination and partial cross-examination of 
        the first witness, the appellant, took place.  The trial was adjourned 
        and scheduled to continue in January 2000.  In the interim, the trial 
        judge heard and granted a motion by the appellant’s counsel to be removed 
        from the record.  For a short period, the appellant represented himself.  
        Eventually, he retained new counsel, Mr. Levitan.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The trial continued before Jenkins J. in January 2000.  On January 
        10, 2000 counsel advised the trial judge that all of the issues had been 
        resolved. Minutes of Compromise and Settlement (the &quot;Minutes&quot;) 
        were signed by all parties on January 10, 2000 and approved by the trial 
        judge on January 12, 2000.  The Minutes provide that:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>(i)        the <i>inter vivos</i> transfers of Lots 1, 2, 6 and 9 
            are valid;</p>
          <p>(ii)       the 1992 will is valid;</p>
          <p>(iii)     the estate is deemed to own the Inventory;</p>
          <p>(iv)      a General Security Agreement was granted over the collateral;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span> the estate would obtain a severance approval of a two acre 
            retirement lot and transfer the retirement lot to the appellant;  
            this lot is Lot 1 to which I have previously referred.</p>
          <p> (v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span> following severance approval, the estate would pay the appellant 
            $140,000.00 for the purpose of building a house on lot 1 by November 
            15, 2000 [later extended by Jenkins J. to January 15, 2001];</p>
          <p>(vii)     the inventory would be returned to the estate;</p>
          <p> (viii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
            the estate would sell all of the inventory and the proceeds would 
            be held in trust.  The obligation to pay the $140,000.00 would be 
            a first charge on the proceeds received, unless otherwise paid.</p>
          <p>(ix)      the appellant would grant vacant possession to the estate 
            of Lot 1 by January 10, 2001 [later extended by Jenkins J. to March 
            10, 2001].</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On January 12, 2000, after the parties had already approved the 
        Minutes, Mr. Levitan stated in open court that he wanted to put ten items 
        on the record.  Item 5 related to the appellant's use of the retirement 
        lot, and in particular his desire to build a barn on the lot and to farm 
        the land.  The excerpt from the transcript at page nine reads:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Number five, that this severed portion obviously be a severed lot 
            that the municipality would allow for septic tank and there has to 
            be access and the ability to have a well on it, and agricultural.  
            In other words, if they want to put a little barn there to put a few 
            animals in.  </p>

      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> However, because of its zoning provisions, such use was not permitted 
        by the Township.   </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> After the Minutes were signed and approved, the estate obtained 
        severance approval for the appellant’s two acre retirement lot.  The Committee 
        of Adjustment issued its approval March 10, 2000.  That same day the appellant 
        wrote a letter to the Chief Building Official of the Township applying 
        for permission to construct farm buildings on the lot.  That permission 
        was denied.  On the basis of the appellant’s letter, the Township appealed 
        the Committee of Adjustment's approval of the severance to the Ontario 
        Municipal Board (the &quot;OMB&quot;).  The appellant then withdrew his 
        request to construct the farm buildings, and the Township withdrew its 
        appeal to the OMB.  The estate obtained the required Lot 1 final severance 
        approval on July 12, 2000.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On June 29, 2000 the respondents brought a motion before Jenkins 
        J. to obtain direction from the court regarding the settlement.  After 
        outlining the problem surrounding the granting of the severance outlined 
        above, counsel for the defendants made the following submission:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Now in our submission, Your Honour, it was abundantly plain January 
            12, 2000 that what William O. was getting as step one in this settlement 
            was a retirement lot.  I am very quick to concede that upon the finalization 
            of the settlement Mr. Levitan, counsel for the Plaintiff, and I will 
            leave this to him to explain to you, if I may, raised a number of 
            issues that we recorded and subsequently had typed up and passed between 
            counsel as potential issues of clarification and that one of the issues 
            was the question of the extent to which as the occupant of a retirement 
            lot the plaintiff may have some limited ability, whether it was a 
            small barn or whatever it might be.  However that may be, what is 
            clear to me is by no stretch of the imagination could the Plaintiff 
            or anyone else have had any honest belief that he was entitled to 
            erect the buildings that he proposed in the letter of March 10.</p>
          <p>The letter of March 10, in my respectful submission, was a flagrant 
            contempt of Your Honour’s order approving the Minutes of Settlement. 
            …</p>
          <p>Thankfully there is hope for a way out of this.  By negotiations 
            with the solicitor for the Town of Bradford, West Gwillimbury we were 
            able to get a commitment from him to advise his client, the Town of 
            Bradford, West Gwillimbury that in the event that William O. McArthur 
            and Bonnie McArthur signed here today in court a letter to the appropriate 
            town officials withdrawing without equivocation the March 10 letter 
            then the town would abandon its appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board 
            …</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> At that appearance, the appellant signed a letter unequivocally 
        withdrawing his application for permission to use his retirement lot for 
        agricultural purposes.  He contends that he signed the letter under a 
        form of duress.  Be that as it may, the appellant did sign the letter 
        and took no steps to set aside the settlement.  Instead, he proceeded 
        as if the settlement was intact, although he managed to breach many of 
        its terms.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Following receipt of the final severance approval, the estate 
        went about complying with the conditions of the Minutes.  According to 
        the Minutes, part of the estate’s obligation was to conduct a proper inventory 
        of estate assets, and to move toward a sale of those assets.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On October 26, 2000, Mr. Levitan resigned as the appellant’s counsel.  
        On November 24, 2000, Jenkins J. was asked to give directions further 
        to the provisions of the Minutes.  After hearing submissions from counsel 
        for the respondents and from the appellant, who was then representing 
        himself, Jenkins J. confirmed the settlement as modified on consent on 
        June 29, 2000.  He also ordered that “the remaining inventory items” were 
        to be sold at a public auction to be held on April 13, 2001.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On November 27, 2000 Judy and Nancy arrived at the property to 
        retrieve the inventory.  At this point they discovered that the appellant 
        had sold the cattle belonging to the estate for $1.00 a head.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On January 10, 2001, the respondents sought further directions 
        from Jenkins J.  The appellant and his wife did not appear on this date, 
        despite the fact that they were aware of it as a result of discussions 
        in court on November 24, 2000.  On the return of the motion, Jenkins J. 
        made a number of orders, including that the appellant and his wife were 
        to provide vacant possession of Lot 1 by March 10, 2001.  This vacant 
        possession date was subsequently extended on consent.  Jenkins J. also 
        found that the appellant had wrongfully sold the cattle.  He valued the 
        cattle and corresponding costs at $77,776.22.  He found that there had 
        been partial payment of that amount by the estate with respect to the 
        $140,000.00 to be paid to William Osler.  Further to the Minutes, he ordered 
        the estate to pay the balance of $62,223.78 into Court by January 15, 
        2001, which it did.  He also found that pursuant to the Minutes, the appellant 
        and Bonnie McArthur must vacate Lot 1 by March 10, 2001.</p>

        of Jenkins J.'s November 24, 2000 order (the &quot;first appeal&quot;), 
        which set a schedule for the pick-up of the estate inventory and ordered 
        an auction of that inventory.  On February 9, the appellant served a Notice 
        of Appeal of Jenkins J.'s January 10, 2001 order (the &quot;second appeal&quot;), 
        where Jenkins J. found that there had been partial payment for $77,776.22 
        by the estate to the appellant and that the appellant and Bonnie McArthur 
        were to vacate Lot 1 by March 10, 2001.  </p>

        </span> I dismissed the appellant’s motions to stay Jenkins J.’s January 
        2001 order.  It is clear that what the appellant really sought was not 
        a stay of this order pending his appeal.  Rather, the appellant was seeking 
        a stay of this order pending the disposition of his motion (not yet commenced) 
        to set aside the settlement, further to which both the November 2000 and 
        January 2001 orders were issued.</p>

        </span> In <i>RJR-MacDonald v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1994] 1 
        S.C.R. 311, the Supreme Court summarized its earlier decision in <i>Manitoba 
        (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd</i>., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110, 
        which adopted a three-stage test for courts to apply when considering 
        an application for either a stay or an interlocutory injunction:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>First, a preliminary assessment must be made of the merits of the 
            case to ensure that there is a serious question to be tried.  Secondly, 
            it must be determined whether the applicant would suffer irreparable 
            harm if the application were refused.  Finally, an assessment must 
            be made as to which of the parties would suffer greater harm from 
            the granting or refusal of the remedy pending a decision on the merits.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> On a motion to stay execution of an order of a trial judge, where 
        no obvious error has been made, courts are reluctant to grant a stay.  
        See <i>Bijowski v. Caicco</i> (1985), 45 R.F.L. (2d) 266 (Ont. C.A.); 
        <i>Lee v. Kim</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 1252 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).  I see no 
        obvious error here.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> I accept that the threshold to be met on the preliminary assessment 
        of the merits of the case is low.  At one time, an applicant needed to 
        demonstrate a strong, <i>prima facie</i> case.  See <i>American Cyanamid 
        Co. v. Ethicon Ltd</i>., [1975] A.C. 396.  Now, it will generally suffice 
        if the applicant can show that there is a serious issue to be tried.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> After reviewing the merits of his appeal, I am not satisfied that 
        there is a serious issue to be tried.  There is no obvious error in the 
        order under appeal.  It simply provides direction to the parties on the 
        implementation of the binding settlement entered into by them, including 
        the appellant while he was represented by competent counsel.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Even if there is a serious issue to be tried, the second test 
        in an application for a stay is whether irreparable harm will be suffered 
        unless the stay is granted.  According to the Supreme Court, the only 
        issue to be decided at this stage is:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>… whether a refusal to grant release could so adversely affect the 
            applicants’ own interests that the harm could not be remedied if the 
            eventual decision on the merits does not accord with the result of 
            the interlocutory application. </p>
          <p>&quot;Irreparable&quot; refers to the nature of the harm suffered 
            rather than its magnitude.  It is harm which either cannot be quantified 
            in monetary terms or which cannot be cured, usually because one party 
            cannot collect damages from the other. <i>RJR-MacDonald, supra</i> 
            at paragraphs 58-59.</p>

      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In this case, the $140,000.00 payment to the appellant by the 
        estate is for the purpose of building a house on the retirement lot.  
        In my opinion, the appellant will not suffer irreparable harm if the stay 
        is not granted.  Any harm in this regard can be quantified in money terms.  
      </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> As for the date for vacant possession, there is no question that 
        eviction from one's home is a serious matter that can cause considerable 
        disruption.  This is particularly true for the appellant and his wife, 
        who have two school-age children, and who say that they require a farming 
        property in order to carry on their livelihood.  However, as of March 
        20, 2001, the date this motion was heard, the appellant had over 14 months 
        notice of the date for vacant possession.  In the event that he is successful 
        on appeal, the enforcement of Jenkins J.'s order for vacant possession 
        can be compensated by monetary damages.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The third test to be applied on a stay application requires a 
        balancing to determine which of the two parties will suffer greater harm 
        from the granting or refusal of the stay sought.  The factors to be considered 
        in assessing what is referred to as the &quot;balance of convenience&quot; 
        will vary in each case.  In this case, the  $140,000.00 payment by the 
        estate was ordered so that the appellant could build a house on the retirement 
        lot.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> It seems to me that the balance of convenience lies with the respondents, 
        and is not offset by any harm the appellant may suffer if the relief is 
        denied.  The motion to stay is therefore denied.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> I denied the appellant’s motion to stay the appeal pending disposition 
        of the motion to set aside the settlement.  I am not convinced that there 
        is a serious question to be tried with regard to the settlement.  As of 
        March 20, 2001, the appellant has not moved to set aside the settlement.  
        He claims that he executed the Minutes in the belief that a severance 
        could not be obtained for a lot in excess of two acres in size, and that 
        he could carry on his livelihood as a farmer on the property.  He claims 
        that his counsel, Mr. Levitan, made that clear to Jenkins J. when he clarified 
        the terms and conditions of the settlement on January 12, 2000.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Yet, the &quot;clarification&quot; that he claims Mr. Levitan 
        put on the record was not part of the Minutes; nor was it binding on the 
        estate.  Indeed, at an appearance before Jenkins J. on June 29, 2000, 
        Mr. Levitan conceded that it was only “<u>the hope</u>” of the McArthurs 
        that they would be able to farm the land.  In any case, his dealings with 
        the municipal corporation show that he clearly understood what he could 
        and could not do on Lot 1.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Even if there are grounds to set aside the settlement, a proposition 
        which I do not accept, compliance with the orders of Jenkins J. would 
        not cause the appellant irreparable harm.  The appellant appeals Jenkins 
        J.'s November 24, 2000 order, which set a schedule for the pick-up of 
        the estate inventory and ordered an auction of that inventory.  He also 
        appeals Jenkins J.'s January 10, 2001 order, where Jenkins J. found that 
        there had been partial payment for $77,776.22 by the estate to the appellant 
        and ordered vacant possession of Lot 1.  If his appeal is successful on 
        the merits, any harm suffered by the appellant can be quantified in money 
        terms, and cured by payment of the $77,776.22 and damages for the auctioned 
        inventory.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The balance of convenience does not lie in the appellant’s favour.  
        This matter ought to have been brought to a head over one year ago.  At 
        that time, the estate offered the appellant a two acre retirement lot 
        and funds to built a home on that lot.  In January 2000, the appellant, 
        in open court and represented by experienced, competent counsel, accepted 
        the estate’s offer and signed the Minutes of Compromise and Settlement.  
      </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Now, over one year after he accepted the deal and signed the Minutes, 
        incorporated into an order by Jenkins J., the appellant moves to set aside 
        the settlement.  He does so after interfering with the estate’s ability 
        to conduct a proper inventory and move toward a sale of the estate’s assets, 
        by selling assets belonging to the estate, contrary to a court order.  
        The evidence the appellant seeks to rely on to set aside the settlement 
        is that a two acre retirement lot is zoned residential, and that it cannot 
        be zoned for agricultural use.  He has known about this problem for more 
        than one year.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> This litigation has been costly and time-consuming.  The estate 
        is insolvent.  The respondents have had to borrow large amounts of money 
        to fund the estate administration and defend the litigation.  Each property 
        owned by the estate is fully encumbered. </p>

            which will not be recovered; the renewal of insurance on the equipment 
            which presently expires on 10 May 2001; holding up the administration 
            of the Estate; the negative effect the cancellation will have on the 
            attendance, bids and proceeds of any rescheduled auction; the permanent 
            withdrawal by Mr. Allen of his auctioneer services due to concerns 
            about his reputation as an auctioneer in this area; and the near impossible 
            position the Estate will be put in trying to find another suitable
