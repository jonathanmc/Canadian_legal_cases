  </span> This is a motion by Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (ITCL) for leave 
  to intervene as an added party in an appeal by the Attorney General for Ontario 
  from the order of Wilson J. dated March 1, 2001 and reported as <i>McIntyre 
  Estate v. Ontario (Attorney-General)</i> (2001), 198 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  165.  In that order, Wilson J. concluded that the proposed contingent fee arrangement 
  between the plaintiff and her counsel in an action against ITCL did not violate 
  the provisions of <i>An Act Respecting Champerty</i>, R.S.O. 1897, c. 327 (the 
  <i>Champerty Act</i>).  In her statement of claim in that action the plaintiff, 
  Maureen McIntyre, alleges that her late husband, Ronald McIntyre, died of lung 
  cancer as a direct result of smoking ITCL products to which he had become addicted.  
  The claim, although issued, has not been served.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The plaintiff’s income and assets are not sufficient to fund what she 
  contends will be relatively costly litigation.  Accordingly, plaintiff’s counsel 
  took the position that they would only act for her on a contingent fee basis.  
  The particulars of the proposed arrangement are fully set out in Wilson J.’s 
  reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Rather than simply proceeding with the action on a contingent fee basis, 
  the plaintiff applied for a declaration that the particular contingent fee arrangement 
  with her counsel did not violate the <i>Champerty Act</i>, the <i>Solicitors 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15, or the common law.  In the alternative, if the 
  contingent fee arrangement did violate the <i>Champerty Act</i>, the plaintiff 
  sought a declaration that the <i>Champerty Act</i> violated her s. 2(b) and 
  s. 7 Charter rights.  Because the applications judge found that the proposed 
  contingent fee arrangement did not breach the relevant provisions of the <i>Champerty 
  Act</i>, she did not address the constitutionality of the <i>Champerty Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The application for a declaration that the arrangement did not violate 
  the <i>Champerty Act</i> was brought in the plaintiff’s name.  The Attorney 
  General of Ontario was the named respondent.  ITCL was not a party to the application, 
  or served with notice of it. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the province appealed Wilson J.’s order, ITCL, which learned of 
  Wilson J.’s order from a newspaper report, sought leave to be added as a intervener 
  party pursuant to Rules 13.01 and 13.03(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, 
  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, which provide:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>13.01 – A person who is not a party to a proceeding may move for leave 
      to intervene as an added party if the person claims,</p>
    <p>(a) an interest in the subject matter of the proceeding;</p>
    <p>(b) that the person may be adversely affected by a judgment in the proceeding; 
    </p>
    <p>     or</p>
    <p>(c) that there exists between the person and one or more of the parties 
      to the proceeding a question of law or fact in common with one or more of 
      the questions in issue in the proceeding.</p>
    <p>13.03(2) – Leave to intervene as an added party or as a friend of the court 
      in the Court of Appeal may be granted by a panel of the court, the Chief 
      Justice of Ontario or the Associate Chief Justice of Ontario.</p>
  </blockquote>

line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, under Rule 13.01, the court may grant a non-party leave to intervene 
  in an appeal where the party can show an interest in the subject matter of the 
  proceedings; evidence that it may be adversely affected by a judgment in the 
  proceedings; or a question of fact or law in common with one or more of the 
  questions in issue in the proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> ITCL contends that it has an interest in the subject matter of the appeal 
  and that it may be adversely affected by a judgment issued on the appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before moving to the crux of ITCL’s motion for leave to intervene in 
  the appeal, it is important to briefly summarize the issue on the appeal.  The 
  Attorney General has framed the issue as whether the proposed contingency arrangement 
  between the plaintiff and her counsel is prohibited by the <i>Champerty Act</i>.  
  The Attorney General’s notice of appeal supports this characterization of the 
  issue on the appeal and I accept this characterization as valid.  The issue 
  on the appeal does not concern ITCL’s liability to the plaintiff in any respect.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> ITCL, as an essential part of its motion for leave to intervene, seeks 
  to expand the record which was before the applications judge.  The evidence 
  ITCL seeks to introduce is set out in the comprehensive affidavit of Deborah 
  Glendinning.  In general, ITCL wants to put evidence before this court to establish:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> that the record below was incomplete and inaccurate in certain 
      respects as it related to the history of tobacco litigation in Canada;</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the accurate particulars of conduct of the tobacco industry 
      and that of ITCL, in Canada;</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the state of regulation of the tobacco industry in Canada; 
      and,</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the cost of tobacco litigation.  In this regard, ITCL contends 
      that tobacco litigation is no  more costly than any other personal injury 
      litigation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence in question is evidence suggesting that the evidence that 
  was before the applications judge was not complete and, indeed, was inaccurate 
  in certain respects.  The evidence ITCL seeks to add to the record was available 
  when the application was heard.  However, it was not adduced because ITCL was 
  not given notice of the plaintiff’s application by either the plaintiff or the 
  Attorney General, the respondent on the application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An intervener will rarely be permitted to expand the evidentiary record 
  on an appeal.  Expanding the record creates obvious problems, in that in reviewing 
  the order appealed from, this court will necessarily have to consider the correctness 
  of the order on the basis of a different evidentiary record than the one that 
  was before the court below.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the reasons that follow, ITCL’s motion for leave to intervene is 
  dismissed.  In my opinion, ITCL should not be permitted to expand the evidentiary 
  record.  Further, on the record that is before me I am not persuaded that ITCL 
  has anything to say about the issues on the appeal that will not be said by 
  the Attorney General.  I will deal with the evidentiary issue first since it 
  is so much part of the fabric of ITCL’s position on this motion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have said, ITCL was not served with notice of the plaintiff’s application.  
  Thus, it did not appear on the application.  In these circumstances it was open 
  to ITCL, once it learned of the result of the application before Wilson J., 
  to move to vary or set aside her order under Rule 37.14(1)(a).  This rule provides 
  that a person “who is affected by an order obtained on motion without notice” 
  may move to set aside or vary the order.  Rule 37.14(2) provides that the court 
  may set aside or vary the order in question “on such terms as are just.”  Rule 
  37.14(4) provides that a motion to set aside or vary an order without notice 
  to the moving party may be made “to the judge who made it … or to any other 
  judge.”  Finally, Rule 39.01(6) provides that where a motion is made without 
  notice, “the moving party or applicant shall make full and fair disclosure of 
  all material facts.”  Under this rule, a failure to disclose “is in itself sufficient 
  ground for setting aside any order obtained on the motion or application.”  
  ITCL contends that the plaintiff did not make full and fair disclosure to the 
  applications judge on her motion before Wilson J.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Instead of proceeding under either or both of Rules 37.14 and 39.01, 
  once ITCL determined that the Attorney General had appealed Wilson J.’s order, 
  ITCL sought leave to intervene and leave to expand the record.  Yet, the advantage 
  of proceeding under rules 37.14 or 39.01 is that, however such a motion is decided, 
  the evidence that ITCL now seeks to admit if it is granted intervener status 
  will have been considered by the court below.  It will not have to be considered 
  afresh in this court, as will be the case if ITCL were to be granted leave to 
  intervene and to expand the evidentiary record.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It appears to me that the factual issues and problems which ITCL raises, 
  particularly with respect to the history of tobacco litigation in Canada, were 
  entirely peripheral to Wilson J.’s decision.  The issue before Wilson J. was 
  whether the proposed fee arrangement between the plaintiff and her counsel offended 
  the <i>Champerty Act</i>, the <i>Solicitor’s Act</i> or the common law.  In 
  my opinion, the additional evidence proposed by ITCL is not material to either 
  the relief sought on the application before Wilson J., or to her order.  Therefore, 
  had the evidence that ITCL seeks to adduce been before the motions judge, it 
  is unlikely that her order would have been any different.  See <i>Girsberger 
  v. Kresz</i> (1998), 19 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 57 (Ont. Gen. Div.), leave to 
  appeal refused, [1998] O.J. No. 2392; <i>931473 Ontario Ltd. v. Coldwell Banker 
  Canada Inc.</i> (1991), 5 C.P.C. (3d) 238 (Ont. Gen. Div.);  <i>Pazner v. Ontario</i> 
  (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 138 (H.C.J.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I accept that there may be cases where failure to disclose or inaccurate 
  disclosure, though not material to the decision in question or the relief sought 
  on the motion, may be so egregious as to bring the administration of justice 
  into disrepute.  In those cases, the order issued ought to be set aside.  However, 
  this is manifestly not one of those cases.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In order to be granted leave to intervene, ITCL must show a sufficient 
  interest in the subject matter of the proceeding.  ITCL argues that, as the 
  main defendant in the plaintiff’s action, it has a financial interest in the 
  proceeding.  I accept that ITCL does have a financial interest in the main proceeding, 
  that is, in the action in which it is a defendant.  However, it is important 
  to recognize that the relevant proceeding for purposes of ITCL’s motion for 
  leave to intervene is the appeal related to the contingent fee arrangement between 
  the plaintiff and her counsel.  In my view, ITCL cannot show a sufficient interest 
  in the subject matter of <i>that</i> proceeding to warrant being granted leave 
  to intervene. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> ITCL does not have an interest the Attorney General’s appeal from the 
  order permitting the contingent fee arrangement that was put generally before 
  Wilson J.  While ITCL may be interested in trying to prevent or discourage potential 
  litigation against it, it does not have an interest in whether or not the plaintiff 
  can retain counsel to bring such an action.  As counsel for the plaintiff aptly 
  put it in his factum:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Put simply, the ability of the respondent [the plaintiff] to hire a lawyer 
      is none of Imperial Tobacco’s business.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even if ITCL does have a financial interest in the appeal, I accept 
  the plaintiff’s submissions that that interest is not sufficient to justify 
  the order sought.  ITCL’s interest in the outcome of the appeal must be genuine 
  and direct.  As stated, the precise issue that will be before this court – whether 
  a contingent fee arrangement, necessary to promote the plaintiff’s access to 
  justice, breaches the <i>Champerty Act</i> – is not an issue in which ITCL has 
  a direct interest.  See <i>Halpern v. Toronto</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 742 (Div. 
  Ct.);  <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 666 (Gen. Div.).  In 
  <i>Peixeiro,</i> LPIC was refused leave to intervene in a private negligence 
  matter which was based on the potential implications of limitation periods set 
  out in the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, and the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  LPIC argued that the decision could have significant 
  repercussions on negligence claims against lawyers.  MacPherson J. held that 
  the result would not affect any of the lawyers involved in the action, that 
  those lawyers could adequately argue the issue, that LPIC was not financially 
  exposed in the particular litigation, and that its interest was not impartial 
  or altruistic.  </p>

  </span> One can easily distinguish the interest of ITCL in this case from that 
  of LPIC in <i>Peixeiro</i> on the ground that, unlike LPIC, ITCL is a named 
  defendant in the plaintiff’s action.  However, it seems to me that <i>Peixeiro</i> 
  stands for the principle that intervener status should not be granted simply 
  because the proceeding opens the party seeking to intervene to future litigation.  
  This concern was clearly part of LPIC’s position in <i>Peixeiro</i>.  Following 
  <i>Peixeiro</i>, the prospect of ITCL or other tobacco companies being exposed 
  to future litigation undertaken on a contingency fee arrangement is not sufficient 
  to establish the kind of genuine and direct interest required to permit ITCL 
  to be granted intervener status.</p>

  </span> Furthermore, ITCL must show an adverse impact in respect of the appeal 
  “in a greater way than any member of the general public”.  See <i>John Doe v. 
  Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</i> (1991), 87 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  (Ont. Div. Ct.).  Superficially, ITCL can show an adverse impact in a greater 
  way than any member of the general public, as it is a defendant in the plaintiff’s 
  main action.  However, it seems to me that the fact that ITCL is a defendant 
  in the plaintiff’s action is incidental to, and distinctly separate from the 
  subject matter of the relevant proceeding – the appeal related to the contingent 
  fee arrangement. Specifically, it is incidental to the plaintiff’s common law 
  and constitutional arguments attacking the application and validity of the <i>Champerty 
  Act</i> to the fee arrangements between her and her counsel.</p>

  </span> ITCL also invokes the common law tort of “barratry” to justify its interest 
  in the Attorney General’s appeal.  I include myself among those who had never 
  heard of the tort of barratry until I read the material on this motion.  Nonetheless, 
  this submission requires some comment because of the position ITCL takes with 
  respect to it.  ITCL claims that the tort of barratry permits a defendant who 
  is exposed to costs as a result of a champertous proceeding to sue the lawyer 
  through whose “efficacious intermeddling” or improper motive the champertous 
  action was brought in the first place.  </p>

  </span> Barratry is related to, but clearly different from, champerty and maintenance.  
  Barratry is defined in <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. (St. 
  Paul:  West Publishing, 1999) as “[t]he offence of frequently exciting and stirring 
  up quarrels and suits, either at law or otherwise”.  According to <i>Black’s</i>, 
  barratry is also “a crime in most jurisdictions”.</p>

  </span> By contrast, champerty refers to a bargain between a stranger and a 
  party to a lawsuit by which the stranger pursues the party’s claim in consideration 
  of receiving part of any judgment proceeds.  The difference between champerty 
  and barratry appears to be that while champerty is purely self-interested, barratry 
  requires the additional intent to harm the third person:  “… if the design was 
  not to recover his own right, but only to ruin and oppress his neighbour, that 
  is barratry”.  See <i>Words and Phrases Judicially Defined</i>, Vol. I (London:  
  Butterworth &amp; Co., 1943).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Maintenance is further distinguished from barratry and champerty on 
  the basis that it appears to be motivated by altruism.  That is, it requires 
  a person to “lay out money on behalf of another in suits at law to recover a 
  just right, and this may be done in respect of the poverty of the party;  but 
  if he lends money to promote and stir up suits, then he is a barrator”.  <i>Words 
  and Phrases</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

  </span> In Canada, the common law criminal offences of champerty, maintenance 
  and barratry (as well as refusing to serve in office and being a “common scold”) 
  were abolished after the 1950 <i>Report of the Royal Commission on the Revision 
  of the</i> <i>Criminal Code</i>.  There is no reference to a tort of barratry 
  in torts texts such as <i>Canadian Tort Law</i>, Lewis Klar, (Toronto:  Butterworths, 
  1999), <i>Remedies in Tort</i>, Lewis Klar et al., (Toronto:  Carswell, Looseleaf 
  ed.) or <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 9<sup>th</sup> ed., John Fleming (N.S.W.:  
  The Law Book Company, 1998).  Nonetheless, for the purpose of this motion I 
  will assume, but not decide, that there is such a thing as the tort of barratry.

  </span> The offence of barratry was considered (along with champerty and maintenance) 
  by the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>NAACP v. Button</i> (1963), 
  371 U.S. 415.  In that case, the Supreme Court held that legislation passed 
  by the State of Virginia aimed at restricting the activities of the National 
  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which supported litigation 
  involving alleged civil rights abuses, was unconstitutional.  Justice Brennon 
  wrote the majority opinion:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>However valid may be Virginia’s interest in regulating the traditionally 
      illegal practices of barratry, maintenance and champerty, that interest 
      does not justify the prohibition of the NAACP activities disclosed by this 
      record.  Malicious intent was of the essence of the common law offences 
      of fomenting or stirring up litigation.  And whatever may be or may have 
      been true of suits against the government in other countries, the exercise 
      in our own, as in this case, of First Amendment rights to enforce constitutional 
      rights through litigation, as a matter of law, cannot be deemed malicious.

  </span> The <i>NAACP v. Button</i> case was cited with approval by the British 
  Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Young v. Young</i>, [1990] 29 R.F.L. (3d) 113.  
  The Court of Appeal’s judgment in <i>Young</i> was varied on other grounds by

  </span> Assuming that the common law tort of barratry lives on, the issue remains 
  whether it could have any application in this case.  According to its characterization 
  by ITCL, its application assumes the presence of a champertous action.  If the 
  retainer in question is champertous in law, the question then becomes whether 
  ITCL’s costs interest is a sufficient basis upon which to grant an application 
  for intervener status.  For reasons I have already canvassed, ITCL’s costs interest 
  is not a sufficient basis.  If the retainer is not champertous, there is no 
  foundation in the obscure tort of barratry and ITCL cannot rely on it to support 
  its interest in the appeal.  In that regard, there is absolutely no evidence 
  of a malicious intent on the part of the plaintiff’s counsel directed toward 
  ITCL.</p>

line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, the real issue on the Attorney General’s appeal is whether, 
  because of the proposed fee arrangements between the plaintiff and her counsel, 
  this is a champertous action.  As I have already stated, ITCL has nothing to 
  add to the Attorney General’s submissions on that question. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, ITCL’s position is analogous to the position of targeted 
  defendants in motions under s. 246 of the <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, where leave to commence a derivative action is required.  
  In <i>Lederer v. 372116 Ontario Ltd. </i>(2001), 141 (O.A.C.) 338 (C.A.), this 
  court held that the issue whether leave should be granted to commence a derivative 
  action does not require service upon the targeted defendants so as to give those 
  defendants a right to participate in the leave motion.  Of course, the defendant 
  in such circumstances, and Imperial Tobacco here, has the right to challenge 
  any claim on the basis that the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, 
  or is frivolous or vexatious.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Finally, I want to address two further issues, both relevant to ITCL’s 
  position on this motion.  First, I accept that under Rule 13.01(2), if ITCL 
  were granted leave to intervene without being granted the right to significantly 
  expand the record, ITCL’s participation as an intervener will not “unduly delay 
  or prejudice” the determination of the rights of the plaintiff and the Attorney 
  General on the appeal.  However, if ITCL is permitted to intervene and expand 
  the record, its intervention would, in my view, unduly delay the determination 
  of the issues on the appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, in its proposed additional evidence, ITCL suggests that tobacco 
  litigation is not unduly expensive when compared to other forms of personal 
  injury litigation.  I find this suggestion somewhat disingenuous.  In fact, 
  virtually all personal injury litigation is beyond the reach of even middle 
  class Ontario residents.  This explains why almost all such litigation in Ontario 
  is undertaken on some agreed contingency fee arrangement.  See <i>Bergel &amp; 
  Edson v. Wolf</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 777 (Sup. Ct.).  Moreover, I would not 
  be surprised if, consistent with recent American experience, some defence work 
  in Ontario is conducted on contingent fee arrangements.  As Carthy J.A. recently 
  said in <i>Finlayson v. Roberts</i> (2000), 136 O.A.C. 271 (C.A.), at para. 
  24:  “For some years, the contingency-like fees approach has been condoned by 
  the courts, particularly in negligence claims”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons ITCL’s motion for leave to intervene is dismissed 
  with costs to the plaintiff, payable by ITCL fixed at $750.  These costs will 
  be accounted for through the judicial supervision of the final fee arrangements 
  contemplated by the applications judge.</p>
