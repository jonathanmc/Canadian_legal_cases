  </span></span> This appeal arises from an intended class proceeding brought 
  on behalf of a class of automobile insurance policyholders.  The appellant is 
  the named applicant.  One of the appellant’s automobiles was damaged beyond 
  repair.  The respondent Co-operators General Insurance Company paid the appellant 
  the value of the vehicle, less the deductible under the policy, and took title 
  to the damaged vehicle as salvage.  The appellant alleges that, in these circumstances, 
  the terms of the applicable statutory policy condition required the respondent 
  to pay “the actual cash value of the automobile”, with no reduction for the 
  deductible under the policy. </p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant moved for judgment on its own claim and for certification 
  of the class proceeding brought on behalf of similarly situated policyholders 
  insured by the respondent in Ontario and five other provinces where the same 
  statutory condition is imposed.  The motions court judge dismissed the application 
  on the ground that the statutory condition must be read together with the policy 
  term providing for a deductible.  The motions court judge held that the appellant 
  could not escape the deductible clause under its policy. </p>
<span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> The appellant submits that the terms of the statutory condition 
prevail and that the motions court judge erred in dismissing the application.  
The respondent submits that the motions court judge correctly interpreted the 
statutory condition together with the other terms of the policy that provide for 
the application of the deductible.  The respondent submits that, in any event, 
the appellant settled its claim by negotiating the value of the vehicle and accepting 
payment on the basis that the deductible applied, and that it is therefore barred 
from asserting a claim for the deductible.

  </span></span> The respondent issued an automobile policy to the appellant for 
  a fleet of vehicles effective April 21, 1998 for a period of one year.  The 
  policy is in the standard form, approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, pursuant 
  to the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  It provides for a deductible 
  of $1,000 to be applied to all claims for loss or damage, except for claims 
  resulting from fire, lightning or theft of the entire vehicle. </p>

  </span></span> In March 1999, one of the appellant’s vehicles was involved in 
  a collision and damaged beyond repair.  Initially, the appellant and the respondent’s 
  adjuster could not agree on the value of the vehicle.  The adjuster thought 
  it was worth $7,150, but the appellant wanted more.  The adjuster offered to 
  settle on the basis that the value of the vehicle was $7,625, but this was not 
  satisfactory to the appellant.  The adjuster sent the appellant a proof of claim 
  form.  After consulting a lawyer, the appellant completed the proof of claim 
  as follows </p>

      insurer only in the event that this claim is based upon the whole value

    persons (a) who owned a motor vehicle which was insured against loss or damage 
    by Co-operators General Insurance Company (“The Co-operators”) through an

    Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island, and (b) who suffered a total loss of 
    the motor vehicle by reason of collision, theft, fire or vandalism, and (c) 
    to whom The Co-operators paid the value of the vehicle minus a deductible 
    sum provided by the applicable insurance policy, and (d) to whom The Co-operators 
    failed to account regarding salvage of the motor vehicle.</span></blockquote>

'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> By way of relief, the Notice of Application seeks an interpretation 
of the Ontario, Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince 
Edward Island statutory conditions governing the entitlement of automobile insurers 
to obtain title to damaged vehicles upon payment of the actual cash value of the 
vehicle before it was damaged.  The appellant also seeks on behalf of the proposed 
class a declaration that class members are entitled to the salvage obtained by 
the respondent from their vehicles, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  
The Notice of Application alleges that the respondent was in breach of its duty 
of good faith in failing to reveal the terms of the statutory condition and in 
failing to pay the class members the amounts recovered for the salvage of their 
vehicles.  As an alternative theory of liability, it is alleged that the respondent 
is liable for conversion of the vehicles.

  </span></span> The motions court judge held that the entire policy, including 
  statutory condition 6(7), had to be “read as a whole”.  He applied the principle 
  of interpretation stated by Estey J. in <i>Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. 
  v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… the normal rules of construction lead a court to search for an interpretation, 
      which, from the whole of the contract, would appear to promote or advance 
      the true intent of the parties at the time of entering into the contract.  
      Consequently, literal meaning should not be applied where to do so would 
      bring about an unrealistic result or a result which would not be contemplated 
      in the commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was contracted.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions court judge held that the deductible provision of 
  the policy should apply where the insurer elects to take ownership of the salvage.  
  He noted that if the insured kept the damaged vehicle, the insurer would be 
  credited with its salvage value and the deductible would apply.  To achieve 
  the same financial result, he reasoned that the deductible should also apply 
  where the insurer elected to take the salvage.  The motions court judge concluded 
  as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…In my view the only way statutory condition 6(7) can be given commercial 
      efficacy and therefore produce the result that must have been contemplated 
      by the parties when the statutory condition is read in the context of the 
      whole policy, is to accept that the replacement of the automobile or payment 
      of the actual cash value in the context of statutory condition 6(7) is subject 
      to the application of the deductible.  This interpretation confers no advantage 
      on either party and is in harmony with the purpose of the policy which is 
      to fully indemnify the insured for all losses that exceed the amount of 
      the agreed upon deductible.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The approach taken by the motions court judge rests on the assumption 
  that the entire policy, including the statutory conditions, is to be read as 
  a whole with no priority given to the statutory conditions.  This has the result 
  that the deductible will be applied consistently and it accords with what appears 
  to be widespread industry practice. </p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The real issue is whether, in law, the terms of the statutory 
  condition must be given priority or whether they can be qualified by other policy 
  provisions.  In my view, the legislature has answered that question with s. 
  234(2).  By stipulating that “no variation or omission of or addition to a statutory 
  condition is binding on the insured”, the legislature has created a hierarchy 
  of contractual terms in which the statutory conditions are to be accorded priority.  
  To the extent other policy terms would conflict with or qualify the effect of 
  the statutory conditions, such other policy terms must yield so that the statutory 
  conditions prevail.  </p>
<p><span

'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the submission of the appellant that s. 234(2) is 
  a form of consumer protection legislation.  By mandating certain policy terms 
  and by expressly providing that an insured is not bound by other conflicting 
  or limiting policy terms, the legislature has limited the extent to which commercial 
  efficacy or the apparent intention of the parties are determinative.  In this 
  setting, consumer protection is the controlling principle of interpretation 
  and the statutory conditions are “paramount”: <i>Curtis’s and Harvey Ltd. v. 
  North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. Ltd.</i> (1920), 55 D.L.R. 95 at 99-100 
  (P.C.).  In his report on the <i>Inquiry into Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation 
  in Ontario</i> (Toronto: Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General and the Ministry 
  of Financial Institutions, 1988) at p. 138, Osborne J. drew a clear distinction 
  between the general policy provisions and the statutory conditions: “[t]he entire 
  policy is subject to the Statutory Conditions.”  By according the statutory 
  conditions priority, s. 234(2) limits the extent to which a court is free to 
  apply the general rules of interpretation laid down in <i>Consolidated Bathurst</i>. 
</p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent relies on the fact that the terms of the policy, 
  including those relating to the deductible, are closely regulated and subject 
  to approval by the Superintendent.  That argument was rejected by this court 
  in an analogous situation in <i>Prasad v. Gan Canada Insurance Co.</i> (1997), 
  33 O.R. (3d) 481, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1997] 3 S.C.R. viii.  <i>Prasad</i> 
  dealt with the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 
  672,which defined an insured person entitled to benefits as someone “…involved 
  in an accident <i>in or outside Ontario</i>…” (emphasis added).  The <i>Insurance 
  Act</i>, s. 268(1), requires every motor vehicle policy to include the benefits 
  set out in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>.  Thus, the <i>Statutory 
  Accident Benefits Schedule</i> is closely analogous to the statutory conditions 
  at issue in the present case.  The terms of the policy provided for coverage 
  only in Canada or the United States.  This court held at p. 483 “that a territorial 
  limitation inserted in the contract of insurance by the defendant could not 
  effectively reduce the coverage under the benefits schedule.  That coverage 
  was required by statute, and could be limited only by statute.”  The court rejected 
  the argument that territorial limits in the policy should apply because the 
  policy was approved by the Commissioner.  The court held at p. 484 that s. 227(2), 
  validating any form of policy approved by the Commissioner “even if those terms 
  are inconsistent with, vary, omit or add to any provision or condition of this 
  Part” did not apply in the absence of evidence that the Commissioner “made a 
  decision under s. 227(2) to approve a form of policy inconsistent with the Act.”

'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> I note as well that the policy itself confirms the paramountcy 
of the statutory conditions.  In the plain language summary it is stated: “If 
there is a discrepancy between the statutory conditions and the wording in the 
policy, the statutory conditions in Section 8 prevail.”

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>In 
  the face of s. 234(2), I am unable to accept the proposition that the phrase

  </span></span> To the extent that there is specific authority on the point, 
  it favours the appellant.  In <i>Mueller v. Western Union Insurance Co.</i>, 
  [1974] 5 W.W.R. 530 (Alta. Dist. Ct.), Tavender D.C.J. interpreted the same 
  statutory condition under the Alberta regime that also makes the statutory conditions 
  part of every policy and prohibits any variation, omission or addition to them.  
  He held, at p. 536, that the insurer had the option of either paying the amount 
  of the loss, less the deductible, in which case the insured retained title to 
  the salvage, or, the insurer “may elect to take the salvage under the statutory 
  conditions and in this case it must pay the insured the actual cash value of 
  the vehicle. The wording of the condition is very clear.”  As the insurer had 
  taken the salvage but reduced its payment to the insured by the amount of the 
  deductible, the insured recovered judgment for the deductible.  C. Brown, <i>Insurance 
  Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf, vol. 1 (Scarborough: Carswell, 1999) at p. 11-16 
  considers the <i>Mueller</i> decision and states: “This solution is appropriate 
  and consistent with other principles of insurance law.”  Similarly, Newcombe, 
  <i>The Standard Automobile Policy Annotated</i> (Toronto: Butterworths, 1986) 
  at p. 164, reviews the<i> Mueller</i> decision and states: “this decision seems 
  to be a correct interpretation of the wording, but insurers continue to follow 
  the same procedure [paying cash value less the deductible] without being challenged.”

'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent relies on American authority to the contrary: 
  <i>Straus v. Allstate Inc. Co</i>., 378 N.E. 2d 1308 (Ill.App. 1 Dist. 1978); 
  <i>Langford v. Federated Guarantee Mutual Company</i>, 543 So. 2d 675 (Ala. 
  Sup. Ct. 1989).  However, these cases are distinguishable on the ground that 
  the courts were not interpreting mandatory statutory conditions that prevail 
  over ordinary policy terms. </p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>To 
  the extent there is any doubt on the point, the interpretive approach adopted 
  by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. in <i>July v. Neal</i> (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 129 (C.A.) 
  at p. 135 requires us to resolve that doubt in favour of the appellant:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Insurance policies are statutory contracts and the wording of the terms 
      as in the instant case normally are not the words of the insurer but the 
      words of the statute or of the regulation.  To such terms the <i>contra 
      proferentem</i> rule does not apply.  However, the insurance industry is 
      consulted and does have input with regard to legislation affecting the industry.  
      The individual insured has none.  His role is to pay the premium for the 
      expected indemnity.  It appears to me that if there is doubt in the legislation 
      establishing and governing the cover, and there are two possible interpretations 
      of any aspect of the cover, the one more favourable to the insured should 
      govern: …</p>

'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> The respondent argues that accepting the appellant’s argument would 
lead to the elimination of the deductible in other situations.  Particular concern 
was expressed with respect to statutory condition 6(5) which provides that “…the 
insurer shall not be liable for more than the actual cash value of the automobile 
at the time any loss or damage occurs…”.  That statutory condition imposes a <i>limit</i> 
on liability and, unlike statutory condition 6(7), does not <i>require</i> the 
insurer to pay actual cash value.  By adopting the appellant’s interpretation 
of statutory condition 6(7), we would not eliminate the deductible from situations 
falling under statutory condition 6(5).

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Accordingly, 
  I conclude that as the respondent elected to take title to the damaged vehicle, 
  the terms of statutory condition 6(7) required the respondent to pay the appellant 
  the actual cash value, with no reduction for the amount of the deductible under 
  the policy.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Issue 2:    Is the appellant precluded from asserting a claim by the 
  terms of the Proof of Loss?</i></b> </p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent submits that by agreeing to terms that plainly 
  took the deductible into account, the appellant released any claim.  The argument 
  rests on the terms of the proof of loss, signed by the appellant. </p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the respondent’s submission on this point must be 
  rejected.  I do not see how the respondent can overcome the protective language 
  of the <i>Insurance Act</i> that alters the result that would follow at common 
  law.  Section 131(2) provides that neither the insured nor the insurer shall 
  be deemed to have waived any term or condition by virtue of the adjustment of 
  a claim.  This provision allows both the insured and the insurer to engage in 
  the adjustment process without risking the loss of their respective contractual 
  rights.  As the legislation specifically protects the contractual rights of 
  the parties during the adjustment process, I fail to see how the appellant can 
  be said to have waived or surrendered its contractual rights. </p>
<p><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Secondly, even if s. 131(2) did not have this protective effect, 
  the wording of the proof of loss does not amount to a release of all claims.  
  Indeed, the proof of loss form tracks the wording of statutory condition 6(7).  
  The proof of loss states that title to the vehicle is transferred “only in the 
  event that this claim is based upon the whole value of the said vehicle”.  On 
  that wording, which in turn must be read in the light of statutory condition 
  6(7), it is difficult to see how the respondent could have obtained title to 
  the damaged vehicle as the claim was not based on the whole value of the vehicle, 
  but rather on the value of the vehicle, less the deductible. </p>
<span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> Thirdly, the terms of the proof of loss left the insurer with various 
options.  After the appellant had completed the proof of loss, it remained open 
to the insurer to decide whether or not it wished to take title to the damaged 
vehicle. The cause of action asserted by the appellant arose later when the respondent 
elected to take the salvage.  Accordingly, even if the terms of the proof of loss 
were sufficient to bar the claim now asserted, that claim did not exist at the 
time the appellant signed the proof of loss.

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Accordingly, 
  I would dismiss the respondent’s submission that the appellant is barred by 
  the terms of the proof of loss from asserting the claim. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Issue 3:    Should the applicant’s claim be certified as a class proceeding

  </span></span> The appellant asks this court to certify the application as a 
  class proceeding.  We were informed that the issue of certification was fully 
  argued before the motions court judge.  In view of the conclusion he reached 
  on the substantive point, he understandably did not rule on certification.  
  The result, however, is that we do not have the benefit of his findings and 
  views on certification.  I have considerable sympathy for Mr. McGowan’s submission 
  that every effort should be made to simplify class proceedings and, where possible, 
  to avoid protracted and multiple routes of appeal.  However, I do not think 
  it appropriate for this court to attempt to deal with certification as if we 
  were a court of first instance.  Class proceedings are procedurally complex.  
  The <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, s. 34 (1) requires that all pre-trial 
  motions are to be heard by the same judge and in the practice of the Superior 
  Court, class proceedings are closely case managed. It is obvious that as an 
  appellate court we cannot carry out this function.  This regime does not lend 
  itself to a piecemeal approach whereby this court would determine whether the 
  matter should be certified and then, if it is to be certified, leave the details 
  of bringing the matter forward to a judge of the Superior Court.  In my view, 
  the appropriate order is to remit the matter to the motions court judge to deal 
  with the issue of certification. </p>

  </span></span> In its factum, the appellant raises a number of other issues 
  and asks this court to determine the entitlement of each class member to compensatory 
  and punitive damages, in addition to pre-judgment interest.  As I have already 
  indicated, the proposed class includes policyholders from five other provinces 
  and would require determination of their rights under the laws of those provinces.  
  Issues are also raised as to applicable limitation periods.  </p>
<p><span

'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We must not lose sight of the fact that this proceeding is an 
  intended class proceeding and that, if certified, it will affect the rights 
  of a significant number of individuals.  In certain circumstances, it may be 
  appropriate to make a substantive determination of law at the request of the 
  proposed representative plaintiff prior to certification: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>Bywater 
  v. Toronto Transit Commission</i> (1998), 27 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 172 (Ont. 
  Gen. Div.).  In the present case both parties were content to have the substantive 
  issue of the interpretation and the effect of the statutory condition resolved 
  before certification.  I see no reason why we should not grant declaratory relief 
  determining the appellant’s rights.  However, we must also exercise a measure 
  of restraint lest we put our substantive cart before the procedural horse.  
  While I think it appropriate to give a declaration as to the effect of the statutory 
  condition, it would be inappropriate to go any further before there has been 
  an order certifying the matter as a class proceeding.  In particular, we should 
  avoid attempting to resolve the many controversial issues that flow from the 
  declaration of right.  </p>
