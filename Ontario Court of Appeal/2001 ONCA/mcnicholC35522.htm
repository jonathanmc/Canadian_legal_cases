  </span> On December 4, 1998, Louis McNichol died of a massive heart attack while 
  on vacation in Florida. In this lawsuit, his widow and his dependants have sued 
  those responsible for his health care over the last six months of his life, 
  starting on June 7, 1998 when he first exhibited symptoms of cardiovascular 
  disease. The last in the sequence of those treating Mr. McNichol was the defendant 
  Dr. Puentes, a Florida chiropractor who saw Mr. McNichol only once, on the day 
  before his death, when Mr. McNichol came to his office in Florida complaining 
  of chest pains. The other defendants are all Ontario doctors and Ontario hospitals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While Dr. Puentes did not question the validity of the <i>ex juris </i>service 
  upon him, he moved for a stay of the action as against him on two bases. First, 
  pursuant to s. 106 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, he argued that the court 
  had no jurisdiction over the claim against him because of an absence of a real 
  and substantial connection between that claim and Ontario. Second, pursuant 
  to rule 17.06(2)(c) he said that in any event Ontario is a <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ross J. decided against Dr. Puentes on both points. For the reasons 
  that follow, I agree with his conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The pleadings disclose that prior to his death Mr. McNichol was a resident 
  of the Town of Mitchell, Ontario. On June 7, 1998, he was admitted to the Seaforth 
  Community Hospital for observation and treatment of chest pains. Several days 
  later he was transferred to the Stratford Community Hospital for further investigation. 
  He returned to the Seaforth Hospital for follow-up treatment, including an exercise 
  stress test, and, later in the fall, surgery on his toe. Dr. Woldnik and Dr. 
  Schwarz treated him at the Seaforth Hospital. Dr. Percival is also a doctor 
  at that hospital. At the Stratford Hospital he was treated by Dr. Van Walraven. 
  The two hospitals and the four doctors are the other defendants in this lawsuit 
  in addition to Dr. Puentes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The essence of the plaintiffs case is that in the sequence of treatment 
  accorded to Mr. McNichol from June 7 to December 3, 1998, the defendants provided 
  him with inadequate care which caused his death. Apart from the claim on behalf 
  of Mr. McNichol by his wife as trustee of his estate, the plaintiffs seek damages 
  pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990 c. F-3.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The four doctors have filed a defence denying the allegations and cross-claiming 
  against the two hospitals and Dr. Puentes. The hospitals have done the same, 
  denying the allegations and cross-claiming against the four Ontario doctors 
  and Dr. Puentes. Dr. Puentes has not yet filed a defence. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the respondents factum raised the question of whether the order 
  appealed from was interlocutory or final, this was not advanced in argument 
  and I therefore do not deal with it. That leaves the two issues raised by the 
  appellant, namely whether Ross J. was correct in concluding that the action 
  should not be stayed as against Dr. Puentes either for want of jurisdiction 
  or because Ontario is a <i>forum</i> <i>non conveniens</i>. I will deal with 
  each of these in turn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE JURISDICTION QUESTION</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The modern test for determining if an Ontario court can properly take 
  jurisdiction over an action with an extra-territorial dimension has its genesis 
  in the well-known case of <i>Morguard Investments Ltd.</i> <i>v. De Savoye,</i> 
  [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Speaking for the court, La Forest J. explained that as globalization 
  brings ever greater international flows of products, wealth and people, courts 
  must move beyond the simple criterion of territoriality in determining whether 
  jurisdiction is properly taken, while continuing to recognize that being sued 
  in a foreign jurisdiction may pose a problem for a defendant. At p. 1108 of 
  that judgment he said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It seems to me that the approach of permitting suit where there is a real 
      and substantial connection with the action provides a reasonable balance 
      between the rights of the parties. It affords some protection against being 
      pursued in jurisdictions having little or no connection with the transaction 
      or the parties.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Hunt v. T. &amp; N. plc</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, La Forest J. 
  again, speaking for the court, makes clear (at p. 325) that the exact limits 
  of what would constitute a real and substantial connection between the subject 
  matter of the litigation and the domestic forum were not defined nor could the 
  test be rigidly applied. Importantly, he went on at (p.326) to underline that 
  the proper assumption of jurisdiction must ultimately be guided by the requirements 
  of order and fairness, not a mechanical counting of the contacts or connections 
  with the domestic forum.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the appellant accepts the real and substantial connection test 
  for jurisdiction, he contends that it should be applied to the claim against 
  him as if that claim were a separate lawsuit. He argues for an assessment confined 
  to the connection between Ontario and the claim advanced solely against Dr. 
  Puentes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not agree that where an action has some claims with an extra-territorial 
  dimension, and others which have none, the former must be separated and tested 
  in isolation. To do so would, in my opinion, be contrary to the direction set 
  by <i>Morguard </i>and<i> Hunt</i>. It would be a step backwards, towards a 
  focus on territoriality and away from the recognition of the increasingly complex 
  and interdependant nature of the modern world community which lies at the heart 
  of La Forest J.s reasoning. Moreover, it would introduce a rigidity to a test 
  clearly designed to be flexible. Finally, it would mute the influence of the 
  underlying requirements of order and fairness by preventing an assessment of 
  the entire action against these requirements to determine whether they made 
  it proper to take jurisdiction over the action as framed by the plaintiffs, 
  including the extraterritorial claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Rather, I think that the approach prescribed by <i>Morguard </i>and<i> 
  Hunt</i> requires the court to evaluate the connection with Ontario of the subject 
  matter of the litigation framed as it is to include both the claim against the 
  foreign defendant and the claims against the domestic defendants. In doing so, 
  the courts must be guided by these requirements of order and fairness. If it 
  serves these requirements to try the foreign claim together with the claims 
  that are clearly rooted in Ontario, then the foreign claim meets the real and 
  substantial connection test. This is so even if that claim would fail the test 
  if it were constituted as a separate action. This approach goes beyond showing 
  that the foreign defendant is a proper party to the litigation. It rests on 
  those values, namely order and fairness, that properly inform the real and substantial 
  connection test and allows the court the flexibility to balance the globalization 
  of litigation against the problems for a defendant who is sued in a foreign 
  jurisdiction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It remains to apply that approach to this case. The subject matter of 
  this litigation is the death of Mr. McNichol and the relative responsibilities 
  of his health care providers for that death. The litigation must examine that 
  health care over the six months prior to his death, which is a story told very 
  largely in Ontario. Only the last chapter, that involving Dr. Puentes, takes 
  place in Florida.  Moreover, Ontario is where the damages alleged by Mr. McNichols 
  dependants arise. Indeed, apart from the claim against Dr. Puentes the litigation 
  is virtually entirely domestic. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the need to resolve the relative responsibilities, if any, of 
  the seven defendants and the cross-claims amongst them, I think order and fairness 
  require that resolution all be done in a single action. To require the plaintiffs 
  to sue Dr. Puentes separately in Florida would be unfair to them and to the 
  cross-claiming defendants. It would also set up the disorderly and undesirable 
  prospect of inconsistent decisions about those relative responsibilities. In 
  my view, these considerations outweigh the only arguable unfairness, namely 
  that Dr. Puentes is compelled to participate in an action in what for him is 
  a foreign jurisdiction. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Puentes is clearly a proper party to this action, which is otherwise 
  uncontestably one properly within the jurisdiction of the Ontario court. The 
  requirements of order and fairness yield the conclusion that the claim against 
  Dr. Puentes is properly resolved in the action as framed and therefore that 
  claim has the necessary real and substantial connection to Ontario. This ground 
  of appeal therefore fails.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE <i>FORUM NON CONVENIENS</i> 
  QUESTION</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second issue raised by the appellant is that of <i>forum</i> <i>non 
  conveniens</i>. While involving considerations which overlap with the question 
  of jurisdiction, this is a separate doctrine under which a court may exercise 
  its discretion to stay an action where there is a more convenient or appropriate 
  forum elsewhere. See <i>Tolofson v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) v. 
  Gagnon</i>,  [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022 at 1048-50.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Drawing on the seminal case of <i>Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia 
  (Workers Compensation Board), </i> [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897, Arbour J.A. put the 
  doctrine as follows in <i>Frymer v. Brettschneider</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 
  60 at 79:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In all cases, the test is whether there clearly is a more appropriate jurisdiction 
      than the domestic forum chosen by the plaintiff in which the case should 
      be tried. The choice of the appropriate forum is designed to ensure that 
      the action is tried in the jurisdiction that has the closest connection 
      with the action and the parties. All factors pertinent to making this determination 
      must be considered.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span

  </span> Again here, the appellant accepts this test, but says that the trial 
  judge was wrong not to apply the test to the claim against Dr. Puentes alone, 
  isolated from the remainder of the action as framed. The respondent says that 
  the trial judge was correct not to do so. I agree. The objective is to have 
  the action tried in the jurisdiction that had the closest connection with it 
  and the parties, not just one of the parties. </p>

  </span> As I have said, Dr. Puentes is clearly a proper party to this litigation. 
  Given this circumstance, it makes no more sense to use the doctrine of <i>forum 
  non conveniens</i> to require the plaintiffs to sue him separately in Florida 
  than it would to use the test for jurisdiction <i>simpliciter </i>to force that 
  result.</p>

  </span> Indeed, in <i>Amchem</i> itself, Sopinka J., speaking for the court, 
  held that where in a Texas action only one of the defendants was in a foreign 
  jurisdiction, British Columbia  there was no basis for differentiating between 
  that defendant and the other defendants for the purposes of determining whether 
  Texas was the convenient forum, given that the British Columbia defendant was 
  a proper party to the litigation. As he said at p. 940 of that judgment, [i]t 
  would make little sense to require the claimants to pursue a separate action 
  against one company in British Columbia.</p>

  </span> Moreover, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings has always been one 
  of the considerations in determining the appropriate forum.</p>

  </span> Taken as framed, this action and the parties to it are overwhelmingly 
  most closely connected with Ontario. All the plaintiffs and all but one of the 
  defendants are located here. The factual core of the action is the medical care 
  accorded to Mr. McNichol, most of which occurred in Ontario, and the damages 
  said to accrue here to the plaintiffs as a result. There is no suggestion that 
  the plaintiffs are forum shopping or that Dr. Puentes loses a juridical advantage 
  if the action proceeds against him in Ontario. I would therefore conclude that 
  this ground of appeal also fails.</p>

  </span> As a result, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</p>
