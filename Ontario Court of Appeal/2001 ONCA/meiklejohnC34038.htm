<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Patricia H. Wallace 
  dated March 31, 2000</span></b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> The appellant and respondent, whom for convenience I will refer 
  to as the husband and wife respectively, separated in 1990 after 23 years of 
  marriage.  In 1993, they entered into a separation agreement settling spousal 
  support and division of net family property.  The husband agreed to pay support 
  in the amount of $1,800 per month.  At the time, the husband was employed as 
  a primary school principal.  The parties anticipated that the husband would 
  retire and suffer a corresponding reduction in income at some point, probably 
  when he reached the “90 factor”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>.  However, the husband’s health began to deteriorate and when, 
  as a result of changes to the terms of employment, the husband became eligible 
  to retire under an “85 factor” programme, he took early retirement.  Upon retirement, 
  the husband’s income decreased from $82,000 to $48,600 under his pension.  While 
  his expenses were also reduced, the husband suffered a net reduction in disposable 
  income of about $16,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The separation agreement included a clause providing that either 
  party could bring an application to court to vary the support “based on a material 
  change in circumstances” including “a significant change in the income of either 
  or both parties”.  Following his retirement, the husband invoked this clause 
  and brought an application to reduce the spousal support.  Wallace J. found 
  that the husband had demonstrated a material change in circumstances by reason 
  of the early retirement but that he had not established a significant change 
  in his income.  She therefore dismissed the application.  The husband submits 
  that she erred in her decision because she failed to give effect to the rule 
  against “double-dipping” as dealt with in the recent decision in <i>Boston v. 
  Boston</i>, 2001 SCC 43.  He also submits that, in any event, the applications 
  judge misapprehended the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While I have concluded that application of <i>Boston v. Boston</i> 
  does not warrant a reduction in the spousal support, I am also of the view that 
  the applications judge did make several errors that require reversal of her 
  decision.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and reduce 
  the spousal support to $1,200 indexed annually to the cost of living.  I would 
  make the reduction effective as of October 15, 2001.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The husband and wife married in 1968 and separated in December 
  1990.  They are now divorced.  They have two adult children.  The husband was 
  employed as a teacher and later as a principal in the public elementary school 
  system.  The wife was economically dependent upon the husband throughout the 
  marriage.  The husband and wife entered into a separation agreement in 1993 
  containing the spousal support and variation clause mentioned above.  In 1998, 
  the husband remarried.  His second wife has two dependant children.  She has 
  an income of approximately $27,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the time the parties entered into the separation agreement, 
  the husband’s first available date to retire on an unreduced pension was September 
  2001 at age 56 [the “90 factor”].  In 1998, teachers became eligible for early 
  retirement using the “85 factor”.  This advanced the husband’s earliest available 
  date to retire on an unreduced pension to April, 1999.  The husband had been 
  experiencing stress-related illness and on the advice of his physician he elected 
  to retire on April 1, 1999.  The applications judge found that this decision 
  was taken in good faith.  Upon retirement, the husband began to collect a pension 
  of approximately $48,600.  This pension is fully indexed to the cost of living.  
  The husband also received a retirement gratuity of approximately $40,000 gross.  
  This retirement gratuity had not been taken into account in the equalization 
  of net family property.  The husband’s pension is now his sole source of income.  
  When he turns 60 he will be eligible for Canada Pension Plan benefits.  According 
  to the evidence, the impact upon the husband’s pension when he becomes eligible 
  for CPP is not clear.  However, the husband is now only 55 years of age.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The wife suffers from a number of health problems of her own 
  and has only been able to work part time.  At the time of the application before 
  Wallace J. she earned approximately $22,000 from employment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When he retired, the husband, without notice to the wife, cancelled 
  health care coverage from his employer.  As a result, the wife is no longer 
  covered by any extended health care.  In cancelling the health care in the manner 
  that he did, the husband breached a term of the separation agreement.  Under 
  the agreement, the wife had the option to insist that the coverage be maintained, 
  albeit at her cost through a reduction in the spousal support.  The husband 
  also cancelled certain insurance policies that named the wife as beneficiary.  
  As I understand the evidence, the net unanticipated cost to the wife of these 
  decisions by the husband is $300 per month.  In other words, for the wife now 
  to find comparable extended health coverage and insurance on the husband’s life 
  it will cost her $300 more per month than it would have, had the husband complied 
  with the separation agreement.  Finally, the husband elected to take a reduced 
  pension to enhance the survivor benefit for his second wife (60% rather than 
  50% of the pension).  Had he not made this decision, his pension would have 
  been approximately $49,600 instead of $48,600.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At present, the parties have the following assets.  In accordance 
  with the separation agreement, the husband transferred his interest in the matrimonial 
  home to the wife (a value of $30,000) and paid her a further $15,000.  The wife’s 
  net worth as a result of the separation agreement and a modest inheritance is 
  in the range of $170,000, consisting principally of the house ($135,000) and 
  RRSP’s ($60,000).  The husband’s only real asset is his pension.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE REASONS OF THE APPLICATIONS 
  JUDGE</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have indicated above, the applications judge found that 
  the husband’s unanticipated early retirement constituted a material change in 
  circumstances potentially triggering a right to reduce the spousal support of 
  $1,800 per month.  She held, however, that there was no significant change in 
  income within the meaning of the agreement because when other benefits are taken 
  into account, the husband’s available income is in the range of his gross income 
  when the separation agreement was negotiated.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  According to the 
  applications judge, these other benefits consist of the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)        the contribution of $27,000 per annum to the husband’s household 
      from the income of his second wife;</p>
    <p>(ii)       reduction in income tax and other expenses upon retirement;</p>
    <p>(iii)     CPP benefits without clawback worth $7-8,000.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The applications judge also took into account the choice made 
  by the husband to enhance the survivor benefit for his second wife resulting 
  in a $1,000 per annum reduction in his pension and his bad faith decisions concerning 
  extended health insurance and life insurance.  The applications judge made only 
  passing reference to the principal of “double dipping”.  It did not seem to 
  play any part in her decision.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>“Double Dipping” and Boston v. 
  Boston</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Boston v. Boston</i> 
  was released after the applications judge’s judgment.  In <i>Boston, </i>the 
  court dealt at some length with the problem of “double recovery” or “double 
  dipping”.    As explained by Major J. for the majority at paragraph 1, these 
  terms “describe the situation where, after an equal division of assets on marriage 
  breakdown, one spouse claims continued support from the previously divided or 
  equalized assets of the other spouse”.  Major J. described at paragraph 3 how 
  the problem arises where, as here and as in <i>Boston</i>, a pension is involved:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>When a pension changes from an asset into income the “double recovery” 
      difficulty can arise, usually in the following way.  On marriage dissolution, 
      the parties equalize the matrimonial assets.  The pension-holding spouse 
      (the husband in this appeal) must include the future right to his pension 
      as part of his net family property.  For the husband to retain his pension, 
      the payee spouse (the wife in this appeal) must get other assets of the 
      same value, in order to equalize their net family property.  While the husband 
      is still employed, he may be obliged to make spousal payments to the wife.  
      When he retires, however, and his pension comes into pay, the wife is said 
      to be making a double recovery if she continues to receive spousal support 
      from the husband’s pension income, as she received assets equal to the capital 
      value of the pension at the time of settlement.  If support payments from 
      the pension are maintained, she is collecting twice from the same source.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Major J. concluded at paragraph 63 that it is “generally unfair 
  to allow the payee spouse to reap the benefit of the pension both as an asset 
  and then again as a source of income”, particularly where the payee spouse receives 
  capital assets that she retains to increase her estate.  To avoid double recovery, 
  the court where practicable is to focus on that portion of the payor’s assets 
  that was not part of the equalization or division of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Major J. recognized, however, that there are a number of caveats 
  to the generally undesirable double recovery.  A rationale for avoiding double 
  recovery is that the payee spouse is in a position and under an obligation to 
  generate income from the assets that have been transferred to her upon separation.  
  However, as Major J. pointed out at paragraph 59, “it may be unreasonable to 
  expect the payee spouse to generate investment income from the matrimonial home”.  
  The support payments should provide “a level of income sufficient to maintain 
  a lifestyle that is comparable to that enjoyed during the marriage”.  Allowing 
  the spouse to remain in the matrimonial home contributes to this goal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Major J. also recognized, at paragraph 65, that where the spousal 
  support agreement is based mainly on need, rather than compensation, double 
  recovery may be permitted.  As he also said, “Double recovery may be permitted 
  where the payor spouse has the ability to pay, where the payee spouse has made 
  a reasonable effort to use the equalized assets in an income-producing way and, 
  despite this, an economic hardship from the marriage or its breakdown persists”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There are a number of factors that lead me to conclude that the 
  general rule against double dipping does not apply in this case.  A significant 
  portion of the husband’s pension was not equalized because it was probably undervalued 
  at the time of the agreement.  Further, a portion was earned by the husband 
  after separation and the employer subsequently “sweetened” the pension.  The 
  parties could not agree on the unequalized portion of the pension, but it could 
  be over 50%.  No actuarial evidence was available in this regard.  Also, it 
  is apparent that, to a significant extent, the amount of spousal support is 
  based upon need rather than compensation.  The wife is in poor health, has a 
  limited ability to earn income, and received only a modest amount from the equalization 
  of net family property.  Finally, most of the wife’s assets are tied up in the 
  matrimonial home and at this point in her life it is not unreasonable for her 
  to retain the home. RRSP’s are her other significant asset and it is also not 
  unreasonable for her to retain those, especially since she has no entitlement 
  to survivors’ benefits should the husband predecease her, and the husband cancelled 
  the life insurance.  She thus has almost no ability, at this time, to generate 
  income from her assets.  In the words of Major J. in paragraph 65 of <i>Boston</i>, 
  “an economic hardship from the marriage or its breakdown persists”.  This means 
  that some spousal support must continue even if a portion of it will have to 
  come from the equalized part of the husband’s pension.  I would not give effect 
  to the ground of appeal based upon alleged double dipping.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Misapprehension of evidence</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I am, however, of the view that this appeal must succeed on the 
  ground of misapprehension of evidence.  The premise underlying the applications 
  judge’s decision was that the total of the various benefits that flowed to the 
  husband following retirement brought his available income within close range 
  of his gross income when the separation agreement was negotiated.  Thus, there 
  was no significant change in income.  I cannot agree and I will deal with each 
  of the factors referred to by the applications judge.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><i>(i)        Decrease in expenses</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no question that after he retired, the husband’s expenses 
  decreased.  However, there was still a substantial decrease in his net disposable 
  income from $38,050 to $21,550, roughly a 40% decrease.  This is a significant 
  decrease by any standard.  The significance of the decrease can be seen from 
  another point of view.  Following retirement, the husband’s gross income (net 
  of spousal support) is now approximately $26,400; the wife’s, approximately 
  $43,600.</p>

  </span></span> The husband’s second wife has an income of $27,000.  The applications 
  judge assumed that she assists the husband by sharing many of his expenses.  
  However, the applications judge did not, it seems, take into account that this 
  combined income had to spread over a household of four persons.  In my view, 
  the applications judge unreasonably emphasized the impact of the second wife’s 
  income.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On appeal, counsel for the parties could not agree on whether 
  the trial judge was correct in her understanding of the relationship between 
  CPP and the teachers’ pension.  They could, however, agree that the husband 
  would only be entitled to start collecting CPP at the earliest when he turned 
  60 years of age.  Since the husband was 52 at the time of his retirement and 
  was only 54 at the time of the application, the availability of CPP should not 
  have been a factor on the application.</p>

  </span></span> In view of the cumulative effect of these errors, the decision 
  of the applications judge cannot stand.  It remains to determine the appropriate 
  amount of support.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Setting the support</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the husband has met the onus of showing that there 
  was a material change in circumstances and a significant decrease in his income.  
  The amount of spousal support must be varied in light of the economic implications 
  of the husband’s retirement and the substantial reduction in his income occasioned 
  by it:  <i>Doe v. Doe</i>, [1999] O.J. No.&nbsp;2564 (C.A.) at paragraph 4.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the husband suggested that if the <i>Boston v. Boston</i> 
  principles did not apply, at the least the monthly spousal support should be 
  reduced to $1,083.  This would roughly equalize the income of the husband and 
  the wife.  The difficulty with this approach is that it fails to take into account 
  the wife’s increased needs (approximately $300 per month) brought about by the 
  bad-faith decisions of the husband with respect to insurance and extended health 
  care.  The husband, in fairness, must bear some of this cost.  On the other 
  hand, it is also fair to take into account that the wife’s ability to remain 
  in the matrimonial home assists her in maintaining her lifestyle:  <i>Boston 
  v. Boston</i> at paragraph 59.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Taking all the circumstances into account, I would reduce the 
  spousal support to $1,200 per month.  Further, since, in my view, the spousal 
  support is based on need, as well as compensation, and since the husband’s pension 
  is fully indexed, I would order that the spousal support be indexed annually 
  to the cost of living.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A potentially difficult question is whether this order should 
  be retroactive to the date of retirement.  Counsel for the husband fairly pointed 
  out, however, that since the retirement gratuity was not equalized it may be 
  that any variation in the order should not be fully retroactive.  The value 
  of the gratuity after tax was approximately $24,000.  A very rough equalization 
  would give the wife $12,000.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  The reduction in 
  the spousal support  that I have ordered amounts to $7,200 per annum.   The 
  husband retired in April, 1999.  Thus, just over two years have elapsed since 
  the reduction in his income.  In the circumstances, it would not be unfair to 
  make the change in the support prospective only.</p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment 
  of the applications judge, allow the application to vary the spousal support 
  and vary the support to $1,200 per month indexed annually to the cost of living.  
  The variation shall take effect on October 15, 2001. I would invite counsel 
  to make written submissions concerning the costs of the application and the 
  appeal within fifteen days of release of these reasons.</p>
