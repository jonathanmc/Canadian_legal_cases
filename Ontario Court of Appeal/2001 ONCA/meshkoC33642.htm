<h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h3>
<p>RE:                              HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. UREY 
  MESHKO (Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE:                   DOHERTY, AUSTIN and MACPHERSON JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL:                Urey Meshko in person</p>
<p>                                    Leslie Paine for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD:                     June 26, 2001</p>
<p>On appeal from the conviction and sentence imposed by Justice Frank K. Roberts 
  dated July 8, 1999.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>

  </span> The appellant chose to represent himself on the appeal.  He chose not 
  to avail himself of the help of duty counsel except to a limited degree.  He 
  filed several letters with the court and made oral submissions for 1 1/2 hours.  
  Part way through his oral argument, the appellant asked for an opportunity to 
  file further written argument instead of completing his oral argument.  We decided 
  that it was not practical to accede to this request.  The appellant then requested 
  an adjournment.  We refused that request.  He completed his submissions.  We 
  also considered the helpful written submissions provided by the <i>amicus curiae</i> 
  and the Crown.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We see no merit in the grounds of the appeal advanced by the appellant.  
  Most of those grounds consisted of a re-argument of relatively minor evidentiary 
  issues raised by the appellant at his trial.  His submissions ignored the overwhelming 
  direct evidence provided by three eyewitnesses who witnessed the appellant’s 
  attack on his wife and subdued him during the course of that attack.</p>

'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge declined to direct a trial of an issue as to the appellant’s 
  fitness to stand trial.  Having listened to the appellant, we agree with that 
  assessment.  On the authority of <i>R. v. Taylor</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 
  551 (Ont. C.A.), we see no reason to doubt the appellant’s fitness to stand 
  trial.</p>

  </span> The evidence of the threats made to the deceased and testified to by 
  the daughters was not admissible as “direct evidence” as indicated by the trial 
  judge.  There was, however, evidence that the appellant impliedly adopted the 
  deceased’s allegation of the threat when confronted with it by one of his daughters.  
  Apart from the evidence of that one threat, there was other cogent evidence 
  of the appellant’s animosity towards the deceased.  The evidence of the threat 
  which the daughters said their mother told them about was, in our view, only 
  a small part of the evidence going to the appellant’s state of mind, including 
  the question whether the murder was planned and deliberate.  </p>
