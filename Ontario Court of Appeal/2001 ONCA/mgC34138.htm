  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant was 
  charged with four counts of historical sexual offences involving the daughter 
  of a family friend when she was between the ages of 6 and 14 years old. The 
  appellant was convicted by a jury of three of the counts and acquitted of the 
  fourth. The primary ground of appeal is that both in her charge to the jury 
  on reasonable doubt and again in answer to a question from the jury about the 
  definition of reasonable doubt, the trial judge told the jury that a lack of 
  evidence could form the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This was in 
  accordance with the suggested charge set out by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 320 before it was corrected by the 
  court.</span></p>
<p><b>FACTS           </b></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The complainant testified 
  that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant about 50 times between 1980 
  and 1987 when she was between the ages of 6 and 14 years old. Her father was 
  a friend of the appellant. The complainant used to spend a lot of time at the 
  appellant’s rural residence where he raised foxes and had a lot of animals around. 
  </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The first incident 
  occurred around the time of a photograph taken of the complainant and her two 
  brothers in February, 1980. She could not pinpoint the time any better. She 
  said that she was in the appellant’s car with him and he was telling her how 
  &quot;someone&quot; was trying to get him into trouble by saying that he had 
  touched her. He said the complainant would know that he would never do anything 
  like that other than grabbing her &quot;boobs&quot;, which she said referred 
  to a joke between the appellant and her father because at that time she did 
  not have “boobs”. The appellant then pulled off the road into a field across 
  from his house. He started rubbing her vagina on top of her pants, then he climbed 
  over to her seat, undid her pants and started rubbing her vagina with his fingers. 
  Then he had intercourse with her. She cried and asked him to stop and he put 
  his hand over her mouth. She did not remember if she then went back to his house 
  or if he took her to her own house. Later she found blood in her underpants 
  and threw them out so her parents would not find out, as the appellant told 
  her that her father would be angry because he wanted her first.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Following the incident 
  the complainant began to spend weekends at the appellant’s place without her 
  parents. She said that she had a room in the basement where she would stay and 
  it was there that he had sexual intercourse with her approximately 50 times. 
  She described the basement room as her room and said that the waterbed in that 
  room was purchased for her. At that time the appellant lived with a woman named 
  M. W.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The complainant said 
  that the sexual activity occurred both during the day and at night but only 
  when no one else was home. The sexual activity also involved occasions when 
  she performed oral sex on the appellant. She said that she never told anyone, 
  that she never hated the appellant and he was good to her other than the sexual 
  abuse. The complainant could not provide details of any of the incidents other 
  than the first one in the car. She said that they were all the same.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The last incident occurred when the complainant was 14. She had 
  been released from a group home and because she did not get along with her mother, 
  her parents agreed that she could stay at the appellant’s home and attend school 
  from there. When the  appellant tried to have sex with her, she stopped him, 
  said it would never happen again, and walked out. The appellant drove her back 
  to her parents’ home. </p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>She first told her 
  parents about what happened when she was 20 years old.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In cross-examination, 
  the complainant’s credibility was attacked based on several prior statements 
  and the unlikelihood of the 50 attacks given that the appellant lived with M. 
  W. throughout the time, together with the fact that the basement room was occupied 
  by another girl for two or three of the years in question and the waterbed was 
  not purchased for the complainant, but for the other girl.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The complainant’s 
  mother testified that she had no specific recollection of the complainant staying 
  at the appellant’s place without her brother.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The complainant’s 
  father testified that while out drinking one night, the appellant told him that 
  he “had had&quot; the complainant, but he just laughed it off at the time thinking 
  the appellant was trying to upset him in front of another friend. He said the 
  complainant told him about her allegations when she was 17. He then confronted 
  the appellant who denied it.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant testified 
  in his own defence. He described how he had lived with M.&nbsp;W. for 20 years 
  starting in 1977. He described his fur farm operation. He said that the complainant's 
  brother spent time at his house, first staying for weekends, then working for 
  him and going to school from there, but that the complainant was hardly ever 
  there. He remembered her coming out with her parents and once with her boyfriend. 
  He said she stayed over once in the basement room. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>He said the basement 
  room was used by another girl, C. W., M. W.’s niece, and it was for her that 
  they bought the waterbed. C. W. stayed at their place after her mother threw 
  her out when she was 13 or 14 and she stayed with them for three years.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>He also recalled the 
  complainant’s father asking him to have the complainant live with them to see 
  &quot;if it might straighten her out&quot;, when she was 14. The complainant's 
  father brought her to the house and brought her belongings down to the basement. 
  The next day she went to school, but did not return. Her father brought her 
  back again and again she went to school but did not return. At that point the 
  appellant and M. W. decided they could not handle the complainant and that they 
  did not want her to stay there.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant was 
  asked about the car incident and specifically denied it. He was asked about 
  the allegation of 50 sexual assaults, which he also denied. He said he first 
  heard the allegations about 6 years before from the complainant and her boyfriend 
  who kept phoning and threatening him. As a result he went to the police the 
  next day. He also denied that he told the complainant’s father, while drinking, 
  that he had slept with the complainant.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In cross-examination 
  the appellant acknowledged that although he did not remember the complainant 
  staying over at his place, he said it was possible, but basically C. W. stayed 
  there for three years in the 1980’s.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant also 
  called M.W., his former common law spouse, as well as her niece C. W. to testify. 
  M. W. testified that she and the appellant had lived as husband and wife for 
  22 years from 1975. She described how the complainant’s brother would come out 
  and stay with them on weekends and then eventually stayed there and helped them 
  with the fur farming operation. However, the complainant did not come without 
  her parents. Sometimes her parents would come out and stay in the basement. 
  </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Also, her niece C. 
  W. came and stayed and went to school from there starting in 1984 or 1985 although 
  she was not there all the time. They bought her a waterbed. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>M. W. did not recall 
  the complainant staying over. The complainant came over with her parents. M. 
  W. recalled once when C. W. was not there that the complainant’s parents wanted 
  her to stay with them, and there was something about a group home. She did not 
  want the complainant to stay because it would be too hard, but the appellant 
  wanted to try and help his friend so M. W. agreed. The complainant came but 
  only stayed a couple of days. The complainant would not listen to them and do 
  what she was told and she would not go to school so M. W. and the appellant 
  phoned her father to come and pick her up. M. W. was sure that the complainant 
  never stayed there before that incident.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>C. W. confirmed that 
  her aunt M. W. was with the appellant for 20 years. She and the appellant were 
  still friends although M. W. and he were no longer together. She described how 
  she stayed with them in late 1984, for most of 1985 and part of 1986. She stayed 
  in the basement. They got her a waterbed for the basement room. As far as she 
  knew no one else used that bed while she was there. She was there during the 
  week and on weekends the majority of the time. She remembered the complainant 
  being there only once.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the charge to the 
  jury, the trial judge explained the Crown’s burden of proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>. . . The accused enters these proceedings presumed 
      to be innocent. That presumption of innocence remains throughout the case 
      until such time as the Crown has, on the evidence put before you, satisfied 
      you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. What does the 
      expression &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; mean? The term beyond a 
      reasonable doubt has been used for a very long time and is part of our history 
      and our traditions of justice. It is so engrained in our criminal law that 
      some think it needs no explanation and yet something must be said regarding 
      its meaning. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary or frivolous doubt. 
      It must not be based on sympathy or on prejudice. Rather it is based on 
      reason and common sense. It is logically derived from the evidence or the 
      absence of evidence. Even if you believe the accused is probably guilty 
      or likely guilty, that is not sufficient. In those circumstances, you must 
      give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and acquit because the Crown 
      has failed to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable 
      doubt.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On the other hand we have to remember that it is virtually 
      impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty and the Crown is not 
      required to do so. Such a standard of proof would be impossibly high. In 
      short if, based on the evidence <i>or lack of evidence</i> before the court, 
      you are sure that the accused has committed the offence you should convict, 
      since this demonstrates that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt 
      of the guilt. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The jury returned 
  with the following question after several hours of deliberation: &quot;Please 
  give us the definition of reasonable doubt again.” After consulting with counsel, 
  the trial judge repeated the charge on reasonable doubt in the same terms as 
  follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I am going to give you the articulation that 
      has been approved in our courts.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>What does the expression 'beyond a reasonable 
      doubt' mean? The term 'beyond a reasonable doubt' has been used for a very 
      long time and is part of our history and traditions of justice. It is so 
      engrained in our criminal law that some think it needs no explanation, yet 
      something must be said regarding its meaning.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary or 
      frivolous doubt. It must not be based upon sympathy or prejudice. Rather, 
      it is based on reason and common sense. It is logically derived from the 
      evidence or absence of evidence.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Even if you believe that the accused is probably 
      guilty or likely guilty, that is not sufficient. In those circumstances, 
      you must give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and acquit because 
      the Crown has failed to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused beyond a 
      reasonable doubt. On the other hand, you must remember that it is virtually 
      impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty and the Crown is not 
      required to do so. Such a standard of proof would be impossibly high.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In short, if based upon the evidence <i>or 
      lack of evidence</i> before the court, you are sure that the accused committed 
      the offence, you should convict since this demonstrates that you are satisfied 
      of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I won't say more because anything I would 
      do to expand that might take me into error, so I will leave you with that 
      and send you off again and hope that you have the energy to continue for 
      a while. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Although neither counsel 
  objected to this formulation in the original charge, after the answer to the 
  jury’s question, defence counsel referred the court to a note by Justice Salhany 
  where he raised the concern about suggesting to the jury that the case could 
  be proved through a lack of evidence, and suggested further that those words 
  amount to reversible error. The trial judge declined to recharge the jury on 
  the basis that she was following the form mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ANALYSIS</span></b></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is clear that both 
  the original charge and the repetition of the charge on reasonable doubt contained 
  an error by referring to a lack of evidence as being capable of constituting 
  the basis for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That error had been corrected 
  by the Supreme Court shortly after the release of the decision in <i>Lifchus</i>: 
  see [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320; (1998), 120 C.C.C. (3d) vi. Unfortunately, neither 
  counsel nor the trial judge was aware of the correction at the time.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>While acknowledging 
  the error, the Crown submits that the jury could not have been misled in this 
  case, first because there was no basis on the evidence for the jury to convict 
  based on a lack of evidence, and second because the trial judge made repeated 
  reference in the charge to convicting only on the basis of the evidence. The 
  Crown relied specifically on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. P.S.</i> (2000), 
  144 C.C.C. (3d) 120. In that case, the same error was made in the definition 
  of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the error caused no 
  prejudice to the appellant. The court could see no basis upon which the jury 
  could have found the appellant guilty based on a lack of evidence. The court 
  noted in that regard that the appellant testified in his own defence and called 
  other defence witnesses and defence counsel made no objection to the charge.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my view, <i>P.S. 
  </i>is distinguishable from the instant case. In <i>P.S.</i>, the accused was 
  found guilty by the jury of all three counts of sexual assault and sexual touching 
  involving two complainants, and in spite of the fact that the accused testified 
  and called other defence witnesses, this court was satisfied that the jury would 
  not have misunderstood that they could convict based on a lack of evidence.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In this case, the 
  appellant was acquitted of the third count. That count covered the time period 
  from 1983 to 1988. The appellant was convicted of the other three counts, all 
  of which included the time period beginning in 1980. Based on the instructions 
  to the jury on the definitions of the four offences charged, it is possible 
  that the jury registered convictions on each of counts 1, 2 and 4, based only 
  on the incident in the car and not on any of the other incidents alleged by 
  the complainant. Although this interpretation of the verdicts was rejected by 
  the trial judge in her reasons for sentence, in my view that is not only a possible 
  interpretation, but the most likely one given the overlapping dates and the 
  nature of the offences charged.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In this circumstance, 
  this court must examine the nature of the evidence in order to properly assess 
  whether the jury may have convicted of the incident in the car based on a lack 
  of evidence. I agree with counsel’s submission that this may well have happened, 
  based on the following factors: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The defence was 
      a full denial of any sexual contact. However, the defence witnesses focused 
      on the unlikelihood of anything happening in the house based on the complainant’s 
      misperception of the basement room and the waterbed as hers, her inconsistencies 
      in recollecting the history of her attendances at the appellant’s residence 
      and the presence of the appellant’s then spouse, M. W. However, the only 
      defence to the car incident was a denial by the appellant. It is therefore 
      possible that the jury could have perceived a lack of evidence from the 
      defence in response to the car incident as opposed to the other 50 alleged 
      occasions of intercourse, and convicted on that basis. As counsel pointed 
      out, it is difficult to know what the jury may have understood by the concept 
      of proof beyond a reasonable doubt based on a lack of evidence.</span></p>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The jury specifically 
      asked for a repetition of the definition of reasonable doubt and received 
      the same misdirection twice. They then asked for the complainant’s evidence 
      with respect to the incident in the car to be repeated. The jury came back 
      with the verdicts one half hour later. In those circumstances, it cannot 
      be said that their attention was not focused on the lack of detailed evidence 
      from the defence in respect of that incident.</span></p>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In this case, 
      defence counsel did object to the formulation. Unfortunately, both counsel 
      and the trial judge were unaware that the error in the charge had long since 
      been corrected by the Supreme Court.</span></p>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>P.S.</i>, 
      this court noted that when &quot;read fairly as a whole”, the charge would 
      not have left the jury under a misapprehension about the meaning of the 
      onus of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in this case, that cannot 
      be said in light of the recharge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> This court recently dealt again with the “lack of evidence” error 
  in the case of  <i>R. v. Lawler</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 1744. In that case a new 
  trial was ordered on the basis that the misdirection came in response to a question 
  from the jury, the verdict came shortly after the misdirection, and the lack 
  of evidence was an important feature of the case where the accused did not testify. 
  Although the appellant did testify in this case, the other three factors in 
  <i>Lawler</i> are equally true and applicable in this case.</p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>CONCLUSION</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The error in the charge 
  on reasonable doubt, repeated twice to the jury, requires a new trial in the 
  circumstances of this case. Given that the appellant was acquitted on one of 
  the counts spanning several years, this was not a case where the evidence of 
  the complainant was wholly accepted by the jury. It cannot be said that the 
  convictions were not based on a lack of detailed or corroborative evidence from 
  the defence in respect of the appellant's denial of the incident in the car, 
  as opposed to the other alleged incidents of intercourse in his home.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the result, I would 
  allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</span></p>
