  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>There is no real dispute that Ms. Mills formed 
  the intention to appeal within the relevant period and attempted to pursue an 
  appeal in Divisional Court. Although I do not foreclose the prospect that, in 
  some circumstances, proceeding in the wrong court will excuse delay in filing 
  a notice of appeal in the proper court, in this case, Ms. Mills’ motion for 
  leave to appeal lay dormant in Divisional Court for at least one year. I am 
  not persuaded that Ms. Mills has adequately explained that delay, nor therefore, 
  her delay in filing a notice of appeal to this court. Further, I am not persuaded 
  that the merits of this appeal or the ends of justice justify such a lengthy 
  extension.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On July 13, 1999, Master Polika dismissed Ms. 
  Mills’ action against the responding parties based on her failure to comply 
  with an order requiring answers to undertakings. Ms. Mills did not attend the 
  motion before Master Polika. She subsequently brought a motion pursuant to Rule 
  37.14 to have his order set aside, saying that she failed to attend the motion 
  through accident or mistake. Kiteley J. dismissed her motion on October 18, 
  1999, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I find that the reason for Ms. Mills[’] non-attendance was neither accident

  Counsel for the respondents informed her, by letters dated October 25, 1999 
  and November 8, 1999, that they felt her appeal should be to the Court of Appeal. 
  Counsel for the respondent hospital informed Ms. Mills that leave was unnecessary 
  for an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the personal respondents also 
  informed Ms. Mills that she would seek instructions to bring a motion to have 
  the appeals from Kiteley J. and the Master Polika consolidated and heard together

      Order was properly brought to the Court of Appeal. I have heard nothing 
      from you since November 29, 1999. What do you intend to do with respect

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mr. Smith, counsel for the hospital and I attended at both 393 University 
      Avenue and 130 Queen Street West this morning with respect to your pending 
      motion in the Divisional Court for an appeal of Madam Justice Kitel[e]y’s 
      Order of October 18, 1999. Pursuant to your letter of November 29, 1999, 
      Mr. Smith and I both understood that this motion, which had been returnable 
      on November 30, 1999, was adjourned on consent to January 19, 2000. Mr. 
      Smith had written to you on January 6, 2000 to inquire as to your intentions 
      with respect to this motion. Mr. Smith advises that he received no reply 
      to his letter. I attempted unsuccessfully to contact you by telephone on 
      both January 14 and January 18, 2000, in order to determine your intentions 
      with respect to this motion.</p>
    <p>Based on the foregoing, please be advised that I am of the view that your 
      motion for leave to appeal Madam Justice Kitel[e]y’s Order has been abandoned.</p>

  on August 31, 2001, Ms. Mills asserted that the Divisional Court leave motion 
  was originally scheduled for November 19, 1999, but was rescheduled for a hearing 
  on April 23, 2000. She says the leave motion was subsequently adjourned to June 
  18, 2001, because she was in hospital on April 23, 2000, and to August 15, 2001, 
  because she was still recuperating on June 18, 2001. Ms. Mills also deposed:</span></p>
<blockquote>

  letter to opposing counsel dated November 29, 1999 but said the subsequent delay

  reliance on her advice that the leave motion had been adjourned to January 19, 
  2000 as a proper basis for them attending court that day. She said counsel should 
  have known the motion could not proceed on January 19, 2000 because she had 
  not delivered a motion record.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In a further supplementary affidavit filed after 
  the decision in this matter was reserved, Ms. Mills deposed as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>6. … it should be noted that the Defendants did not take any steps whatever 
      to consolidate the appeal of the Kitel[e]y  order with another appeal of 
      the Polika orders. Despite the fact that I agreed to adjourn the motion 
      for leave to appeal the Order of Kiteley, J. scheduled to be heard on November 
      30<sup>th</sup>, 1999, to January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2000, specifically for 
      the purpose of permitting the Defendants to bring a motion consolidating 
      the appeals, they failed to do so. Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 
      “F” are true copies of two letters dated November 29, 1999, one addressed 
      to the Solicitors for the Defendants and one to the Assistant Registrar, 
      of the Divisional Court.</p>
    <p>7. With respect to the service of the Notice of Leave to appeal of Kiteley’s 
      order on the defendants, was filed on November 5<sup>th</sup>. The service 
      and the relief I was seeking was being pursued in good faith and not for 
      the purpose of delay[.] In fact, I had telephoned [counsel] advising them 
      that the reason why I was continuing with my Motion for Leave to Appeal 
      was because I was advised by a counsel whose name I was able to obtain through 
      the Law Society Referral Service and who was certified to be an expert in 
      such matters, … that the Order of Kiteley was an interlocutory order. …</p>
    <p>8. In late October, 1999, I again had telephone contact with [counsel]. 
      In these conversations, I clearly expressed my understanding that the order 
      of Madam Justice Kiteley was an interlocutory order … I further advised 
      them during the telephone conversations that since the Polika order was 
      in the Divisional Court on appeal I would leave Madam Kiteley’s order in 
      the Divisional Court to be heard with Polika’s appeal, when the date was 
      set by the Registrar of the Divisional Court so that both the appeal of 
      Polika and the leave to appeal from Kiteley’s order could be heard together.</p>
    <p>9. The suggestion by [counsel] that I abandoned my motion is a convenient 
      argument for her to make. In fact, I was waiting at all times for the Defendants 
      to bring their motion to consolidate the two appeals. As I had received 
      legal advice contrary to their position, there was no basis for me to consent 
      to their motion. At no time did they abandon their position that the two 
      proceedings be consolidated and in fact I had absolutely no indication from 
      either of them that they were not intending to pursue an order of consolidation 
      as they clearly thought was appropriate, especially in light of the circumstances 
      outlined in my letter of November 29, 1999.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>…</p>
    <p>12. It is true that I received a letter dated February 16, 2000 requesting 
      payment of costs awarded by Madam Justice Kiteley …</p>
    <p><span>            </span>…</p>
    <p>14. Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit “I” is a true copy of a Notice 
      of Intention to Dismiss my motion for leave to appeal for delay. I received 
      this document dated February 13, 2001 shortly after its date. I immediately 
      proceeded to perfect my motion for leave to appeal. … </p>

    <p>I have taken the Endorsement made by Madam Justice Kiteley to the Court 
      of Appeal for Ontario and was told it does not belong there and in their 
      view it lies within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Justice (Divisional 
      Court).</p>
    <p>The Defendant Solicitors … are of the opinion that the Order of Madam Justice 
      Kiteley is a Final Order and a Notice of Appeal should be brought before

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Mills asserts that the merits of her case 
  have never been addressed. She says she failed to attend before Master Polika 
  because she was in another court dealing with a personal injury case and the 
  presiding judge refused to release her to attend. She claimed she was not served 
  with a motion record, but was notified of the motion by way of a letter received 
  a few days before the motion. She points out that Kiteley J. acknowledged that 
  she did not have the materials that were before Master Polika before her. She 
  also submits that she was not allowed to reply to the submissions made by the 
  responding parties and was not given the time she requested to present her motion.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Decision</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The foregoing chronology indicates Ms. Mills’ 
  leave motion lay dormant in Divisional Court between at least January 19, 2000 
  and March 2, 2001. Ms. Mills seeks to explain this delay on two bases. First, 
  she adjourned her leave motion to accommodate the respondents’ desire to bring 
  a motion transferring both of her proposed appeals to the Court of Appeal and 
  the respondents failed to proceed with their motion. Second, she always believed 
  this appeal was properly in the Divisional Court, and was content that the leave 
  motion be heard with the appeal of Master Polika’s order.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The basis for adjourning the leave motion from 
  November 30, 1999 to January 19, 2000 is disputed. Whatever the original reason, 
  Ms. Mills’ assertion that she was waiting for the respondents to bring a motion 
  to clarify the appeal route, before proceeding with her leave motion, is contradicted 
  by correspondence from opposing counsel indicating they were treating her leave 
  motion as abandoned. Although Ms. Mills asserts that counsel did not abandon 
  their position that the two pending appeals should be consolidated, she does 
  not deny receiving their letters saying they would treat the leave motion as 
  abandoned. Ms. Mills specifically acknowledges receipt of counsel’s letter dated 
  February 16, 2000. It refers to the February 10, 2000 letter, which, in turn, 
  refers to the position that the leave motion had been abandoned. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>There is no reason to believe Ms. Mills did 
  not receive the correspondence setting out counsel’s position that she had abandoned 
  her leave motion. However, even if Ms. Mills had not received it, she could 
  have discovered its existence through reasonable inquiry arising from the other 
  correspondence she received.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Whatever assumptions existed prior to January 
  19, 2000, Ms. Mills knew, in early February 2000, that opposing counsel felt 
  there was a problem, both with the appeal route she had chosen and with the 
  status of her leave motion. Ms. Mills was not, of course, required to accept 
  counsel’s position. However, to the extent Ms. Mills failed to expeditiously 
  resolve the correct appeal route, it is she who is responsible for any delay. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Once placed on notice respondents’ counsel were 
  treating her leave motion as abandoned, Ms. Mills could not rely on an expectation 
  that they were going to bring a motion, as an explanation for her failure to 
  act. Similarly, once informed that respondents’ counsel believed she had chosen 
  the wrong appeal route, Ms. Mills could not rely on a belief that she was correct, 
  to explain her failure to proceed as quickly as possible with her leave motion. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Even assuming Ms. Mills initially thought counsel 
  were going to bring a motion, she ought to have taken steps sooner than she 
  did, when that did not transpire. Ms. Mills is ultimately responsible for choosing 
  to appeal to the Divisional Court in the first instance. She also bears the 
  onus of explaining any delay in filing a notice of appeal to this court. Ultimately, 
  it was up to Ms. Mills to ensure the leave motion was not unduly delayed. Accordingly, 
  I find Ms. Mills’ has not adequately explained her delay in filing a notice 
  of appeal to this court. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span> </span>As for the merits of the proposed appeal, I note 
  that there were conflicting affidavits before Kiteley J. concerning Ms. Mills’ 
  efforts to have the personal injury case she was attending briefly adjourned 
  so she could attend before Master Polika. The onus was on Ms. Mills to demonstrate 
  the likelihood of her version of the events. Ultimately, Kiteley J. was not 
  satisfied that Ms. Mills’ failure to attend before Master Polika was due to 
  accident or mistake. I am not aware of any basis for challenging her conclusion.

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Further, as Ms. Mills was the moving party, 
  it is not open to her to complain that Kiteley J. did not have the material 
  that was before Master Polika. It was Ms. Mills’ responsibility as the moving 
  party to place any relevant material before the court. Further, it would have 
  been open to Kiteley J. to rely on Master Polika’s finding that the affidavit 
  of service was conclusive evidence of Ms. Mills having been served.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The motion is accordingly dismissed with costs 
  to the respondents.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I should add that I allowed Ms. Mills the opportunity 
  to file additional material after this matter was heard solely as an indulgence 
  to an un-represented litigant. I did not, however, permit her to respond to 
  reply materials filed by one of the respondents as Ms. Mills had already had 
  ample opportunity to place her position before the court. On August 31, 2001, 
  I allowed the in-court filing of the Divisional Court motion record on the leave 
  application to supplement Ms. Mills’ original material. I also held the motion 
  down until 2:30 p.m., and permitted Ms. Mills to file a supplementary affidavit 
  in court at that time. </span></p>
