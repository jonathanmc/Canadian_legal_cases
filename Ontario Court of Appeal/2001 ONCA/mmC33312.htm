  </span></span> On November 19, 1999, the respondent was acquitted on all counts.  
  The appellant, the Attorney General of Ontario, now appeals against the acquittal 
  on a question of law alone on the ground that the trial judge erred in excluding 
  the statement of A.M.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant in this case, R.M., is the respondent’s former 
  wife.  They have two children, H. and A., aged 2½ and 6 respectively at the 
  time of trial.  At the time of the alleged incident, the couple had separated 
  and were involved in a custody dispute over the children.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to the complainant, on the afternoon of January 26, 
  1999, the respondent forced his way into her apartment after being told that 
  he was not to enter.  It was the complainant’s evidence that the respondent 
  then picked her up against her will and carried her to the bedroom, where he 
  held her down and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse.  In addition to 
  allegedly confining and sexually assaulting the complainant, the respondent 
  was also alleged to have threatened to tape the complainant’s mouth shut and 
  to kill her.  The complainant further claimed that throughout the incident, 
  she screamed and yelled, and that although she repeatedly cried out to her eldest 
  son, A., to help her, A. was prevented from doing so because the respondent 
  had blocked the door from opening.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was the respondent’s position that he and the complainant 
  had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse that afternoon, and that the complaint 
  against him was motivated by the custody battle.  The respondent testified that 
  on the afternoon in question, after the couple had sex, he left the apartment 
  with A. and took him back to his apartment for a visit.  Soon after, he became 
  aware that the police were looking for him and so he contacted the police.  
  A detective informed him that he was to come down to the station.  The respondent 
  cooperated with this request and was charged that afternoon.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the day in question, A. accompanied his father to the police 
  station and was interviewed by the police to determine if he could provide any 
  further details about the incident.  The interview with the child on January 
  26, 1999 was audiotaped but not videotaped.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A. made a second statement to the police on 
  June 29, 1999, but the fact that this statement was not admitted at trial is 
  not under appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In its opening to the jury, Crown counsel referred to A.M. as 
  having witnessed the events in issue in the course of summarizing the complainant’s 
  version of the alleged assault.  The Crown sought to call A. to testify as its 
  second witness, right after the conclusion of the evidence of the complainant.  
  The jury was present when six-year-old A. came into the courtroom sobbing and 
  then left unable to testify.  After a recess the trial judge told the jury:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>Members of the jury, thank you for your indulgence.  
      We have concluded that, whatever assistance the young lad’s … A.’s evidence 
      would be to us is far outweighed by the emotional strain on him, so we decided 
      not to put him through it.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following the Crown’s case, the jury was excused 
  and by way of an application pursuant to <i>R. </i>v.<i> Khan</i> (1990), 59 
  C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.), the Crown sought to introduce A.’s taped and transcribed 
  statement taken by the police on the day of the incident. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>The trial 
  judge’s rulings on the admissibility of the statement</span></b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following the Crown’s application, the trial 
  judge ruled that A.’s statement to the police should not be admitted.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that the child was clearly upset and traumatized 
  about testifying and that the necessity requirement under the rubric of <i>R. 
  v. Khan</i>, <i>supra</i>, had been met. With respect to the reliability criterion, 
  the trial judge found that the child was present in the apartment during the 
  time of the alleged sexual assault and that the police interview was conducted 
  within approximately 3-4 hours of the alleged incident.  The recording and transcript 
  of the interview suggested that A. was calm and outgoing, and that he demonstrated 
  considerable intelligence and resistance to suggestibility.  According to the 
  trial judge, his concerns over the officers’ failure to inquire into A.’s ability 
  to differentiate between the truth and lies was offset by A.’s attempts to set 
  the officers straight when they misapprehended what he was saying.  Further, 
  the trial judge held that there was “no central ambiguity in the statement that 
  was capable of more than one conclusion so as to result in the absence of cross-examination 
  with unfairness to the accused.”   </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Based on all of these reasons, the trial judge held that “the 
  issues of reliability and necessity are favourable to the admissibility of the 
  taped evidence.”  However, the trial judge went on to state that there were 
  additional concerns to address and weigh.  He stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>The evidence is not that of a victim of an offence 
      but rather of a witness to the offence.  Its relevance is principally to 
      two issues in the trial, of credibility, i.e., it is relevant to support 
      the complainant’s evidence that she called the child during the events in 
      the bedroom, and that the accused at one point moved a child’s playpen against 
      the door.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On the other hand, his evidence would appear to 
      contradict the mother’s firm testimony that the accused had never before 
      that day been allowed to enter the apartment.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>The evidence cuts both ways, and its probative 
      value to the jury would be as evidence supportive or not of the complainant’s 
      evidence. <u>Given this limited probative purpose and weight, it would, 
      in my opinion, absent the opportunity to cross-examine, be unfair to the 
      accused to admit it into evidence.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the respondent had testified, the Crown asked the trial 
  judge to re-visit the issue of the admissibility of A.’s statement, arguing 
  that evidence given by the respondent in his examination-in-chief was directly 
  in contrast to the child’s evidence, making A.’s statement extremely probative 
  to the issues before the court.  The trial judge stated that while he understood 
  that the child’s statement was clearly probative, he had weighed this against 
  other considerations, taken all of the arguments into account, and decided to 
  exercise his discretion in not allowing the statement to be admitted at trial.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Issues<u></u></span></b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is the position of the appellant that the trial judge erred 
  in law by excluding the child’s statement.  The appellant submits that the trial 
  judge made the following errors:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span> 
      <span
lang=EN-US>Having already determined that the absence of cross-examination did 
      not affect the threshold reliability of the statement, the trial judge erred 
      by finding that the absence of cross-examination affected the ultimate reliability 
      such that the statement was inadmissible. The issue of the absence of cross-examination 
      having been decided under the threshold analysis, the ultimate reliability 
      of the statement was for the jury to decide.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span> 
      <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in holding that the probative value of the statement 
      was diminished because it was relevant and helpful to both the Crown and 
      the defence. The appellant says that its probative value to the jury was 
      enhanced by its dual nature.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The notion of reliability, as it relates to 
  the admission of evidence in cases such as the one at bar, was discussed by 
  Lamer C.J.C. and Iacobucci J. for the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hawkins</i> 
  (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 157-58 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>The criterion of reliability is concerned with 
      threshold reliability, not ultimate reliability.  The function of the trial 
      judge is limited to determining whether the particular hearsay statement 
      exhibits sufficient <i>indicia</i> of reliability so as to afford the trier 
      of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement.  
      More specifically, the judge must identify the specific hearsay dangers 
      raised by the statement, and then determine whether the facts surrounding 
      the utterance of the statement offer sufficient circumstantial guarantees 
      of trustworthiness to compensate for those dangers.  The ultimate reliability 
      of the statement, and the weight to be attached to it, remain determinations 
      for the trier of fact.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After having considered the issues of necessity and reliability, 
  Lamer C.J.C. and Iacobucci J. went on to deal with the residual discretion retained 
  by trial judges to exclude evidence even in circumstances where the evidence 
  appears to be necessary and reliable.  As stated at pp. 161-62:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>It remains to be seen whether the trial judge 
      ought to have nonetheless excluded Graham’s evidence before the inquiry 
      under his residual discretion at common law.  Even where a particular hearsay 
      statement satisfies the criteria for necessity and reliability under the 
      reformed framework, the statement remains subject to the judge’s residual 
      discretion to exclude the statement where “its probative value is slight 
      and undue prejudice might result to the accused”: [<i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 
      2 S.C.R. 915] at p. 937.  The existence of this discretion, of course, is 
      constitutionalized by the guarantee of a fair trial under s. 11(<i>d</i>) 
      of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: R. v. Harrer</i>, [1995] 
      3 S.C.R. 562, at p. 579, 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 128 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
      98 (S.C.C.).  And as underscored by McLachlin J. in <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, 
      [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p.&nbsp;610, 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321, 83 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
      193 (S.C.C.), the meaning of “prejudice” must be broadly understood as encompassing 
      both prejudice to the accused and prejudice to the trial process itself.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The approach espoused in <i>R. v. Hawkins</i>,<i> supra</i>, 
  was followed by the trial judge in reaching his decision on the admissibility 
  of the child’s statement.  After having acknowledged that the child’s statement 
  met the threshold for necessity and reliability, the trial judge nevertheless 
  chose to exclude the statement on the ground that admission would operate unfairly 
  against the respondent. I believe that the trial judge, who had the opportunity 
  to read the statement and consider its impact on the case against the respondent, 
  was entitled to exercise his discretion in this manner and that he acted properly 
  and within the scope of his authority in reaching the decision that he did.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge recognized that the five-year-old child was not 
  a witness to the alleged sexual assault itself, but was merely in the apartment 
  at the time when it is said to have occurred.  Accordingly, the child was in 
  a position to give limited evidence as to what he saw and heard.  Based on these 
  factors, as well as the fact that the respondent would not be able to cross-examine 
  the child on the statement, the trial judge decided that it would be unfair 
  to the respondent to admit the evidence.  That is, the trial judge clearly assessed 
  the probative value of the evidence and then weighed this against the potential 
  prejudice or unfairness to the respondent if the evidence was admitted, concluding 
  that to admit the statement while denying the respondent the chance to elicit 
  his own evidence from A. would be fundamentally unfair to the defence. </p>

  </span></span> I do not believe that the trial judge acted unreasonably in exercising 
  his discretion or that he erred in principle in properly focussing on the absence 
  of cross-examination of this witness as an element of trial fairness.  While 
  the trial judge did note that the statement given by A. had no central ambiguity, 
  I agree with the respondent’s submission that this is only one factor that would 
  tend to reduce the impact of the absence of cross-examination.  The respondent 
  could have benefited from cross-examining A. on the statement, and limiting 
  A.’s evidence to the statement had the potential of presenting an entirely unbalanced 
  picture of his evidence, to the detriment of the accused and the trial process.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was clearly cognizant of the 
  relevant considerations to keep in mind when ruling on the admissibility of 
  a hearsay statement, and there is no basis for this court to overrule the trial 
  judge’s appropriate exercise of discretion or to interfere with the jury’s verdict 
  of acquittal.</span></p>

  </span></span> For all of the above reasons, I conclude that the trial judge 
  did not err in excluding A.’s statement.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
