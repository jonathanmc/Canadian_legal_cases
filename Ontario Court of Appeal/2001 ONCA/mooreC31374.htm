<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from their convictions by Justice John F. Hamilton, 
  sitting with a jury, on April 28, 1998 and from the sentences imposed on May 
  1, 1998</span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>CHARRON J.A.:</span></b></p>
<h3>I.           Overview of the Appeal</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following their trial by judge and jury, the appellants Gregory 
  Charles Moore-McFarlane and Paul Anthony Bogel were convicted of robbery with 
  a firearm, using a disguise in the commission of an offence and other related 
  weapons offences arising out of the robbery of a convenience store in Toronto 
  on March 26, 1997.  McFarlane was sentenced to a total of four years’ imprisonment 
  and Bogel to nine years in addition to the thirteen months they each spent in 
  pre-trial custody. They appeal against their convictions and sentences. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The grounds of appeal against conviction relate to the challenge-for-cause 
  process and the admissibility of statements allegedly made by each appellant 
  to the police. On the first issue, both appellants contend that the challenge-for-cause 
  process was fundamentally flawed because the trial judge (a) refused to exclude 
  the jury panel during the process; (b) gave inadequate instructions to the triers; 
  and (c) denied defence counsel’s request to make submissions to the triers. 
  On the second issue, each appellant contends that the trial judge’s ruling on 
  the voluntariness of his alleged statements to the police was unreasonable.  
  In addition, Bogel submits that the trial judge erred in failing to consider 
  and adjudicate upon his application to exclude his statement under s.&nbsp;24(2) 
  of the <i>Charter</i> on the ground that it was obtained in violation of his 
  s.&nbsp;10(b) right to counsel.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the evidence adduced on the <i>voir dire</i> with 
  respect to the voluntariness of the statements allegedly made by each accused 
  cannot reasonably support the trial judge’s conclusion that the statements were 
  voluntary except for one  spontaneous utterance allegedly made by McFarlane 
  upon his arrest with respect to lottery tickets found in his coat. All other 
  statements should have been excluded.  Since I am not satisfied that this is 
  an appropriate case to apply the curative proviso, I would order a new trial. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is also clear from the record that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to consider and adjudicate upon Bogel’s application to 
  exclude his statement under the <i>Charter</i>. However, given my conclusion 
  on the issue of voluntariness, it will not be open to the Crown to adduce the 
  evidence of Bogel’s statements at the new trial and Bogel’s <i>Charter</i> application 
  therefore becomes moot.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In view of my conclusion with respect to the 
  appellants’ statements, it is not necessary for me to deal with the grounds 
  of appeal that relate to the challenge-for-cause process in any detail. I will, 
  however, make general comments on the process that was followed in this case 
  at the conclusion of this judgment. Finally, as there will be a new trial, I 
  will simply give a brief overview of the evidence and relate in more detail 
  only the facts that are relevant to the admissibility of the appellants’ statements.

  </span></span> It was the theory of the Crown at trial that McFarlane and Bogel 
  were involved in the armed robbery of a convenience store in the west end of 
  Toronto on the evening of  March 26, 1997.  The Crown also alleged that Bogel 
  twice fired a gun at Peter Mills, a CFTO cameraman who got involved in a chase 
  of the getaway van. In support of its theory, the Crown relied on inculpatory 
  statements allegedly made by each appellant to Metro Toronto hold-up squad detectives 
  following his arrest. The statements in question and the circumstances surrounding 
  their taking will be reviewed later in this judgment. In addition, the Crown 
  relied on the following evidence:</p>

  </span></span> McFarlane testified and denied any involvement in the robbery. 
  At the time of the incident, he was a 19 year old teenager with no criminal 
  record. He testified that he was in the vicinity of the robbery waiting for 
  his girlfriend when a police officer approached him, drove him to the spot where 
  police later described apprehending him, and later arrested him for robbery. 
  He also testified that the lottery tickets found in the coat he was wearing 
  belonged to his friend whose jacket he had borrowed earlier that night to impress 
  his girlfriend. McFarlane testified that his confession was false and that he 
  had been coerced into giving it after having been assaulted and interrogated 
  by the officers of the hold-up squad while he was naked. The detectives denied 
  assaulting McFarlane and testified that they interrogated him in his underwear 
  and socks.  </p>

  </span></span> Bogel also testified. He admitted to being in the vicinity of 
  the robbery to purchase some drugs.  However, he denied any involvement in the 
  robbery and shooting. He further denied giving any statement to the police. 
  He presented a defence of mistaken identification and police corruption. In 
  support of his theory of mistaken identification, Bogel relied on the following

<h3>III.    The <i>Voir Dire</i>  </h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the arraignment of both appellants but before the selection 
  of the jury, Crown counsel sought a <i>voir dire</i> “as to voluntariness” with 
  respect to statements allegedly made by each appellant to the police. While 
  the purpose of the <i>voir dire</i> was thus identified by Crown counsel solely 
  in terms of voluntariness, it is clear from the record and from the fresh evidence 
  adduced on appeal that both Crown counsel and the court were aware that Bogel 
  was also seeking to exclude the statement under s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter. 
  </i> Hence, I see no merit to the argument advanced by Crown counsel on appeal 
  when she states in her factum that there was no indication anywhere on the record 
  that the <i>voir dire</i>, in so far as Bogel was concerned, was intended to 
  be a blended <i>voir dire</i> both on the issue of voluntariness and the allegation 
  of a <i>Charter</i> breach. While it would appear that no written notice was 
  served upon the Crown and no application material was filed with respect to 
  the <i>Charter</i> application, no objection was raised by Crown counsel at 
  trial on these procedural defects. It is also clear from the record that evidence 
  was adduced and argument was made with respect to both issues. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The fact that both issues (voluntariness and 
  the allegation of a s.&nbsp;10(b) <i>Charter</i> violation) were before the 
  court with respect to Bogel becomes particularly relevant because the trial 
  judge, in his brief ruling at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i>, did not 
  deal with the <i>Charter</i> application. The Crown relies on the presumption 
  that the trial judge knows the law and that he must therefore be taken to have 
  applied it correctly to the evidence on both issues. The trial judge’s ruling 
  with respect to McFarlane’s statements was also very brief and the Crown relies 
  on the same presumption in support of the trial judge’s ruling in his case. 
  It therefore becomes important, in this court’s assessment of the reasonableness 
  of the trial judge’s ruling, to consider the actual conduct of the <i>voir dire</i> 
  as well as the evidence that was adduced where it may shed some light on the 
  trial judge’s appreciation of the issues before him. The relevant facts can 
  be summarized as follows. </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <h4><b>A.           Evidence in relation to McFarlane’s statement</b></h4>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span
lang=EN-US><b>1.</b></span> <b><span lang=EN-US>      At the scene and en route 
        to the police station</span></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Detective Lajeunesse testified that he arrested McFarlane shortly 
  after 10:16 p.m., running down a street close to and heading away from the scene 
  of the robbery.  Lajeunesse had but a brief contact with McFarlane at this point 
  in time before he turned him over to Detective May. May testified that he informed 
  McFarlane of his rights to counsel, that McFarlane indicated to him that he 
  understood, and that he did not wish to speak with a lawyer. May searched McFarlane 
  and found four lottery tickets in the pocket of his coat, at which time McFarlane 
  immediately indicated that he found those on the street. This statement was 
  one of the statements later introduced at trial. As indicated earlier, it is 
  my view that this statement was properly admitted in evidence.  None of the 
  arguments advanced on appeal have any bearing on the admissibility of this statement.  
  Hence the following analysis does not pertain to this statement.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> May then read to McFarlane the caution from his memo book. McFarlane 
  acknowledged that he understood and denied robbing anyone. After other officers 
  arrived on the scene around 11:00 p.m., May and Lajeunesse left with McFarlane 
  and arrived at 12 Division a few minutes later. They then waited approximately 
  half an hour in the car before bringing McFarlane in the station. May could 
  not explain the delay but thought it was possibly because someone else was being 
  booked at the time.  He testified that he had no conversation with McFarlane 
  in the car. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> McFarlane testified that he was hit in the jaw with a walkie-talkie 
  by the police on the way to the police station and that the police kept asking 
  him who was involved in the robbery. He testified that he was not hit hard – 
  “trying to get me scared; nothing hard”. He was not injured but felt “kind of 
  stunned”.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>May and Lajeunesse brought McFarlane before 
  the officer in charge at the station, Staff Sergeant Pinfold, where he was booked 
  at approximately 11:33 p.m. When Crown counsel sought to elicit testimony from 
  the first witness, Lajeunesse, on what transpired at the time of booking, the 
  trial judge intervened and the following dialogue ensued:</span></p>

  threats, promises and inducements, whether he had made any threats to McFarlane 
  during the time he was with him, the trial judge intervened and said:</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Court:              This is judge alone. Don’t go into that. [Defence

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Lajeunesse and May testified that McFarlane 
  was escorted from the booking area to the interview room in the criminal investigation 
  office where he was strip-searched. Lajeunesse testified that McFarlane was 
  strip-searched for weapons, and that at the time he left him, McFarlane was 
  seated on a bench in the interview room and that he was “re-clothed”. Lajeunesse 
  did not remember when he seized McFarlane’s clothes but he had a note that he 
  handed the clothes to a detective from the forensic identification services 
  at 5:15 a.m. In re-examination Crown counsel sought to elicit from the officer 
  evidence that he had given McFarlane new clothes. The trial judge intervened 
  and correctly noted to Crown counsel that she could have dealt with this in 
  chief. Crown counsel did not pursue her questions, commenting that “Not much

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At approximately 11:50 p.m., Detectives Peter 
  Lacey and Doug Yarenko entered the interview room where McFarlane was seated. 
  Yarenko testified that McFarlane was dressed in white socks and a pair of yellow 
  boxer shorts and that the rest of McFarlane’s clothing was outside in a container. 
  Yarenko testified that he had directed that McFarlane’s clothes be seized so 
  that they could be submitted for forensic testing. He confirmed that McFarlane 
  was not given other clothes until after the interview was completed. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Yarenko testified that he acted as a witness 
  to the interview conducted by Lacey. He stated that Lacey conducted a question-and-answer 
  period from about 11:50 p.m. until about 12:22 a.m. at which time Lacey exited 
  the room to obtain a tape recorder. At 12:24&nbsp;a.m. Lacey returned to the 
  room and a taped conversation was commenced, finishing at 12:46 a.m. Yarenko 
  took no notes of the conversation but later reviewed Lacey’s notes and initialed 
  them. When Yarenko was cross-examined on the paucity of his notes taken between 
  11:50&nbsp;p.m. and 12:22&nbsp;a.m., the trial judge intervened and stated: 
  “Isn’t that something for the jury? He said he read Lacey’s book and signed 
  it. You can do that with the jury. It doesn’t help on the <i>voir dire</i>.”

  </span></span> Yarenko was then cross-examined by counsel for Bogel with respect 
  to records of arrest that had been prepared in relation to both appellants. 
  In particular, counsel noted the reference on the usual form to the prisoner’s 
  right to make reasonable use of the telephone, the space for his signature and 
  the box indicating “call not desired”. Yarenko confirmed that records had been 
  signed by both appellants on the evening in question each indicating a waiver 
  of his right to counsel but that these records were subsequently lost.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Lacey testified that, although at the preliminary 
  hearing he could not recall what McFarlane was wearing, he had since thought 
  about it and now remembered that McFarlane was in his jockey shorts and a pair 
  of socks. He testified that he conducted the interview and took notes of the 
  questions and answers in his notebook. He testified that the following questions 
  and answers represented a full account, albeit not verbatim, of the half-hour

<blockquote>

    <p>Q.            Do you want to talk to us?</p>
    <p>A.            Sure, I’ll tell you what happened.</p>
    <p>Q.            Before you do, I want to warn you that you don’t have to

    <p>A.            No, that’s not necessary.</p>
    <p>Q.            Did the officer read you your rights, and all that?</p>
    <p>A.            Yes.</p>

    <p>A.            The store, people were coming, it was my job to watch.</p>
    <p>At that point I asked him, “Before we go any further, I would like to give

      can continue this conversation on television or I can just get a tape recorder.

  in to speak with him, one of the officers punched him in the face.  The officers 
  told McFarlane to tell them what happened.  McFarlane told them that he didn’t 
  know anything.  The officers kept hitting and punching him.  The hits and punches 
  were rapid.  They kept landing on the same side of his face.  McFarlane testified 
  that the record of the audiotaped statement before the court was actually his 
  third attempt at an audiotaped statement.  The first one “didn’t take” because 
  McFarlane was crying and sniffing too much.  The second one didn’t work out 
  because McFarlane was complaining too much.  McFarlane stated that he was hit

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At the conclusion of McFarlane’s testimony, 
  the trial judge asked counsel for their submissions. Counsel for McFarlane indicated 
  that some of the witnesses that would be called with respect to Bogel’s statements 
  would have some bearing on his position and hence sought leave to reserve his 
  submissions until the end of the <i>voir dire</i>. The trial judge directed 
  counsel to make his submissions now indicating “If it changes, we will revisit 
  it”. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel argued that the circumstances surrounding 
  the taking of McFarlane’s statement gave rise to a reasonable doubt on its voluntariness. 
  Counsel relied mainly on the suspicious sequence of events from his client’s 
  denial of any knowledge about a robbery to his alleged full cooperation with 
  the police and on the conflicting evidence with respect to McFarlane’s state 
  of dress during the police interrogation. He submitted that the officers’ own 
  evidence on this issue should raise a concern with the court. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the Crown submitted that McFarlane’s version of events 
  was incredible. She relied on unlikely aspects of his story, his failure to 
  complain about any injuries, and the absence of cross-examination of Crown witnesses 
  by his counsel concerning his allegations.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following the submissions of both counsel, the

  </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I am satisfied the statement is voluntary in the circumstances of this 
      particular case. I am satisfied Mr. Moore-McFarlane was given his rights, 
      cautioned properly, and he gave the statement. I find it was given by an 
      operating mind, and I am satisfied it was voluntary under the circumstances. 
      Accordingly, it will be admitted. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Upon counsel seeking clarification, the trial

  with Bogel in the police car. Srenensky testified that he asked him his name 
  and,  at 10:31 p.m., he  advised him that he was under arrest for robbery. When 
  asked if he understood, Bogel replied “Yes. My eyes are killing me.” Srenensky

  out from the pepper spray. Srenensky testified that he continued to question 
  Bogel on the way to the hospital asking him his full name, date of birth, the 
  names of the guys who were with him that evening, their nicknames, and who was 
  driving the getaway van.  Bogel responded to the questions as he continued to

  never been pepper sprayed before. When asked to describe the effect, he stated: 
  “To put it in a nutshell, I lost control of my body. I couldn’t move or see. 
  My knees were hurting. I couldn’t breathe.”  He also stated that he felt a lot 
  of pain and discomfort, that the effects had subsided somewhat by the time he 
  reached the hospital but that they continued for sometime after.  Bogel’s account 
  of the conversation with the police officer immediately following his arrest 
  was as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Q.            What happened when you were placed in the cruiser?</p>
    <p>A.            He came in and said, “What’s your name?” and I said, “Paul.”</p>
    <p>Q.            Who came in?</p>
    <p>A.            The officer.  Who the officer was I don’t know because I 
      couldn’t see.</p>
    <p>Q.            What was the nature of the conversation?</p>
    <p>A.            The first thing he said was, “You got pepper sprayed?” and 
      I said, “Yes, my eyes are burning.”  He says, “Stay calm. Don’t move around.  
      Just let the pepper spray take its effect and it will go away.”</p>
    <p>He started to ask me, “Who were you involved with in the robbery?” and 
      I said, “What robbery?  What are you talking about?”</p>
    <p>I got backhanded, and he said, “Don’t play smart with me.”  He said, “Who 
      are your friends?” and I said, “What do you mean?  What friends?  I have 
      a lot of friends.”  He said, “The friends who were with you at the robbery,” 
      and I said, “I don’t know what friends you’re talking about.”  He says, 
      “Who was the driver of the vehicle you were in?”  I said, “Paco”, and I 
      gave the name because I knew the driver.</p>
    <p>Q.            When you were backhanded, what portion of your body was struck?</p>
    <p>A.            To my chin, bottom lip, because I had a cut inside my lip.</p>
    <p>Q.            The lower lip or upper lip?</p>
    <p>A.            Lower lip.</p>
    <p>Q.            From the backhand?</p>
    <p>A.            Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.            Struck any other times in the back of the cruiser?</p>
    <p>A.            He was saying, “Don’t play smart with me.  He knows what 
      went down.  Tell me what happened,” and I said, “I don’t know what you’re 
      talking about.”</p>
    <p>Q.            How long did the conversation last for?</p>
    <p>A.            I wasn’t keeping track of it.</p>
    <p>Q.            Any further conversation in the back of the cruiser, or was 
      that it?</p>
    <p>A.            I was telling him, “I want to talk to my lawyer.  I want 
      a phone call, and I want to talk to my lawyer.  I have nothing to say to 
      you.”</p>

  at 11:06 p.m.  Pinfold, on the other hand, noted his first contact with Bogel 
  at 11:29 p.m. Pinfold testified that Bogel was exhibiting signs consistent with 
  having been pepper sprayed and that he had a cut lip.  Pinfold described that 
  as a prisoner goes through the booking process, he makes sure that the prisoner 
  has been advised of his rights to counsel and that he has been cautioned.  Pinfold

  judge intervened in the cross-examination and asked of counsel if his argument 
  was that there was a loss of the record of arrest. When counsel confirmed that 
  that was his argument, the trial judge stated “You can go to the Court of Appeal 
  on that”. Counsel insisted on putting his position on the record. After a further 
  exchange between counsel and the court, the trial judge directed defence counsel

      with the gun tonight?” and he replied, “Yes, sir.”  I asked, “Do you want 
      to give a statement as to what happened at the variety store tonight?” and

  hold-up squad, concerning the need to videotape interrogations. The trial judge 
  interrupted counsel mid-sentence and instructed the witness that he didn’t need 
  to answer that. When counsel submitted that it was relevant to his cross-examination, 
  the trial judge ruled that it was a matter for argument before him and not for 
  the witness to answer. Counsel accordingly moved on with his cross-examination 
  and simply obtained a confirmation from MacCallum that there had been no discussion 
  with fellow officers prior to questioning Bogel whether audio or videotape facilities 
  would be used, that there was nothing preventing the use of a recording device, 
  and that it had been the officer’s choice not to tape the interview. MacCallum

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel for Bogel argued that his client’s statements 
  should be excluded both under the <i>Charter</i> and at common law. With respect 
  to the <i>Charter</i> argument, counsel relied on his client’s assertion that 
  his repeated requests to speak to a lawyer were denied and on the total lack 
  of confirmation of the police officers’ testimony on the issue of waiver. Counsel 
  placed much reliance in his argument on the fact that several copies of the 
  arrest record which purportedly confirmed that Bogel did not wish to speak to 
  a lawyer had been mysteriously lost. With respect to voluntariness, counsel 
  placed considerable emphasis on the police’s failure to record any of the alleged 
  statements. He submitted that the police officer’s deliberate decision not to 
  record the statements gave rise to a reasonable doubt on their voluntariness 
  particularly given the discrepancies and conflicts in the evidence. Counsel 
  also submitted with respect to the statement allegedly made to Gallant that 
  it was highly prejudicial and unrelated to the matters under investigation. 
  Counsel further submitted that any statements allegedly made by his client while 
  suffering from the effects of pepper spray could not be held to be voluntary.

    <p><span

  of meeting the requirements of the confessions rule. The circumstances surrounding 
  the alleged statements of each appellant gave rise to numerous concerns and 
  it is apparent from the record that the evidence was not subjected to the scrutiny 
  mandated by well-established jurisprudential principles. Before dealing with 
  the evidence, it may be useful to repeat some of these principles here. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The rationale for the rule and its scope have 
  been recently reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hodgson</i> 
  (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 449 and <i>R. v. Oickle</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321. In <i>Hodgson</i>, Cory J., writing for the majority of the Court, reviewed 
  the historical rationale for the rule and its significance in these words (at 
  paras.&nbsp;14 and 15, p.&nbsp;460):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Evidence of a confession has always been accorded great weight by triers 
      of fact. This is a natural manifestation of human experience. It is because 
      of the tremendous significance attributed to confessions and the innate 
      realization that they could be obtained by improper means that <i>the circumstances 
      surrounding a confession have for centuries been carefully scrutinized</i> 
      to determine whether it should be admitted. A confession is not excluded, 
      however, simply because of the risk that a conviction may result, but because 
      of the greater risk that the conviction will be unfairly obtained and unjust. 
      The unfairness of admitting a confession has historically been addressed 
      by a consideration of two factors, First, the voluntariness of the statement; 
      and second, the status of the receiver of the statement, that is to say, 
      whether the receiver was a person in authority. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>As to the first factor, a statement is said to be voluntary when it 
      is made without “fear of prejudice or hope of advantage”: [citations omitted]. 
      In <i>Boudreau v. The King</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 262 at p. 269, Rand J. explained 
      that “the rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated or 
      induced or coerced admission”. Voluntariness also requires that the statement 
      must be the product of an operating mind: [citations omitted]. Voluntariness 
      is determined by <i>a careful investigation of the circumstances </i>surrounding 
      the statement of the accused, and involves a consideration of both objective 
      and subjective factors. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cory J. went on to discuss how the confessions rule is historically 
  rooted in two concerns.  The first concern related to the reliability of the 
  evidence.  He stated (at para.&nbsp;17, p.&nbsp;461):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Indeed, the basis for the admission of a statement of the accused as 
      an exception to the rule against hearsay is that what people freely say 
      which is contrary to their interest is probably true. However, where a statement 
      is prompted by a threat or inducement held out by a person in authority, 
      it can no longer be presumed to be true. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cory J. noted that the second concern is related to the administration 
  of justice and fundamental principles of fairness, in particular the principle 
  against self-incrimination.  After reviewing further authorities, Cory J. observed 
  (at para.&nbsp;18, pp.&nbsp;461-62):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, it is apparent that from its very inception, the confessions 
      rule was designed not only to ensure the reliability of the confession, 
      but also to guarantee fundamental fairness in the criminal process.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Iacobucci J., in writing for the majority in <i>Oickle,</i> set 
  out the scope of the confessions rule. He reviewed much of the same historical 
  development of the confessions rule from the initial focus on the unreliability 
  of a confession arising from threats or promises, to the broader notion of voluntariness 
  that embraces the notion of procedural fairness. He noted that this latter approach 
  is most evident in the “operating mind” doctrine that concerns itself with the 
  coercive effect an atmosphere of oppression created by the police authorities 
  may have on an accused.  Iacobucci J. reiterated that one of the predominant 
  reasons for the concern with voluntariness, broadly defined, “is that involuntary 
  confessions are more likely to be unreliable” (para.&nbsp;32, p.&nbsp;341). 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Hence it is clear from the discussion in <i>Oickle</i> that both 
  elements of the modern confessions rule, the absence of threats or promises 
  and the principles related to the “operating mind”, are closely related to the 
  predominant concern for <i>reliability. </i>Since voluntary confessions are 
  admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, it should come as no surprise 
  that concerns over the reliability of the evidence are at the root of the confessions 
  rule. In turn, the reliability of the evidence is intrinsically connected to 
  trial fairness, the second rationale for the confessions rule. Again here, it 
  is noteworthy that the relationship between reliability and fairness underlies 
  the modern principled approach to hearsay exceptions in general. As noted by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, it would 
  compromise trial fairness and raise the spectre of wrongful convictions, if 
  the Crown were allowed to introduce unreliable hearsay against the accused.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The admission of a confession, as an exception to hearsay, is 
  of course subject to more complex and more stringent requirements than other 
  traditional exceptions. The confessions rule has been adapted and refined in 
  order to address the particular problems raised by the nature of this evidence. 
  As discussed above, the concept of voluntariness is broadly defined to address 
  both reliability and fairness concerns. The concern over fairness extends not 
  only to the potential unfairness caused by the admission of the evidence at 
  the trial itself, but also to the protection of the accused’s rights during 
  the investigative process. As Cory J. noted in <i>Hodgson</i>, the two rationales 
  (reliability and fairness) “blend together so as to ensure fair treatment to 
  the accused in the criminal process by deterring coercive state tactics” (at 
  para.&nbsp;21, p.&nbsp;463). And, as noted by Iacobucci J. in <i>Oickle</i>, 
  it is also important in defining the confessions rule “to keep in mind its twin 
  goals of protecting the rights of the accused without unduly limiting society’s 
  need to investigate and solve crimes” (para.&nbsp;33, p.&nbsp;341).  Finally, 
  because the admission of a confession may prove conclusive of the guilt of the 
  accused, the higher onus of proof beyond a reasonable doubt must be met before 
  the evidence will be admitted: <i>R. v. Egger</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451 at 474-75. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is important to distinguish between reliability 
  as a concept underlying the notion of voluntariness at the admissibility stage 
  and the ultimate questions of reliability and weight that remain, as with all 
  evidence, determinations for the triers of fact. The first has been commonly 
  referred to as the “threshold reliability” in the general context of the principled 
  approach to hearsay exceptions. In the particular context of confessions, Cory&nbsp;J. 
  in <i>Hodgson</i> referred to the “putative reliability” of the evidence. Hence, 
  he noted that the purpose of the confessions rule was to exclude statements 
  that were inherently unreliable because they were obtained by force, threats, 
  or promises [or in an atmosphere of oppression] but that it did not inquire 
  into the truth or falsity of the statement. “Rather it focuses on putative reliability, 
  by analysing the circumstances surrounding the statement and their effect on 
  the accused, regardless of the statement’s accuracy.” (para.&nbsp;21, p.&nbsp;463). 
  Hence, it is only consonant with the general principled approach to hearsay 
  exceptions that the court, as part of its inquiry into the voluntariness of 
  a confession, should look for circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that 
  sufficiently address the dangers associated by this kind of evidence. </span></p>

  videotape, of all custodial interrogations and waivers of the s.&nbsp;10(b)

  (at para.&nbsp;46, pp.&nbsp;344-45):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Before turning to how the confessions rule responds to these dangers, I 
      would like to comment briefly on the growing practice of recording police 
      interrogations, preferably by videotape.  As pointed out by J. J. Furedy 
      and J. Liss in “Countering Confessions Induced by the Polygraph: Of Confessionals 
      and Psychological Rubber Hoses” (1986), 29 Crim.L.Q. 91 at 104, even if 
      “notes were accurate concerning the <i>content</i> of what was said . . 
      ., the notes cannot reflect the <i>tone</i> of what was said and any body 
      language that may have been employed” (emphasis in original).  White [W.&nbsp;S. 
      White, “False Confessions and the Constitution: Safeguards Against Untrustworthy 
      Confessions” (1997), 32 Harv. C.R.-C.L.L. Rev. 105], at p.&nbsp;153-54, 
      similarly offers four reasons why videotaping is important:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>First, it provides a means by which courts can monitor interrogation 
          practices and thereby enforce the other safeguards.  Second, it deters 
          the police from employing interrogation methods likely to lead to untrustworthy 
          confessions.  Third, it enables courts to make more informed judgments 
          about whether interrogation practices were likely to lead to an untrustworthy 
          confession.  Finally, mandating this safeguard accords with sound public 
          policy because the safeguard will have the additional salutary effects 
          besides reducing untrustworthy confessions, including more net benefits 
          for law enforcement.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>This is not to suggest that non-recorded interrogations are inherently 
      suspect; it is simply to make the obvious point that when a recording is 
      made, it can greatly assist the trier of fact in assessing the confession.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel submits further that the appellants 
  have confused issues of weight with issues of admissibility. Since it is for 
  the trier of fact to determine the ultimate reliability of the statement, including 
  whether it was in fact made, and the weight that should be attached to it, it 
  is submitted that a failure to accurately or completely record an accused’s 
  statement should not render the statement inadmissible. </span></p>

  </span></span> I agree that there is no absolute rule requiring the recording 
  of statements.   It is clear from the analysis in both <i>Hodgson</i> and <i>Oickle</i> 
  that the inquiry into voluntariness is contextual in nature and that all relevant 
  circumstances must be considered. Iacobbuci J. says so expressly in <i>Oickle</i> 
  in the following words (at para.&nbsp;47, p.&nbsp;345):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The application of the rule will by necessity be contextual. Hard and 
      fast rules simply cannot account for the variety of circumstances that vitiate 
      the voluntariness of a confession, and would inevitably result in a rule 
      that would be both over-and under-inclusive. A trial judge should therefore 
      consider all the relevant factors when reviewing a confession. </span></p>

  </span></span> However, the Crown bears the onus of establishing a sufficient 
  record of the interaction between the suspect and the police. That onus may 
  be readily satisfied by the use of audio, or better still, video recording. 
  Indeed, it is my view that where the suspect is in custody, recording facilities 
  are readily available, and the police deliberately set out to interrogate the 
  suspect without giving any thought to the making of a reliable record, the context 
  inevitably makes the resulting non-recorded interrogation <i>suspect</i>.  In 
  such cases, it will be a matter for the trier of fact to determine whether or 
  not a sufficient substitute for an audio or video tape record has been provided 
  to satisfy the heavy onus on the Crown to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The sufficiency of the record does not go exclusively 
  to the question of ultimate reliability and weight as contended by the Crown. 
  One of the cases relied upon by the Crown on this point is the decision of this 
  court in <i>R. v. Lapointe and Sicotte</i> (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 366 (C.A.) 
  aff’d (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 287 (S.C.C.) where the court stated as follows 
  (at para.&nbsp;37, p.&nbsp;380): </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Questions regarding the accuracy of the recording of an accused person’s 
      words by reason of unconscious editing on the part of the police have to 
      do with the authenticity of the statement and do not fall to be decided 
      by the judge on the <i>voir dire</i>.  If he does so, as apparently the 
      learned trial judge did in the present case, he is usurping the function 
      of the trier of fact.  The 12 bilingual jurors at this trial were eminently 
      capable of resolving the issues of accurate or inaccurate recording of the 
      respondents’ words, of unconscious or deliberate inaccuracy, editing or 
      deliberate fabrication.  They are issues of authenticity and are not to 
      be confused with issues of admissibility. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is important to read this statement of principle 
  in context. The issue that arose in <i>Lapointe</i> – whether the accused’s 
  capacity to understand English was sufficient for him to have given the statement 
  alleged by the police officers – was one that related to the ultimate reliability 
  of the statement and the weight that was to be attached to it. As the court 
  stated, it was only where an accused’s capacity was so deficient as to make 
  it impossible for him to have given a statement that the trial judge would be 
  justified in excluding the statement on that basis. Hence the court concluded 
  that, in this case, this issue was not a matter to be determined at the <i>voir 
  dire</i> stage of the proceedings. The decision in <i>Lapointe</i> does not 
  stand for the proposition that <i>all</i> issues of accuracy and completeness 
  of recording are left to the triers of fact. Such an interpretation would run 
  contrary to centuries of jurisprudence that require careful scrutiny of the 
  circumstances surrounding the taking of a statement by persons in authority. 
  And, in my view, the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the record have 
  everything to do with the court’s inquiry into and scrutiny of the circumstances 
  surrounding the taking of the statement. Indeed, it is difficult to see how 
  the Crown could discharge its heavy onus of proving voluntariness beyond a reasonable 
  doubt where proper recording procedures are not followed.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is clear that, while determining the legal 
  test of voluntariness is a question of law, its application to the evidence 
  is a question of fact or of mixed law and fact. A trial judge’s finding of voluntariness

  the absence of legal error in determining the test, or overriding and palpable

  urges this court to apply the presumption that the trial judge knows the law 
  and that he has correctly applied it to the facts. She notes that the trial

  by the evidence and that an appellate court should not conclude, on the basis 
  of a lack of reasons alone, that the trial judge misapprehended the issue of 
  voluntariness or misapplied any legal principle relating to that issue. However, 
  the usual presumption cannot be relied upon where the record reveals that the 
  trial judge has founded his decision on incorrect principles of law or has misapplied 
  the correct legal test, or where the evidence does not support the trial judge’s

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this case, many of the trial judge’s interventions 
  and rulings during the course of the <i>voir dire</i> strongly suggest that 
  the trial judge either misapprehended the governing test on voluntariness, or 
  failed to apply it to the evidence. I note the following in support of this 
  conclusion:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(i) On more than one occasion, the trial judge readily questioned the 
      relevance of the evidence presented by the Crown in relation to any of the 
      events that transpired before<i> </i>the interrogation in the interview 
      room actually commenced. These interventions suggest a lack of appreciation 
      of the need to scrutinize <i>all</i> of the circumstances surrounding the 
      taking of a statement. </span></p>
    <p>(ii) The trial judge directed Crown counsel not to examine the police witnesses 
      on whether there had been any threats  because “this was not a judge alone 
      trial”. As noted earlier, the inquiry into whether any threats or promises 
      were made to induce the confession lies at the core of the confessions rule 
      and is not simply a matter going to the issue of ultimate reliability or 
      weight of the evidence.   </p>
    <p>(iii) The trial judge expressed agreement with Crown counsel’s comment 
      early on in the <i>voir dire</i> that “not much turned” on the question 
      of McFarlane’s possible state of undress during the interrogation. This 
      comment suggests that the trial judge misapprehended the compelling nature 
      of this evidence on the question whether the alleged confession was given 
      in oppressive circumstances that negated any voluntariness.  </p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(iv) The trial judge curtailed defence counsel’s cross-examination 
      on the paucity of the notes taken by one of the recording officers in the 
      interview room on the basis that this line of questioning was not helpful 
      on the <i>voir dire</i> and that this was a matter for the jury. As discussed 
      earlier, the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the record is intrinsically 
      related to the Crown’s onus on the <i>voir dire</i> and is not simply a 
      matter going to the ultimate reliability and weight of the evidence. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(v) The trial judge directed counsel for McFarlane to make his submissions 
      mid-way through the <i>voir dire</i> notwithstanding the indication from 
      counsel that other witnesses who were going to be called by the Crown with 
      respect to Bogel’s alleged statements were expected to give evidence that 
      would be relevant to his client’s position. Although the trial judge told 
      counsel that the issue could be revisited later if need be, he immediately 
      ruled on the issue of voluntariness before hearing those additional witnesses. 
      This approach suggests that the trial judge failed to consider all relevant 
      circumstances in determining voluntariness. In this case it caused actual 
      prejudice to the appellant McFarlane because the evidence adduced by the 
      Crown that directly concerned Bogel was indeed capable of lending credence 
      to the position advanced by McFarlane on the treatment he had received that 
      night.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(vi) The trial judge’s curtailment of defence counsel’s cross-examination 
      of the police officers on the lost records of arrest suggests that the trial 
      judge misapprehended the significance of this evidence on the question of 
      waiver of the right to counsel. In the absence of any recording, the records 
      of arrest would have provided the only confirmatory evidence of each appellant’s 
      waiver of his right to counsel. The trial judge’s failure to refer to or 
      even adjudicate on Bogel’s s.10(b) <i>Charter</i> application further suggests 
      that he was not alive to the issue. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(vii) In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge’s curtailment 
      of defence counsel’s cross-examination on the police officers’ knowledge 
      of the legal requirement that a proper record be made undermined the significance 
      of the officers’ decision not to record some of the statements. </span></p>
    <p>(viii) The trial judge’s apparent prejudgment that Short’s testimony would 
      necessarily corroborate that of his fellow officer before hearing the testimony 
      in question unfortunately further compromised the appearance of fairness 
      in the  conduct of this proceeding. </p>

  </span></span> An issue arose as to what transpired in the police cruiser when 
  McFarlane was transported to the police station. McFarlane alleged that he was 
  hit with a walkie-talkie. He also alleged that he was aggressively questioned 
  by the police about the robbery without having had the opportunity to consult 
  counsel. The police officers denied any acts of violence or conversation in 
  the cruiser. However, the police witnesses presented a very casual and poor 
  recording of the events between the time of arrest at 10:16 p.m. and the appellant’s 
  booking at the station close to one and a half hours later at 11:33 p.m.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>McFarlane’s allegation that he was naked during 
  the interrogation at the police station raised a serious concern that his statement 
  was taken in oppressive conditions that may have impacted on its voluntariness. 
  Even on the Crown’s evidence, taken at its highest, a serious issue arose as 
  to the propriety of leaving a suspect scantily clad in his underwear and socks 
  during the course of an interview with the police. One additional factor in 
  particular should have heightened the concern on this issue: McFarlane was a 
  young black male, with no apparent experience with the criminal justice system; 
  the officers were white. Further, the serious inconsistencies in the police 
  officers’ evidence on the question of McFarlane’s state of dress and the vagueness 
  of their testimony raised serious credibility issues. Finally, the evidence 
  on this point had to be considered in the context of the police officers’ decision 
  not to videotape the interview. </span></p>

  the events that transpired during the first part of the interview with McFarlane, 
  between 11:50 p.m. and 12:22 a.m., raised a serious issue of credibility given 
  the short conversation that was noted. The concern over the reliability of the 
  record was further heightened by McFarlane’s allegation that he had given three 
  statements on tape, the third one alone finding its way into court because he 
  had finally got it right. Finally, the officers’ decision not to videotape the 
  interview or audio tape the first part of the interview was a very important 
  factor to consider. </span></p>

  a reliable record. </span></p>

  on this issue. The loss of the record of arrest, the decision not to record

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is clear in these circumstances that the 
  trial judge’s findings on voluntariness cannot stand. Further, given the importance 
  of this evidence in the context of the other evidence at trial, this is not 
  a proper case for the application of the curative proviso. There is a very real 
  danger that the jury convicted each appellant on the basis of their alleged 
  confessions alone without giving proper consideration to the other issues raised

  a <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility of any alleged confession. 
  However, in this case, it is my view that the evidence falls far short of meeting 
  the test of voluntariness. Quite apart from any question of credibility of the 
  appellants’ testimony and the police officers’ evidence on the <i>voir dire 
  </i>on issues related to voluntariness, a matter that would require a determination 
  by a trial judge, it is my view that the Crown cannot meet its heavy onus of 
  proving voluntariness based on the evidence adduced in this case. The serious 
  deficiencies alone in the overall recording by the police authorities of the 
  events that transpired while the two appellants were in police custody on the 
  evening in question militate against any reasonable finding that the statements

  statement to Gallant to the effect that things might have been different if 
  “he had had his crew behind him” should not have been admitted at trial. The 
  alleged statement was suggestive of a general involvement in crime and constituted 
  evidence of bad character. It was highly prejudicial, of no probative value

  within the trial judge’s discretion in controlling the challenge-for-cause process 
  so as to prevent its abuse and ensure that the process is fair to the prospective 
  juror as well as to the accused person. On appeal, the trial judge’s decision 
  is entitled to deference and should not be interfered with unless the appellant 
  can demonstrate that the trial judge committed a clear error in principle in 
  the exercise of his or her discretion, or that the trial judge’s decision resulted

      see whether that juror is acceptable to sit on the jury that will try the 
      two accused persons on the charges.  If they are found acceptable, and they 
      are accepted by counsel, that potential juror goes on to be jury member.  
      That particular juror takes over the place of one of the triers.  The No.&nbsp;1 
      trier goes back into the jury panel, so there is No.&nbsp;1 juror and the 
      No.&nbsp;2 trier who are the triers of the second potential juror, to see 
      if that potential juror is accepted.  If that juror is accepted, those two 
      jurors become the triers of the third, and then three and four do five, 
      and four and five do six, until we have twelve picked.  It takes about an 
      hour.  That is how we will do it for the challenge for cause.</p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then provided the following instructions to 
  the first two triers:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each potential juror will come up here and they will be asked a question 
      and on their answer you will be asked do you find that juror acceptable 
      or unacceptable to try the two people before the court.  If you find them 
      acceptable, counsel will say they find them acceptable.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>No further instructions were given during the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>These instructions, in my view, did not adequately 
  assist the jury in understanding the nature of their task and the procedure 
  they were to follow. The triers were not told that they were to decide the question 
  on the balance of probabilities, that the decision had to be that of both of 
  them, that they could retire to the jury room or discuss the matter right where 
  they were and that if they could not agree within a reasonable time, they were 
  to say so: see <i>R. v. Hubbert</i> (1975), 29 C.C.C.(2d) 279 at 294 (Ont. C.A.) 
  aff’d (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 207 (S.C.C.). It would also have been preferable 
  if the jury had been provided more assistance in understanding the meaning of 
  partiality or acceptability, and the importance and purpose of the challenge 
  for cause process. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, with respect to the denial of defence 
  counsel’s request to make submissions to the triers, I do not agree that counsel’s 
  request should have been granted as of right. As with the issue of excluding 
  the jury panel, this is a discretionary matter for the trial judge to determine 
  depending on the circumstances. Absent an error in principle or a demonstration 
  of a miscarriage of justice, appellate intervention is unwarranted. In this 
  case, I find it sufficient to note that any need for submissions that may be 
  apparent from the record could have been alleviated by proper instructions to 
  the triers from the trial judge. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would therefore also give effect to this ground 
  of appeal on the basis of the inadequacy of the instructions. </span></p>
<h3>V.          Disposition</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would allow each appellant’s 
  appeal against conviction, quash the convictions and order a new trial. </span></p>
