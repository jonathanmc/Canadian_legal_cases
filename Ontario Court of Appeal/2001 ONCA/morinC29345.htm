  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On July 19, 1994 Loomis Armoured Car Services 
  discovered that a bag containing $120,000 in cash was missing from one of its 
  trucks. The appellant was convicted of theft and possession of stolen property 
  on February 27, 1997. She was subsequently sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. 
  She appeals against conviction, and sentence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was originally charged in the same indictment as 
  Angele Brisson<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>. Ms. Brisson was 
  the driver of the Loomis truck on the morning of July 19, 1994. She and two 
  other Loomis employees were replenishing automated banking machines along a 
  twenty three-stop route, from cash bags pre-packed for each individual stop. 
  The missing bag was intended for the 10<sup>th </sup>stop along the route. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant was a former Loomis employee, 
  and therefore familiar with company procedures. She and Ms. Brisson were common-law 
  partners in July 1994. The theory of the Crown was that Ms. Brisson either handed 
  the missing bag to the appellant, or threw it into a bush for later recovery 
  by the appellant, at the second stop along the route, while the two other crew 
  members replenished the bank machines at that location. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Crown’s case against the appellant was presented 
  in three parts. In the first part, Loomis employees testified about money packing 
  procedures and the chain of events leading to loading the truck driven by Ms. 
  Brisson on July 19, 1994. In the second part, the Crown adduced cell phone records, 
  records from the appellant's health club, and other evidence designed to establish 
  the appellant’s whereabouts on the morning in question. In the third part, the 
  Crown led evidence of the appellant’s spending patterns and lifestyle, both 
  before and after the offence. The third part of the Crown’s case included evidence 
  from a Mr. Catellier, who rented a room from the appellant for several months 
  in the early part of 1996, after she was charged with these offences.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In addition to his observations of the appellant’s 
  house and sources of income, Mr. Catellier testified about the appellant’s responses 
  to questions he asked her about the offence. He said that while the appellant 
  never admitted anything, she did not deny any involvement either. Mr. Catellier 
  felt the appellant was playing a game with him. She would not agree with his 
  suggestions, but she would laugh or blush at his questions. If he went off the 
  track in his comments about how things proceeded, she would bring him back on 
  track. Mr. Catellier also mentioned a photograph he saw of the appellant and 
  Ms. Brisson, pictured seated, with a 16 - 20 inch stack of cash between them.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant raised seven issues on the conviction 
  appeal. Six arose out of the instructions to the jury. The seventh challenges 
  the trial judge’s ruling granting a short adjournment when Mr. Catellier emerged 
  as a Crown witness after the trial started. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The ground of appeal arising out of the trial judge’s ruling 
  after the Crown advised that Mr. Catellier would be a witness requires little 
  analysis. In the circumstances an adjournment to allow counsel to consider the 
  disclosure provided concerning Mr. Catellier’s evidence, and to reassess its 
  case was the appropriate remedy.  This was not a case for a stay or even a mistrial. 
  The length of the adjournment was primarily a matter for the trial judge. We 
  cannot say that the length of the adjournment granted was inadequate and compromised 
  the appellant’s right to make full answer and defense.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We called on the Crown only with respect to 
  three of the issues arising out of the charge to the jury. A fourth issue arose 
  in argument. These reasons address only those four issues.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge did not frame his comments to 
  the jury in terms of a standard unsavoury witness warning, however, he did point 
  out the circumstances creating a need for caution in assessing Mr. Catellier’s 
  evidence. In particular, the trial judge reviewed the evidence concerning both 
  Mr. Catellier’s contact with Loomis and his subsequent dealings with the police. 
  He pointed out that negotiations for a reward fell apart after Mr. Catellier 
  was told he would have to testify. He reviewed Mr. Catellier’s extensive criminal 
  record in great detail. He reminded the jury that the appellant had denied “that 
  she ever played a game with Catellier”, and pointed out that it was a question 
  of pure credibility. Finally, he told the jury that they “had to look at [Catellier’s 
  evidence] very carefully”.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>There was no objection at trial to the trial 
  judge’s instructions to the jury concerning Mr. Catellier’s evidence. Mr. Catellier 
  was neither an accomplice nor a jailhouse informant. In the circumstances, we 
  are satisfied that the trial judge adequately conveyed to the jury the need 
  for caution in assessing his evidence.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Although the primary position of the defence 
  was that the Crown had not proven that the appellant was involved in a theft 
  that may have occurred at the second stop along Ms. Brisson’s route, the defence 
  also relied on evidence of lax procedures on the part of Loomis vault employees 
  [particularly Mr. Toombers], involved in storing cash bags and turning them 
  over to truck crew members and of the specific crew member [Mr. Hodges] alleged 
  to have loaded the missing cash bag onto the truck on July 19, 1994. In reviewing 
  the defence position, the trial judge said the following in his initial charge:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now you start with something that you do know happened, that is the theft. 
      There is a bag that was stolen. I don’t think there is any question about 
      that, and both counsel have not denied that a theft took place, or not tried 
      to influence you by saying that there was no such thing. You start with 
      those things that are, first of all, well known, and when you think the 
      bag disappears, when, <b>first of all, you ask yourselves, I think, when 
      you think that the bag disappeared. Was it at Jockvale or was it prior, 
      when Hodges was going down to the back of his truck and opening it up, I 
      suppose there would be a moment there where someone might have walked by 
      and picked it up, but, Hodges has said they wouldn’t have time to do it. 
      He said that emphatically…he had further insisted, he was adamant about 
      the fact that there were 23 bags that he had put into the truck … <u>Now, 
      it wouldn’t have happened, I think, in the cash cage or in the vault because 
      there were too many signatures involved and I think you have to pretty well 
      accept the evidence of both [of the Loomis employees]</u>  </b>… Now, Hodges 
      … was observed in the video there taking up each bag … there is evidence 
      that he had put these bags in just as they came out of the vault, itself. 
      <b>In any event, he had signed for 23, and he has said that he had counted 
      23, and that they had gone in the truck. </b>So, you have to determine when, 
      is this the proper time at Jockvale that this theft took place, and of course 
      if it isn’t, then if somebody else had taken it, or if there is evidence 
      of that, and there isn’t, there doesn’t appear to be any evidence of anyone 
      else taking it, but, if there had been evidence or was evidence…[emphasis 
      added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Defence counsel objected to this aspect of the 
  charge. She submitted that the trial judge had effectively “obliterated” the 
  defence theory that “the bag could have gone missing even before Hodges took 
  his custody of those bags”, including the manner in which Mr. Toombers transferred 
  the bags to Mr. Hodges without counting them, and the fact that there had been 
  evidence that the bags had not been recounted in the vault the night before. 
  Defence counsel asserted that it was open for the jury to reject Mr. Hodges’ 
  evidence that he had counted the bags properly before putting them on the truck. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge explained that he was under 
  the impression that the defence had agreed that the bag had gone into the truck. 
  Counsel clarified that although she had agreed there was nothing she “could 
  do about the cash cage people”, she had not conceded with respect to the vault. 
  The trial judge re-charged the jury as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, we go back to, I think I said that Mr. Hodges, it shouldn’t go back 
      beyond him with respect to the bag being missing, but Mr. Toombers said 
      he hadn’t counted them or anything. He just handed them over, and there 
      was some comparison in the evidence that the same thing happened the week 
      before … what happened the week before has nothing to do with this trial 
      … because we are talking about theft here that appears to have taken place. 
      The other [incident] was just a lost bag and was found. So, those are two 
      different matters. Mr. Hodges on that point was heard to say, I wish I had 
      made a good count, but at other times, he did mention that there were 23 
      bags that went into the truck, that he had counted them. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge’s reference, in the re-charge, 
  to Mr. Hodges having said he wished he had made a good count, was actually an 
  erroneous reference to a comment made by Mr. Toombers in his evidence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Although the trial judge did not review the 
  evidence concerning pre-loading procedures in detail in the re-charge, he did 
  effectively re-open the question of whether the bags were properly counted before 
  they went onto the truck, and therefore left with the jury the question of whether 
  the theft could have occurred prior to loading. Defence counsel made no further 
  objection in relation to the re-charge. We must accordingly assume that defence 
  counsel was satisfied that, even if not perfectly conveyed, the trial judge 
  adequately conveyed the defence position to the jury. Appellate counsel’s assertion, 
  that at trial the defence contested the chain of custody of the missing bag 
  from <i>the cash cage</i> onward, is not borne out by the record. We would not 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant makes a general submission that 
  the trial judge’s charge on reasonable doubt “is weak”, and also says that when 
  responding to a question from the jury, a trial judge’s charge should be “full, 
  comprehensive, and accurate, including repeating the definition of reasonable 
  doubt already used in the main charge”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge said the following about reasonable 
  doubt:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, the matter of reasonable doubt, that is the definition, and reasonable 
      doubt is such a doubt that reasonable and honest Jurors may entertain after 
      they have heard and carefully and conscientiously considered the facts of 
      the case. It is a real doubt, a genuine doubt, an honest doubt, and a sensible 
      doubt, and it is one that is founded on reason which arises from the evidence, 
      or from the lack of evidence, one or the other, evidence or lack of evidence, 
      through which a Juror possesses a good reason for entertaining.</p>
    <p>Now, it is not a mathematical certainty, like, two plus two equals four, 
      but, in any event, if you have such a reasonable doubt, then the accused 
      is entitled to an acquittal. I have to tell you, however, that it cannot 
      be a doubt which is based on a stretch of the imagination in order to allow 
      a member of this Jury to avoid his or her plain duty. You might feel that 
      you can impose a verdict of guilty on someone and you create a stretch of 
      the imagination based on what you think is a reasonable doubt, but where 
      a reasonable doubt really doesn’t exist. So, it can’t be that kind of a 
      doubt.</p>
    <p>Now, on the other hand, after you have carefully and conscientiously considered 
      the evidence, reviewed the facts and so forth, there remains an abiding 
      assurance of her guilt and of course, your solemn duty would be to bring 
      in a verdict of guilty on that occasion. There used to be a question of 
      moral certainty, but, we don’t do that anymore.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In responding to a question from the jury: “[p]lease review the 
  process by which one determines reasonable doubt”, the trial judge explained 
  that “reasonable doubt is not a process but it is a state of mind…” He reiterated 
  the burden of proof and, other than referring to mathematical certainty, substantially 
  repeated both his instructions on reasonable doubt and the <i>W.(D.)</i> <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a>instruction.</p>

  Carriere<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a></i>, 
  released October 30, 2001, the trial judge said two things, which, after <i>R. 
  v. Lifchus</i> <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>, 
  he should not have said. The trial judge should not have told the jury that 
  a reasonable doubt is a doubt for which they can ascribe a reason. Further, 
  he should not have referred to the “timid juror”, who finds reasonable doubt 
  as a means of avoiding his or her duty. Finally, the trial judge failed to mention 
  one matter he ought to have addressed, namely that proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt involves more than proof of probable guilt, and is much closer to certainty 
  than to probable guilt.</p>

  none of the enumerated defects should be viewed as fatal. Rather, the task of 
  an appellate court reviewing a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> charge is to determine whether 
  the charge, read as a whole, gives rise to a reasonable likelihood that the 
  jury misapprehended the correct standard of proof: <i>R. v. Avetysan</i>, (2000),

  the trial judge did not distinguish the criminal standard of proof from the 
  civil standard, he said nothing that would have misled the jury into thinking 
  that they should use the same standard for decision-making as individuals use 
  on a day-to-day basis. The trial judge’s use of language such as “carefully 
  and conscientiously”, and “solemn duty”, would have conveyed to the jury the 
  significance of the occasion, and the degree of care involved in the decision 
  they were making. Further, the trial judge’s reference to “an abiding assurance 
  of guilt” would have been a clear indication of the high standard of proof required.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>As in <i>Carriere</i>, the accused testified, 
  and the trial judge told the jury that, even if they did not believe her evidence, 
  they must acquit if left with a reasonable doubt by the totality of the evidence, 
  including the evidence of the accused. This aspect of the <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction 
  makes it clear that a criminal case is not to be decided based on the jury’s 
  perception of who is <i>probably</i> telling the truth. Rather, an acquittal 
  is required if the jury is left in a state of reasonable doubt by the accused’s 
  evidence. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Having assessed the charge as a whole, we see 
  no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of 
  proof in this case. Moreover, we are satisfied that the trial judge’s response 
  to the jury’s question was full and substantially complete. No objection was 
  made at trial either to this aspect of the original charge, or to his response 
  to the jury’s question. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Trial

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Catellier testified that the appellant never 
  acknowledged to him that she committed the offences. He was cross-examined by 
  defence counsel about a statement he made to the police in which he said that 
  both the appellant and Brisson admitted responsibility for the offences. The 
  trial judge referred to this evidence of an out-of-court statement in his charge, 
  however he did not instruct the jury about the use that can be made of such 
  evidence. Specifically, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that, unless 
  adopted by the witness while testifying, evidence of an out-of-court statement 
  cannot be used for the purpose of proving the truth of its contents. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant did not raise this issue on appeal. 
  We note that it was the defence that adduced the evidence of Mr. Catellier’s 
  out-of-court statement, and that neither the Crown, nor the defence, invited 
  the jury to treat it as proof of the truth of its content. Although we consider 
  that it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have instructed the 
  jury concerning the use that may be made of evidence of out-of-court statements, 
  the failure to do so does not amount to reversible error in these circumstances.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We disagree. The offences committed by the appellant 
  are extremely serious and amounted to a breach of trust. Although the appellant 
  no longer worked for Loomis at the time of the offences, her co-accused did. 
  The offenders used their knowledge of Loomis’ practises, and the co-accused’s 
  position at Loomis, to perpetrate a significant crime, motivated entirely by 
  greed. The offences placed other Loomis employees under a cloud of suspicion. 
  None of the stolen funds have been recovered. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In our view, the trial judge would have been 
  justified in imposing a significantly longer sentence, even on a first offender. 
  A twelve-month conditional sentence would be unfit. Given that fact, the principle
