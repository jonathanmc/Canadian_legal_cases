lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal by the defendants (other than Trish Wood, who 
  made a personal assignment in bankruptcy on September 23, 1999) from the judgment 
  of Bellamy J., after a judge alone trial, released on November 19, 1999.  Her 
  reasons for judgment are reported at (1999), 47 C.C.L.T. (2d) 272 (Sup. Ct.).  
  The judgment awarded the plaintiff, Dr. Martin G. Myers (“Myers”) general damages 
  in the amount of $200,000 for defamation arising from the defendant’s production 
  and broadcasting of a one hour episode on television.  Myers cross-appeals the 
  dismissal of his claim for aggravated and punitive damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The episode, entitled “The Heart of The Matter”, was shown on 
  a CBC feature program known <i>as “the fifth estate”</i>, known to engage in 
  investigative journalism.  The program was shown once on the CBC’s main television 
  channel to an audience of one million people and four times on its Newsworld 
  channel to audiences totalling 400,000.  (The trial judge held that the Newsworld 
  audiences totalled 200,000.  The court was advised during the hearing of this 
  appeal and a parallel appeal involving Dr. Frans H. H. Leenen, that the correct 
  figure was 400,000).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The episode involved consideration of drugs 
  prescribed for the treatment of heart disease and specifically the work of Health 
  Canada’s Health Protection Branch (“HPB”) respecting medications called Calcium 
  Channel Blockers (“CCBs”) and in particular one called nifedipine, manufactured 
  by Bayer, a large pharmaceutical company.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The thesis of the program appears to have been 
  that nifedipine, in its short-acting capsule form which was approved by Health 
  Canada for the treatment of angina but was being prescribed by doctors for both 
  angina and hypertension, was turning out to be more of a hazard than a help 
  and that HPB was not moving quickly or positively enough in determining whether 
  nifedipine, in its long-acting pill form, was also more of a hazard than a help.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The mechanics of the program included excerpts from interviews 
  by Wood with an insider or a former insider from HPB to establish the theme.  
  Then other authorities were introduced, including Myers, again by excerpts from 
  interviews by Wood, to provide their respective views on the questions raised.  
  As found by the trial judge and as amply supported by my viewing a video tape 
  of the program, this format permitted the creation of a “good guy/bad guy” scenario.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> What is complained of is that by a sophisticated “cut and paste” 
  process Myers was portrayed as one of the bad guys, largely by the use of his 
  own statements.  The complaint is not that his words or any of the statements 
  made are false or defamatory in their true and natural meanings, but rather 
  that “the overall impression created by the words and the images is alleged 
  to be defamatory”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It was alleged that the program made the following 
  innuendoes:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Dr. Myers realized that nifedipine was killing thousands of patients 
      and did not care;</p>
    <p>(ii) In recommending the long-acting pills of nifedipine, Dr. Myers was 
      dishonest;</p>
    <p>(iii) His opinion was completely contrary to accepted medical practice 
      and hence he did not know what he was talking about or was intentionally 
      misleading the Canadian public;</p>
    <p>(iv) Dr. Myers was helping Bayer push a dangerous capsule and pill which 
      he knew to be dangerous;</p>
    <p>(v) He was trying to stifle valid and accurate revelations of nifedipine’s 
      capacity to kill patients;</p>
    <p>(vi) In his role as a member of the committee selected by the HPB to review 
      nifedipine and CCBs, he acted dishonestly;</p>
    <p>(vii) He did not have the competence or stature to be on the  committee; 
      and</p>
    <p>(viii) He refused to be interviewed again because he was afraid the truth 
      would be revealed that he was dishonest.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>After a very thorough analysis of the evidence 
  and of the law the trial judge concluded that all eight innuendoes were defamatory 
  and were proven based on the evidence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> She then found that although the subject matter was one of public 
  interest, the occasion was not such as to impose any duty to communicate the 
  defamatory information to the public.  Accordingly, it was not an occasion of 
  qualified privilege and the protection applicable to such an occasion did not 
  apply.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then turned to the question of fair comment, 
  determining (1) that the broadcast did contain true facts which could support 
  the innuendoes and (2) that it was a matter of public interest.  The next part 
  of the fair comment test is whether the comment was one through which a fair-minded 
  person could honestly come to the defamatory conclusion based on the facts proved.  
  In this regard the trial judge noted:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The long arm of the defence of fair comment highlights the importance we 
      ascribe to freedom of expression in our society.  We place a high value 
      on this freedom and recognize that it is not the job of the courts to tell 
      TV producers, researchers or editors how to do their jobs.  While we expect 
      responsible journalism, and arguably, especially from the CBC, there is 
      little room for courts to censor what they do.  Reporters do not have to 
      meet an objective standard of care in reporting.  The only constraint on 
      their freedom to make damaging comments is that their comments must be fair, 
      in the sense of satisfying the branches of the common law defence of fair 
      comment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>She then reviewed each innuendo in context and 
  in detail, concluding that number six was protected by the defence of fair comment 
  but that insofar as the rest were concerned, they:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . do not fall within the defence of fair comment.  Although there are 
      single facts which support the damaging innuendoes, I cannot accept that 
      a fair-minded person, or any person, could honestly come to these conclusions, 
      when all the proved facts on which the CBC relied, both reported and unreported, 
      are considered.  While the defence of fair comment provides broad protection 
      to journalists to publish whatever they want, it also imposes a minimal 
      standard of fairness which has not been met.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then returned to the question of malice and again, 
  after an exhaustive analysis, found against the defendants.  This finding rendered 
  the defence of fair comment unavailable to innuendo number six.  The trial judge 
  then found the defendants liable in damages with respect to all eight innuendoes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In fairness to Mr. Tunley, counsel for the appellants, it must 
  be said that he used every possible argument to attack the judgment.  Having 
  said that, I am not persuaded that the trial judge made any palpable or overriding 
  error dealing with the facts or any legal error of significance.  On the contrary 
  her reasons present a meticulous, logical, coherent and accurate analysis of 
  a complex and difficult matter.  The defendant’s appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>At trial, Myers claimed general damages of $1,000,000, 
  aggravated damages in the amount of $500,000 and punitive damages of $500,000.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge noted that once defamation is made out, damages 
  arise by inference of law and do not require proof of actual injury.  As the 
  trial judge commented:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The damages reflect what the law presumes to be the material 
      or probable consequences of the defendant’s conduct and the harm which normally 
      results from such defamation.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The factors to be considered include the size and nature of the 
  audience, and the conduct and character of both the plaintiff and the defendants.  
  As the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The influence and reputation of the defendant is important in the assessment 
      of damages, since the impact of a slander obviously depends very much on 
      the status of the speaker.  The greater the defendant’s reputation, the 
      more the plaintiff will suffer.</p>

    <p>. . . devastated by the program and shocked by what was said.  He felt

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Of particular significance with respect to both 
  liability and damages is the fact that as found by the trial judge:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The widow of a former patient congratulated the CBC on the “exposé of Dr. 
      Myers” in the program.  She wrote that she “watched with horror and jubilation 
      as the facts were revealed”, as she had always felt that Dr. Myers was responsible 
      for her husband’s death and that the CBC “exposé” only corroborated her 
      suspicions.  She then asked whether this could lead to a class action law 
      suit.  Dr. Livingstone, Vice-president of Professional Affairs at Sunnybrook 
      Hospital, facilitated an investigation of Dr. Myers’ handling of the complainant’s 
      late husband’s case.  Ultimately, the conduct of Dr. Myers and his staff 
      was found to meet all standards, and the concerns were found to be groundless.  
      The tone of the letter and the subsequent investigation confirm that the 
      program directly affected the professional life of Dr. Myers, in addition 
      to causing him substantial personal suffering.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge assessed Myers’ general damages at $200,000.  
  Although counsel for the CBC had argued at trial that $20,000 to $25,000 general 
  damages would have been adequate, on the appeal he candidly admitted that the 
  actual award was modest.  I agree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge rejected the claim for aggravated 
  and punitive damages as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is not an appropriate case for aggravated or punitive damages.  Although 
      I have found that there was malice on the part of the CBC, I must distinguish 
      this conduct from the kind of outrageous conduct which occurred in cases 
      such as <i>Hill, supra</i> or even <i>Hodgson, supra</i>.  Similarly, while 
      I acknowledge that Dr. Myers has endured substantial personal suffering, 
      I cannot agree that he has suffered the kind of heightened distress that 
      usually underlies an award of aggravated damages.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Myers abandoned his claim for punitive damages so it need not 
  be dealt with.  I have trouble, however, with the disposition of the claim for 
  aggravated damages.  In my view, the difference between this case and <i>Hill 
  v. Church of Scientology,</i> [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 and <i>Hodgson v. Canadian 
  Newspapers Company Limited </i>(2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 161 (leave to appeal refused, 
  [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 465) is not one of kind but rather one of degree.  As in 
  <i>Hill</i>, Myers was attacked in his calling, in his profession and, as found 
  by the trial judge, Myers was defamed “through the distortion of his own words” 
  which “has the effect of being especially damaging, since it is much more difficult 
  to explain the truth”. </p>

  </span></span> Finally, there is the finding of malice.  The trial judge held 
  that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Given my finding that neither a fair minded nor a reasonable person could 
      glean these opinions from the CBC resources, I am unable to accept the evidence 
      of the defence witnesses that they lacked suspect intentions or ill will 
      towards Dr. Myers.  I am especially troubled by their decision not to include 
      any reference to other expert doctors who largely concurred with Dr. Myers’ 
      views on both short-acting and long-acting nifedipine.</p>
    <p>That remains the case today; there was no softening of the position of 
      the defendants between trial and the appeal or during the argument of the 
      appeal.  In all of the circumstances, I would award aggravated damages in 
      the sum of $150,000.</p>
  </blockquote>

lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, I would dismiss the defendant’s appeal with costs 
  and the plaintiff’s cross-appeal for punitive damages, without costs.  I would 
  allow the plaintiff’s cross-appeal for aggravated damages and fix such damages 
  at $150,000 together with costs.</p>
