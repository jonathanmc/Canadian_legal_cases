  </span> This appeal concerns significant hearsay evidence led by the Crown and 
  admitted in anticipation of a Crown witness to support that evidence. That witness 
  was not called. Should a mistrial have been declared? Was the trial judge’s 
  charge appropriate?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted after a trial before a jury of one count 
  of trafficking and one count of possession for the purpose of trafficking in 
  cocaine. An abbreviated version of the factual background is that Detective 
  Constable Burke issued $100 in pre-recorded buy money to undercover Officer 
  McLane, who testified that he gave $40 of the money to the appellant in return 
  for some cocaine.  The two then walked toward the appellant’s car, McLane gave 
  a signal, and other officers including Ratchford came to make the arrest.  The 
  officers seized a baggy containing 2.1 grams of cocaine, which formed the basis 
  for the second charge. Burke, the recording officer, testified that Ratchford 
  returned the pre-recorded buy money to him. Ratchford was said to have seized 
  the money from the appellant incident to his arrest.  When his turn came to 
  give evidence, Ratchford was attending a sick child and the Crown did not call 
  him. The appellant asked for a mistrial on the basis of the hearsay evidence 
  of the seizure of the buy money from him. When that request was refused, the 
  appellant testified in his own defence. His evidence was that he had no money 
  on his person; that someone ran by, told him to hold a package, and thrust a 
  package at him; and that the police suddenly surrounded him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no question that the hearsay evidence as to the appellant’s 
  possession of the buy money would not have been introduced, nor would Crown 
  counsel have spoken of it in his opening address, if it had been known that 
  the seizing officer would not be called. It is equally obvious why there was 
  no objection from defence counsel, who expected, as did everyone else, that 
  the evidence was forthcoming.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When Crown counsel announced at the close of his case that Ratchford 
  would not be called, defence counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that 
  the appellant had been tactically prejudiced. According to defence counsel, 
  the unfulfilled expectation that Ratchford would testify led him to highlight 
  in cross-examination the veracity of the evidence concerning the $40 buy money.  
  I see no support for that in the transcript, and neither did the trial judge.  
  If Burke had said nothing as to the source of the money, defence counsel’s task 
  would have been the same: cross-examining witnesses in anticipation of evidence 
  that might or might not be called.  What he is really complaining of is that 
  he wasn’t told in advance that Ratchford would not be called. That is not a 
  reasonable complaint, nor one justifying a mistrial.  No one could have anticipated 
  the unavailability of the witness and it was reasonable to conclude, as did 
  the trial judge, that an appropriate charge would enable the jury to limit its 
  consideration to admissible evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the course of the argument as to a mistrial the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> THE COURT:  There is no – and I shall so instruct the jury, unless, when 
      the Crown’s case is in – there is no evidence that any control bills were 
      taken from the person of Mr. Myers.  There is no evidence to that effect.  
      I shall so tell them. </p>
    <p>And later:</p>
    <p> THE COURT:  I would authorize you to say in your address to the jury that 
      His Honour will tell you that there is not one shred of evidence that a 
      single piece of buy money was taken from the person of Mr. Myers.  You can 
      put it to them yourself, as I certainly will. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following that argument and the refusal of the mistrial, the Crown called 
  its final witness, an experienced officer, to speak to quantities of cocaine 
  that suggest trafficking.  He was cross-examined at length on the significance 
  in drug transactions of finding or not finding buy money on the arrested person.  
  The defence was clearly trying to build a case on the absence of evidence of 
  money being seized from the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the trial judge’s charge he stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You would, in a buy-and-bust situation, expect to find the prerecorded 
      buy money on the person of the alleged dealer, the accused person, and as 
      has been indicated over and over again, it was not.  There is no evidence 
      before you that any buy money was found on the accused person.  That is 
      something that you may consider, but as the Crown has also pointed out, 
      it is not an essential element of the case that the buy money be found.  
      It would be corroborative of the evidence given by the undercover officer 
      had it been available, but if you are satisfied on his evidence beyond a 
      reasonable doubt, then the absence of the buy money is not critical.  On 
      the other hand, you are entitled to view the absence of the buy money with 
      suspicion if you care to do so, and take that into consideration in reaching 
      your decision.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In retrospect, this charge appears imperfect because it ignores the 
  hearsay evidence of possession of the money.  However, some context is suggested 
  by the reference to hearing this over and over again and to the Crown’s position.  
  Surely this refers to the defence and Crown addresses (which were not transcribed) 
  and is modelled to be consistent with them. If defence counsel did not make 
  reference to the hearsay evidence – and it seems unlikely to me that he would 
  have done so – then he can hardly complain of the trial judge not doing so. 
  Further, the trial judge was being generous to the defence in light of the mishap.  
  He could have instructed the jury that, while there was no direct evidence of 
  seizure of the money, an inference could be drawn from the fact that it was 
  returned combined, if believed, with the evidence of the undercover officer 
  that it was handed to the appellant. Instead he told them there was no evidence 
  of seizure of the money and this might be considered a suspicious circumstance 
  in light of the expert evidence. As the expression goes, “he cut him a piece 
  of slack”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is my conclusion that the jury undoubtedly understood that the hearsay 
  evidence was to be ignored and that the evidence was to be considered apart 
  from any consideration of the seizure of buy money.  If the instructions were 
  too emphatic in that direction it benefitted the appellant. The evidence was 
  overwhelming and the appellant was asking much of the jury to accept his fanciful 
  version of events.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
