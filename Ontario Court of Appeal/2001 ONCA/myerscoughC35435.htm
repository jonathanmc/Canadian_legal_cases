  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Following an altercation on a Toronto street, 
  Richard Myerscough (“the respondent”) and a co-accused were convicted of three 
  counts </span>of assault.  The respondent appealed his convictions to the summary 
  conviction appeal court, which allowed his <span> </span>appeal and directed 
  acquittals on all three counts.  The Crown now seeks leave to appeal and, if 
  leave be granted, appeals against that decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent was represented by counsel in both courts below.  
  He was served personally with the Crown’s notice of appeal to this court.  When 
  the appeal to this court was called for hearing two months ago, the respondent 
  was not present.  The court adjourned the hearing and directed the Crown to 
  make its best efforts to serve him with notice of the adjourned hearing date.  
  When the appeal came on before us, we were satisfied, from the affidavit of 
  the investigating officer, that such efforts had been made and that the respondent 
  had notice of the date on which the appeal would be argued.  Accordingly, we 
  permitted Crown counsel to argue the appeal in the absence of the respondent 
  or of anyone on his behalf.</p>
<p><b><i><span lang=EN-US>The reasons of the trial judge</span></i></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In oral reasons for judgment delivered at the end of the trial, 
  the trial judge recited the charges, the Crown’s election to proceed summarily, 
  the pleas of not guilty and an order made for the exclusion of witnesses.  He 
  then proceeded to make findings of credibility, following “the guidance to this 
  court by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Richards</i>”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a><i>  </i>He found that the Crown witnesses (the three complainants 
  and another member of their party) were credible witnesses, and found that the 
  respondent and his co-accused were not credible witnesses.   He then set out 
  the facts, as he found them, on which his decision was based.  He found that, 
  on the evening before the events in question, the respondent and his co-accused 
  had been celebrating the respondent’s birthday at a friend’s house, where a 
  quantity of alcohol was consumed.  In the early hours of the morning, the respondent, 
  his co-accused and an acquaintance of the respondent named John left the friend’s 
  house and proceeded to walk toward a nearby intersection.  As they were walking, 
  the three complainants and two of their friends parked their car and walked 
  toward the same intersection.   The trial judge continued: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Without any further ado, the three gentlemen, Mr. Kalimeris [the co-accused], 
      Mr. Myerscough [the respondent] and John then attacked the party of two 
      men and three ladies.  They did so as a group, and did so by exchanging 
      places, so that on each occasion where blows or kicks were struck, they 
      were struck by all three parties.  The result was that there were assaults 
      made on [all three complainants].</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>He then expressed himself to be satisfied beyond 
  a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the respondent and his co-accused on each 
  count, and entered convictions against them on all three counts. </span></p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>The reasons of the summary conviction appeal court</span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> The summary conviction appeal court judge (“the appeal judge”) 
  allowed the respondent’s appeal and directed acquittals on all three counts 
  against him.  It will be convenient to consider the appeal judge’s reasons for 
  judgment by reference to the four grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the 
  Crown in the argument before us. <span lang=EN-US></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the Crown’s submission, the appeal judge 
  erred in four respects: </span></p>
<p class=mac-num><span>            </span>(a)   he wrongly reversed the trial 
  judge for failing to give reasons for his findings of credibility;</p>
<p><span>            </span>(b)  he wrongly substituted his own appraisal of the 
  respondent’s credibility;</p>
<p class=mac-num><span>            </span>(c)   he wrongly found that the trial 
  judge did not correctly apply the concept of reasonable doubt; and</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'><span>            </span>(d)   
  he wrongly concluded that the trial judge had erroneously based his decision 
  on “common intent”. </p>
<p><b><i><span lang=EN-US>The first ground: failure to give reasons for credibility 
  findings</span></i></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal judge was critical of the manner in which the trial 
  judge dealt with credibility in what he characterized as the trial judge’s “very 
  terse judgment”.  The appeal judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think he misapprehended the evidence because in giving reasons, he gave 
      no reasons why he accepted one’s credibility over the other and he need 
      not, but I would think in a trial that went on for three days, there is 
      some [<i>sic</i>] to deal with at least Myerscough’s evidence ...  He basically 
      said I do not believe him.  I find the victims credible.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>...</span></p>
    <p>The trial judge says I do not believe him.  I think the trial judge would 
      owe more to [the respondent] than to say I just don’t believe him.  He should 
      set out why he does not believe him in the circumstances.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I am well aware the trial judge need not set out all the 
      reasons and he is presumed to know but I think in the circumstances of this 
      case that there was an error as I have so stated.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The reasons of the trial judge were admittedly brief, and it 
  may have been desirable for him to go into greater detail to indicate why he 
  believed the victims and disbelieved the respondent and his co-accused.  In 
  fairness,  however, it should be noted that the trial judge did more than simply 
  make findings of credibility and move directly to findings of guilt.  Between 
  those findings, he specifically set out the facts on which his decision was 
  based.  Those facts were consistent with and supported by the evidence of the 
  Crown’s witnesses and inconsistent with the evidence of the respondent and his 
  co-accused.  The trial judge’s failure to give detailed reasons for his findings 
  of credibility did not, in the circumstances of this case,  constitute legal 
  error.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Trial judges do not err merely because they do not give reasons 
  for deciding one way or the other on problematic points: <i>R. v. Burns</i> 
  (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 199-200; <i>R. v. Barrett</i> (1995), 
  96 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (S.C.C.) at 320.  This proposition does not, of course, insulate 
  trial judges from giving reasons in all cases. As Major J. said in <i>R. v. 
  R.(D.)</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 308:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>McLachlin J. clearly set out the law regarding the requirement 
      of trial judges to give reasons in <i>Burns</i>. However, it should be remembered 
      that <i>Burns</i> dealt with a situation where the Court of Appeal agreed 
      the trial judge had evidence before him to support the conclusion he reached, 
      but overturned the verdict due to lack of reasons. The above-quoted passage 
      does not stand for the proposition that trial judges are never required 
      to give reasons. Nor does it mean that they are always required to give 
      reasons. Depending on the circumstances of a particular case, it may be 
      desirable that trial judges explain their conclusions. Where the reasons 
      demonstrate that the trial judge has considered the important issues in 
      a case, or where the record clearly reveals the trial judge’s reasons, or 
      where the evidence is such that no reasons </span><span
lang=EN-GB>are necessary, appellate courts will not interfere. Equally, in</span><span lang=EN-US> 
      cases such as this, where there is confused and contradictory evidence, 
      the trial judge should give reasons for his or her conclusions. The trial 
      judge in this case did not do so. She failed to address the troublesome 
      evidence, and she failed to identify the basis on which she convicted D.R. 
      and H.R. of assault. This is an error of law necessitating a new trial. 
      </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the present case, the Crown witnesses testified to a sudden 
  and unexpected assault by the accused and his co-accused, whereas the respondent 
  and his co-accused testified to acting in self-defence in response to unprovoked 
  blows inflicted by the complainants.  The Crown and defence evidence was “contradictory” 
  in the sense that they told dramatically different stories but their witnesses’ 
  testimony was not internally inconsistent, and there was no uncertainty as to 
  “the basis on which [the trial judge] convicted”.  The evidence was not “confused” 
  or “troublesome” (<i>R. v. R.(D.)</i>, quoted above) or  “bizarre” (<i>R. v. 
  R.(D.)</i>, at 307), so as to necessitate the kind of explanation to which the 
  foregoing quote refers.</p>

    <p><span lang=EN-US>I do not find on the facts of this particular case that

lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was not open to the appeal judge to reverse the trial judge’s 
  finding against the credibility of the respondent in this manner.  As this court 
  said in <i>R. v. G.W.</i> (1996), 93 O.A.C. 1 at 5:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The reviewing court should show “great deference” to the trial judge’s 
      findings of credibility.  It is, however, open to the appeal judge to conclude 
      that a verdict based on credibility findings is unreasonable if the appeal 
      judge takes into account the fact that the trial judge had the advantage 
      of seeing and hearing the witnesses give evidence.  However, where the verdict 
      essentially turns on credibility findings, the appeal judge’s power to interfere 
      should be exercised sparingly. ... The appeal judge must not try the case 
      <i>de novo</i> or simply substitute her views for those of the trial judge.</p>

  </span></span> The proposition that there is “a third alternative without accepting 
  the evidence of the accused” is indisputable: <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 
  C.C.C. (3d) 397.  But nothing in the reasons of the trial judge suggests that 
  he misunderstood or misapplied that proposition.  Indeed, the reference in his 
  reasons to this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Richards</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a> suggests the contrary.  <i>Richards </i>was an appeal from the 
  same trial judge as in the present case.  The reasons of Rosenberg J.A., who 
  delivered the decision of the court in <i>Richards</i>, contain a separate section 
  relating to “The Trial Judge’s Assessment of Credibility” and quote, in full, 
  the well-known passage of Cory J. relating to the application of the burden 
  of proof to questions of credibility: <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> at 409.  In these 
  circumstances, the failure of the trial judge in the present case to recite 
  that form of words cannot be equated with a failure to understand and apply 
  the principle of reasonable doubt.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal judge said in his reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Myerscough was convicted on basically a group activity 
      and the issue is that the trial judge made an error in that because there 
      is no common intention because if there is to be common intent on a group 
      assault that common intent must be different from defence charge that is 
      the assault. </span></p>

  </span></span> The expression “common intent” in this passage appears to refer 
  to s.&nbsp;21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which extends the liability of 
  the parties to an offence beyond the wrongful act originally intended in cases 
  involving “an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose”.  However, 
  in the trial judge’s reasons for judgment, he never used the phrase “common 
  intent” or “intention in common”, nor did he express the basis of the respondent’s 
  conviction by reference to s.&nbsp;21(2).  There was a more direct basis on 
  which to convict the respondent.  The evidence was that the assault on the three 
  complainants arose suddenly and without warning.  There was no suggestion of 
  a common intention shared by their assailants.  On the evidence called by the 
  Crown at trial, the respondent, his co-accused and the unidentified third man 
  all participated in the attack and all of them were liable to conviction as 
  principals.  There was no need for the trial judge to resort to a theory of 
  extended liability under s.&nbsp;21(2) nor, in my view, did he do so.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I agree with the Crown that the appeal judge 
  wrongly concluded that the decision of the trial judge was based on “common 
  intent”. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with all four grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of 
  the Crown.  In essence, the appeal judge rejected the trial judge’s findings 
  of credibility and substituted his own and, having done so, proceeded to retry 
  the case.  It was not open to him to do so: <i>R. v. G.W.</i> (1996), 93 O.A.C. 
  1 (C.A.); <i>R. v. C.P.</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 342 (C.A.).  A review of the trial 
  record indicates that there was ample evidence, which the trial judge accepted, 
  to support the respondent’s convictions.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, 
  allow the appeal, set aside the order of the appeal court and restore the respondent’s 
  convictions at trial.</span></p>
