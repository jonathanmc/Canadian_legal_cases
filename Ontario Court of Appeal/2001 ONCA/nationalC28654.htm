<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On June 28, 1991, H&amp;R Block Canada, Inc. purchased stock 
  in bulk from Tax Time Services Limited for $800,000.  H&amp;R failed to comply 
  with s. 4(1) of the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.14.  Instead, it 
  accepted the promise of Tax Time and its president that it would be indemnified 
  for any liability incurred resulting from non-compliance with the Act.  All 
  the proceeds from the sale, $800,000, were used to pay Tax Time’s secured creditors, 
  First City Trust Company and Royal Bank of Canada.  Additional secured and unsecured 
  creditors of Tax Time remained unpaid.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Prior to the sale, Tax Time had commenced an action against National 
  Trust for $5,000,000 in damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary 
  duty.  National Trust counterclaimed for $205,293, plus accrued interest, for 
  unpaid loans it had advanced to Tax Time.  The litigation was pending at the 
  time of the sale.  National Trust had not obtained any security for its loans 
  to Tax Time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>On June 29, 1993, O’Leary J. dismissed Tax Time’s 
  claim against National Trust with costs.  He awarded National Trust judgment 
  on its counterclaim in the amount of $327,625, which included accrued interest, 
  plus costs.  On June 21,1996, almost five years to the day after the sale in 
  bulk had taken place, Tax Time’s appeal to this court in respect of the claim 
  and counterclaim was dismissed with costs.  By this time, Tax Time was no longer 
  in business and was unable to pay National Trust’s judgment and costs.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May 20, 1993, while Tax Time’s appeal with respect to the 
  National Trust judgment was pending, National Trust commenced this proceeding 
  under s. 17(1) of the <i>Bulk Sales Act </i>in which it seeks two orders.  First, 
  it seeks an order declaring the bulk sale of June 28, 1991 void as a result 
  of H&amp;R’s non-compliance with s. 4 of the Act.  Second, it seeks an order 
  requiring H&amp;R to account to it under s. 16(2) of the Act for the amount 
  which it claimed it was owed by Tax Time as of the date of O’Leary J.’s judgment.  
  The hearing of the application was delayed until the completion of Tax Time’s 
  appeal.  When it came before Spence J. in October 1997, National Trust claimed 
  that the debt then owing to it by Tax Time was just under $800,000.  This amount 
  was comprised of the judgment granted by O’Leary J. which, with post-judgment 
  interest, had grown to $459,124, and the assessed costs of the trial and the 
  appeal which, including interest, amounted to $340,810, for a total alleged 
  debt owing of $799,934.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the hearing before the application judge, the parties agreed 
  that the bulk sale did not comply with the Act.  The parties also agreed that 
  “the value of the stock in bulk”, within the meaning of s. 16(2) of the Act, 
  was $800,000, being the amount that H&amp;R paid to purchase it from Tax Time.  
  The application judge declared the sale to be void, set it aside and ordered 
  H&amp;R to “account to National Trust Company for the value of the stock in 
  bulk which was the subject matter of the Asset Sale by paying” National Trust 
  $740,743.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> H&amp;R appeals from this judgment.  It asks that the judgment 
  be set aside and that National Trust’s application be dismissed.  National Trust 
  cross-appeals.  It asks that the judgment be varied to $800,000, plus post-judgment 
  interest thereon at 6.1% per annum from February 3, 1997 to November 6, 1997 
  constituting $36,972, with post-judgment interest on $836,972 from November 
  7, 1997 at the rate of 5% per annum.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Significantly, there is no suggestion that Tax Time or H&amp;R 
  acted dishonestly.  Specifically, Tax Time did not pocket any of the proceeds 
  from the sale to the prejudice of its creditors.  Rather, it paid its creditors 
  ratably and in priority to their claims, with the result that it used the entire 
  sale proceeds to pay a portion of the debts owing to its secured creditors.  
  National Trust was an unsecured creditor ranking in priority behind all the 
  secured creditors.  Thus, even if H&amp;R had complied with the Act, National 
  Trust would not have received any payment for its debt for the simple reason 
  that the entire amount of the sale proceeds were used to pay creditors that 
  ranked ahead of it.  Thus, the critical issue on this appeal is whether s. 16(2) 
  of the Act is meant to be interpreted and applied to require H&amp;R to satisfy 
  Tax Time’s indebtedness to National Trust, with the result that National Trust 
  would be in a better position than it would have been had H&amp;R complied with 
  the Act.  It is H&amp;R’s position that s. 16(2) is not meant to be interpreted 
  to effect such a result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A second issue, raised by H&amp;R in the event that it is unsuccessful 
  on the first issue, is the amount for which it must account to National Trust 
  under s. 16(2).  It contends that the proper amount is the amount of the unpaid 
  loans that Tax Time owed to National Trust on the date of the bulk sale, namely, 
  $205,293 plus accrued interest. It submits that the application judge erred 
  by increasing this amount to encompass the sum awarded by O’Leary J., as well 
  as the amount of the costs awarded to National Trust by O’Leary J. and the Court 
  of Appeal.</p>

  </span></span> Bulk sales legislation originated in the United States at the 
  turn of the twentieth century.  These laws were the product of an initiative 
  by creditors to combat commercial fraud, which was prevalent at that time.  
  See:  T. Billig, <i>Bulk Sales Laws: A Study in Economic Adjustment,</i> (1928) 
  77 U. Pa. L. Rev. 72 at 81.  The laws were introduced as a direct response to 
  a perceived inadequacy in the traditional common law remedies aimed at deterring 
  fraudulent dispositions of property.  See:  Law Reform Commission of British 
  Columbia, <i>Report on Bulk Sales Legislation,</i> (1983) at p. 4.  Bulk sales 
  laws were adopted rapidly in the United States and Canada.  By 1922, laws governing 
  sales in bulk were in place in 45 U.S. jurisdictions and in all Canadian provinces.  
  See:  Robert M. Forbes, <i>Handbook: Ontario Bulk Sales Act</i> (Burlington: 
  Rapport Publishing Inc., 1990), at p. 1.  On the other hand, Great Britain has 
  never found the need to enact bulk sales laws.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In Ontario, the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i> was originally enacted 
  in 1917 (R.S.O. 1917, c. 33).  Although the Act was the subject of minor amendments 
  in 1933 (S.O. 1933, c. 4), it was not until 1959 that it was amended significantly 
  and a new Act came into force (S.O. 1959, c. 9). There has been no substantive 
  change to the Act since 1959.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The main change in the legislation in 1959 had to do with the 
  consequences of non-compliance with the Act by the buyer of the stock in bulk, 
  which is the issue in this appeal.  What are now s. 16(1) and s. 16(2) were 
  introduced as s. 17 to provide unpaid creditors of the seller with a remedy 
  against the buyer.  What is now s. 17(1) of the Act was s. 18 of the 1959 Act. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In recent years, bulk sales legislation has been repealed in 
  Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Yukon and the Northwest Territories.  
  The repeal of these statutes follows reports of law reform commissions in those 
  jurisdictions that the goal of protecting creditors, to the extent that it is 
  achieved at all by bulk sales legislation, is realized only at the cost of significant 
  commercial inconvenience, disruption and expense.  An additional reason cited 
  for the repeal of bulk sales law is the availability of the general law of fraudulent 
  disposition  to protect creditors.  See:  Law Report Commission of British Columbia, 
  <i>supra</i>, at p. 1;  Manitoba Law Reform Commission, <i>Report of the Bulk 
  Sales Act</i>, (1988); Northwest Territories Committee on Law Reform, <i>The 
  Bulk Sales Act, Working Paper No. 3</i>, (1990); Law Reform Commission of Saskatchewan, 
  <i>The Bulk Sales Act: Report to the Minister of Justice</i>, (1990); Alberta 
  Law Reform Institute, <i>The Bulk Sales Act</i>, (1990).</p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From the outset, bulk sales legislation has been judicially recognized 
  as protecting the interests of creditors whose merchant debtors have disposed 
  of most or all of their inventory, chattels and fixtures by which they carry 
  on business.  For example, in <i>McLellan v. Fulton</i> (1921), 50 O.L.R. 572 
  at 577, Hodgins J. noted that the purpose of the 1917 Ontario Act was “to prevent 
  a person, partnership or company from disposing of his or its assets in bulk 
  and pocketing the money, leaving creditors in the lurch”.  In <i>Re St. Thomas 
  Cabinets Ltd.</i> (1921), 61 D.L.R. 487 at 491 (Ont. H.C.), Orde J. stated the 
  purpose of the 1917 Ontario legislation as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>… to protect creditors against the effect of a secret though valid 
      sale of the debtor’s stock and the possible unfair distribution or dissipation 
      of the proceeds, the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i> was passed making it incumbent 
      upon a purchaser under such circumstances to take certain steps to protect 
      the creditors, if any, at the risk of finding his purchase void if he failed 
      to comply.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Garson v. Canadian Credit Men’s Trust 
  Association</i>, [1929] S.C.R. 282 at 285-86, the Supreme Court of Canada declared 
  that the object of Nova Scotia bulk sales legislation was to “… prevent a trader 
  from making a sale of his stock-in-trade, goods and merchandise without the 
  consent of his creditors thereto or the payment of their claims”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Under the present scheme in Ontario a seller may obtain an order 
  under s. 3(1) exempting a sale in bulk from the application of the Act if the 
  court is satisfied “that the sale is advantageous to the seller and will not 
  impair the seller’s ability to pay creditors in full”.  If an exemption order 
  is not obtained, s. 4 requires that the buyer, before paying any part of the 
  sale proceeds other than a ten per cent deposit, obtain a sworn statement from 
  the seller listing “the amount of the indebtedness or liability due, owing, 
  payable or accruing due or to become due or payable by each of its secured and 
  unsecured trade creditors”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Where the buyer has received the sworn statement referred to 
  in s. 4, the buyer has several options.  Under s. 8(1), the buyer may pay the 
  sale proceeds to the seller and acquire the stock in bulk if:  (a) the claims 
  of the secured trade creditors and the unsecured trade creditors each do not 
  exceed a total of $2,500; or (b) the seller provides a sworn statement that 
  it has paid in full the claims of both categories of trade creditors; or (c) 
  the seller has made provision for immediate payment of the claims of both categories 
  of trade creditors after the completion of the sale, except for the claim of 
  any creditor that has waived immediate payment of its claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Under s. 8(2), the buyer may pay the sale proceeds to the seller 
  and acquire the stock in bulk if the seller delivers to the buyer: (a) the consent 
  of unsecured trade creditors “representing not less than 60 per cent in number

  and (b) an affidavit deposing that the seller has delivered to its secured and 
  unsecured trade creditors the statement referred to in s. 4.  Where a sale in 
  bulk is completed under s. 8(2), ss. 9 and 10 require that a trustee be appointed 
  to receive the sale proceeds.  The trustee is required to distribute the proceeds 
  pursuant to s. 12(1), which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span

      are paid or delivered to a trustee under section 10, the trustee is a trustee 
      for the general benefit of the creditors of the seller and shall distribute 
      the proceeds of the sale among the creditors of the seller, and, in making 
      the distribution, all creditors’ claims shall be proved in like manner and 
      are subject to like contestation before a judge and … are entitled to like 
      priorities as in the case of a distribution under the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i> 
      (Canada), as amended or re-enacted from time to time, and shall be determined 
      as of the date of the completion of the sale.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Thus, s. 12(1) contains a body of priority rules to resolve 
  conflicts between secured and unsecured creditors of the seller that might arise 
  in the distribution of the sale proceeds.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although I briefly outlined the facts in the 
  introduction, it is helpful to review the evidence that was before the application 
  judge pertaining to the financial situation of Tax Time at the time of the sale 
  and to the distribution of the sale proceeds to its creditors.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Tax Time’s unaudited financial statements as of January 31,1990 
  and May 31, 1991 revealed that as the company continued to carry on business 
  it was losing money and its indebtedness to its creditors was increasing.  In 
  particular, the financial statements as of May 31, 1991 showed liabilities of 
  $1,398,858, assets of $812,908 and a negative owner’s equity of ($585,950).  
  According to Tax Time’s owner, as of May 31, 1991 the company owed its secured 
  creditors in excess of $3,500,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the date of the bulk sale, all of Tax Time’s assets were standing 
  as security for various loans made to it by a number of financial institutions 
  including the Royal Bank, First City, National Bank of Canada, Norex Leasing, 
  Federal Business Development Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia.  All of these 
  financial institutions released their respective security interests in the assets 
  purchased by H&amp;R to enable the bulk sale to take place, but maintained their 
  security interests in all of Tax Time’s remaining assets. The entire sale proceeds 
  were distributed to two of the secured creditors in order to obtain their releases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Of the $800,000 paid by H&amp;R for the stock in bulk, $424,920.78 
  was paid to First City.  The balance of $375,079.22 was paid to the Royal Bank, 
  leaving in excess of $590,000 owing to the bank on account of Tax Time’s operating 
  loan.  It would appear to be common ground between the parties that the sale 
  proceeds were distributed in accordance with s. 12(1) of the Act.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In addition to its obligations to its secured creditors, at the 
  approximate date of the completion of the bulk sale, Tax Time owed 35 unsecured 
  creditors, excluding National Trust, $100,158.  </p>

  </span></span> Assuming that H&amp;R had complied with the Act or that the bulk 
  sale had received judicial exemption from compliance with the Act, and assuming 
  that National Trust was either a creditor of Tax Time within the meaning of 
  the Act or a judgment creditor of Tax Time, it would not have participated in 
  the distribution of the sale proceeds at the date of the bulk sale. Nor would 
  National Trust have participated in the distribution of any proceeds had Tax 
  Time been forced into bankruptcy at the time of the bulk sale to H&amp;R. This 
  is because Tax Time’s liabilities substantially exceeded its assets, and what 
  assets it had were pledged as security to creditors with priority over National 
  Trust.  Moreover, had H&amp;R complied with the Act and a trustee been appointed 
  under s. 9(1) to receive the sale proceeds, the same result would also have 
  followed on the trustee’s distribution of the sale proceeds under s. 12(1).  
  That is, no proceeds of the bulk sale would have been distributed to National 
  Trust.  The proceeds were paid as they should have been notwithstanding defective 
  compliance with the Act.  Thus National Trust suffered no loss as a consequence 
  of H&amp;R’s failure to complete the bulk sale as required by the Act.</p>

  </span></span> There is no coherent body of evidence concerning the nature of 
  Tax Time’s indebtedness to National Trust.  However, I have developed an understanding 
  of it from the following sources:  the affidavit of Greg Jackson, who was a 
  vice-president of National Trust in May, 1993; the May 29, 1990 auditors’ report 
  prepared by Tax Time’s chartered accountants; the pleadings in the action between 
  Tax Time and National Trust that was commenced on December 21, 1987; and the 
  reasons for judgment of O’Leary J. in that action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From 1984 to 1987 National Trust provided financing for Tax Time, 
  particularly for Tax Time’s lucrative business of discounting income tax refunds, 
  known as its Income Tax Refund Discounting Program.  From time to time, National 
  Trust provided advances to Tax Time to operate this program.  However, in 1987, 
  apparently as a result of its contract dispute with National Trust, Tax Time 
  stopped paying interest on the advances.  Consequently, when Tax Time commenced 
  its breach of contract action in December 1987, National asserted a counterclaim 
  for $205,293.78 plus interest.  No particulars were provided in the counterclaim 
  respecting the calculation of this sum, except for the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>13.  As a result of advances made to Tax Time by National Trust Company 
      and its predecessors, V &amp; G, Tax Time is indebted to it in the principal 
      amount of $205,293.78 on account of advances made to Tax Time together with 
      interest thereon at the rate of 11.75% per annum from December 15, 1987 
      until payment.  As evidence of the said indebtedness Tax Time made the following 
      promissory notes in favour of the defendant or its predecessor V&amp;G.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The counterclaim lists 23 demand promissory notes totalling $320,383.96 
  from December 15, 1986 to November 16, 1987, and goes on to plead that a demand 
  was made for payment of the promissory notes on January 19, 1988, which was 
  subsequent to the commencement of Tax Time’s action.  In its defence to the 
  counterclaim, Tax Time denied that there had been a demand for payment and asserted, 
  as a result of National Trust’s breach of contract, that it was relieved from 
  paying the amount claimed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In allowing national Trust’s counterclaim, O’Leary J.’s reasons 
  for judgment are brief.  The substantial portion of his reasons relate to the 
  dismissal of Tax Time’s claim.  He described the counterclaim as being “for 
  an amount owing by [Tax Time] in regard to [its] tax rebate business”, to which 
  he could see no defence.  Without providing any further analysis of the nature 
  of National Trust’s counterclaim, O’Leary J. concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly, then, the counterclaim succeeds against Tax Time for the amounts 
      claimed against it.  That claim, with interest until today, amounts to $327,625.59.</p>

  </span></span> Some assistance regarding the nature of the claim is found in 
  Tax Time’s audited financial statements as of January 31, 1990, prepared by 
  the accounting firm Schwartz Levitsky Feldman, showing bank loans of $765,286.  
  The components of the bank loans are described in note 3 to the financial statements 
  as an outstanding loan from the Royal Bank for $559,993 and “demand notes” payable 
  to National Trust totalling $205,293, bearing interest at rates varying from 
  10.75% to 11.75%.  With respect to the $205,293, note 3 states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a result of the litigation referred to in note 7 the company has ceased 
      paying interest on the National Trust Company demand notes effective December 
      15, 1987.  Interest from that date has not been accrued in these financial 
      statements.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>As for the “litigation” referred to in note 7, that note states:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span

    <p>On December 21, 1987, the company instituted legal proceedings against 
      National Trust Company for breach of contract, claiming $5,000,000 in general 
      damages and $5,000,000 in special damages.  National Trust Company has counterclaimed 
      for amounts owing to it as described in note 3.  Legal counsel for Tax Time 
      Services Limited are of the opinion that the damages to be recovered will 
      likely be greater than National Trust Company’s counterclaim.  Therefore, 
      the amount disclosed as a liability to National trust Company in note 3 
      may never be paid.  Any settlement resulting from the resolution of this 
      contingency is expected to be accounted for as an extraordinary item.</p>

  be void and ordered that it be set aside.  He further ordered that “H&amp;R 
  Block shall account to National Trust Company for the value of the stock in 
  bulk that was the subject matter of the Asset Sale by paying to National Trust 
  Company the sum of $740,743.13”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The reasons of the application judge are brief.  They were delivered 
  at the conclusion of the hearing, with supplementary reasons provided on January 
  28, 1999 concerning the amount of compensation which National Trust claimed 
  it was entitled to recover from H&amp;R.  After the hearing, National Trust 
  asked the application judge to vary his judgment by increasing the amount he 
  had ordered H&amp;R to pay it to $843,369.88.  It is in respect to the application 
  judge’s refusal to do so that National Trust cross-appeals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application judge held that given H&amp;R’s failure to comply 
  with s. 4 of the Act, Tax Time’s payment of the entire sale proceeds to the 
  secured creditors was not a sufficient reason to refuse to void the sale.  In 
  granting the declaration that the sale was void, he stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since there was no compliance, the sale is voidable under s. 16(1).  The 
      fact that the proceeds were paid to secured creditors is not a sufficient 
      reason not to void the sale.  If it were, the Act would provide little protection 
      to unsecured creditors.  The only question left, as to the effect of the 
      payments to the secured creditors, is whether they constitute the accounting 
      required by s. 16(2), which is applicable because the sale must be declared 
      void for purposes of the Act by reason of s. 16(1).</p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application judge concluded that Tax Time’s payment of the 
  entire sale proceeds to two of its secured creditors did not constitute the 
  accounting to the seller’s creditors required by s. 16(2).  In doing so, he 
  distinguished the facts of this case from three decisions cited by H&amp;R as 
  standing for the proposition that in accounting to National Trust for the value 
  of the stock in bulk under s. 16(2), a “credit” should be given for the payments 
  made to Tax Time’s secured creditors:  <i>Chicopee Food Market Ltd. (Trustee 
  of) v. Knechtel Corp.</i> (1992), 8 B.L.R. (2d) 81 (Ont. Gen. Div.); <i>Garson 
  v Canadian Credit Men’s Trust Association, supra</i>; and <i>Motorsource Inc. 
  v. A.O. Smith Corp.</i> (1993), 8 Alta. L.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After disposing of the issue of the credit, the application judge 
  held that “H&amp;R Block has a duty to account to the creditors of the seller 
  for the value of the stock in bulk purchased from the seller”.  He concluded 
  that “the obligation to account under s. 16(2) arises <i>at the time the sale 
  is declared void and the amount of the debt [from Tax Time to National Trust] 
  should be determined as at that time</i>, which would include here any interest 
  accrued and costs payable [pursuant to the judgment of O’Leary J. and the order 
  of the Court of Appeal]”.  [Emphasis added.]  No reasons were provided for this 
  conclusion.</p>

  </span></span> As I indicated earlier, the parties agreed that the value of 
  the stock in bulk was the same as the amount paid by H&amp;R to purchase it, 
  namely, $800,000.  Accordingly, the application judge ordered H&amp;R to account 
  to National Trust for the value of the stock in bulk that it purchased from 
  Tax Time by paying $740,743.13 to National Trust.</p>

  </span></span> It is unclear from the application judge’s reasons or from the 
  formal order how he arrived at the amount of $740,743.13.  It appears that an 
  explanation can be found in the application judge’s supplementary endorsement 
  of January 28, 1999, in which he gave effect to the calculation submitted by 
  H&amp;R.  This calculation differs in two respects from National Trust’s calculation, 
  which is set out in paragraph 22 of that endorsement.  The first difference 
  is the application of a lower interest rate to the amount of the judgment and 
  costs than the rate advanced by National Trust.  The second difference is that 
  the application judge’s calculation does not include any amount for pre-judgment 
  interest on the total amount of the judgment and costs from February 3, 1997 
  to November 6, 1997.</p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, there appears to be an inconsistency in the reasons 
  of the application judge with respect to the point in time that the calculation 
  of the amount of Tax Time’s debt to National Trust is to be made.  In the reasons 
  given at the conclusion of the hearing on November 6, 1997, he stated that the 
  calculation was to be made as of the time the sale in bulk was declared void.  
  However, in his supplementary reasons of January 28, 1999, he stated that National 
  Trust was entitled to compensation from H&amp;R “for an amount up to the debt 
  owing by Tax Time [to National Trust] <i>at the time of the improper sale in 
  bulk</i>” [emphasis added], plus National Trust’s costs of obtaining judgment 
  for that debt, and interest at an appropriate rate.</p>

  </span></span> In the view that I hold of this appeal I find that I need consider 
  only the application of s. 16(2) to the circumstances of this appeal.  I do 
  so on the basis of the following assumptions.  First, on June 28, 1991, the 
  date on which Tax Time sold its assets to H&amp;R, National Trust had an unsecured 
  debt due to it from Tax Time.  As will become apparent, the amount of the debt 
  is irrelevant.  Second, that for the purpose of the application and this appeal, 
  that the value of the stock in bulk for the purpose of s. 16(2) is $800,000.  
  This assumption is consistent with the agreement of the parties.  Third, that 
  Tax Time paid the entire sale proceeds to two of its secured creditors.</p>

  </span></span> Although there are cases in which this court has made reference 
  to s. 16(2), this appears to be the first occasion on which the court has been 
  called upon to interpret and apply that provision.  See:  <i>Busuttil v. Diamond 
  T. Truckers (Toronto) Ltd.,</i> [1969] O.R. 245 (C.A.); <i>Sidaplex-Plastic 
  Suppliers Inc. v. Elta Group Inc. </i>(1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 563 (C.A.).</p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have pointed out, the major change in the <i>Bulk Sales 
  Act</i> as a result of its 1959 overhaul was the consequence arising  from non-compliance 
  with the Act.  Under the former legislation, the only penalty imposed on a buyer 
  for non-compliance was to render the transaction liable to be declared void 
  as against the seller’s creditors if it was attacked within the statutory limitation 
  period.  This required the creditors to have to resort to the various statutes 
  dealing with fraudulent transfers in order to recover their debts, as described 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Garson, supra</i>, at p. 285 <i>et seq.</i>  
  This remedy usually proved ineffectual, as the subject matter of the sale was 
  often dissipated before proceedings were brought.  See: F. Catzman, <i>Bulk 
  Sales in Ontario</i> (1960), 3 Can. Bar J. 28 at 39.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The introduction of then s. 17 in the 1959 Act (now s. 16) eliminated 
  the cumbersome, and generally ineffective remedies, available to creditors.  
  It did so by introducing an alternative remedy to execution against the buyer’s 
  property.  Section 17 was designed to provide creditors with recourse to a legislated 
  remedy – an accounting by the buyer of the value of the bulk goods, as well 
  as personal judgment against the buyer for the value thereof.  As such, it provided 
  additional protection for trade creditors by imposing a form of penalty against 
  buyers who failed to conform to the requirements of the Act, thereby acting 
  as an incentive for compliance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, there are a number of factors to be taken into account 
  in interpreting and applying s. 16(2) of the present Act.  First, the section 
  should be interpreted having regard to the purpose of the Act.  Second, regard 
  is to be had to s. 12(1) of the Act which provides that when the sale proceeds 
  are paid to a trustee, “the trustee is a trustee for the general benefit of 
  the creditors of the seller and shall distribute the proceeds among the creditors 
  of the seller . . . <i>[who] are entitled to like priorities</i> as in the case 
  of a distribution under the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i> (Canada), as amended or re-enacted 
  from time to time, and shall be determined as of the date of the completion 
  of the sale”.  See: <i>Busuttil, supra,</i> at p. 253.  Third, a proceeding 
  to have a bulk sale declared void is “in the nature of a representative action 
  for the benefit of all creditors”.  See: <i>Sidaplex-Plastic, supra, </i>at 
  p. 573.  Fourth, the term “liable to account” is to be interpreted according 
  to its ordinary meaning, as an equitable decree for an accounting.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With regard to the first factor, I have already discussed the 
  purpose of bulk sales legislation, which is to ensure that the creditors of 
  a seller receive their ratable share of the proceeds of a sale in bulk, and 
  are therefore not prejudiced by the sale.  Those proceeds are to be used to 
  pay only those creditors who were creditors of the seller at the time of the 
  bulk sale.  See: <i>Re St. Thomas Cabinets, supra; Bank of Montreal, supra.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With regard to  the second and third factors, it is necessary 
  to note by incorporating the provisions of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
  Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, s. 12(1) provides for the <i>pro rata</i> distribution 
  of the sale proceeds.  Although the scheme of distribution under that Act is 
  somewhat complex, it is clear from s. 136(1) that secured creditors rank in 
  priority to all other creditors.  In considering the application of s. 16(2) 
  in <i>Busuttil, supra,</i> Kelly J.A. stated at p. 253:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the value of the stock in bulk found due by [the buyer] 
      to [the seller] should be dealt with in the same manner as the purchase 
      price of the stock would have been, if the sale of the same had been conducted 
      in compliance with the requirements of the Act.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I come now to the fourth factor, which is the remedy provided 
  to a seller’s creditors by s. 16(2).  In my view, where there has been non-compliance 
  with the Act and the sale has been declared void, and where the buyer has received 
  or taken possession of the stock in bulk that is the subject of the sale, s. 
  16(2) provides a creditor with an action against the buyer for an accounting 
  of the value of the stock in bulk.  In keeping with the well-accepted nature 
  of an equitable action for an accounting, the buyer is required to provide an 
  account of all money it paid for the stock in bulk and its disbursement by the 
  seller.  If the seller has disbursed the proceeds in a manner that has resulted 
  in any creditor not having been paid its full or <i>pro rata</i> share, then 
  the buyer must personally pay creditors their full, or ratable, share of the 
  proceeds, up to the value of the stock in bulk.  I find support for this interpretation 
  in <i>Wiebe v. Holmes, </i>[1971] 4 W.W.R. 588 (Man. Q.B.) and <i>Thomson v. 
  Richardson</i> (1967), 61 D.L.R. (2d) 162 (Alta. C.A.) which considered provisions 
  similar to s. 16(2) in s. 10(2) of the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>, R.S.M. 1954, c.&nbsp;30 
  and s. 10(2) of the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>, R.S.A. 1955, c. 33 respectively.  
  In <i>Thomson</i>, Allen J.A. at p. 171 clearly considered the remedy provided 
  by s. 10(2) of the Alberta Act, which is virtually identical to s. 16(2), to 
  be an “action for an accounting”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I find further support for this interpretation 
  in <i>Garson, supra</i> and <i>Chicopee, supra</i>, upon which H&amp;R relied 
  before the motion judge and this court, and which the motion judge did not apply 
  on the ground that they are distinguishable from the circumstances of this case.</span></p>

  </span></span> In <i>Garson</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada considered early 
  Nova Scotia bulk sales legislation that provided that where a purchaser fails 
  to complete a bulk sale in accordance with the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>, R.S.N.S. 
  1923, c. 202, the sale “shall be deemed to be fraudulent and shall be absolutely 
  void against the creditors”, a provision similar to s. 3 of the <i>Bulk Sales 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1950, c. 42.  The Supreme Court concluded that in such circumstances 
  a creditor was entitled to obtain a remedy from the buyer through the application 
  of the general law relating to fraudulent transactions.  As stated in the headnote 
  to the case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The creation in the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i> of a presumption of fraud on 
      the part of both purchaser and vendor as against the vendor’s creditors, 
      indicates a legislative intention to put a sale in bulk made without compliance 
      with that Act in the same category as sales made with an intention to defraud 
      the vendor’s creditors.  This presumption of fraud has the effect of bringing 
      into play all other statutes passed for the protection of creditors against 
      a fraudulent sale of his goods by a debtor to the prejudice of his creditors, 
      and the right to recover from a fraudulent transferee the proceeds of goods 
      coming into his possession by an invalid transfer, and resold by him, is 
      given by s. 21(1) of the <i>Assignments Act</i> (R.S.N.S. (1928), c. 200).</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Chicopee</i>, Granger J. was required to apply s. 16(2) 
  of the present Ontario Act on an application by a seller’s trustee in bankruptcy 
  to have the sale of equipment and inventory declared void as contravening the 
  Act and to recover the proceeds of the sale.  The buyer agreed to purchase the 
  seller’s equipment and inventory for $576,270, but failed to comply with the 
  Act.  It then sold the property and paid the bank, which was a secured creditor 
  of the seller, $289,292 to satisfy its security interest.  It also paid $10,326 
  to other creditors.  Thereafter, the seller made an assignment in bankruptcy, 
  at which time it owed $104,00 to secured creditors and $391,094 to unsecured 
  creditors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Granger J. set aside the sale and declared it void as a result 
  of the buyer’s failure to comply with the Act and held that the buyer was required 
  by s. 16(2) to account to the trustee in bankruptcy for the purchase price of 
  $576,270.  However, as the buyer had paid $299,618 to some of the seller’s creditors, 
  he ordered that it pay the balance of $276,652 to the trustee in bankruptcy 
  for distribution to the seller’s secured and unsecured creditors. Thus, in accounting 
  to the seller’s creditors for the value of the goods purchased, the purchaser  
  was entitled to receive “credit” for the amounts that it paid to the seller’s 
  creditors, utilizing a portion of the sale proceeds to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, <i>Chicopee</i> illustrates what is to occur on a 
  s. 16(2) accounting.  In conducting an accounting, the court is to give effect 
  to payments properly made from the proceeds of the sale to the seller’s creditors.  
  There is an obvious similarity between the facts of <i>Chicopee</i> and the 
  facts of this case.  Whereas in <i>Chicopee</i> only part of the sale proceeds 
  was paid to creditors of the seller, in this case the entire sale proceeds were 
  paid to the creditors of the seller, which, as I have explained, were creditors 
  ranking in priority to National Trust.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Given that the sale proceeds are required to be distributed to 
  the seller’s creditors ratably, and that the proceeds were distributed entirely 
  to two secured creditors which ranked in priority to National Trust, an unsecured 
  creditor, the result of an  action for an accounting is obvious in this case.  
  In demonstrating, as it did before the application judge, that Tax Time used 
  the entire proceeds of the bulk sale to pay debts which Tax Time owed to secured 
  creditors that ranked in priority to National Trust, H&amp;R provided a satisfactory 
  explanation, or accounting, to Tax Time’s creditors of the distribution of the 
  agreed upon value of the stock in bulk.  Tax Time engaged in no improper conduct 
  in its disbursement of the sale proceeds.    There is no suggestion that the 
  bulk sale was designed to prefer or to defeat Tax Time’s creditors.  There was 
  no misuse of the sale proceeds.  Given the following facts, no creditor of Tax 
  Time, secured or unsecured, was “left in the lurch” notwithstanding H&amp;R’s 
  failure to comply with the Act: (1) the sale proceeds were $800,000; (2) Tax 
  Time’s indebtedness to secured creditors exceeded that amount; (3) the entire 
  sale proceeds were paid to two secured creditors that ranked in priority to 
  the remaining secured creditors and all the unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if H&amp;R had complied with the Act, because National Trust 
  was an unsecured creditor ranking behind the secured creditors it would have 
  been entitled to be paid nothing.  Nobody was unjustly enriched at the expense 
  of National Trust;  there was no misuse of the sale proceeds.    In my view, 
  National Trust has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced because of H&amp;R’s 
  failure to complete the sale in compliance with the Act.  Therefore,  no remedy 
  is available to National Trust under s. 16(2).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> National Trust submits that s. 16(2) imposes a penalty on a buyer 
  who completes a bulk sale without complying with the Act.  The penalty is that 
  the buyer must pay the seller’s creditor the unpaid amount of its indebtedness, 
  up to the amount of the value of the stock in bulk that was the subject of the 
  sale.  It submits that this penalty applies regardless of whether the creditor 
  would not have been entitled to share in the sale proceeds had there been compliance 
  with the Act.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I disagree with National Trust’s submission, the essence of which 
  is that the legislature intended to constitute a buyer the guarantor of a seller’s 
  indebtedness regardless of whether the sale proceeds, within the scheme of distribution 
  provided by the Act, prove to be insufficient to pay the indebtedness.  Had 
  this been the legislature’s intention, it would have said so in express language.  
  Rather, the legislature chose to adopt the language of the equitable remedy 
  of an accounting.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Examples are many whereby equity decrees that there be an accounting.  
  See:  John McGhee, <i>Snell’s Equity</i>, 30<sup>th</sup> ed., (London: Sweet 
  &amp; Maxwell, 2000), at p. 705 <i>et seq.</i>  Perhaps the most common example 
  of an accounting in equity is a proceeding brought by the beneficiaries of an 
  estate against the estate trustee to account for funds held in trust on their 
  behalf.   In such a proceeding, the trustee is required to explain his or her 
  dealing with the trust funds.  If it is found that the trustee misused or misapplied 
  the funds, the trustee must account to the beneficiaries by paying them the 
  amount that was misused or misapplied.  The absence of any wrongdoing by the 
  trustee, or misuse of the trust funds, is a defence to a suit for an accounting.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thus, in an action for an accounting under s. 16(2), the buyer 
  of the stock in bulk is put in the position of a trustee required to account 
  to the seller’s creditors for the seller’s distribution of the sale proceeds.  
  If the buyer can demonstrate, as H&amp;R has done in this case, that the seller 
  did not misuse the sale proceeds, then the creditor is not entitled to a remedy.  
  If, however, the result of the accounting is that the seller misused all or 
  part of the sale proceeds, the buyer must account to the creditors ratably for 
  the amount misused, up to the value of the stock in bulk, by paying them accordingly.  
  To state it somewhat differently, the issue to be determined under s. 16(2) 
  is whether, as a result of the buyer’s failure to comply with the Act, any creditor 
  was deprived of any money that it would have been paid but for the non-compliance. 
  <i>Cf., Garson, supra</i>, at p. 288.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In support of its submission that s. 16(2) imposes a penalty 
  National Trust points to s. 8(2)(a) of the Act and states that had there been 
  compliance with s. 4 it was in a position to deny consent to the completion 
  of the sale because its claim of $205,293 exceeded 60 per cent of the total 
  claims of the other unsecured trade creditors, which amounted to $100,158.  
  It is difficult to understand how this advances National Trust’s submission 
  that the purpose of s. 16(2) is to penalize a buyer who does not comply with 
  the Act.  While it is easy for National Trust to say with the benefit of hindsight 
  10 years after the sale that it would have blocked it had H&amp;R complied with 
  the Act, I have great difficulty in giving any weight to this submission as 
  it does not accord with the commercial reality of the situation as it existed 
  in June, 1991.  Given the failing nature of Tax Time’s business at that time, 
  it is reasonable to infer that by blocking the sale National Trust would not 
  have improved its position.  The likelihood is that if Tax Time had not sold 
  its assets to H&amp;R it would have ceased business, or been placed in bankruptcy.  
  National Trust would have been no better off in such circumstances.  I do not 
  see what effect on the remedy provided by s. 16(2) follows from the speculation 
  that National Trust might have blocked the sale if H&amp;R had complied with 
  the Act.  In any event, it is too late to speculate what position National Trust 
  might have taken under s. 8.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, National Trust suffered no deprivation as a result 
  of H&amp;R’s failure to comply with the Act.  Because it would not have been 
  entitled to any payment had the sale been completed in compliance with the Act, 
  it was not deprived of any money it was entitled to receive on a ratable distribution 
  of the proceeds.  Therefore, National Trust is not entitled to a remedy.  In 
  my view, any other result would be to apply s. 16(2) in a punitive manner.  
  The legislature did not intend that where there has been non-compliance with 
  the Act and the buyer has accounted for the distribution of the sale proceeds 
  that a creditor be in a better position than it would have been had there been 
  compliance with the Act.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, there is another analysis which supports my interpretation 
  of s. 16(2).  Although s. 7 enables a creditor who acquires knowledge of an 
  intended bulk sale to demand of the seller written particulars of the sale, 
  there appears to be no provision in the Act that requires a seller to give notice 
  of an intended sale to its creditors.  Although under s. 3(2) a judge may order 
  that creditors receive notice of an application to exempt a sale from compliance 
  with the Act, experience suggests that this is rarely required.  It is only 
  where under s. 8(2)(a), a buyer wishes to obtain the consent of the seller’s 
  unsecured trade creditors to a sale, that the buyer must give these creditors 
  a copy of a statement of the seller’s creditors.  Where the creditors’ consent 
  to the sale is obtained, the sale must be completed by a trustee as required 
  by s. (9)(1).  The trustee is governed by s. 12(1) in distributing the proceeds 
  of the sale.  As I have explained, s. 12(1) contains a body of priority rules 
  to ensure that there be evenhandedness in distributing the sale proceeds to 
  the seller’s creditors.  Thus, unsecured creditors’ interests in the sale proceeds 
  may be diluted or frustrated altogether, depending upon the circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Supreme Court of Canada judgment in <i>Garson, supra,</i> 
  illustrates that bulk sales law is a particular form of the general fraudulent 
  disposition and preference law.  The evenhandedness norm illustrates the affinity 
  between fraudulent disposition and bulk sales laws.  In Ontario, this can be 
  seen by the combined effect of the <i>Assignments and Preferences Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. A.33, the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,    c. F.29, 
  and the <i>Creditors’ Relief Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.45 upon the distribution 
  of the proceeds of a judgment obtained under the first two Acts among the creditors 
  of a debtor that has dealt fraudulently in the disposition of its property to 
  the prejudice of its creditors.  The goal of the <i>Creditors’ Relief Act</i> 
  is to require a judgment creditor to share the proceeds of an execution <i>pari 
  passu </i> with other unsecured creditors.  However, secured creditors, and 
  in many cases creditors preferred by other statutes or by the common law, retain 
  their special ranking. See C.R.B. Dunlop, <i>Creditor-Debtor Law in Canada</i>, 
  2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1995, Carswell) at 545 <i> et seq.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have pointed out, a similar distribution of the proceeds 
  of a bulk sale among the seller’s creditors on the basis of the priority of 
  their debts is required by s. 12(1) of the <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>. As an application 
  by a creditor under s. 17(1) of the Act to have a bulk sale declared void and 
  for a remedy under s. 16(2) is in the nature of a representative action for 
  the benefit of all of a seller’s creditors, the schemes of distribution under 
  s.&nbsp;12(1) and the <i>Creditors’ Relief Act</i> necessarily apply to an accounting 
  ordered under      s. 16(2).  Thus, just as a transferee’s return of the fraudulently 
  or preferentially transferred assets to the debtor or its creditors may not 
  compensate the creditors to the full amount of their loss, the accounting under 
  s. 16(2) may be inadequate to fully compensate a seller’s creditors for the 
  loss resulting from a sale that has been completed without compliance with the 
  <i>Bulk Sales Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thus, a buyer is liable to account to a creditor only for any 
  amount that the creditor would not have realized if the buyer had complied with 
  the Act.  The cumulative liability of the buyer to the seller’s creditors may 
  not exceed an amount equal to the value at the date of the sale of what was 
  purchased, which amount is reduced by any amount paid to a creditor whose claims 
  rank in priority to the claims of those creditors applying under s. 17(1) for 
  a remedy under s. 16(2).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, under s. 16(2) the buyer occupies the status of a 
  receiver, holding the stock in bulk and its proceeds for the benefit of the 
  seller’s creditors and having a duty to account therefor.  The buyer has the 
  burden to prove that compliance with the Act would not have produced any recovery, 
  or any additional recovery, for the complaining creditor.  If the buyer, in 
  accounting for the distribution of the sale proceeds, can demonstrate that the 
  seller distributed the sale proceeds ratably among its creditors, the buyer 
  will not be required to assume any liability.  Otherwise, s. 16(2) imposes a 
  liability on the buyer limited to the value of the stock in bulk.  In a sense, 
  s. 16(2) may be viewed as draconian, as it may force a buyer, who has failed 
  to comply with the Act to pay twice for the property that it purchased.  This 
  is the risk that a buyer takes when it ignores the requirements of the Act.  
  However, by incorporating the equitable remedy of an accounting as the mechanism 
  for determining a buyer’s liability, together with the scheme of ratable distribution 
  of the sale proceeds contained in federal bankruptcy legislation, as well as 
  placing a limit on the buyer’s liability, the legislature has exhibited its 
  intention that there be a significant degree of fairness to the operation of 
  s. 16(2) and that unconscionable results in its application be avoided.  In 
  my view, it was not the legislature’s intention that s. 16(2) be applied to 
  enable a creditor, where there has been non-compliance with the Act, to be in 
  a better position than it would have been had there been compliance.</p>

  </span></span> When Tax Time received the sale price of $800,000 from H&amp;R, 
  it paid the entire amount to the two secured creditors with the first and second 
  ranking priorities.  H&amp;R took the position that this was an appropriate 
  accounting within the meaning of s. 16(2) of the Act and that, accordingly, 
  no other creditors could attack the sale even though there was no compliance 
  with the Act.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Spence J. responded to this argument as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>One defence is that the proceeds of sale were paid to secured creditors 
      of Tax Time on account of debts owing and payable to them.  The <u>Bulk 
      Sales Act</u> provides for exemptions under s. 3.  No exemption was requested.  
      Whether an exemption could have been obtained seems to me a matter that 
      is now too late to speculate about.  I doubt it would have been granted 
      if it would have put the unsecured creditors (for whose protection the Act 
      is designed to operate) in worse position than compliance with the Act would 
      have yielded.  The compliance scheme starts with s. 4.  No statement was 
      delivered under s. 4 so the provisions of the Act which are engaged only 
      when s. 4 has been satisfied have no application.  Those provisions include 
      s. 8, s. 9, s. 10 and      s. 12.  S. 12 contemplates in effect payment 
      to the secured creditors first, but it has no application because s. 4 was 
      not complied with.  Indeed, if not all creditors’ claims could have been 
      satisfied in full, s. 8(2) would also have been applicable and whether the 
      consent required by s. 8(2)(a) would have been given cannot be known.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, this reasoning and conclusion are impeccable.  The 
  purpose of the Act is to protect all creditors, including unsecured creditors.  
  That is achieved in one of two ways, either full payment to all creditors (s. 
  3) or less than full payment, but coupled with a detailed procedure for giving 
  creditors, including unsecured creditors, an opportunity to state their position 
  on the proposed sale (ss. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is common ground that National Trust received no payment, 
  let alone full payment, as a result of the bulk sale between Tax Time and H&amp;R.  
  My colleague does not regard this as important because, as he puts it, “even 
  if H&amp;R had complied with the Act, National Trust would not have received 
  any payment for its debt for the simple reason that the entire amount of the 
  sale proceeds were used to pay creditors that ranked ahead of it.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, this presumes that there was only one conclusion 
  a judge could have made if H&amp;R had complied with the Act.  Unfortunately, 
  H&amp;R’s calculated decision not to comply with the Act meant that all creditors, 
  including National Trust, were deprived of their statutory right to contest 
  the sale.  If National Trust had been accorded this right, it might have said 
  several things to a judge called upon to decide whether to approve the sale.  
  It might have submitted that the price was too low.  Alternatively, National 
  Trust could have pointed out that Tax Time was retaining some of its assets; 
  it could have submitted to the judge that more of Tax Time’s assets should be 
  included in the sale, thus raising the sale price and the proceeds available 
  for distribution to creditors.  Yet another potential submission to the judge 
  might have been that the sale should not proceed at that time without exploring 
  other options that would take better account of the interests of unsecured creditors, 
  including, perhaps, the payment of at least some of the debts of unsecured creditors 
  out of the assets Tax Time was retaining.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Of course, the judge hearing the application under the Act might 
  have rejected National Trust’s arguments and concluded that the sale should 
  proceed, that $800,000 was a fair price and that the proceeds should be distributed 
  to the two secured creditors.  The point is, however, as the application judge 
  observed, that this is “a matter that is now too late to speculate about”.  
  In the context of blatant non-compliance with the Act by H&amp;R and Tax Time, 
  a unilateral decision by Tax Time of how to distribute the proceeds of the sale 
  is not a proper accounting for the value of the stock in bulk.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In light of my conclusion on the accounting

  </span></span> After the bulk sale between H&amp;R and Tax Time took place in 
  June 1991, litigation involving Tax Time and National Trust continued.  The 
  result of that litigation was the dismissal of Tax Time’s $20,000,000 claim 
  against National Trust and acceptance of National Trust’s counterclaim relating 
  to the $205,000 debt.  Tax Time’s appeal of O’Leary J.’s judgment relating to 
  this debt was dismissed by this court on June 21, 1996, five years after the 
  completion of the bulk sale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application judge held that H&amp;R’s accounting should include 
  not only payment to National Trust of the $205,000 debt and interest thereon, 
  but also the costs of the litigation between National Trust and Tax Time which 
  resulted in judicial confirmation of the debt and interest thereon.  The application 
  judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>It appears to me that the obligation to account under 
      s. 16(2) arises at the time the sale is declared void and the amount of 
      the debt should accordingly be determined at that time, which would include 
      here any interest accrued and costs payable.</span></p>

  </span></span> With respect, I do not agree that H&amp;R is also liable to National 
  Trust for the assessed costs of the National Trust - Tax Time litigation and 
  for interest on those costs.  There is, in my view, a fundamental distinction 
  between debt incurred before a bulk sale and debt incurred after the sale.  
  The Act is designed to protect creditors with debts in the former, but not the 
  latter, category:  see <i>Bank of Montreal v. Ideal Knitting Mills Ltd.</i> 
  (1924), 55 O.L.R. 410 at 413 (C.A.); <i>Commercial Motorbodies  and Carriages 
  Ltd. v. Perth Ltd.</i>(1930), 65 O.L.R. 383 at 387-88, aff’d (1930), 66 O.L.R. 
  209 (C.A.); <i>Pizzolati v. Chittaro Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. May</i>, [1972] 
  2 O.R. 606 (C.A.); <i>Re St. Thomas Cabinets Limited</i> (1921), 50 O.L.R. 492

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is true that these cases deal with the distinction between 
  existing and post-sale <i>creditors</i>.  However, I can see no reason in principle 
  for not making the same distinction between existing and  post-sale <i>debts 
  of a single creditor</i>.  If a bulk sale purchaser need not be concerned with 
  new creditors of the vendor after the sale is concluded, equally the purchaser 
  should not need to be concerned with new debts that arise after the sale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, there is nothing in the wording of the Act to suggest 
  that the purpose of protecting creditors extends to protecting debt that does 
  not exist at the date of the sale.  If H&amp;R had complied with the Act, it 
  would not have been liable for the costs awarded several years later at the 
  conclusion of the National Trust-Tax Time litigation.  In my view, there is 
  no principled reason to extend H&amp;R’s liability to the costs of subsequent 
  third party litigation simply because H&amp;R did not comply with the Act.</p>

  </span></span> First, National Trust contends that the application judge erred 
  by substituting an average interest rate for the actual post-judgment interest 
  rates stipulated in the judgment and Order of O’Leary J. and the Order of this 
  court in the National Trust – Tax Time litigation. The application judge did 
  not apply those rates because H&amp;R was not a party to that litigation.  Instead, 
  the application judge substituted a rate of 6.07 per cent per annum, being the 
  average of bank interest rates prevailing since June 28, 1991, the date of the 
  bulk sale.  I see no reason to interfere with this disposition.</p>

  by failing to provide for pre-judgment interest on $800,000, the amount representing 
  the value of the stock, for the period after the indebtedness owing by Tax Time 
  reached that amount to the date of his judgment.  In light of the disposition 
  of the appeal, which removes H&amp;R’s liability to account for costs and interest 
  in the National Trust – Tax Time litigation, this issue does not arise because 
  National Trust’s recovery will be well under $800,000.</p>
