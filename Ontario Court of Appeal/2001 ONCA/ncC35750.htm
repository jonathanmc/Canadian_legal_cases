<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Timothy 
  C. Whetung on November 2, 2000.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>*</span></a> </p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual interference involving 
  his twelve year old granddaughter.  He now appeals that conviction, seeks to 
  withdraw his guilty plea and asks for a new trial.  Counsel filed two affidavits 
  by the appellant and the appellant was cross-examined on those affidavits.  
  We also received a letter from trial counsel detailing his recollection of the 
  relevant events.  Counsel was not cross-examined.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant claims that he was not told and he did not understand 
  that in pleading guilty to the charge he was admitting that he touched his granddaughter 
  “for a sexual purpose”.  The charge was read to the appellant prior to his plea.  
  The charge includes the phrase “for a sexual purpose”.  There was no further 
  reference to that phrase in the proceedings.  After describing two incidents 
  in which the appellant hugged his granddaughter and touched her “lower back/buttocks 
  area”, Crown counsel says:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Your Honour, that is a brief summary of the facts of what occurred.  The 
      essential gravamen of the offence is that the grandfather touched the body 
      of the granddaughter in an inappropriate way, making her feel uncomfortable 
      at the time.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Trial counsel for the appellant indicated that his client took the position 
  that he had hugged his granddaughter from behind and touched her in the stomach 
  area.  Counsel then added the following comment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… He describes the incident as going to her from behind and placing her 
      hands around on the front of her tummy area, but he concedes that there 
      was a touching that was inappropriate on those two occasions.  He sensed 
      on the second occasion that she felt uncomfortable.  He didn’t on the first 
      occasion, but in retrospect, looking back at hindsight, he can see that 
      she would feel uncomfortable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When asked if he had anything to say after the charges had been read 
  and counsel had made their submissions, the appellant said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I would like to say I am sorry that I made [the complainant] feel uncomfortable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant had intended to plead not guilty to the charge.  On the 
  day on which the preliminary inquiry was to be held, Crown and defence counsel 
  had certain plea discussions with the trial judge.  The appellant was aware 
  of these discussions.  He came to know that in exchange for a guilty plea, the 
  Crown would “water down” the factual allegations by removing any reference to 
  what was apparently the most serious of three factual allegations.  The appellant 
  pleaded guilty in open court, was convicted and received the sentence that he 
  understood he would receive upon his guilty plea.  He claims that he first realized 
  that he had pleaded guilty to an offence involving touching his granddaughter 
  for a sexual purpose when he read it in the paper the next day.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To be valid, a plea must be informed.  The accused must be aware of 
  the nature of the allegations to which he or she is pleading:  <i>R. v. T.(R.)</i> 
  (1992), 17 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 247 at 252 (Ont. C.A.).  Where an accused is 
  charged with sexual interference contrary to s. 151, his or her purpose is an 
  essential, if not the most important, element of the offence.  It is the sexual 
  purpose which makes the contact criminal.  If the appellant did not understand 
  that his plea constituted an admission that he touched his granddaughter for 
  a sexual purpose, his plea was not an informed one and cannot stand.  The appellant 
  has the onus of demonstrating that he lacked the necessary understanding.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We have no doubt that the appellant knew from the outset that he was 
  charged with an offence that arose out of the hugging of his granddaughter and 
  that the charge contained an allegation of sexual impropriety.  He discussed 
  the charge at length with his lawyer and it would appear that those discussions 
  contained reference to the sexual purpose component of the charge.  The appellant 
  had denied that he had any such purpose.  The appellant knew that he was pleading 
  guilty to the charge for which he had originally been arrested.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The real question, however, is whether the appellant understood that 
  as a result of the plea discussions, he would plead to that charge based on 
  what he did combined with how it made his granddaughter feel and without in 
  any way acknowledging any sexual purpose on his part.  The position taken by 
  the appellant finds support in the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> There is no mention of sexual purpose in the proceedings 
      after the charge is read.  The equivocal word “inappropriate” is used by 
      both counsel.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The Crown’s description of the essence of the offence makes 
      no reference to sexual purpose or to any other culpable state of mind.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Defence counsel’s reply to the Crown’s recitation of the 
      facts significantly changes those facts and again makes no reference to 
      the appellant’s state of mind.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> It is acknowledged that on the very day of the plea, the 
      appellant had denied any sexual purpose.  </p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Although counsel believed that his client understood the 
      charges, he did not explain to the appellant, after the appellant chose 
      to plead guilty, that by pleading guilty he was admitting that he touched 
      his granddaughter for a sexual purpose.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the appellant has met the onus of demonstrating that the 
  plea was not an informed one.  The appeal should be allowed, the plea set aside, 
  the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We add the following observation.  The trial judge has the power to 
  conduct an inquiry into the validity of a plea entered before that judge.  In 
  these circumstances, we think that the trial judge should have conducted such 
  an inquiry.  The facts accepted by the defence were very different from the 
  facts relied on by the Crown.  The trial judge knew that on the day of the plea 
  the accused had insisted he was not guilty.  Finally, defence counsel did not 
  clearly admit the essential elements of the offence.  These circumstances combined 
  should have raised sufficient concern to cause the trial judge to inquire into 
  the validity of the plea.  </p>
