<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Nancy M. Mossip 
  dated March 6, 2000.</span></b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>CRONK J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the court to order a 
  capacity assessment and visitation rights under the <i>Substitute Decisions 
  Act</i>, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 30, as amended, (the “SDA”) and the <i>Health Care 
  Consent Act</i>, 1996, S.O. 1996, c. 2, Sch. A., as amended, (the “HCCA”).  
  By judgment dated March 6, 2000, Justice Mossip declined to order the relief 
  sought and awarded costs of the application to the respondents, on a solicitor-and-client 
  scale, in the fixed amount of $18,000 inclusive of Goods and Services Tax and 
  disbursements.  The appellant, Judith Neill, appeals from the dismissal of her 
  application and seeks leave to appeal from the costs award.  For the reasons 
  that follow, I would grant leave to appeal the costs award and allow the appeal 
  on that issue.  In all other respects, I would confirm the judgment of the motions 
  judge.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio is a 78-year-old woman who suffers from advanced 
  Parkinson’s disease.  She is cared for in her own home by her husband, Maurice 
  Pellolio, and one of her three daughters, Maureen Pellolio.  Ms. Neill is also 
  a daughter of Mrs. Pellolio.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In August 1994, Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio signed a power of attorney 
  for personal care (the “Power of Attorney”) which appointed Maurice Pellolio 
  as her attorney and named Ms.&nbsp;Neill and Ms. Pellolio as co-attorneys if 
  Mr.&nbsp;Pellolio was unwilling or unable to act.  The Power of Attorney provides 
  in paragraph&nbsp;4 thereof:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If at such time the situation should arise in which there 
      is no reasonable expectation of my recovery from extreme physical or mental 
      disability, I DIRECT that I be allowed to die and not be kept alive by medications, 
      life support systems or other artificial means or “heroic measures”….</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In October 1999, Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio was hospitalized with admitting 
  diagnoses which included advanced Parkinson’s disease, aspiration pneumonia 
  and dehydration.  Her initial treatment involved use of a temporary nasal gastric 
  tube.  Although Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio recovered from the aspiration pneumonia, 
  the prognosis was unfavourable for recovery of the ability to swallow.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Options for future feeding care included initiation of permanent 
  gastrostomy tube feeding (“PGTF”)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> or cessation of gastrostomy tube feeding and pursuit of a long-term 
  palliative plan of care.  Under the latter option, it was anticipated that Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio’s 
  death would occur within one or two months.  Ms. Neill opposed commencement 
  of the PGTF treatment and sought to have paragraph&nbsp;4 of the Power of Attorney 
  enforced.  Mr.&nbsp;Pellolio and Ms. Pellolio supported PGTF.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In mid-November 1999, Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio’s treating physician, 
  Dr.&nbsp;Heather MacDonald, conducted an assessment under the HCCA to determine 
  Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio’s capacity to provide informed consent to PGTF. Dr.&nbsp;MacDonald 
  concluded, for reasons set out in her assessment note, that Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio 
  clearly indicated her wish to proceed with the PGTF treatment and understood 
  the implications of this decision.  Thereafter, Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio was discharged 
  home with a PGTF mechanism. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio’s discharge from hospital, Ms. Neill 
  commenced an application under the SDA and the HCCA to compel a capacity assessment 
  of her mother and to obtain visitation rights.  She obtained interim court orders 
  permitting her to visit her mother.  The visitations did not proceed smoothly.  
  Difficulties arose between Ms.&nbsp;Neill and other family members and, on at 
  least one occasion, between Ms. Neill and a visiting nurse.  Numerous, and often 
  acrimonious, court attendances then ensued, culminating in the appearance before 
  Justice Mossip in March 2000.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Two issues arise on this appeal: first, the 
  jurisdiction of the court to grant the capacity assessment and visitation rights 
  sought by Ms. Neill having regard to the nature of the application brought by 
  her; and secondly, the exercise by the motions judge of her discretion respecting 
  costs.</span></p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>(1)            <u>Request for Capacity Assessment</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In her application, Ms. Neill did not seek an order appointing 
  a guardian of the person or property of Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio pursuant to the SDA.  
  Rather, amongst other relief, she sought an order, (a)&nbsp;that her mother 
  be required to undergo an assessment to determine her capacity to understand 
  information relevant to making decisions concerning her health care, (b)&nbsp;outlining 
  the conditions for the conduct of such an assessment, (c)&nbsp;declaring the 
  Power of Attorney to be effective if, as a result of the assessment, Mrs. Pellolio 
  was found to be incapable of making decisions affecting her personal care, and 
  (d)&nbsp;granting Ms.&nbsp;Neill visitation rights to her mother.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge concluded that she had no jurisdiction under 
  the SDA or the HCCA to grant the relief sought by Ms. Neill.  With respect to 
  the SDA, she stated: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The applicant did not apply to be the guardian of the person nor the guardian 
      of the property of her mother, Geraldine Pellolio pursuant to the [SDA].  
      Section 79(1) of the SDA provides for the court to make an order that a 
      person be assessed “in a proceeding under this Act”.  The types of proceedings 
      under this Act are set out in sections 20.3, 22, 27(3.1), 42, 55 and 62(3.1).  
      There is no “stand-alone” relief available to the applicant for a capacity 
      assessment to be granted in the absence of an application brought under 
      the SDA for any of the permitted relief.  Accordingly, this court has no 
      jurisdiction under the SDA to grant the applicant’s relief.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In connection with the HCCA, the motions judge 
  concluded:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have reviewed the Affidavit of Dr.&nbsp;MacDonald and am satisfied that 
      she has properly and competently followed the procedures and requirements 
      set out in the [HCCA].  Dr.&nbsp;MacDonald found Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio capable 
      of consenting to treatment under that Act.  Accordingly, there is, pursuant 
      to that legislation, no provision to appeal the decision of the patient 
      and the treating physician, when the patient has consented to treatment, 
      as has occurred in this case.  The treatment was not administered to Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio 
      pursuant to [the] Power of Attorney which Mrs. Pellolio had granted in favour 
      of her husband of 36 years, but was administered as a result of Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio’s 
      consent as properly obtained by her attending physician.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, not only does the court not have jurisdiction 
      to grant the relief requested by the applicant, but I am not satisfied there 
      are any moral or equitable grounds to interfere with the decision made by 
      Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio in consultation with her doctor, assuming for the moment 
      the court could even do so.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms. Neill’s notice of application referenced ss.&nbsp;6, 45, 
  46, 79 and 80 of the SDA in relation to the requested assessment.  Before this 
  court, reliance was also placed by her on ss.&nbsp;66, 67 and 68 of the SDA.  
  However, none of these sections of the SDA, in the circumstances of this case, 
  provides jurisdiction to order the capacity assessment sought by Ms. Neill.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 79 of the SDA authorizes the court, on motion or on its 
  own initiative, to order that a person be assessed for the purpose of obtaining 
  an opinion as to the person’s capacity.  Section&nbsp;79(1) provides that this 
  power may be exercised:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If a person’s capacity is in issue in a proceeding under 
      this Act and the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to 
      believe that the person is incapable … </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Thus, for an assessment order to be made under 
  s. 79(1), two conditions must first be satisfied:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US>(a)</span> <span> </span>a proceeding under the SDA must 
      be pending in which a person’s capacity is in issue; and</p>
    <p> <span lang=EN-US>(b)</span> <span> </span>the court must be satisfied 
      that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is incapable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These conditions are cumulative.  In my opinion, neither condition 
  is satisfied in this case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The word “incapable” is defined under s.&nbsp;1(1) of the SDA 
  as meaning “mentally incapable”.  It is a basic principle of the SDA that, absent 
  reasonable grounds to believe the contrary, persons are presumed to be capable 
  of giving or refusing consent in connection with their own personal care (see 
  s. 2(2) of the SDA). A similar presumption is established under s. 4(2) of the 
  HCCA for the purposes of treatment under that statute.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The first requirement under s.&nbsp;79(1) of 
  the SDA, that a person’s capacity must be in issue “in a proceeding under [the 
  SDA]” in order for the court to order a capacity assessment, is not satisfied 
  in this case.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The SDA contemplates various types of proceedings, none of which 
  has been initiated by Ms. Neill.  These include proceedings to appoint a guardian 
  of property (see ss.&nbsp;17, 22 and 27(3.1)), or of the person for a person 
  who is incapable of personal care (see ss.&nbsp;55 and 62(3.1)), to review a 
  finding of incapacity (see s. 20.2), or to terminate or vary guardianship (see 
  ss. 20.3, 26, 27(9.1), 28, 61, 62(11) and 63)).  No application under any of 
  these sections of the SDA has been made in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms. Neill argues that the motions judge, in considering her jurisdiction 
  under the SDA, failed to take into account s.&nbsp;68 of the SDA.  That section 
  provides, in material part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If an incapable person has … an attorney under a power 
      of attorney for personal care, the court may give directions on any question 
      arising … under the power of attorney.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>An application may be brought under s.&nbsp;68(1) 
  by various persons, including by </span>“<span lang=EN-US>any person with leave 
  of the court” (see s.&nbsp;68(3)).</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> An application under s.&nbsp;68(1), however, presupposes that 
  a finding of incapacity has been made in respect of the person subject to the 
  power of attorney for personal care.  This has not occurred in relation to Mrs. 
  Pellolio.  Thus, even if Ms.&nbsp;Neill’s application had been framed as an 
  application for directions from the court, in this case such an application 
  would have been foreclosed under s. 68(1).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms.&nbsp;Neill argues that such a strict interpretation of s.&nbsp;68 
  of the SDA would unduly restrict the ability to challenge the capacity of a 
  person to make decisions in relation to his or her own care.  I do not agree.  
  The SDA contemplates, by the combined operation of ss.&nbsp;55 and 79, that 
  a capacity assessment may be ordered by the court in a proper case when a guardian 
  of the person application is pending concerning a person who is believed to 
  be incapable of personal care.  In contrast, as relevant to this case, s.&nbsp;68(1) 
  of the SDA reflects a clear legislative intention that an application for directions 
  be confined to questions arising under a power of attorney for personal care 
  once incapacity has been established.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> Furthermore, s.&nbsp;62(2) of the SDA imposes a mandatory duty 
  on the Public Guardian and Trustee to investigate “any allegation that a person 
  is incapable of personal care” where it is alleged that “serious adverse effects 
  are occurring or may occur” as a result of the person’s incapacity.  The term 
  “serious adverse effects” is broadly defined under s. 62(1) of the SDA to include 
  serious illness or injury, or deprivation of liberty or personal security.</p>

  </span></span> Thus, the SDA provides at least two mechanisms whereby the capacity 
  of a person in relation to personal care may be assessed.  This can occur in 
  the context of an application for the appointment of a guardian, or in the course 
  of an investigation by the Public Guardian and Trustee of an allegation of incapacity.  
  Neither mechanism applies in this case.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The second requirement under s. 79(1) of the 
  SDA contemplates that before an order may be made under that subsection for 
  a capacity assessment, the court will determine whether reasonable grounds exist 
  to satisfy the belief that a person is incapable.</span></p>

  </span></span> In this case, Dr. MacDonald did not conduct a general assessment 
  of Mrs. Pellolio’s capacity.  However, she did conduct a specific assessment 
  under the HCCA of Mrs. Pellolio’s ability to make a decision regarding long 
  term PGTF treatment.  As a result of this assessment, Dr. MacDonald concluded 
  that Mrs. Pellolio “is capable of making a decision regarding long-term tube 
  feeding under the HCCA” and that she “indicated her wish to proceed with [PGTF] 
  and understood the implications for this decision for her health care and other 
  needs”.  With respect to this treatment, therefore, capacity was specifically 
  confirmed.  Dr. MacDonald’s evidence is uncontroverted by evidence from any 
  other health practitioner.</p>

  </span></span> Although the HCCA was not argued by Ms. Neill on this appeal, 
  reliance was placed on it before the motions judge.  In addition, the respondents 
  submitted before this court that the HCCA is a complete code in relation to 
  consent to treatment issues, such that the provisions of that statute are dispositive 
  of the assessment and visitation rights requests made by Ms. Neill.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The HCCA and the SDA operate in concert respecting matters of 
  guardianship and incapacity.  The HCCA applies specifically, among other matters, 
  to consent to treatment issues.  Both statutes establish presumptions of capacity 
  and give prominence to the expressed wishes of a person in relation to his or 
  her personal care (see, in the case of the presumption of capacity, s. 4 of 
  the HCCA and s. 2 of the SDA and, in the case of a person’s expressed wishes, 
  s. 5 of the HCCA and ss. 66(3) and (4) of the SDA).  Paragraph 1(c) of the HCCA 
  confirms that one of the purposes of that Act is:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enhance the autonomy of persons 
      for whom treatment is proposed, … by,</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>(iii) requiring that wishes with respect to treatment, … expressed 
          by persons while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, be 
          adhered to;</p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, prior to commencement of the PGTF treatment, Dr.&nbsp;MacDonald 
  conducted the required assessment under the HCCA to determine the capacity of 
  Mrs.&nbsp;Pellolio concerning the proposed treatment and determined that she 
  was both capable with respect to the treatment and that she consented to it.  
  The motions judge concluded that there was no right under the HCCA to appeal 
  or review such a decision by a patient and treating physician when informed 
  consent to the treatment is given.  I agree with this conclusion.  I note also 
  that it is consistent with the fundamental philosophy reflected in the HCCA, 
  to respect the treatment wishes of capable persons concerning their personal 
  care when informed consent is given.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For all of these reasons, I conclude that there 
  is no basis upon which to interfere with the motions judge’s decision to decline, 
  on jurisdictional grounds, the requested capacity assessment.</span></p>

  </span></span> Ms.&nbsp;Neill correctly points out that an attorney for an incapable 
  person under a power of attorney for personal care is obliged to foster regular 
  personal contact between the incapable person and supportive family members 
  and friends (see ss.&nbsp;66(6) and 67 of the SDA).  Similarly, such an attorney 
  is obliged to consult from time to time with supportive family members and friends 
  of the incapable person who are in regular personal contact with the incapable 
  person (see ss.&nbsp;66(7)(a) and 67 of the SDA).  However, these obligations 
  only arise under the SDA where a finding of incapacity has been made.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A similar objective is identified as one of the purposes of the 
  HCCA when a person lacks the capacity to make a decision about a treatment (see 
  para.&nbsp;1(e) of the HCCA).  As relevant to this case, however, this objective 
  only applies under the HCCA when a person “lacks the capacity” to make decisions 
  about his or her treatment.  In this case, in respect of the PGTF treatment, 
  an express finding of capacity resulted from a capacity assessment conducted 
  under the HCCA.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge concluded that she had no jurisdiction in the 
  circumstances of this case to order visitation rights for Ms. Neill.  I agree 
  with this conclusion having regard to the nature of the application commenced 
  by Ms. Neill.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge also found that the respondents were willing 
  to allow Ms.&nbsp;Neill to visit Mrs. Pellolio, and that the terms for visitation 
  proposed by the respondents were reasonable and designed to protect Mrs. Pellolio.  
  As the motions judge lacked jurisdiction to order visitation rights in the proceeding 
  as framed by Ms. Neill, these findings, of course, were unnecessary.  I would 
  note, however, that these findings were fully supported by the record.</p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>(3)            <u>Costs</u></p>

  </span></span> In considering Ms. Neill’s application, the motions judge determined 
  the issues based on jurisdictional grounds.  In so doing, she commented adversely 
  on the motives of the appellant in bringing her application and on her conduct 
  in relation to the respondents and Mrs. Pellolio.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the costs award made by the motions 
  judge was punitive in nature.  While costs awards are a discretionary matter, 
  and leave to appeal such awards should be granted sparingly, I agree that costs 
  on a solicitor-and-client scale should not be awarded unless special grounds 
  exist to justify same (see Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs</i>, 2nd ed., (Canada 
  Law Book: 1993), at 2-91 to 2-92).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my respectful opinion, this is not a case warranting a complete 
  indemnification for costs.  As noted by this court in <i>Foulis et al. v. Robinson</i> 
  (1979), 21 O.R. (2d) 769, (Ont. C.A.), at 776:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The expense of litigation is a matter of concern for all those interested 
      in the administration of justice, but one must have regard for the burden 
      which such costs place on all parties.  Generally speaking, an award of 
      costs on a party-and-party scale to the successful party strikes a proper 
      balance as to the burden of costs which should be borne by the winner without 
      putting litigation beyond the reach of the loser.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the motions judge had jurisdiction under Rule 57.01 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure to award costs on a solicitor-and-client scale 
  in a proper case, the exercise of that power should be confined to exceptional 
  cases.  Moreover, while one might disagree with Ms. Neill’s belief that paragraph 
  4 of the Power of Attorney should be enforced, absent clear evidence to the 
  contrary, she is entitled to hold that belief without attribution to her of 
  improper or reprehensible motives.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the circumstances, I am of the view that 
  the appropriate costs award in relation to the application before the motions 
  judge was on the lower, party-and-party scale.</span></p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal the costs award, and 
  allow the appeal on that issue, by setting aside the costs award and in its 
  place award the respondents their costs of the application below on a party-and-party 
  basis.  In all other respects, I would confirm the judgment of the motions judge.  
  As success on this appeal has been divided, I would award no costs of the appeal.</p>
