</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pauline Nelitz appeals from the
judgment of Eberhard J. dismissing her action against the respondent Dr. Gary
Dyck for damages for battery and against the respondent Gore Mutual Insurance
Company for damages for battery and breach of duty of good faith.  Her husband, Robert Nelitz appeals from
dismissal of his claim under the <i>Family
Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;F.3. 
These claims arose out of an independent chiropractic examination
performed by Dr. Dyck at the request of Gore. 
The trial judge ordered that the plaintiffs pay party-and-party costs to
the defendants.  The appellants also
seek leave to appeal against the costs order and argue that there should have
been no costs ordered.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pauline Nelitz was involved in two
motor vehicle accidents.  The first
accident was in 1985 and resulted in her having to undergo a discotomy.  After this accident, Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz began
treatment with a chiropractor, Dr. Stackhouse. 
On January 27, 1993, she was involved in the second accident.  This accident was not as severe as the
first.  She continued treatment with Dr.
Stackhouse and claimed accident benefits from her insurer, Gore, primarily for
chiropractic care with Dr. Stackhouse. 
Gore had difficulty obtaining information from Dr. Stackhouse about Mrs.
Nelitz’s prognosis.  For over a period
of a year and a half Gore wrote to Dr. Stackhouse and later to Mrs. Nelitz
seeking information such as the schedule of visits before the accident.  Gore received no proper response from
either.  In February 1994, Gore asked
Dr. Stackhouse for Mrs. Nelitz’s progress and indicated that Gore was planning
to have her examined by another chiropractor. 
There was no response at that time nor to follow-up letters in June and
September nor to a telephone call in October. 
Notwithstanding Dr. Stackhouse’s lack of response, Gore continued to pay
his accounts as submitted as well as Mrs. Nelitz’s mileage. Finally, Gore’s
senior claims consultant, Dieter Fischer, contacted Dr. Dyck to arrange an
independent chiropractic examination. 
On December 7, 1994, Fischer wrote to Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz advising her of
the appointment with Dr. Dyck.  The text
of the letter is important:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Please be advised that we have arranged for an Independent Medical
Examination of you by Dr. Gary Dyck, located at 27 Gowan St. Barrie, ON,
telephone 705-726-9292, for Wednesday, January 11, 1995 at 10:00 a.m.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Dr. Dyck has requested that you bring along any X-rays which may
have been taken either by your family physician or your chiropractor is [sic]
it relates to your motor vehicle accident related injuries.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Should you not be able to attend for the scheduled appointment we
would ask that you telephone Dr. Dyck’s office directly and make alternate
arrangements.  Should you fail to attend
this appointment, any fee charged by the doctor’s office for the missed
appointment will be your responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although it does not say so, Mrs.
Nelitz interpreted the letter to mean that if she did not attend for the
examination, Gore would stop paying for her chiropractic care with Dr.
Stackhouse.  She went to Dr. Dyck’s office
on January 11, 1995.  She signed a form
authorizing Dr. Dyck to give the results of the examination to Gore.  She did not sign a consent to the
examination.  On the other hand, she
gave no indication at all that she was not consenting to the examination.  The examination lasted about 25
minutes.  She had no complaint about any
part of the examination except for what she said happened at the end.  She gave the following testimony:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Then I sat down on his examining table and he was standing behind me
and I felt his hands on my head and <u>all of a sudden there was a very quick,
a quick and a very harsh hand movement pushed down on my head</u> and I kind of
was taken, I was kind of shocked, I was stunned.  And I said, oh gee, that hurt. 
And that was the end of the examination.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Nelitz testified that after the
examination she began to feel unwell. 
She saw Dr. Stackhouse a few days after the examination and complained
to him.  He suggested that she call Dr.
Dyck.  She did so and complained that he
“really hurt” her.  During the
conversation Dr. Dyck used the term “foraminal compression test” (FCT).  Dr. Dyck made a note of this term which he
attached to the file.  Mrs. Nelitz
continued to experience nausea, dizziness and an inability to concentrate.  She found that she could no longer perform
properly at her part-time sales job because she was making errors.  She became depressed and angry and this
impacted on her relationship with her husband. 
She attributed the change in health to the actions of Dr. Dyck in pushing
down on her head.  </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Dyck is a highly qualified and
experienced chiropractor and has conducted many independent chiropractic
examinations.  During his testimony, he
described his procedure in exhaustive detail including the manner in which he
performs the FCT.  He reviewed his
records of the examination of Mrs. Nelitz and described the manner in which he
would have performed the FCT:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>I would come in behind the patient and do what is written here as
the foraminal compression test.  <u>Pressure
is put on his shoulders.</u>  I am going
to push down.  Stop me if there is any
discomfort at all.  As I push downwards,
it was indicated to me that discomfort was created in the mid dorsal
region.  That was recorded on the chart
right beside the foraminal compression, as mid D.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence from the experts was that
the procedure described by Mrs. Nelitz in which pressure is applied to the head
has some aspects similar to a cervical foraminal compression test (CFCT).  Dr. Dyck testified that a CFCT is a standard
orthopedic test to determine whether arm pain is caused from a radicular
involvement in the neck.  That test,
which would have been conducted early in the examination, was not called for
because Mrs. Nelitz had no complaints of arm pain.  Dr. Dyck testified that Mrs. Nelitz made no complaint of pain at
any time during the examination.  He
denied performing the procedure described by Mrs. Nelitz or a CFCT or
performing any chiropractic manipulation of her.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was a great deal of evidence
about Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz’s condition that pre-existed the examination.  There was evidence that she had suffered
from headaches, ear pain, right-eye blindness, depression, anxiety, variable
neck and chest pain and dizziness, awkwardness and nausea, all of which existed
prior to the examination by Dr. Dyck.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties called expert
evidence.  The experts tried to account
for the symptoms described by Mrs. Nelitz. 
The most important witness for Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz was Dr. Spence.  He was of the view that the best explanation
for her symptoms was vertebrobasilar artery injury (VBI) caused by manipulation
of the cervical spine.  However, the
weight of the evidence, including the plaintiff’s expert chiropractor, was that
the description of the procedure by Mrs. Nelitz would not be sufficient to
cause the VBI, because there was no twisting of the head.  Nevertheless, Dr. Spence was of the view
that VBI could be caused without such manipulation, although it usually
requires rotational manipulation.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence expert, Dr. Berry, offered
several explanations for the symptoms: (1)&nbsp;That if there was VBI it could
have been caused by the manipulations performed by Dr.&nbsp;Stackhouse.  That treatment included multiple cervical
manipulations involving rotation of the cervical spine.  (2)&nbsp;That in view of her pre-existing
psychiatric and marital difficulties, Mrs. Nelitz’s depression and associated
emotional symptoms arose primarily from stress related to a number of serious
family problems.  (3)&nbsp;That her
pre-existing migraine type problem, which had resulted in episodic complete
loss of vision in the right eye, supported a diagnosis of basilar migraine that
is characterized by many of the neurological symptoms described by Mrs. Nelitz
such as dizziness and nausea.</span></p>

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that Mrs.
Nelitz, although an honest witness, was imprecise and tended to gloss over or
omit medical history when consulting with her physicians and with the expert
witnesses.  She also rejected the
evidence of Mrs. Nelitz that she complained of any pain while in Dr. Dyck’s
office and rejected evidence given by Mr.&nbsp;Nelitz that his wife had
complained to him in Dr. Dyck’s office after the examination.  Nevertheless, the trial judge accepted that
she suffered “symptoms of unwellness [that] were indeed sudden, obvious and
debilitating” and that, in general, “from around January 11, 1995 she felt
lousy”.  </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found Dr. Dyck to be a
very precise witness and that “notwithstanding his lack of particular memory
about his examination of Pauline Nelitz on January 11, 1995, that this
demonstrated standard examination was likely exactly what he would do and has
done thousands of times”.  Thus, if Dr.
Dyck did perform the procedure as described by Mrs. Nelitz, “it would have been
a big mistake or a frolic taken for inexplicable reasons”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded this part of
her reasons with the following statement:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>In assessing the evidence, I am therefore left with this
dilemma:  <u>I accept totally that
Pauline Nelitz is an honest witness</u> who suffered symptoms which would be
caused by vertebral artery injury [VBI]. 
<u>I also totally accept that Dr.&nbsp;Dyck is an honest competent
practitioner</u> whose contemporary charting and reports support that he
performed a standard independent chiropractic assessment which did not include
a cervical foraminal compression test. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, the trial judge could not find
that Dr. Dyck had performed the CFCT based on Mrs. Nelitz’s testimony.  The trial judge then went on to consider
whether the symptoms themselves were proof of causation and referred to the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Snell
v. Farrell</i> (1990), 72 D.L.R. (4th) 289. 
She noted that <i>Snell</i> was a
different case because in this case there was a dispute not only about
causation but whether the act was done. 
She then held as follows:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>I find I must be persuaded on a balance of probabilities that it
[Dr. Spence’s diagnosis of VBI] is the only possible explanation, or I cannot
reasonably conclude not only that it is the cause but also go on to find that
Dr. Dyck must, therefore, have performed a cervical foraminal compression test
even though he says he didn’t and I would otherwise have believed him.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that “in spite of
the apparent cluster of symptoms after January 11, 1995” she was not persuaded
of “any necessary connection between the symptoms”.  The trial judge gave extensive and careful reasons for this
conclusion and found as follows:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>As a result of this analysis, I am unable to accept that
vertebrobasilar ischaemia is the only possible cause.  It is but one theory that could account for Pauline Nelitz’s
misery.  Since I cannot isolate that as
a cause and therefore conclude there must have been some traumatic triggering
event, and since I have no reason to believe the plaintiff and disbelieve the
defendant, <u>I make no finding that a cervical foraminal compression test was
performed</u>.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Therefore, the touch which formed the basis of the allegation of
battery is not proven to a civil standard.

found that the plaintiff had not proved the touch that formed the basis for the
allegation of battery, she went on to consider a “wider” consent argument.  This was based on the theory that the

theory of liability depended on the allegation that Mrs. Nelitz did not give a
genuine consent to the examination and only acquiesced in the examination
because of a misrepresentation by Gore in their December 7<sup>th</sup> letter.</span></p>

did not know of Mrs. Nelitz’s reluctance to undertake the examination.  She relied upon an excerpt from A.M. Linden,
<i>Canadian Tort Law,</i> 6<sup>th</sup> ed.
(Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1997) at p.&nbsp;66 to find consent by
conduct.  She also held that there was
no conspiracy between Dr. Dyck and Gore and no employment or agency
relationship.  Therefore, Dr. Dyck could
not be held liable “for any vitiation of consent by misrepresentation”.</span></p>

liability of Gore for battery on this theory. 
She held that Gore had no right under the <i>Insurance Act</i> or the applicable <i>Statutory
Accident Benefits Schedule</i> to require an independent chiropractic
examination.  The December 7<sup>th</sup>
letter made no mention of Mrs. Nelitz’s right to refuse.  As well, it was “clearly wrong” to purport
to hold her responsible for the cost should she fail to attend and this gave
“an otherwise innocuous letter a coercive tone”.  However, the trial judge found that a corporation cannot, itself,
commit battery and it could not be vicariously liable because it was neither
pleaded nor proved that Dr. Dyck was Gore’s employee or agent.</span></p>

was no breach of duty of good faith, notwithstanding the fact that Gore failed
to inform Mrs. Nelitz that she was not required to attend on the examination
and the letter had a tone of coercion. 
The trial judge held that if she were wrong on this aspect of the case
she would only have awarded nominal damages of $1.00 for breach of duty of good

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This was the main issue on the
appeal.  The appellants argued that the
trial judge misdirected herself with respect to causation and that her
dismissal of the claim is inconsistent with certain factual findings.  Much of the oral argument was directed to
what the appellants consider to be the inconsistency between finding that Mrs.
Nelitz was an honest witness and became unwell “from around January 11, 1995”
and yet failing to find that Dr. Dyck had performed the CFCT.  They also argue that the trial judge erred
in placing a burden on the plaintiffs to establish the exact cause of the
symptoms.  The court did not require the
respondents to respond to this part of the appeal.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, there is no inconsistency
between finding that Mrs. Nelitz was an honest witness and yet finding that Dr.
Dyck did not perform the complained of procedure.  While the trial judge found that Mrs. Nelitz was an honest
witness, she did not find that she was an entirely reliable witness.  The trial judge disbelieved Mr. and Mrs.
Nelitz on important issues.  More
importantly, she found that Dr. Dyck was an honest and reliable witness.  If that were the only evidence in the case,
and the trial judge was unable to decide which version of events was correct,
the plaintiffs would have failed because they bore the burden of proof.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, that was not the only
evidence and the trial judge went on to consider all of the evidence, including
the expert evidence.  The balance of the
evidence, some of which I have summarized above, was largely inconsistent with
Dr. Dyck having performed a procedure like the CFCT.  Considering all of the evidence, the trial judge was not
persuaded that Dr. Dyck had performed a test that was not required, that would,
as she said, mean that he was on a “frolic taken for inexplicable
reasons”.  </span></p>

counsel for the appellants complained that the trial judge had not carried out
her duty to make findings of fact.  This
submission was based on the excerpt quoted above where the trial judge says, “I
make no finding that a cervical foraminal compression test was performed”.  This submission betrays a misapprehension of
the trial judge’s reasons.  The trial
judge made extensive findings of fact. 
In the end, she did not believe Mrs. Nelitz’s testimony that
Dr.&nbsp;Dyck performed the CFCT-like test. 
She also did not disbelieve Dr. Dyck’s denial that he performed the
test.  Accordingly, the appellants had
failed to show that the CFCT was performed. 
Put another way, the trial judge could not find that the test had been
performed.  The burden of proof being on
the appellants, the claim failed.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants also submit that the
trial judge misdirected herself concerning causation.  They argue that the trial judge accepted that Mrs. Nelitz
experienced a constellation of symptoms following the January 11<sup>th</sup>
examination and there was no burden on the appellants to show the precise
scientific explanation for Mrs. Nelitz’s injury, whether it was VBI or
something else.  The appellants submit
that the trial judge erred, in particular, when she held that she had to be
persuaded on a balance of probabilities that Dr. Spence’s diagnosis of VBI “was
the only possible explanation” for Mrs. Nelitz’s symptoms.  They rely upon <i>Snell v. Farrell </i>and <i>Athey v.
Leonati</i> (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235 (S.C.C.).  In the latter case at p. 239, Major J. held as follows:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><u><span
lang=EN-US>It is not now necessary, nor has it ever been, for the plaintiff to
establish that the defendant's negligence was the <i>sole cause</i> of the injury</span></u><span lang=EN-US>. There will
frequently be a myriad of other background events which were necessary
preconditions to the injury occurring. To borrow an example from Professor
Fleming (<i>The Law of Torts</i>, 8th ed.
(Sydney: Law Book Co., 1992) at p. 193), a &quot;fire ignited in a wastepaper
basket is ... caused not only by the dropping of a lighted match, but also by
the presence of combustible material and oxygen, a failure of the cleaner to
empty the basket and so forth&quot;. As long as a defendant is <i>part</i> of the cause of an injury, the
defendant is liable, even though his act alone was not enough to create the
injury. There is no basis for a reduction of liability because of the existence
of other preconditions: defendants remain liable for all injuries caused or
contributed to by their negligence.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, as the trial judge correctly
recognized, there is an important distinction between this case and the
decisions in <i>Snell</i> and <i>Athey.</i> 
In <i>Snell</i>, the trial judge
found that the physician had been negligent in performing eye surgery.  The issue in the Supreme Court of Canada was
whether the plaintiff had proved that the loss of sight to the eye was due to
the defendant’s negligence.  Similarly,
in <i>Athey</i>, the defendant motorists
were admittedly negligent and again the only issue was causation.  In both cases, there was no doubt that the
defendants’ tortious conduct could have caused the injuries.  The defendants argued, however, that there
were other factors that caused or contributed to the injuries.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, leaving aside whether
the examination was tortious in and of itself because of lack of consent, there
was a fundamental dispute as to whether Dr. Dyck did anything that could have
caused the symptoms suffered by Mrs. Nelitz. 
All of the evidence, including the appellants’ evidence, was that aside
from the CFCT-type procedure there was nothing in the examination as described
by Dr. Dyck that could have caused the symptoms complained of.  Accordingly, the case focused on the one
unusual aspect of the examination as complained of by Mrs. Nelitz, the forceful
application of pressure to the top of her head.  If the appellants could not prove that Dr. Dyck had committed
this act, the examination was unremarkable and could not have been the cause of
the constellations of symptoms that occurred at the same time as the
examination.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[28]<span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctrines set out in the <i>Snell</i> and <i>Athey</i> cases would have been important only if the trial judge had
found that Dr. Dyck performed the act complained of, and a question then arose
as to the contribution of Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz’s pre-existing conditions.  At that point it would have been necessary
for the trial judge to apply the holding from <i>Athey</i> set out above.  The
case, however, never made it that far. 
The trial judge’s references to the expert evidence must be seen in that
light.  Since she was unconvinced by the
testimony of Mrs. Nelitz that Dr. Dyck had preformed the CFCT, she examined the
expert evidence to determine whether it could establish that Dr. Dyck must have
performed that procedure.  The expert
evidence manifestly did not do so.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>To conclude, the central issue in the
case was whether Dr. Dyck performed a CFCT-like procedure.  The appellants claimed that it was this
improper procedure that led to the deterioration in Mrs. Nelitz’s health.  It was this act that was the basis for the
large damage award sought by the appellants. 
In my view, the trial judge did not err in concluding that the
appellants had failed to prove Dr. Dyck committed this act.  Accordingly, the primary basis for the
battery claim failed.  I will now turn
to the grounds of appeal based on the simple theory that the examination, even
if conducted properly, was a battery because Mrs. Nelitz did not give a valid
consent.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>A valid consent can be given without uttering a word.  For example, a person standing in a line of

W.&nbsp;L. Prosser, <i>Handbook of The Law

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>The defendant is entitled to rely upon what any reasonable man would

If the plaintiff expressly says, “It’s all right with me,” he will of
course not be permitted to deny that he did consent.  <u>By the same token, if he holds up his arm without objection to

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this principle applies in
the circumstances of this case in respect to the allegation of battery against
Dr. Dyck based solely on the examination. 
As found by the trial judge, he reasonably relied upon the fact that
Mrs. Nelitz appeared for the examination and did not express any lack of
consent.  The circumstances were like
that of the example used by the authors of a person standing in line for a
vaccination and holding up her arm to be inoculated.  The evidence of all of the experts who testified at the trial was
that they did not obtain written consent from the patient before conducting an
independent medical examination.  They
relied upon the patient’s apparently voluntary attendance for the
examination.  I agree with Linden and
Prosser that a physician in the place of Dr. Dyck should be protected from
liability for battery.  Even if Mrs.
Nelitz did not consent to the examination because of the misrepresentation by
Gore, Dr. Dyck was, in effect, an innocent agent.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the trial judge erred in
finding that Gore could not be liable for battery because it was a
corporation.  While a corporation cannot
itself commit battery, because it cannot physically touch an individual, in my
view, it can be liable for battery directly by using an individual to commit
the act or vicariously for acts committed by an employee or agent within the
scope of his or her authority.  The
trial judge considered only vicarious liability and dismissed the claim because
Dr. Dyck was an independent contractor. 
However, if Mrs. Nelitz did not consent to the examination, Gore could
be liable directly for battery because it expressly retained Dr. Dyck to commit
the tort.  There is no question that
this form of liability was pleaded by the plaintiffs.  In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs alleged that Gore,
“actively participated in the battery by encouraging or forcing Pauline Nelitz
to undergo treatment by the Defendant, Dyck”. 
Subject to the question of consent, there is also no doubt that Gore
used Dr. Dyck to commit the alleged battery. 
Gore contacted Dr. Dyck, made the appointment and instructed
Mrs.&nbsp;Nelitz to attend for the examination.</span></p>

predicates the absence from his mind of any feeling of constraint interfering
with the freedom of his will.&quot; <u>A &quot;feeling of constraint&quot; so
as to &quot;interfere with the freedom of a person's will&quot; can arise in a
number of situations not involving force, threats of force, fraud or
incapacity.</u> The concept of consent as it operates in tort law is based on a
presumption of individual autonomy and free will. It is presumed that the
individual has freedom to consent or not to consent. This presumption, however,
is untenable in certain circumstances. <u>A position of relative weakness can,
in some circumstances, interfere with the freedom of a person's will. Our

of the relationship.  Whatever Mrs.

to as the “coercive tone” from this paragraph:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Should you not be able to attend for the scheduled appointment we
would ask that you telephone Dr. Dyck’s office directly and make alternate
arrangements.  Should you fail to attend
this appointment, any fee charged by the doctor’s office for the missed
appointment will be your responsibility.</span></p>

who has dealt with health professionals. 
It warns the patient that she will be responsible for the missed
appointment fee.  As La&nbsp;Forest J.
held in <i>Norberg,</i> community standards
of conduct might be of some assistance. 
This kind of language is not enough to show exploitation.</span></p>
