<h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h3>
<p>RE:                              HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. MICHAEL 
  NELSON (Applicant/Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE:                   DOHERTY, ROSENBERG and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL:                Sam Scratch for the appellant</p>
<p>                                    John McInnes for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD:                     May 24, 2001</p>
<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice D.G. Humphrey, sitting with 
  a jury,  dated February 26, 1999 and the sentence imposed on March 24, 1999.</p>
<h3 align="center"><u>ENDORSEMENT</u></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of robbery and several other offences arising 
  out of the same events.  The Crown alleged that the appellant, while masked, 
  gained entry to the apartment of Debbie Edwards and attacked and terrorized 
  Ms. Edwards and a friend over the course of several hours.  The appellant was 
  sentenced to 8 years in the penitentiary.  He appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the conclusion of oral argument, the court dismissed the conviction 
  appeal and varied the sentence from 8 years to 7 years.  These are the reasons 
  for that disposition.</p>
<h3><u><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Conviction Appeal</span></u></h3>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (a)   The undisclosed alibi</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown’s case rested primarily on the evidence of Ms. Edwards.  She 
  knew the appellant.  She testified that although the intruder was masked and 
  she was pepper sprayed by the intruder, she was able to identify the appellant 
  as the intruder.  She gave several reasons for that identification and was cross-examined 
  extensively on those reasons.  There was also independent evidence capable of 
  confirming Ms. Edwards’ identification of the appellant as her attacker.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified that during the time period when the attack 
  occurred, he was in his apartment cooking and also spent some time in another 
  apartment visiting friends.  Both apartments were in the same building as Ms. 
  Edwards’ apartment.  According to the appellant’s testimony, his uncle’s girlfriend 
  who lived with the appellant and his uncle was at home in the apartment with 
  the appellant during the relevant time.  Also, according to the appellant, two 
  young women were with him in the other apartment.  The appellant provided the 
  name of one of these two women.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When arrested shortly after the event, the appellant had told the police 
  that he was at home when Ms. Edwards was attacked.  He offered no further details 
  as to his whereabouts and made no reference to his uncle’s girlfriend or the 
  two women in the other apartment.  These details first emerged during the appellant’s 
  cross-examination.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant forcefully submitted that the Crown improperly 
  invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the defence’s failure to 
  call witnesses who could, according to the appellant’s testimony, account for 
  his whereabouts at the time of the attack on Ms. Edwards and her friend.  Counsel 
  further argued that even if the inference could be drawn, the trial judge erred 
  in failing to instruct the jury as to the limited nature of that inference and 
  the caution to be exercised before drawing that inference.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal the Crown characterized this as a case of an undisclosed alibi.  
  He argued that the appellant’s failure to reveal the identity of witnesses, 
  who could confirm his whereabouts, until cross-examination amounted to a failure 
  to give timely notice of the essential details of an alibi and invited an instruction 
  as to the adverse inference which could be drawn from the failure to give that 
  timely notice:  <i>R. v. Cleghorn</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 393, per Iacobucci 
  J. for the majority, at p. 397, per Major J. in dissent, at p. 407.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We accept the Crown’s submission.  The appellant’s defence was that 
  he was elsewhere when the crime was committed.  In short, he advanced an alibi:  
  <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 469 at 478-9 (Ont. C.A.).  The appellant’s 
  failure to disclose to the prosecution until cross-examination, the identity 
  of those who according to him could confirm his whereabouts denied the prosecution 
  the opportunity to effectively investigate the alibi.  In these circumstances, 
  the trial judge should have told the jury that the failure to make timely disclosure 
  of the witnesses referred to in the appellant’s cross-examination was a factor 
  to be considered in determining what weight should be given to the appellant’s 
  evidence that he was elsewhere when the crime was committed:  <i>R. v. Hill, 
  supra</i>, at 477-78;  <i>R. v. Chambers</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 343 
  (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Neither trial counsel nor the trial judge treated this as an alibi case.  
  Crown counsel made a submission to the jury that it should consider the appellant’s 
  failure to call certain witnesses in assessing the appellant’s credibility.  
  Crown counsel could have told the jury that the trial judge would tell them 
  that they could consider the appellant’s failure to disclose the names of the 
  witnesses in a timely fashion when assessing the veracity of the appellant’s 
  evidence as to his whereabouts.  The submission made by Crown counsel was no 
  more effective than that which the Crown could have made had it approached the 
  case as one involving an undisclosed alibi.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge said nothing about the failure of the appellant to call 
  the witnesses referred to by the Crown.  He also made no reference to the appellant’s 
  failure to make timely disclosure of the identity of those persons who according 
  to the appellant could vouch for his whereabouts at the relevant time.  The 
  absence of an instruction as to the potential impact of the appellant’s failure 
  to make timely disclosure benefitted the appellant.  From the appellant’s vantage 
  point, the trial judge put the case to the jury on a better basis than the appellant 
  was entitled to as a matter of law.  The appellant can demonstrate no prejudice 
  flowing from Crown counsel’s submissions concerning the failure to call certain 
  witnesses, or from the trial judge’s failure to address those submissions in 
  his instructions to the jury.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (b)   Count 9</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown acknowledges that the trial judge should have given the jury 
  more detailed instructions on count 9 in the indictment.  That count alleged 
  that the appellant assaulted Ms. Edwards’ friend and caused her bodily harm.  
  Crown counsel concedes that the jury could have concluded that the appellant 
  assaulted the friend, but did not cause her bodily harm.  The trial judge gave 
  only the tersest of instructions on this count.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Crown counsel submits that while there was evidence to support a conviction 
  for assault causing bodily harm, justice would not be served by a new trial 
  on that count alone.  He submits that the court should substitute a conviction 
  for assault.  We agree with that position and pursuant to s. 686(3) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>, would set aside the conviction for assault causing bodily harm on 
  count 9 and substitute a conviction for assault.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The sentence imposed on count 9 (3 years) was concurrent to the much 
  longer sentence imposed on the robbery charge.  We would not vary the sentence 
  imposed on count 9.  </p>
<h3><u><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Sentence Appeal</span></u></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant received a total sentence of 8 years.  He had spent some 
  10 months in custody prior to sentencing.  Assuming the usual two for one credit 
  given for pre-trial custody, the appellant’s sentence was equivalent to a sentence 
  of 9 years and 8 months.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the appellant is a young man (21 years old) and has only a 
  minor criminal record, a lengthy penitentiary term was fully warranted.  The 
  appellant assaulted, terrorized and humiliated Ms. Edwards over a prolonged 
  period of time.  His attack was premeditated and marked by repeated and egregious 
  acts of gratuitous violence.  The appellant also confined and assaulted Ms. 
  Edwards’ friend.  To make a bad situation even worse, the attack occurred in 
  Ms. Edwards’ home.  No doubt, she will live with the terror of that afternoon 
  for the rest of her life.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his reasons for sentence the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>So there is absolutely zero remorse;  not only zero remorse, complete defiance 
      of the criminal justice system by attempting to perpetrate a completely 
      perjurious defence on the jury.  Fortunately, they were not fooled and rejected 
      the accused’s evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge continued with this theme when he came to the appellant’s 
  pre-trial custody:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I take into consideration that he has done nine months dead time – ten 
      months pre-trial custody – I also bear in mind that the reason he was in 
      custody for ten months was to enable him to mount this perjurious defence 
      that he has put forward.<b></b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the trial judge erred in principle in disregarding 
  the pre-trial custody based on his assessment of the nature of the defence mounted 
  by the appellant.  Quite simply, there is no connection between the reason credit 
  is given for pre-trial custody and the trial judge’s conclusion that an accused 
  has advanced a “perjurious defence”.  It seems to us that the trial judge felt 
  that the appellant’s sentence should be increased because he had advanced a 
  “perjurious defence”.  Sentences cannot be increased to express disapproval 
  of the conduct of the defence.<b></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having found that the trial judge erred in principle, this court 
  must consider the appropriateness of the sentence imposed afresh.  We are in 
  substantial agreement with the trial judge’s assessment of the appropriate sentence.  
  A sentence closely approaching 9 years was entirely appropriate in this case.  
  Giving the appellant credit of 20 months for his pre-trial custody, we think 
  that 7 years in an appropriate disposition.<b></b></p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (c)   Disposition</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As indicated at the end of oral argument, a conviction for assault 
  is substituted on count 9 and the conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to 
  appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed by varying the 8 year sentence 
  imposed on the robbery charge to a sentence of 7 years.  In all other respects, 
  the sentences imposed at trial stand.<b>  </b></p>
