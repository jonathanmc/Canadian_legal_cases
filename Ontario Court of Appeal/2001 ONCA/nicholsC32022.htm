  </span></span> In September 1995 the appellant Reed Nichols, a young telemarketing 
  salesman in Toronto, placed a “cold call” to Ms. Drusilla Aden, an 82 year old 
  woman living alone in a suburb outside Chicago, Illinois.  He telephoned to 
  sell her packages of lottery tickets.  They talked several times a week over 
  the next few months, often discussing their mutual interest in investments.  
  Nichols endeared himself to Aden and she came to regard him as a friend.  At 
  the end of October 1995 she liquidated most of her foreign investments and sent 
  Nichols $900,000 U.S.  Later she sent him an additional $105,000 U.S.  She recovered 
  only part of her money.</p>

  </span></span> Aden and Nichols gave different accounts of why she sent him 
  the money.  According to Aden, Nichols told her that she had won $13,000,000 
  in a lottery but had to pay him secretly $1,000,000 in tax and insurance costs 
  to receive the winnings. According to Nichols, Aden retained him to invest her 
  money offshore in return for a fee and a share of profits.</p>

  </span></span> After a trial before Whealy J., Nichols was convicted of defrauding 
  Aden and sentenced to 5 years, 3 months in jail.  He appeals both his conviction 
  and his sentence.  The Crown cross-appeals on sentence and asks for a fine or 
  a restitution order.</p>

  </span></span> The Crown’s theory was that Nichols took advantage of a vulnerable 
  and lonely elderly woman.  When Nichols first contacted Aden in September 1995 
  he worked as a telemarketer for Winners Marketing International (“Winners”).  
  Nichols was in his mid-twenties.  His job was to solicit American citizens for 
  lottery packages.  The  company gave him a pre-planned sale pitch.  Nichols 
  was an excellent talker.  He worked on commission and earned approximately $150,000 
  annually.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Aden testified that when Nichols first telephoned her he said 
  that he was calling from Winfall International (“WFI”) on Bloor Street in Toronto.  
  WFI had no connection to Winners, his place of employment.  WFI had been incorporated 
  by Nichols’ wife for a jewellery wholesale business.  It had a post office box 
  and a 1-800 number.  The jewellery business never materialized.  WFI was used 
  only to receive Aden’s money.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols and Aden talked many times a week over several months.  
  A number of the calls lasted over an hour.  They talked about their common interest 
  in investments.  Nichols learned that Aden lived alone and was quite wealthy.  
  Aden came to trust Nichols and rely on his advice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although Aden had difficulty remembering many of the details 
  of her telephone discussions with Nichols, she testified that on one occasion 
  he told her she had won $13,000,000 in a lottery because of tickets she had 
  bought from WFI.  She could not recall buying the tickets.  Nichols told her 
  that she had to pay $1,000,000 U.S. in taxes and insurance before she could 
  receive the money and that if she told any one she would lose the lottery winnings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Aden liquidated most of her investments on October 31, 1995 and 
  sent WFI a cashier’s cheque for $900,000 U.S.  Over the next nine months she 
  sent WFI additional cheques totalling $105,000 U.S.  That was virtually all 
  of her money.   She said that she never received any receipts, documents, accounting 
  or records of trading activity for the money that she sent to Nichols.  She 
  also did not receive any of the $13,000,000 in lottery winnings.  Nichols did 
  send her, at her request, cheques for $10,000 and $13,000 in December 1995 and 
  January 1996.  According to the Crown, he sent her these two cheques to allay 
  any concerns that she might have.  The bank manager at Aden’s branch in Illinois, 
  worried that her client may have been the victim of a scam, initiated a complaint 
  that led to the fraud charge against Nichols.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols gave an entirely different account of his telephone calls 
  with Aden.  He denied that he had defrauded her.  He contended that he and Aden 
  entered into a legitimate arrangement under which he was to manage her money 
  offshore.  His evidence was that though he telephoned her to solicit her to 
  buy a lottery package, when he discovered that she was a client of a competitor 
  he stopped his sales pitch.  Nonetheless he continued to talk to her, mainly 
  about investments.  He told her that he was setting up his own investment fund 
  to manage money offshore.  She was unhappy with her stocks and decided to invest 
  with him.  She signed a contract authorizing him to manage her money for a ten 
  percent annual fee plus twenty-five percent of any profits.  He resigned from 
  Winners in October 1995 to manage Aden’s money.  She was his only client.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols acknowledged that Aden sent him a total of $1,005,000 
  U.S. - $900,000 U.S. at the end of October 1995 and later a series of cheques 
  totalling $105,000 U.S.  Nichols transferred Aden’s money offshore to the Turks 
  and Caicos Islands through a corporation he had purchased there, LCC9606 Ltd.  
  He set up a bank account with Barclays Bank for LCC9606, which he alone controlled.  
  Because he had to have a corporate presence in Turks and Caicos, Nichols arranged 
  for Sapphire Nominees Ltd. – a firm that made its business being the corporate 
  office for many “paper companies” – to become a shareholder director and secretary 
  of LCC9606.  He was the only other director, the only signing officer and the 
  registered beneficial owner of the money.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols testified that in April 1996 he instructed Sapphire to 
  have Aden named beneficial owner of LCC9606 and that she signed and returned 
  to him a trust declaration authorizing him to trade on her behalf.  He said 
  that his copy of the trust declaration went missing the weekend he was arrested.  
  In reply the Crown called Cecilia Ursu, the director and secretary of Sapphire, 
  who testified that she received no instructions from Nichols in April 1996 to 
  transfer ownership to Aden and that Nichols did not request confirmation of 
  the transfer until March 1999.  Even apart from the trust declaration however, 
  Nichols claimed that Aden authorized all of the trades that he made.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols did not withdraw any of Aden’s money for his personal 
  use.  He did, however, engage in risky and speculative trades, all through the 
  brokerage firm of Deacon Capital.  At the time of trial Aden’s money had dwindled 
  to $770,000 U.S.  After the Crown closed its case Nichols returned $772,000 
  U.S. to Aden, leaving a capital shortfall of $209,500.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> At the close of the trial on April 8, 1999 the trial judge delivered 
  reasons in which he found Nichols guilty of fraud.  I turn now to the grounds 
  for Nichols’ conviction appeal.</p>
<h4> <span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:

<p style=' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'> 
  <span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nichols submits that the trial judge erred in refusing him a 
  reasonable adjournment partway through the trial to retain new counsel.  Because 
  of the trial judge’s ruling, Nichols was unrepresented by counsel on a day when 
  the Crown called five witnesses.  Nichols submits that the trial judge’s ruling 
  deprived him of a fair trial.  To put Nichols’ submission in context I will 
  briefly review what occurred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial began on Monday, November 16, 1998.  Nichols was represented 
  by counsel.  However, he discharged his counsel on the morning of Wednesday, 
  November 18<sup>th</sup> because he was unhappy with the way she was conducting 
  the defence.  By then the Crown had put in part of its case, including the evidence 
  of Aden and her bank manager in Illinois whose complaint led to the charge against 
  Nichols.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After Nichols had discharged his counsel the trial judge told 
  him “I’m not going to abort the trial.”  He adjourned the trial until the next 
  day November 19<sup>th</sup> to permit Nichols to find new counsel but said 
  whether or not he had new counsel the trial would proceed on Friday, November 
  20<sup>th</sup>.  Nichols replied that he wanted his new counsel properly prepared 
  and that he was still receiving Crown disclosure.  However, the trial judge 
  did not alter his position.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On Thursday, November 19<sup>th</sup> Nichols came to court with 
  a letter from Mr. Norman Chorney, a criminal defence lawyer.  In his letter 
  Mr. Chorney said that he would act for Mr. Nichols but he was not available 
  on November 20<sup>th</sup>.  Mr. Chorney wrote that he could proceed on November 
  27<sup>th</sup> provided the transcripts of the evidence already taken were 
  available for review.  The trial judge, however, refused to adjourn the case 
  for a week and again insisted that it go ahead the next day, November 20<sup>th</sup>.  
  He commented, “Mr. Nichols you will recall yesterday that I told you not to 
  retain a lawyer who was not going to be prepared to continue tomorrow morning.”  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On November 20<sup>th</sup> Nichols reiterated that Mr. Chorney 
  would be available in a week.  The trial judge then ascertained that the Crown 
  intended to call five witnesses, none of whom had direct involvement in the 
  dealings between Nichols and Aden.  The trial judge was satisfied that &quot;the 
  accused could cope with that sort of witness quite adequately on his own.”  
  He ordered the case to proceed that day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown called two witnesses to testify about the incorporation 
  of WFI and the activity in its bank account, one witness to testify about Nichols’ 
  employment with Winners and two police officers.  Nichols did not cross-examine 
  any of these witnesses, stating that he was not a lawyer and did not know what 
  to ask.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During the evidence of the two police officers the Crown conducted 
  what amounted to a partial <i>voir dire</i> on the admissibility of a statement 
  made by Nichols.  Before the <i>voir dire</i> was completed the Crown decided 
  that because Nichols was unrepresented it would not seek to admit the statement.  
  Nonetheless, the trial judge later admitted part of the statement, holding that 
  everything he had heard suggested that the statement was given voluntarily.  
  He did not give Nichols an opportunity to lead evidence on the <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown closed its case by the end of the day on Friday the 
  20<sup>th</sup>.  The trial was then adjourned several times before the case 
  for the defence was called.  The two reasons for these adjournments were: first, 
  Mr. Chorney wanted time to prepare a defence forensic accounting report and 
  the Crown wanted time to review the report; and second, Mr. Chorney then discovered 
  he had a conflict requiring him to withdraw from the case and forcing Nichols 
  to retain yet another counsel.  The trial was not completed until early April 
  1999.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This first ground of appeal, however, turns on the trial judge’s 
  ruling refusing to adjourn the trial from November 18 to November 27, 1998 and 
  instead ordering the trial to proceed on November 20<sup>th</sup>.  Two rights 
  are at stake: the accused’s constitutional right to be represented by counsel, 
  a fundamental right zealously protected by the court; and the trial judge’s 
  right to control the trial process, a right that includes a wide discretion 
  to grant and refuse adjournments.  In reviewing the trial judge’s balancing 
  of these rights, an appellate court should only interfere if the refusal of 
  an adjournment deprived the accused of a fair trial or the appearance of a fair 
  trial.  See <i>R. v. McCallen</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 56 (C.A.).</p>

  </span></span> In my view, it would have been preferable had the trial judge 
  granted the adjournment sought by Nichols.  Nichols’ request for a one week 
  adjournment was reasonable.  Nothing in the record indicated that he was trying 
  to abort the trial or otherwise manipulate the trial process, or refuted his 
  assertion that his decision to retain new counsel was made in good faith.  There 
  was no jury and no witnesses that would have been inconvenienced by an adjournment 
  to November 27<sup>th</sup>.  And realistically no lawyer could take on the 
  case on the mere two day reprieve given by the trial judge.</p>

  </span></span> However, I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s ruling deprived 
  Nichols of a fair trial or the appearance of a fair trial.  The ruling allowed 
  the Crown to call five witnesses when Nichols was unrepresented.  Three witnesses 
  gave evidence that was peripheral and uncontroversial, evidence concerning WFI 
  and its banking records and concerning Winners, Nichols’ former employer.  Nichols 
  relied on this evidence in his defence.  The two other witnesses, the police 
  officers, gave evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> about a statement made by Nichols.  
  In the part of the statement admitted by the trial judge Nichols acknowledged 
  that he knew Aden and was involved in confidential business dealings with her.  
  This was the very position he advanced at trial.  Moreover, the defence never 
  sought to recall any of the five witnesses for cross-examination.</p>

  </span></span> The Crown claimed that it did not know the defence’s position 
  that Nichols had legitimately arranged to manage and invest Aden’s money.  After 
  hearing Nichols’ evidence about this arrangement, the Crown called in reply 
  – without objection from the defence – Tannis McLaren, Special Advisor to the 
  Chair of the Ontario Securities Commission.  Ms. McLaren was qualified as an 
  expert in securities regulation.  She gave an opinion that the dealings Nichols 
  testified to would be illegal in Ontario absent registration with the Ontario 
  Securities Commission.  Nichols was not registered.  The trial judge accepted 
  Ms. McLaren’s opinion and relied on it in convicting Nichols.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Nichols submits that Ms. McLaren’s evidence 
  should not have been admitted because it was not proper reply evidence and, 
  more important, it was merely evidence of bad character irrelevant to any fact 
  in issue.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have serious concerns whether Ms. McLaren’s opinion evidence 
  was properly admissible.  Her opinion was not put to Nichols in cross-examination.  
  Moreover, I think Mr. Gold is correct in submitting that the opinion was not 
  relevant to any issue in the case.  The question the court had to decide was 
  whether Nichols had defrauded Aden.  Whether Nichols failure to become registered 
  amounted to a <i>Securities Act</i> violation was irrelevant to whether he committed 
  fraud.  Nonetheless, this was a judge alone trial and I cannot say that Ms. 
  McLaren’s evidence alone caused a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<h4><span>            </span>3.  The onus of proof</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge was faced with two conflicting versions of what 
  occurred.  He was required to resolve this credibility conflict in accordance 
  with the principles in <i>R. v. W.D.</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  
  Nichols submits that the trial judge did not do so.  He argues that the trial 
  judge simply weighed one version against the other and then compounded this 
  error by relying on his rejection of Nichols’ version as positive proof of guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the trial judge’s reasons do not resolve the credibility 
  conflict according to the three-step formula set out in <i>W.D.</i>, taken as 
  a whole the reasons are faithful to the substance of <i>W.D.</i>   I am therefore 
  not persuaded that the trial judge misapplied the onus of proof.  <i>R. v. S. 
  (W.D.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The rationale underlying <i>W.D.</i> is that a trial judge should 
  not simply choose between two competing versions of what occurred because doing 
  so ignores the third alternative, that though the accused’s evidence may not 
  be believed, it may still raise a reasonable doubt.  In this case the trial 
  judge did not approach the case by considering whether he should believe Aden’s 
  story or Nichols’ story.  His reasons show that he considered whether Nichols’ 
  evidence raised a reasonable doubt and whether the Crown had proved the case 
  to the criminal standard.  Before finding Nichols guilty, the trial judge reviewed 
  important aspects of both the Crown and the defence evidence.  He made findings 
  on the credibility of all the main witnesses in the case.  He was alive to the 
  frailties in Aden’s evidence stating that “her testimony was not perfect but 
  on dominant facts and issues she was firm and unhesitating.”  On the other hand, 
  in his view, Nichols’ evidence was rife with “improbabilities and specific contradictions”, 
  many of which the trial judge itemized.  In the light of his assessment of all 
  the evidence, the trial judge not only rejected Nichols’ testimony as untrue, 
  but was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of Nichols’ guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moreover, I do not think that the trial judge used “the improbability 
  and specific contradictions” in Nichols’ testimony as positive proof of guilt.  
  Nichols relies on the following paragraph at the conclusion of the trial judge’s 
  reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>In conclusion the combination of improbabilities and specific 
      contradictions of Nichols’ testimony have convinced me, beyond a reasonable 
      doubt that the testimony of Drucila Aden as to why she sent her money to 
      this accused man is true, and that his testimony is untrue.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The language of this paragraph is admittedly awkward.  But it 
  comes after the trial judge had discussed the Crown and defence evidence, made 
  findings on what evidence he accepted, and, importantly, after he had unequivocally 
  rejected Nichols’ evidence.  The Supreme Court of Canada and this Court have 
  consistently stated that a trial judge’s reasons should not be put under a microscope, 
  that individual paragraphs should not be examined in isolation from the reasons 
  as a whole, and that trial judges are presumed to know elementary principles 
  of criminal law such as the burden and onus of proof.  As my colleague Doherty 
  J.A. said in <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Even if the passage set out above was ambiguous and could bear either the 
      interpretation I place on it or the interpretation advanced on behalf of 
      the appellant, I would adopt my interpretation.  Trial judges are presumed 
      to know the law:  <i>R. v. Burns</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at pp. 664-65, 
      89 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at pp. 199-200.  That presumption must apply with particular 
      force to legal principles as elementary as the presumption of innocence. 
      Where a phrase in a trial judge’s reasons is open to two interpretations, 
      the one which is consistent with the trial judge’s presumed knowledge of 
      the applicable law must be preferred over one which suggests an erroneous 
      application of the law:  <i>R. v. Smith (D.A.)</i> (1989), 95 A.R. 304 (C.A.) 
      at pp. 312-13, affirmed [1990] 1 S.C.R. 991.</p>
    <p>… In any event, it is wrong to analyze a trial judge’s reasons by dissecting 
      them into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation as if it described, 
      or was intended to describe, a legal principle applied by the trial judge.  
      Reasons for judgment must be read as a whole: <i>R. v. C.(R.)</i> (1993), 
      81 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at p. 418 (Que. C.A.), per Rothman J.A. in dissent at 
      p. 419; dissenting reasons adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada [1993] 
      2 S.C.R. 226, 81 C.C.C. (3d) 417; <i>R. v. Telmosse</i> (1945), 83 C.C.C. 
      133 at p. 138, [1945] 1 D.L.R. 779 (S.C.C.).  Furthermore, they must be 
      read with an appreciation of the purpose for which they were delivered.  
      Where a case turns on the application of well-settled legal principles to 
      facts as found after a consideration of conflicting evidence, the trial 
      judge is not required to expound upon those legal principles to demonstrate 
      to the parties, much less to the Court of Appeal, that he or she was aware 
      of and applied those principles.</p>

  The Crown’s cross-examination of  Nichols on his affidavit</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During her cross-examination of Nichols, Crown counsel asked 
  him whether he had ever called himself a “security investment manager.”  He 
  answered “no”.  Crown counsel then tried to impeach Nichols’ credibility by 
  referring to an affidavit Nichols had filed on a pre-trial <i>Charter</i> motion.  
  In that affidavit Nichols had sworn that at the time he was charged he was “a 
  certified investment manager.”  At trial Nichols acknowledged that his affidavit 
  evidence was untrue.  The trial judge relied on this untruth in rejecting Nichols’ 
  defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Defence counsel at trial did not object to the Crown’s use of 
  Nichols’ affidavit to impugn his credibility.  On appeal, however, Mr. Gold 
  submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine 
  Nichols on his affidavit.  Mr. Gold contends that under s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  the affidavit could be used to impeach evidence given by the accused on direct 
  examination but not on cross-examination.  As the accused’s evidence sought 
  to be impeached – that he had never called himself a security investment manager 
  – was elicited on cross-examination, Mr. Gold submits that the Crown could not 
  rely on the affidavit from the earlier motion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443.  Provided the testimony – here an affidavit – from an earlier 
  proceeding is used, as it was here, to impugn the accused’s credibility and 
  not to establish guilt, then whether the evidence sought to be impugned is given 
  on direct examination or on cross-examination matters not.  In neither case 
  is s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i> infringed.  I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> To respond to Nichols’ evidence that he transferred beneficial 
  ownership of LCC9606 to Aden in April 1996, the Crown called in reply Cecilia 
  Ursu, the director and secretary of Sapphire.  Nichols submits that the trial 
  judge erred in his appreciation of her evidence.  I disagree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge held that Ursu had not received instructions 
  in April 1996 to transfer the beneficial ownership of LCC9606 to Aden and that 
  she was induced by Nichols in March 1999 to backdate documents evidencing the 
  transfer.  The trial judge found:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I accept the testimony of Cecilia Ursu that she never received, to her 
      knowledge, any instructions from Nichols by fax in 1996 to change the beneficial 
      ownership of LCC9606 to Aden from himself.  When approached by Nichols on 
      3 March 1999, just four weeks ago, to confirm she had carried out his 1996 
      instructions, and she asked to see the fax cover sheet, he lied when he 
      responded that it was in the hands of his lawyers.  She was induced by Nichols 
      to prepare back-dated minutes for the company books of a resolution to that 
      effect.  This evidence directly contradicts an important element of Nichols’ 
      testimony and increases the improbability that Aden would have agreed to 
      the arrangement he claims.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These findings are fully supported by Ursu’s evidence.  Nichols 
  first contacted Ursu on March 2, 1999, after the Crown had closed its case. 
  He asked for confirmation that his instructions to her on April 23, 1996, to 
  appoint Aden as director and sole beneficiary had been followed.  She said that 
  she had never before received any instructions from anyone about Aden.  Nichols 
  then sent her a fax containing his alleged instructions of April 23, 1996 that 
  Aden be appointed director and beneficial owner of the company.  The cover sheet 
  of the April 1996 fax was not attached.  Ursu asked Nichols for the fax cover 
  sheet showing that he had faxed the instructions in April 1996.  Nichols told 
  her that the fax cover sheet was with his lawyer.  This statement proved to 
  be untrue and the defence later admitted Nichols’ lawyer did not have the fax 
  cover sheet in his file.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nonetheless, Ursu did prepare backdated minutes and a trust declaration 
  reflecting the transfer of ownership to Aden in April 1996.  She testified that 
  she felt uncomfortable doing so but complied with Nichols’ request out of concern 
  that she had missed the original fax, even though she did not remember ever 
  having received it.  The trial judge’s findings show no misappreciation of Ursu’s 
  evidence.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<h4><span>            </span>6.   The Crown’s reply evidence</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In addition to Ursu, the Crown called two other witnesses in 
  reply, Ernest Decater and Tanis McLaren.  Nichols submits that the trial judge 
  erred in admitting the evidence of Decater and McLaren because in doing so he 
  allowed the Crown to split its case.  I do not agree with this submission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have already dealt with McLaren’s evidence.  In my view it 
  did not prejudice Nichols, and indeed his trial counsel did not object to her 
  giving evidence in reply.  Decater was called to rebut Nichols’ evidence that 
  he gave up selling lottery packages in October 1995 to devote all of his efforts 
  to managing Aden’s money.  Decater testified that his late mother regularly 
  received telephone calls from a man named “Ray” and that between April 1995 
  and July 1996 she wrote cheques to Winners, WFI and “Ray Nickel”.  In my view, 
  Decater’s evidence was proper reply evidence but even if it was not, the evidence 
  was relatively insignificant and could not have prejudiced Nichols’ defence.</p>

lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge considered that absent any recovery of money 
  the appropriate sentence would have been seven years.  He discounted this figure 
  by 25 per cent in recognition of the substantial recovery of nearly $800,000.  
  He therefore sentenced Nichols to a prison term of five years, three months.  
  Nichols submits that the sentence is unreasonably high.  I agree.</p>

lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The need to deter and denounce those who prey on the elderly 
      and vulnerable.  In the trial judge’s words:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Predators who target the weak, the sick, the elderly and the disadvantaged 
        attract the most public opprobrium simply because such cowardly conduct 
        strikes at the core values of our society:  fairness and decency.  Where 
        large sums of money are involved and there is no recovery, the principles 
        of public denunciation of the conduct and deterrence to others are the 
        dominant considerations.</p>

lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Despite the substantial recovery Aden was still defrauded 
      of a large sum of money.  With interest the trial judge estimated the loss 
      approximately $372,000 U.S.  Moreover, for about three years she did not 
      have any of the money and therefore had no cash flow.</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The need to deter cross-border frauds, which are both difficult 
      to uncover and to prosecute.  Again in the trial judge’s words:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There is another factor present in this case which marks it as most serious.  
        The facts illustrate a cross-border fraud industry that bedevils the authorities 
        of both U.S.A. and Canada.  The cost of international investigations, 
        the overlapping local and international jurisdictions, and the obscurities 
        which borders provide creates a huge thicket from which unscrupulous people 
        pursue their criminal trade.  No week passes without some story about 
        someone who thought they had a sure thing but lost their money in a similar 
        scam.  Courts, by their sentences, must recognize the difficulty of apprehending 
        and prosecuting such persons as the man before this court.  It is another 
        factor to be weighed.</p>

  </span></span> Despite these considerations, five years, three months is excessive, 
  taking into account that Nichols had no previous criminal record, that, in the 
  end, he returned the bulk of the money, and that other seemingly more serious 
  frauds have attracted lesser sentences:  <i>R. v. Gray</i> (1995), 76 O.A.C.

  </span></span> I would not interfere with the trial judge’s discretion in refusing 
  to impose a fine.  A fine would unreasonably affect the proportionality of the 
  sentence.  If the fine were paid the trial judge’s sentence of imprisonment 
  would become inappropriate because it was based on only partial restitution, 
  and if it were not paid the total sentence of imprisonment would become unfit.  
  I note as well that Nichols eventually returned to Aden all of her money that 
  he had remaining.</p>

  </span></span> A restitution order might have been appropriate had the Crown 
  requested it at trial.  But the Crown did not do so and I do not think that 
  this court should now order restitution on appeal.</p>

  </span></span> I would dismiss Nichols’ appeal against conviction.  I would 
  grant leave to appeal sentence and reduce the sentence to four years imprisonment.  
  I would dismiss the Crown’s cross-appeal on sentence.</p>
