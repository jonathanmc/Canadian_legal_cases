<p class=MsoFooter>On appeal from the order of Justice G. William Dandie dated 
  March 16, 2001</p>
<h3 align="center"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On May 10, 2000, Craig Nelson was arrested on 
  a charge of first degree murder. On March 16, 2001 he was denied bail. On March 
  30, 2001 he was committed for trial on this charge. That trial is now scheduled 
  to begin on June 10, 2002.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Pursuant to s. 680 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  and the direction of the Chief Justice of Ontario he now applies for a review 
  of the decision denying him bail pending trial. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It is common ground that in reviewing that decision 
  this court applies the standard of correctness, and that because of the gravity 
  of the charge, s. 515 of the <i>Code</i> places the onus on the accused to show 
  why his detention is not justified.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In our view, the accused is unable to do so 
  on the facts of this case. We conclude that the decision denying bail was correctly 
  made.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For the following reasons, we are particularly 
  concerned about the primary ground set out in s. 515.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The accused has a significant criminal record 
  which includes convictions for crimes of violence and five convictions for breaches 
  of court orders. Two of those five are for failure to appear as required. When 
  cross-examined about one of these, the accused acknowledged that he did not 
  attend court because he did not want to return to jail. Hence he has a history 
  of disregarding court orders including orders requiring his attendance in court.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While the accused has not been convicted of 
  a crime since November 1995, nevertheless, since his arrest on this charge, 
  he admits having used marijuana several times in jail and has been involved 
  in several physical altercations. These events give little comfort that he has 
  put behind him the kind of conduct reflected in his criminal record.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Nor is there a release plan that would instil 
  much confidence that the accused will abide by his obligations. He does not 
  have a certain job to go to. While he would be living with his parents, that 
  was true for most of the time covered by his criminal convictions. It appears 
  that despite their best efforts, his parents have been unable to control the 
  accused in the past. And while they are prepared to post as security most of 
  what they own, there is little in the material to suggest that this matters 
  sufficiently to the accused to provide the required assurances of his future 
  attendance in court. This is particular so given the magnitude of the penalty 
  the accused would face on conviction. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The accused simply has not demonstrated that 
  his detention is not necessary to ensure his attendance in court. Hence we need 
  not address the secondary and tertiary grounds set out in s. 515. However, because 
  the accused put such emphasis on the apparent weaknesses of the Crown’s case, 
  we would note that even if this were so, the accused has been committed for 
  trial on the most serious charge in the criminal law and the killing involved 
  was undoubtedly a brutal murder, and these considerations as well are relevant 
  to the tertiary ground in s. 515.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In all the circumstances we find that the decision 
  denying bail pending trial was correctly made and we would confirm it.</span></p>
