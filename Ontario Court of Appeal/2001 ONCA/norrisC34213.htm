    <p>The Defendant, The City of Nepean Police, generally and the Defendant, 
      Constable Mark Gatien, specifically respectively owed a duty to enforce

  </span></span> The motion judge allowed the motion and struck out the statement 
  of claim as against Gatien and Nepean.  He endorsed the record as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Defendants Gatien and the City of Nepean bring this motion under R. 
      21 to strike the Statement of Claim as against them as it discloses no reasonable 
      cause of action.  The test, I accept, is that it must be “plain and obvious” 
      that the plaintiff could not succeed against these defendants.  As I must 
      under R. 21, I have taken the material facts as pleaded as having been proved.  
      This is a s. 61 FLA claim and all the claimants are derivative claimants.  
      The action arises out of the death of Shayne Norris caused by a motor vehicle 
      accident on August 24, 1994 in which he was, as pleaded, negligently run 
      down by the defendant Loranger. There is no pleading that the conduct of 
      Gatien (for whom Nepean is responsible) caused the death of Shayne Norris, 
      or was in any way responsible for it.  All actions of Gatien, as pleaded, 
      were subsequent to the accident and by then Shayne Norris was deceased.  
      The rights of the s. 61 claimants arose before any actions of Gatien, as 
      pleaded, occurred.  There is no pleading suggesting any antecedent act on 
      the part of Gatien.  There is nothing pleaded suggesting that Gatien in 
      any way caused or contributed to the death of Shayne Norris.  It is from 
      that death that the dependents’ cause of action arises.  Nevertheless it 
      is argued that the dependents have a cause of action as a result of the 
      manner in which Gatien carried out his investigation.  I do not accept that 
      argument and I can find no case to support that proposition.  <u>Beckstead 
      v. Ottawa</u>, 37 O.R. 3rd, p. 62 in my view does not assist the Plaintiffs.  
      Even if there is a tort of negligent investigation as Beckstead appears 
      to stand for, there is no private duty of care owed by Gatien towards the 
      plaintiffs.  The duty owed by police officers is to investigate and prevent 
      crime.  The duty is a public one owed to the public at large, not to individuals 
      privately.  If as in <u>Miller (Litigation Guardian of) v. Wiwchairyk</u>, 
      there was a pleading of some antecedent negligent act the situation might 
      be different.  Here the alleged negligence of Gatien occurred subsequent 
      to the facts giving rise to the main cause of action.  In my consideration 
      of the issue of public v. private duty, I have carefully considered <u>City 
      of Kamloops v. Neilsen</u> (1984) 10 D.L.R. 7th p. 641 (SCC).  The plaintiff’s 
      claim against Gatien and Nepean is without foundation.  Even if such a duty 
      existed, as I have found it did not, there is no causal connection between 
      the damages alleged and the acts of these Defendants.  Accordingly, the 
      Amended Statement of Claim as it relates to Mark Gatien and the City of 
      Nepean is struck.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It is clear from his reasons that the motion judge treated

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During oral argument on the appeal, however, plaintiffs’ counsel 
  took the position that the claim asserted against Gatien and Nepean was not 
  under the <i>Family Law Act</i> but was a free standing claim, separate and 
  apart from the right of action created by that Act and its predecessors.  Nothing 
  turns on this change in position and nothing further need be said about it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is reasonably clear from the statement of claim that the claim 
  against Gatien and Nepean is not for damages for causing the death of Norris.  
  Neither of them caused or contributed to his death on the facts as pleaded.  
  Rather the plaintiffs’ claim is for acts and omissions of Gatien which are alleged 
  to have occurred after Norris’ death and which are said to have exacerbated 
  the distress caused by the death of Norris.  Specifically it is alleged that 
  Gatien was negligent as set out in paragraph 4 above.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> Counsel for the appellants and respondents are in agreement as 
  to the law.  They disagree however as to its application to the facts of this 
  case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A claim such as this should not be dismissed at this early stage 
  unless it is plain and obvious that it discloses no reasonable cause of action.  
  <i>Hunt v. Carey</i> (1990), 43 C.P.C. (2d) 105 (S.C.C.) per Wilson J. at p. 
  126.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The fact that the claim may present a novel situation is irrelevant.  
  <i>Hunt, supra</i>, per Wilson J. at p. 126.  On a motion under R. 21.01 the 
  statement of claim is to be read generously with allowance for inadequacies 
  due to drafting deficiencies.  <i>Toronto Dominion Bank v. Deloitte Haskins 
  &amp; Sells</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 417(Gen. Div. ) per Blair J. at p. 419.

  </span></span> Counsel for the respondents in his factum objects to the inclusion 
  in the appellants’ factum of facts not included in the statement of claim.  Applying 
  <i>TD Bank v. Deloitte, supra,</i> however, the plaintiffs’ claim may fairly 
  be stated as alleging that while Gatien did not contribute to Norris’ death, 
  Gatien’s negligence in investigating that death resulted in the failure of the 
  prosecution against Loranger on charges of impaired driving causing death and 
  operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .80.  
  Separate proceedings were then commenced against Loranger under the <i>Police 
  Services Act. </i> It is alleged that these later hearings would not have been 
  necessary if the criminal trial had gone ahead.  It is also alleged that these 
  proceedings and the appeal therefrom caused or contributed to the exacerbation 
  and continuation of the emotional stress, pain and suffering of the plaintiffs.</p>

  </span></span> Both counsel recognize that police officers constitute a public 
  authority and are normally engaged in carrying out a public law duty.  The question 
  here is whether, in the circumstances, Gatien owed a private law duty of care 
  to the plaintiffs.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The test for determining that question was set 
  down by Wilson J. in <i>City of Kamloops v. Neilsen et al</i> (1984), 10 D.LR. 
  4th 641 (S.C.C.) at pp. 662-663 as follows:</span></p>

      (the local authority and the person who has suffered the damage) so that, 
      <i>in the reasonable contemplation of the authority</i>, carelessness on 
      its part might cause damage to that person?  If so,</p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>are there any considerations which ought 
      to negative or limit (a) the scope of the duty and (b) the class of persons 
      to whom it is owed or (c) the damages to which a breach of it may give rise?

  </span></span> In my view, the resolution of the instant motion is to be found 
  in the words of the first question, namely “in the reasonable contemplation 
  of the authority [Gatien/Nepean], might carelessness on [their] part cause damage 
  to that person [the plaintiffs]?”.  The answer to that question must be “no”.</p>

  </span></span> This is so because the plaintiffs had no legal interest in the 
  investigation or prosecution of Loranger; that investigation and prosecution 
  were matters of public law and public interest.  Nor had the plaintiffs any 
  legal interest in the disciplinary proceedings taken against Loranger.  Had 
  Loranger been convicted on either or both charges, the plaintiffs, or some of 
  them, may have derived some personal satisfaction from that conviction.  That 
  satisfaction, however, would have been a purely personal matter; it would have 
  no reality in law.  Nor did the failure to reach that verdict have any consequence 
  for the appellants sounding in damages.  </p>

  </span></span> The appellants rely on <i>Beckstead v. Ottawa (City) Chief of 
  Police </i>(1997), 37 O.R. (3d) 62 (C.A.), <i>Doe v. Metropolitan Toronto Municipality 
  (Commissioners of Police)</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 225 (Div. Ct.) and <i>George 
  v. Beaubien</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 4022, [Q.L.].  None of these cases supports 
  the appellants’ claim.  In <i>Beckstead,</i> the careless investigation resulted 
  directly in Beckstead being charged with fraud.  The negligence had a direct, 
  profound and damaging legal impact on the claimant.  In <i>Doe</i>, the negligence 
  contributed to the claimant being sexually assaulted.  In <i>George</i>, the 
  motion to strike the statement of claim was dismissed because it could not be 
  said that the defendant’s action did not contribute to the death of George; 
  it was not clear on the pleadings that George’s death was too remote.</p>

  </span></span> The reasoning in these three cases provides no support for the 
  appellants’ claim against Gatien and Nepean.  I would therefore dismiss the 
  appeal with costs.</p>
