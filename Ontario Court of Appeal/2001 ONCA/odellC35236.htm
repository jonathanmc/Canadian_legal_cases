<p><b><span>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals from convictions entered on July 4, 2000 by Boissonneault 
  J. on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The convictions arise from events that occurred in Lively, Ontario between 
  September 1, 1981 and December 31, 1986. The male complainant testified that 
  the appellant, a Catholic priest, sexually abused him repeatedly over a four 
  to five year period. Credibility and the reliability of recovered memories were 
  significant issues at the trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant explained that he had blocked the events from his conscious 
  memory and that it was not until he was in his twenties that he recognized what 
  had occurred. The Crown adduced expert evidence to explain the memory process 
  in human beings and delayed recall.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the trial judge misapprehended the expert 
  evidence and also placed undue weight on it, by using it to explain significant 
  inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence. Further, he submits that the 
  trial judge erred in accepting the complainant’s testimony given the numerous 
  inconsistencies and improbabilities in his evidence. Finally, he submits that 
  the trial judge applied differing standards in assessing the credibility of 
  the complainant and the appellant, and therefore improperly converted the trial 
  into a credibility contest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Overview</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant described two significant incidents that formed the 
  basis of the convictions. In one incident, the appellant sodomized him with 
  a crucifix while the complainant lay on a leather couch in the priest’s quarters 
  at the church. In the other incident, the appellant fondled the complainant 
  and forced him to perform fellatio while the complainant lay on an altar inside 
  the church.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant said he met the appellant in the spring of 1981, while 
  in grade five. He recalled the appellant as instrumental in persuading him to 
  transfer to a Catholic school, where he commenced grade six in September 1981, 
  by saying to get to heaven the complainant would have to convert to Catholicism. 
  The complainant also described a reddish or port wine birthmark resembling Newfoundland 
  that he had observed on the complainant’s lower right abdomen during the assaults.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Independent evidence called at trial confirmed that the appellant was 
  not transferred to Lively until September 1981 and that the appellant does not 
  have a birthmark on his lower right abdomen. The inaccuracy of the complainant’s 
  testimony with respect to these two matters forms the basis of the first ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant first disclosed his allegations to the police in May 
  1998. Although he always had a sense of what had gone on, he never allowed himself 
  to think about it. It was not until his twenties that he could actually admit 
  that these things did happen to him, that they were real. Prior to this time, 
  he would not have been able to describe what happened. He testified that he 
  did not complain because of shame, family difficulties and his unwillingness 
  to deal with these experiences. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown called Dr. Richard Berry to give expert evidence concerning 
  the memory process in human beings and delayed recall. Dr. Berry testified that, 
  generally, information is stored in an explicit memory system. The individual 
  is consciously aware of it and it is available to him for recall. Memory is 
  subject to change and decay with the passage of time. While the central theme 
  of an incident or core memory tends to remain intact, peripheral memories may 
  be modified by intervening events. So, for example, while one would retain the 
  memory of going on a camping trip, the colour of the canoe or the kind of tent 
  may be lost, or change in recounting over time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Berry further testified that information that overwhelms an individual 
  may, however, result in dissociative amnesia with the information stored in 
  an implicit memory system, where it is not readily available. Recovery of that 
  memory may occur either as a result of a situation that parallels the original 
  traumatic incident or the presence of cues, such as smells, that are similar 
  to the original incident. The onset of memory may begin with a vague feeling 
  that things are wrong. Memory generally returns over an extended period of time, 
  often in a fragmented form that is usually out of sequence, so that memory recovery 
  may never be complete.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge admitted similar fact evidence indicating the appellant 
  pleaded guilty to three counts of gross indecency involving two victims on January 
  9, 1992. The incidents occurred between 1981 and 1988 and the victims were somewhat 
  older than the complainant had been when they met the appellant. The similar 
  fact convictions involved the appellant acting as spiritual adviser to the victims 
  and unusual behaviour in which a pulley system was attached to the victim’s 
  genitals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On convicting the appellant, the trial judge said he believed the complainant 
  and disbelieved the appellant. He also commented:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Dr. Berry acknowledged that memory malfunction is not completely understood 
      and is still under debate. He stated the memory in question can be stored 
      in a disassociated state and return in a fragmented form coming back in 
      bits and pieces. Amnesia, he stated, is fairly prevalent for cases of trauma…</p>
    <p>He testified that recall, in such cases, begins with vague awareness. In 
      cases of sexual assault, problems occur with depression, or foreboding, 
      rather than flashbacks. A feeling of uneasiness and guilt sometimes brings 
      about the search for verification followed by discovery causing the individual 
      to ignore the memory, or set it aside. When recall occurs it is often disjointed 
      and out of sequence. This is especially in cases of sexual assault over 
      a period of time.</p>
    <p>Events are hard to differentiate and categorize. Dr. Berry then went on 
      to say that recovered memory is not significantly different than continuous 
      memory in reliability. </p>
    <p>I find this last statement difficult to reconcile with his previous comments 
      relating to disjointed and fragmented memory and to efforts to ignore the 
      memory, or that the memory may never be, never be complete.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>I conclude that, truthfulness aside, Dr. Berry’s previous evidence indicates 
      memory retrieval can be such that it may not be as accurate as normal memory 
      due to the fashion it comes back with its fragmented non sequential and 
      incomplete characteristics.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>…The impact of Dr. Berry’s evidence is also to be assessed with the credibility 
      of the complainant on the whole of his testimony. <i>I accept that due to 
      the time lapse between the alleged events and this trial I cannot expect 
      that any memory of the events in its details will be totally accurate. Discrepancies 
      are to be expected in the complainant’s evidence.</i> In any event, between 
      his initial complaint and this trial, it is a matter of weight as to what 
      I attribute to the relevance of these discrepancies. <i>I do find however, 
      that [the complainant’s] recollections, lack of recollection, suppression 
      of memory, symptoms of unease, sleep disturbances as evidenced by the testimony 
      of his mother, and himself, and indeed general discrepancies in particular 
      are consistent with the general content of Dr. Berry’s testimony.</i> Dr. 
      Berry’s general comments as to memory function following trauma are consistent 
      with  [the complainant’s] evidence as to his recollection of events and 
      personal reactions and feelings and I accept both their evidence in this 
      regard. [emphasis added]</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>I find that the weight, or the probative value, of the similar fact evidence 
      is of assistance in arriving at the ultimate resolution of this case. <i>I 
      further find that the evidence of the complainant is believable and any 
      discrepancies therein, including the discrepancy between [the appellant’s] 
      official arrival to Pius X Lively in September of 1981, and [the complainant’s] 
      assertion that his first contact with [the appellant] was in the Spring 
      of 1981, <b>are as a result, or partly as a result, of an imperfect retrieval 
      of memory resulting from traumatic amnesia followed by an element of denial 
      on the part of the victim</b>, as well as acute embarrassment </i>in revealing 
      his participation in grotesque sexual acts with the accused. [emphasis added]</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>I found Father O’Dell’s testimony weak in that in many instances, when 
      confronted with a question by the Crown, which clearly, for someone with 
      a normal memory, would have prompted a yes or no reply. His reply was “I 
      don’t recall”.</p>
    <p>On all of the evidence, including the similar fact evidence, I find that 
      the charges have been proven by the crown beyond a reasonable doubt. I believe 
      the evidence of [the complainant] as to the acts alleged <b><i>and I accept 
      Dr. Berry’s evidence as to what can generally happen to memory subsequent 
      to [a] traumatic event. I find his evidence consistent with [the complainant’s] 
      difficulties in recall of details.</i></b> I accept [the complainant’s mother’s] 
      corroborative evidence. I do not believe the accused’s denials. I find that 
      the accused, on all the evidence, is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of 
      both counts as charged. [emphasis added]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the trial judge err

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant says the complainant’s memories of abuse are anchored 
  by two significant details. First, the complainant’s recollection of the appellant 
  as the person who persuaded him to switch to a Catholic school, even though 
  he was not Catholic, an event the complainant identified as the chronological 
  tie to the commencement of abuse. Second, the complainant’s recollection of 
  an unusually shaped “port red wine” birthmark on the abuser’s abdomen, a detail 
  of significance to the identification of the perpetrator.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by placing undue emphasis 
  on Dr. Berry’s evidence to resolve these issues of credibility. Furthermore, 
  the appellant says the trial judge misapprehended Dr. Berry’s evidence when 
  he discounted the clear error in the complainant’s evidence in relation to the 
  first anchor on the basis of “an imperfect retrieval of memory resulting from 
  traumatic amnesia.” The appellant submits that while Dr. Berry stated that memories 
  stored in an implicit memory system may return in a fragmented form, he posited 
  that the information stored in this disassociated state is recalled with a high 
  degree of accuracy and is relatively impervious to change and did not opine 
  that details within the implicit memory system could return in an inconsistent 
  or contradictory form.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further, it is submitted that the trial judge improperly used Dr. Berry’s 
  evidence as being implicitly corroborative of the complainant’s credibility, 
  by the extent to which he relied on it to resolve issues of credibility in the 
  case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, it is submitted that the trial judge either misapprehended, 
  or failed to consider relevant evidence, by failing to refer, in his reasons, 
  to the evidence demonstrating that the appellant does not have a birthmark. 
  The appellant submits that this evidence raised far more than a minor discrepancy 
  in the complainant’s evidence and amounted to a material contradiction of a 
  core allegation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot agree that the trial judge misused or misapprehended the expert 
  evidence or that he ignored the evidence to which the appellant referred. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Key portions of Dr. Berry’s evidence include the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If you have someone who is involved in an experience which, or something 
      happens which for them emotionally can overwhelm them, … [t]hat kind of 
      information may get stored in what’s referred to as the implicit memory 
      system<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>In an implicit memory system … [t]he information could be there, but they 
      may not be aware of the events and not able to access that or retrieve it 
      … Now, I guess, one of the points that you’re raising here is the issue 
      of rehearsal. That is, how often does a person think about an event, and 
      that’s part of this pattern of changing, information changing for an individual 
      that is not immutable, it’s not like this video recording. A person has 
      an experience, they may store some information, but that information is 
      subject to modification according to the point where the event occurs and 
      the point of recall and it can be modified by intervening events. It is 
      not as though everything changes dramatically, but it may be modified by, 
      if you are a child, there is some kind of experience that you had with your 
      family, perhaps it was a camping trip, and that camping trip is then talked 
      about by yourself or with family members on later occasions. That tends 
      to rehearse, tends to refresh the memory. And there may be bits and pieces 
      that get modified in the re-telling that get incorporated into. So that 
      aspects of the memory may change, but the central core tends to … remain 
      intact.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a></p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>…But there is definitely fairly convincing evidence to indicate individuals 
      can have traumatic kinds of experiences for which they appear to have no 
      awareness for a lengthy period of time and later can recount aspects of 
      that. They may later recount the whole event.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
      [3] </span></a></p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Now the explicit memory system as I say will register the conscious available 
      information. Implicit when you have traumatic amnesia – the theoretical 
      model and the empirical data to support that indicates that there is bio-chemical 
      change that occurs. And that information that goes into the implicit memory 
      system appears to be relatively impervious to change while it’s stored in 
      this dissociated state.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
      [4] </span></a></p>
    <p>… </p>
    <p>It comes back as fragmented usually in fragmented form. And as I say, it 
      may come back not in terms of a complete picture, it’s not there. It often 
      doesn’t make sense, and it’s usually out of sequence, out of order. So you 
      just get a bit of this and a bit of that, and often it’s disjointed and 
      disconnected and it’s very fragmented, and it doesn’t tend to make much 
      sense for the individual. May not be able to put it together in terms of 
      a whole account. That kind of gathering the information often takes place 
      over a period of time. So the memory recovery process can be something that 
      can be quite protracted and may in some instances never be complete. That 
      a person may end up with what we would call fragmented memory …<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While it clearly would have been preferable for the trial judge to explain 
  his reasoning process more explicitly in stating: “discrepancies [in the complainant’s 
  evidence] … are as a result, or partly as a result, of an imperfect retrieval 
  of memory resulting from traumatic amnesia”, in my view, this conclusion is 
  available based on Dr. Berry’s evidence about the nature of recovered memory. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge made specific reference to Dr. Berry’s evidence that 
  memory recall could occur with “fragmented non sequential and incomplete characteristics”. 
  It was open to him to conclude that while the complainant’s core memories of 
  the abuse and the abuser were reliable and credible, the complainant had erroneously 
  linked those memories with other events and personal characteristics. I see 
  nothing inconsistent between that conclusion, and Dr. Berry’s statement that 
  “information that goes into the implicit memory system appears to be relatively 
  impervious to change while stored in this dissociated state”. Dr. Berry’s evidence 
  concerning recovered memories makes it clear that, whatever the nature of the 
  memory retained in the implicit memory system, it will not necessarily be recalled 
  in a manner that is complete or that can be distinguished chronologically from 
  other events.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further, I am not persuaded that the trial judge used the conclusions 
  he drew from Dr. Berry’s evidence improperly, in order to corroborate the complainant’s 
  evidence. It was necessary that the trial judge refer to Dr. Berry’s evidence 
  to discount the potentially significant negative inferences that would otherwise 
  arise from the discrepancies. In ultimately accepting the complainant’s evidence 
  however, the trial judge relied on other evidence, including evidence from the 
  complainant’s mother and similar fact evidence, which he found supported the 
  complainant’s account. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the trial judge did not specifically refer to the clear error 
  in the complainant’s evidence relating to the birthmark in speaking about discrepancies, 
  I am not persuaded that his failure to do so amounts to reversible error. The 
  trial judge referred to the complainant’s evidence of the existence of the birthmark 
  in the first part of his reasons when he summarized the evidence. The independent 
  evidence confirming that the appellant does not have a birthmark was a significant 
  piece of evidence emphasized by defence counsel in closing submissions. The 
  trial judge framed his conclusion by reference to “discrepancies”, and recited 
  the specific example of the date of the appellant’s arrival in Lively. Although 
  it would clearly have been preferable for the trial judge to have referred specifically 
  to the <i>two</i> major discrepancies arising from the complainant’s evidence, 
  his use of the term “discrepancies” makes it clear that he was alive to the 
  existence of more than one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Did the trial judge 
  err by concluding the complainant was to be believed in light of the numerous 
  inconsistencies and improbabilities in his evidence? </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the following inconsistencies and improbabilities 
  are neither incidental or collateral, and that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to conclude they cast doubt on the complainant’s reliability and credibility:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
      the complainant told Dr. Berry that the appellant was always nude but testified 
      that he always wore a long black or navy blue shirt;</p>
    <p> ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the complainant 
      never told police he was sodomized with a crucifix;</p>
    <p> iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> the complainant had never 
      mentioned he felt the feet of Jesus hitting his anus prior to trial;</p>
    <p> iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the complainant had 
      never mentioned prior to trial that he had confronted the appellant in 1987;</p>
    <p> v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the 
      complainant alleged that one of the incidents occurred on the altar in the 
      church but could not recall the presence of relics and linens on the altar 
      nor of an altar stone; independent evidence confirmed the likely presence 
      of these items; and</p>
    <p> vi)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the complainant stated 
      that although he was not Catholic, his teacher permitted him to participate 
      in confession; independent evidence suggested it was unlikely this would 
      have occurred.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant provided explanations in his evidence for all of the 
  noted inconsistencies set out in items i) through iv). It was open to the trial 
  judge to accept those explanations, and not discount the complainant’s evidence 
  in any way. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the improbabilities noted in items v) and vi), these were matters 
  for the trial judge to assess. Having reviewed them, I am unable to say they 
  rendered his acceptance of the complainant’s testimony unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>iii) Did the trial judge 
  err by applying different standards in assessing the credibility of the complainant 
  and the appellant, thereby converting the trial into a credibility contest?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that in assessing the reliability and credibility 
  of the evidence, the trial judge held the appellant to a higher standard than 
  the complainant, and thereby impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. He says 
  that the trial judge excused inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant’s 
  evidence as being the result of an imperfect memory but disbelieved the accused 
  when he could not recall innocuous information that was approximately twenty 
  years old. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant relies in particular on the following passage from the 
  trial judge’s reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I did not find the accused’s testimony in many instances credible. His 
      attempt to cast a shadow over the complainant’s testimony on surrounding 
      peripheral matters such as the question of the episode of confession in 
      the school gym and [the complainant’s mother’s] testimony. The assertion 
      of certainty of discovery of any action which occurred on the altar begs 
      a different conclusion because of the time of day alleged when the lights 
      were out and it was at night. I believe the evidence of [the complainant’s 
      mother] relating to her son’s bicycle being often at the church. I believe 
      her testimony and [the complainant’s] testimony as opposed to the accused[’s] 
      that the complainant spent a great deal of time with the accused at the 
      relevant times. I believe [the complainant’s mother’s] testimony that her 
      son was lonely and without many friends at relevant times. I conclude that 
      he was vulnerable, impressionable, submissive and suggestive. I believe 
      [the complainant’s mother] when she testified [the appellant] visited her 
      home to introduce himself. I do not know how he could fail to recollect 
      this event.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The appellant submits that 
  he did not attempt in his testimony to “cast a shadow over the complainant’s 
  testimony on surrounding peripheral matters” but merely responded to allegations 
  of the complainant. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also submits that the trial judge’s finding that his evidence 
  was “weak” based on his answers “I don’t recall” is unreasonable. The appellant 
  says he gave that answer to only three questions posed in cross-examination 
  with respect to matters of an inconsequential nature, dating back a number of 
  years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In sum, the appellant submits that the only rational explanation for 
  him being disbelieved is the fact that the complainant was believed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree. Read fairly, one can construe the appellant’s testimony 
  in part as an effort to discredit the complainant. Though not a necessary finding, 
  it was a finding that was available to the trial judge. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I count a total of five areas of cross-examination in which the appellant 
  asserted a lack of recollection: meeting the appellant’s mother, visiting the 
  complainant’s neighbour’s household, using the expression “have chalice will 
  travel”, visiting the Sudbury area between 1978 and 1981, and knowing the identity 
  of his paperboy. Although he may not have used the specific phrase “I don’t 
  recall” on every occasion, the appellant’s assertions of lack of recollection 
  were frequent, and must be viewed in the context of a similar lack of recall 
  on occasion during examination-in-chief. It was open to the trial judge to assess 
  the areas in which the appellant professed a lack of recollection, and to conclude 
  that it rendered his testimony “weak”. Having reviewed the whole of the appellant’s 
  evidence, I am unable to conclude that the trial judge reversed the burden of 
  proof or rejected the appellant’s testimony on an impermissible basis.</p>
