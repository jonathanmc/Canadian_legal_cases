  </span></span> <span>     </span>These three appeals, which were heard together, 
  arise from three unrelated requests by individuals (requesters) for access 
  to information in the possession of Ontario government ministries. In each case, 
  the responsible government official denied access to the records on the basis 
  that the records fell within s. 65(6) of the <i>Freedom of Information and Protection 
  of Privacy Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (the <i>Act</i>) and were not therefore 
  subject to the <i>Act</i>. In each case, the Assistant Privacy Commissioner 
  sitting on appeal from that decision held that the records did not fall within 
  s. 65(6) and were therefore subject to the <i>Act</i>. The respective ministries 
  challenged each ruling by way of judicial review application. The Divisional 
  Court heard the applications together and, applying a reasonableness standard 
  of review, dismissed the applications. This court granted leave to appeal. I 
  would allow the appeals. In my view, the Assistant Privacy Commissioners rulings 
  are reviewable on a correctness standard. On the correct interpretation of s. 
  65(6), the <i>Act</i> does not apply to the records sought by the requesters.</p>

  records in the custody or control of Ontario government institutions. It also 
  protects the privacy of personal information contained in such records. When 
  a person requests access to records in the custody or control of an institution, 
  the head of the institution is responsible for determining whether the records 
  should be disclosed in accordance with the principles set out in the <i>Act</i>.

  before a court, tribunal or other entity relating to labour relations or to 
  the employment of a person by the institution are excluded from the <i>Act</i> 
  by s. 65(6) 1. Similarly, records relating to [m]eetings, consultations, discussions, 
  or communications about labour relations or employment-related matters in which 
  the institution has an interest are excluded from the <i>Act</i> by s. 65(6) 
  3 even though in the possession of a government institution.</p>

  </span></span> <span>      </span>In each of these three appeals, the head of 
  the relevant institution determined the records in issue were excluded from 
  the <i>Act </i>by s. 65(6) 3<i>.</i> In one instance, the head determined the 
  records were also excluded by s. 65(6) 1. </p>

  </span></span> <span>      </span>On appeal, the Assistant Privacy Commissioner 
  determined that the words in which the institution has an interest as found 
  in s. 65(6) 3 of the <i>Act </i>refer to a legal interest, in the sense of 
  having the capacity to affect the legal rights or obligations of the institution. 
  He also found there were no employment-related issues pending or reasonably 
  foreseeable in relation to the records forming the subject matter of any of 
  the three requests. He accordingly ruled that the respective ministries no longer 
  have an interest in the records requested and that the records are not therefore 
  excluded from the <i>Act</i> by s. 65(6) 3<i>. </i>In the case also involving 
  s. 65(6) 1, the Assistant Privacy Commissioner determined the exclusion provided 
  by that subsection did not apply because there were no existing proceedings 
  or anticipated proceedings before a court, tribunal or other entity. He ordered 
  the respective ministries to deliver a decision concerning disclosure in accordance 
  with the principles set out in the <i>Act</i>.</p>

  of the <i>Act</i> if the appropriate standard of review is correctness. </p>

  </span></span> <span>      </span>Applying a correctness standard of review, 
  in my view the Assistant Privacy Commissioner erred in his interpretation of 
  s. 65(6) in two respects, first, by restricting the meaning of interest to 
  legal interest in s. 65(6) 3, and second, by introducing an erroneous time 
  element into both s. 65(6) 1 and s. 65(6) 3.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>He determined that [t]he interpretation of 
  sections 65(6) and (7) is a preliminary issue which goes to the application 
  of the <i>Act</i> to the requested records. He found those subsections record-specific 
  and fact-specific in that a record would remain within the Commissioners 
  jurisdiction if it fell within one of the exceptions listed in s. 65(7), even 
  though it initially fell within s. 65(6). He found the requested records met 
  the first two criteria set out in s. 65(6) 3 in that i) they were collected, 
  prepared, maintained or used by the Ministry or on its behalf and ii) the collection, 
  preparation, maintenance or usage was in relation to meetings, consultations, 
  discussions or communications. He found the records also clearly related to 
  an employmentrelated matter. He considered the real issue was whether it was 
  an employment related matter in which the Ministry has an interest.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>On that issue, he said the following:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>Previous orders of this office have held that an interest 
      is more than mere curiosity or concern. An interest for the purposes of 
      section 65(6) 3 must be a legal interest in the sense that the matter in 
      which the Police have an interest must have the capacity to affect the legal 
      rights or obligations of the Police (Orders P-1242 and M-1147).</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>Several recent and relevant orders have considered the 
      question of whether a legal interest existed for the purposes of section 
      65(6) 3 or its equivalent in the <i>Municipal Freedom of Information and 
      Protection of Privacy Act</i>. The conclusion of this line of orders has 
      essentially been that for a legal interest to exist, an institution must 
      establish an interest that has the capacity to affect its legal rights or 
      obligations, and that there must be a reasonable prospect that this interest 
      will be engaged. The passage of time, inactivity by the parties, loss of 
      forum or conclusion of a matter have all been considered in arriving at 
      a determination of whether an institution has a legal interest in the records.</span></p>
    <p align="center"><span lang=EN-CA></span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>I accept that the Ministry has a legal obligation to properly 
      discharge its responsibilities under the <i>Police Services Act</i>. However 
       the mere existence of legal responsibilities under a statute is insufficient 
      to establish the third requirement of section 65(6) 3. There is no evidence 
      before me to suggest that there is any ongoing dispute or other employment-related 
      matter involving the Ministry and the appellant, or any other person for 
      that matter, that has the capacity to affect the Ministrys legal rights 
      or obligations. The appellant is no longer an employee of the OPP, and I 
      have been provided with no evidence of any unresolved grievances from his 
      time of employment. There are also no apparent grounds for complaint under 
      the human rights Code, and I have been provided with no evidence of any 
      other statutory or common law basis for redress available to the appellant.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I find that, in the circumstances of this 
      appeal, there is no employment-related matter pending or reasonably foreseeable 
      which has the capacity to affect the legal rights or obligations of the 
      Ministry, and I find that the Ministry has not demonstrated that it has 
      sufficient legal interest in the records to bring them within the ambit 
      of section 65(6) 3.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In the result, the Assistant Privacy Commissioner 
  ordered the Ministry to issue a decision letter to the requester concerning 
  his request.</span></p>

  He subsequently complained that OPP officers assigned to the matter failed to 
  thoroughly investigate the incident. When the OPP determined his complaint about 
  the officers was not substantiated, the requesters husband asked for a review 
  by the Police Complaints Commissioner. The requester later asked for a copy 
  of the Police Complaints Commission file. The Ministry denied the request on 
  the basis that the records were excluded from the <i>Act </i>by sections 65(6)

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The Assistant Privacy Commissioner analyzed 
  section 65(6) 3 in essentially the same fashion as outlined above. He concluded 
  that the OPP had an obligation under the <i>Police Services Act,</i> R.S.O. 
  1990, c. P.-15 to investigate the complaint against the police officer[s] and 
  that this constituted a legal interest in an employment-related matter at the 
  time of the investigation. However, he found that as six years had passed and 
  he had not been provided with any evidence to suggest there is an outstanding 
  interest in the investigation that has the capacity to affect the OPPs legal 
  rights or obligations  there is no matter pending or reasonably foreseeable 
  which has the capacity to affect the Ministrys legal rights or obligations. 
  He also found the records were not excluded by s. 65(6) 1 of the <i>Act</i> 
  as there were no existing proceedings or anticipated proceedings before a court 
  tribunal or other entity. He ordered the Ministry to deliver a decision letter

  questions used at his interview, of the model answers, of the answers he provided

  s. 65(6) 3 in the same fashion as outlined above. He accepted that the Ministrys 
  responsibilities as an employer to adhere to the <i>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> 
  during the recruitment process constituted a legal interest in an employment-related 
  matter at the time of the job competition. However, he found that the recruitment

  said, there is no employment-related matter pending or reasonably foreseeable

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The Divisional Court delivered reasons applicable

  portions of that endorsement are as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <span

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for both the Ministry and the Commission

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the Ministry argued that the 
      amendment of which subsection 65(6) and (7) were a part was passed for the 
      purpose of putting the government into the same position as a private employer 
      with relation to employment-related records. We, are of the opinion, that 
      so classifying the amendment is to state the proposition too broadly. Subsection 
      (3) says employment-related records in which the institution has an interest. 
      [The Ministry] argues that all employmentrelated records are not subject 
      to the Act and that ownership means ownership or management interest; 
      and that in using the words in which the institution has an interest, 
      the legislature was excluding employment records of employees of private 
      employers which might for some reason be in the possession of a government 
      institution, for example, the Ministry of Labour. We do not see any merit 
      in this explanation for the use of the phrase in s.s. 3.</span></p>

      legal rights or obligations and therefore the records did not fit within

      In our view, the records in question were in the control of the Ministry

  </span></span> Rather than focusing on classifying issues as jurisdictional 
  or otherwise, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted a pragmatic and functional 
  approach to determining the appropriate standard of review of the decisions 
  of administrative tribunals. In <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship 
  and Immigration), </i>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 at 1004-1005, Bastarache J. set out 
  the general principles governing this approach and also confirmed the emergence 
  of reasonableness as a third recognized standard, in addition to the traditional 
  standards of  correctness and patent unreasonableness, within the spectrum 
  of standards of review: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>The central inquiry in determining the standard of review 
      exercisable by a court of law is the legislative intent of the statute creating 
      the tribunal whose decision is being reviewed. More specifically, the reviewing 
      court must ask: <i>[W] as the question which the provision raises one that 
      was intended by the legislators to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction 
      of the Board? </i>[emphasis added]<i>.</i></span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>Since <i>U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 
      1048, this Court has determined that the task of statutory interpretation 
      requires a weighing of several different factors, none of which are alone 
      dispositive, and each of which provides an indication falling on a spectrum 
      of the proper level of deference to be shown the decision in question. This 
      has been dubbed the pragmatic and functional approach. This more nuanced 
      approach in determining legislative intent is also reflected in the range 
      of possible standards of review. Traditionally, the correctness standard 
      and the patent unreasonableness standard were the only two approaches 
      available to a reviewing court. But in <i>Canada (Director of Investigation 
      and Research v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, a reasonableness 
      simpliciter standard was applied as the most accurate reflection of the 
      competence intended to be conferred on the tribunal by the legislator. Indeed, 
      the Court there described the range of standards available as a spectrum 
      with a more exacting end and a more deferential end (para. 30).</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-CA>Although the language and approach of the preliminary, 
      collateral or jurisdictional question has been replaced by this pragmatic 
      and functional approach, the focus of the inquiry is still on the particular, 
      individual provision being invoked and interpreted by the tribunal. Some 
      provisions within the same Act may require greater curial deference than 
      others, depending on the factors which will be described in more detail 
      below. To this extent, it is still appropriate and helpful to speak of jurisdictional 
      questions which must be answered correctly by the tribunal in order to 
      be answered <i>intra vires</i>. But it should be understood that a question 
      which goes to jurisdiction is simply descriptive of a provision for which 
      the proper standard of review is correctness, based upon the outcome of 
      the pragmatic and functional analysis. In other words, jurisdictional error 
      is simply an error on an issue with respect to which, according to the outcome 
      of the pragmatic and functional analysis, the tribunal must make a correct 
      interpretation and to which no deference will be shown. </span></p>

  </span></span> The Privacy Commissioner submits the Supreme Court of Canada 
  has thus signaled that reviewing courts must proceed cautiously when assessing 
  the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals. Though charged with the important 
  task of ensuring tribunals do not exceed their legislated mandate, courts must 
  be careful not to limit a tribunals functions in a manner not intended by the 
  legislature. The provisions of a tribunals enabling statue do not always admit 
  of one correct meaning. In order to promote the public policy reflected in 
  the statute, logically, such provisions should be left with the tribunal for 
  an interpretation informed by its specialist perspective.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

  </span></span> The Privacy Commissioner says the records now excluded by s. 
  65(6)<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a> are ones over which she formerly 
  exercised decision-making authority. The interpretation of s. 65(6), like the 
  interpretation of the exemption provisions,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span> [6] </span></a> engages the Privacy Commissioner in a context 
  sensitive, record by record, determination aimed at reflecting the legislatures 
  choice between the competing values of access and confidentiality. She relies 
  on the fact that courts have consistently held that the standard of review of 
  her decisions relating to the interpretation of rights of access and exemptions 
  under the <i>Act </i>is reasonableness. Balancing the objectives set out in 
  the <i>Act</i> lies at the heart of her specialized expertise. She asserts the 
  legislature cannot be presumed to have intended she should now have lesser expertise 
  or be accorded lesser deference. The applicable standard of review of her interpretation 
  of s. 65(6) should therefore be reasonableness. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Relative expertise is no doubt a highly significant 
  factor in the determination of the appropriate standard of review. This court 
  recognized the expertise of the Privacy Commissioner in <i>Ontario (Workers

  (1998), 164 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 129 (Ont. C.A.) as follows: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> the commissioner is required to develop and apply expertise in the management 
      of many kinds of government information, thereby acquiring a unique range 
      of expertise not shared by the courts. The wide range of the commissioners 
      mandate is beyond areas typically associated with the courts expertise. 
       the commission is a specialized agency which administers a comprehensive 
      statute regulating the release and retention of government information. 
      In the administration of that regime, the commissioner is called upon not 
      only to find facts and decide questions of law, but also to exercise an 
      understanding of the body of specialized expertise that is beginning to 
      develop around systems for access to government information and the protection 
      of personal data. The statute calls for a delicate balance between the need 
      to provide access to government records and the right to the protection 
      of personal privacy. Sensitivity and expertise on the part of the commissioner 
      is all the more required if the twin purposes of the legislation are to 
      be met<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] </span></a>.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>While acknowledging the relative expertise of 
  the Privacy Commissioner in matters requiring it, in my view the very wording 
  of s. 65(6) indicates her expertise is not engaged in its interpretation. By 
  using the words this Act does not apply, the legislature has distinguished 
  exclusions from exemptions, and has declared that the delicate balanc[ing] 
  between the need to provide access to government records and the right to protection 
  of personal privacy, which engages the expertise of the Privacy Commissioner, 
  plays no role in relation to the enumerated records. Accordingly, relative to 
  the court, the Privacy Commissioner possesses no particular expertise that is 
  significant to the interpretation of the section. In my view, this wording also 
  signifies the legislatures intention that the Privacy Commissioner not have 
  a determinative say in the interpretation of the section. Had it viewed the 
  matter otherwise, it would not have excluded the enumerated records from the 
  operation of the <i>Act</i>.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In short, when applied to the particular circumstances 
  presented, I consider the <i>Pushpanathan</i> factors favour correctness as 
  the appropriate standard of review. This conclusion appears to be consistent 
  with the decision of this court in <i>Walmsley, supra</i>. There, Goudge J.A. 
  found s. 10(1) of the <i>Act</i> to be jurisdiction-limiting, in the sense that 
  records not in the custody or under the control of an institution are not 
  subject to the <i>Act</i> and are therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Privacy 
  Commissioner. Using a functional and pragmatic approach, he determined the appropriate 
  standard of review of a decision interpreting s. 10(1) to be correctness, based 
  on that finding, the absence of a privative clause, and the conclusion that 
  no particular expertise was required for the interpretation of the operative 
  words of the section. Particularly in the latter respect, s. 10(1) and s. 65(6) 
  share a common characteristic.</span></p>

  </span></span> In my view, the Assistant Commissioner erred in his interpretation 
  of s. 65(6) in two respects: first, by restricting the meaning of interest 
  to legal interest in s. 65(6) 3; and second, by introducing a time element 
  into the section, when none exists. He introduced a time element into sub clause 
  1<a href="#_ftn8"

  list of records to which the <i>Act</i> does not apply. Subsection 6 deals exclusively 
  with labour relations and employment related matters. Subsection 7 provides 
  certain exceptions to the exclusions set out in subsection 6. Examined in the 
  general context of subsection 6, the words in which the institution has an 
  interest appear on their face to relate simply to matters involving the institutions 
  own workforce. Sub clause 1 deals with records relating to proceedings or anticipated 
  proceedings relating to labour relations or to the employment of a person <i>by 
  the institution</i> [emphasis added]. Sub clause 2 deals with records relating 
  to negotiations or anticipated negotiations relating to labour relations or 
  to the employment of a person <i>by the institution</i> [emphasis added]. Sub 
  clause 3 deals with records relating to a miscellaneous category of events about

  an interest. Having regard to the purpose for which the section was enacted<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span>

  which the institution has an interest in sub clause 3 operate simply to restrict 
  the categories of excluded records to those records relating to the institutions 
  own workforce where the focus has shifted from employment of a person to employment-related

  introduces a concept there is no indication the legislature intended.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am also not persuaded by the Ministrys argument that because the wording 
      in the section does not expressly say so, there can be no time limitations 
      associated with section 65(6). In my view, section 65(6) must be understood 
      in context, taking into consideration both the stated intent and goal of 
      the Labour Relations and Employment Statute Law Amendment Act (Bill 7)  
      to restore balance and stability to labour relations and to promote economic 
      prosperity; and overall purposes of the <i>Act</i>  to provide a right 
      of access to information under the control of institutions and to protect 
      the privacy of and provide access to personal information under the control 
      of institutions and to protect the privacy of and provide access to personal 
      information held by institutions. When proceedings are current, anticipated, 
      or in the reasonably proximate past, in my view, there is a reasonable expectation 
      that a premature disclosure of the type of records described in section 
      65(6) 1 could lead to an imbalance in labour relations between the government 
      and its employees. However, when proceedings have been completed, are no 
      longer anticipated, or are not in the reasonably proximate past, disclosure 
      of these same records could not possibly have an impact on any labour relations 
      issues directly related to these records, and different considerations should 
      apply.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span> [12] </span></a></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the time sensitive element of subsection 
  6 is contained in its preamble. The <i>Act </i>does not apply to particular 
  records if the criteria set out in any of sub clauses 1 to 3 are present when 
  the relevant action described in the preamble takes place, i.e. when the records 
  are collected, prepared, maintained or used. Once effectively excluded from 
  the operation of the <i>Act</i>, the records remain excluded. The subsection 
  makes no provision for the <i>Act</i> to become applicable at some later point 
  in time in the event the criteria set out in any of sub clauses 1 to 3 cease 
  to apply.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>This interpretation also makes practical sense 
  for the purposes of administration of the <i>Act. </i>Institutions are required 
  by s. 39(2) of the <i>Act</i> to give notice to affected individuals [w]here 
  personal information is collected on behalf of the institution. Retention and 
  disposal of personal information is to be dealt with as prescribed by regulation. 
  In the absence of clear language one would not expect that institutions are 
  required to continually review their records on an ongoing basis to assess the 
  applicability of the <i>Act</i>. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In my view, therefore, the Assistant Privacy 
  Commissioner was wrong to limit the scope of the exclusions in the way that 
  he did.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons given, I would allow the appeals 
  and quash the decisions of the Assistant Commissioner. Insofar as PO1618 is 
  concerned, I would quash the decision of the Assistant Commissioner only as 
  it relates to part 2 of the request, being the only portion of the request in 
  issue on this appeal. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it is not for this court on an application 
  for judicial review to make any form of declaration as to whether the records 
  are, or are not, excluded from the <i>Act. </i>The effect of quashing the decisions 
  of the Assistant Privacy Commissioner will simply be that the decisions of the 
  heads of the respective Ministries will be restored.</span></p>
