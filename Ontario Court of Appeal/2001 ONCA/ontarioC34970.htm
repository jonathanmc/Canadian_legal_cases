  </span></span> These are two separate appeals relating to the way public complaints 
  about police conduct are dealt with by the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police 
  Services (the “Commission”). In particular, the appeals relate to the Commission’s 
  duties when it reviews a decision by the Chief of Police not to hold a hearing 
  into the complaint.  On judicial review, two differently constituted panels 
  of the Divisional Court quashed the Commission’s decision in each case that 
  a hearing be held, on the grounds primarily that the allegations had been insufficiently 
  particularized by the Commission.  These appeals by the Commission are from 
  those two Divisional Court decisions.  In <i>Sadaka v. Houde</i>, there was 
  also a cross-appeal concerning the applicability of a regulation of the <i>Police 
  Services Act</i>.</font></p>

  member of the public may make a complaint about the conduct of a police officer 
  (s. 56(1)).  The chief of police, defined as including the Commissioner of the 
  Ontario Provincial Police, must give the police officer notice of the substance 
  of the complaint (s. 56(7)); determine whether the complaint is about the policies 
  of or services provided by the police force or about the conduct of a police 
  officer (s. 59(1)); review the complaint (s. 61(1)); cause an investigation 
  to be conducted (s. 64(1)); and determine whether a hearing into the complaint 
  should be held (s. 64(7)).  </font></p>

  because the officer’s conduct may constitute “misconduct” or “unsatisfactory 
  work performance”, the parties are given reasonable notice of the hearing (s. 
  69(4)) and a full hearing into the complaint is conducted (s.&nbsp;64(7)). The 
  parties may appeal the decision to the Commission (s.&nbsp;70(1)), and may further

  the McBrydes a copy of the final report on March 30, 1998. On June 5, 1998, 
  the Superintendent of the Bureau sent the McBrydes a letter confirming that

      was the ambulance attendant’s observation of a moderate odour of alcohol

      that he did not have the accident report in front of him at the time he

      licence violation. It has been noted that the accident report indicates 
      that Mr. Lee was charged with not having a driver’s licence and that he 
      was not a suspended driver. There is insufficient evidence to support a 
      finding of misconduct against the officer regarding this allegation.</span></font></p>

      legal requirement that would require a statement be obtained from Mrs. McBryde. 
      There was no misconduct by the officer regarding this allegation.</span></font></p>

      of interviewing witnesses by phone does not make their statements inadmissible

      know what evidence that witness could give in court. It would be necessary 
      for the witness to attend and give evidence in person during a trial. There

      made. Witnesses are not normally subpoenaed to a first court appearance 
      as the accused must make his plea at that time. If a trial is required, 
      witnesses would be subpoenaed at that time. There is no evidence to support

  He therefore asked the Commission to confirm in writing the issue it found problematic,

  It stated that the Superintendent of the Bureau was directed to charge Constable 
  Browne with either misconduct or unsatisfactory work performance and to convene 
  a hearing. The grounds were that there was sufficient evidence to allege that 
  Constable Browne’s actions were “of such a nature so as to attract the sanction

  “the officer’s failure to attempt to obtain a warrant to obtain a blood sample

  December 8, 1998, counsel for the OPP sent the Commission a letter requesting 
  that the Commission exercise its common law power of reconsideration in connection 
  with its decision to direct a hearing into Constable Browne’s actions, submitting 
  that the failure to obtain a warrant to seize blood samples could not constitute 
  misconduct, since Constable Browne did not have the requisite reasonable grounds 
  to seize them. He submitted to the Commission, among other things, that:</span></font></p>

      neglect of duty or unsatisfactory work performance for the failure to obtain 
      a warrant to seize blood cannot amount to misconduct as the statutory preconditions 
      for the obtaining of a warrant did not exist at the time of this incident. 
      Further, compelling P.C. Browne to attempt to obtain a warrant without the 
      necessary reasonable grounds would amount to a violation of the warrant 
      provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, an unreasonable seizure under the 
      <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, and is tantamount to imposing a duty 
      on this police officer to lie under oath to a justice. This decision of

  </span></span> On April 3, 1998, Andrée Houde and Hélène Goulet parked their 
  minivan on a street in Ottawa and went out for the evening.  During the evening, 
  Constable Mark MacMillan and another undercover police officer saw the minivan 
  parked in an unlit area.  After noticing damage to the door and the ignition 
  cylinder, the officers called the communications department to see if the minivan 
  had been reported stolen.  Although the licence plate check did not indicate 
  a theft, the officers nonetheless suspected that the owner did not yet know 
  that the vehicle was stolen. No other preliminary investigation was conducted, 
  but six other undercover officers were contacted and surveillance was set up, 
  according to the police officers, about 100 to 150 yards away.</font></p>

  </span></span> At around 10:55 p.m., Ms. Houde and Ms. Goulet returned to the 
  minivan and drove away. When they approached the intersection ahead, unmarked 
  police cars blocked the vehicle. As they were about to pass these vehicles, 
  three or four men ran towards the minivan, screaming at the women to open the 
  door and banging on the windows.  Ms.&nbsp;Houde and Ms. Goulet saw that one 
  of the men had a gun.     </font></p>

  </span></span> The complainants did not realize the men were police officers, 
  believed that they were being attacked, and, terrified, attempted to escape. 
  (The police report states that the officers yelled “stop police” and that their 
  jackets had “police” marked on the side.) The complainants reversed the minivan, 
  hitting a car that was blocking them from the rear, swerved onto the sidewalk, 
  and drove past the car that was blocking them from the front.  A police officer 
  fired his gun at the tires of the minivan in an attempt to immobilize it.  </font></p>

  </span></span> A few blocks away, Ms. Houde and Ms. Goulet noticed a marked 
  police car, flashed the headlights of their minivan to attract the police’s 
  attention, stopped the minivan and waved down the police.   When the police 
  car had stopped, Ms. Houde and Ms. Goulet noticed that some of the men who had 
  “attacked” the minivan were present in the police car.  It was only then that 
  they realized that the men who had “attacked” the minivan were police officers.</font></p>

  </span></span> On April 14, 1998, Ms. Houde and Ms. Goulet made a complaint 
  to the chief of police under s. 56(1) of the <i>Act</i>, alleging misconduct 
  against the five police officers involved in the vehicle take-down.  The complaint 
  was categorized as a complaint about the conduct of the named officers, the 
  policies and services of the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police Service (“OCRPS”), 
  and the media releases concerning the incident.</font></p>

  </span></span> In accordance with s. 64(1) of the <i>Act</i>, the chief of police 
  called for an investigation into the matter, which resulted in a report dated 
  June 18, 1998.  The report found that the complaints regarding the policies 
  and services of the OCRPS and the media releases concerning the incident were 
  substantiated and identified areas for improvement.  However, the report also 
  concluded that the complaints regarding the conduct of the named officers were 
  unsubstantiated, and that “while errors in judgment were made, such errors do 
  not constitute misconduct as defined in the <i>Police Services Act</i>”.  The 
  chief of police undertook to bring these matters to the attention of the officers

  </span></span> The Divisional Court held that while there may not be a strict

  statutory requirement of specificity set out in s. 72(8) and the barring of 
  a right of appeal in s. 72(12).  The Court also held that since there is no 
  defined standard to be applied to cases involving allegedly unsatisfactory work 
  performance, fulfilling the specificity requirements set out in <i>Browne</i> 
  was even more important.  Because the Commission did not satisfy these requirements, 
  the Divisional Court quashed the Commission’s order to hold a hearing.  </font></p>

  </span></span> In <i>Sadaka</i>, Sergeant Sadaka, Constable MacMillan and the 
  Chief of Police of the OCRPS cross-appealed on the issue of the Commission’s 
  jurisdiction to order a hearing on the basis of unsatisfactory work performance 
  without first complying with s. 13(3) of the Regulation. Based on <i>Baker v. 
  Canada</i> <i>(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 
  817,  they argued that the appropriate standard of review was “reasonableness” 
  and that the Commission’s decision was unreasonable.  The Police Association 
  of Ontario intervened in support of this position.</font></p>

  </span></span> In the alternative, the cross-appellants submitted that even 
  if the Commission was not bound by the preconditions in s. 13(3), the Commission 
  must abide by the distinction between misconduct and unsatisfactory work performance 
  established in the <i>Act</i>.  The term “unsatisfactory work performance” must 
  be interpreted to refer only to those matters where the necessary steps have 
  been taken and performance has not improved.  Hence, an isolated instance of 
  wrongdoing must be considered “misconduct” rather than “unsatisfactory work 
  performance”.   Without evidence to support a finding that the police officers 
  engaged in improper conduct over time, the Commission acted unreasonably in 
  directing a hearing into allegations of unsatisfactory work performance.</font></p>

  is sufficient evidence to allege unsatisfactory work performance of a serious 
  nature arising from the failure of the officer to vigorously pursue any and 
  all investigative avenues available to him in the McBryde matter, and should 
  be dealt with in accordance with s. 64(7) of the <i>Police Services Act</i>”.

  driver”.  </font></p>

  unsatisfactory work performance “against Acting Sergeant Sadaka owing to his

  that “any member of the public may make a complaint” and s. 56(2) provides that 
  “the chief of police may also make a complaint”.  If there were no distinction 
  between public and internal complaints, these separate subsections would be 
  redundant. Similarly, where a member of the public withdraws a complaint, s.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The 
  legislative purpose is demonstrably to increase public confidence in the provision 
  of police services, including the processing of public complaints. That confidence 
  is further protected legislatively by assigning to the Commission, under s.&nbsp;72(8), 
  responsibility for reviewing the decision of a chief of police regarding complaints 
  from the public.</span></font></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The distinction between public and internal complaints flows 
  logically from the policy of the <i>Act</i>.  In the case of internal complaints, 
  the chief of police brings a complaint directly against a police officer.  Since 
  he or she is the officer’s employer and has the power to order the police officer’s 
  dismissal or suspension, among other possible sanctions under s. 68(1)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>, the graduated discipline found in s. 13(3) of the Regulation 
  provides necessary and appropriate safeguards in the vulnerable relationship 
  between an employer and employee.</font></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In 
  the case of public complaints, on the other hand, different considerations apply. 
  The public may well feel that the police response will be more protective when 
  a member of the public makes a complaint against an officer than when it is 
  the chief of police himself or herself who complains. The public needs to feel 
  confident in the complaints process. This means that its complaints justify 
  different - and more transparent - processes than those internally driven. Requiring 
  the Commission to first satisfy the steps in s.&nbsp;13(3) of the Regulation 
  before ordering a hearing on the basis of unsatisfactory work performance would 
  undermine the public’s ability to have its valid complaints openly considered. 
  This in turn would undermine the perceived integrity of the process and, therefore, 
  the objectives of the legislation. </span></font></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This 
  does not mean that every complaint from the public creates an automatic entitlement 
  to a hearing. There still needs to be a determination that the allegation is 
  sufficiently serious to warrant a hearing, a determination left by statute to 
  the Commission as final arbiter.</span></font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is accordingly no obligation on the part of the Commission 
  to satisfy the conditions precedent in s. 13(3) of the Regulation before it 
  has jurisdiction to order a hearing on the basis of unsatisfactory work performance.  
  </font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similarly, 
  there is no statutory or policy basis for restricting the Commission’s ability 
  to direct a hearing into unsatisfactory work performance to those circumstances 
  where there has been a continuing course of improper conduct. The Commission 
  decides whether the complaint warrants a hearing into an officer’s conduct based 
  on misconduct or unsatisfactory work performance. There is nothing in the <i>Act</i> 
  that would preclude directing a hearing based on only one incident under either 
  category. Whether or not the impugned conduct amounts to “unsatisfactory work 
  performance” is a question to be determined at the hearing.</span></font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-US

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The cross-appellants in <i>Sadaka</i> argue in either event that 
  the Commission’s decision to order a hearing was “unreasonable”.  The Commission, 
  on the other hand, submitted that its decision should be accorded curial deference. 
  In my view, the applicable standard of review of the Commission’s decision to 
  order a hearing is patent unreasonableness.  The privative clause in s. 72(12), 
  which states that the Commission’s decision under s. 72(8) of the <i>Act</i> 
  is “final and binding and there is no appeal therefrom”, confirms the legislature’s 
  intention that the decision to order - or not to order - a hearing into an officer’s 
  conduct should be protected from review and is entitled to deference.</font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-US

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In addition, the specialized expertise of the tribunal cannot 
  be doubted, as the range of its assigned statutory duties demonstrates. Under 
  the <i>Act</i>, the Commission is empowered to hear appeals; suspend or remove 
  the chief of police or members of the board; disband the police force; appoint 
  an administrator to perform specified functions; conduct investigations; conduct 
  inquiries under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council; conduct 
  inquiries on its own motion; conduct reviews under s. 72; and make recommendations 
  regarding the policies or services of a police force.  </font></p>

  </span></span> The combination of the purpose of the <i>Act</i>, the privative 
  clause, and the designated and specialized expertise of the Commission call 
  for patent unreasonableness as the guiding standard of review.  In my view, 
  the Commission’s decision in <i>Sadaka</i> to order a hearing cannot be said 
  to be patently unreasonable, particularly given the serious nature of the allegations.</font></p>
