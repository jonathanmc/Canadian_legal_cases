  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This appeal is concerned 
  with the nature and extent of the power of a board of inquiry under the <i>Human 
  Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 19 to order a complainant, who alleges that 
  she was discriminated against in her employment on the basis of a physical handicap, 
  to disclose medical and other documents relating to her.</span></p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I shall, shortly, describe what has taken place in this proceeding 
  but say now that the board of inquiry (“the board”) which is composed of one 
  person, Matthew D. Garfield, made an order, on a motion by Dofasco Inc., requiring 
  the complainant, Catherine Jeffrey, to disclose certain documents.  I shall 
  set out the terms of the order, which  are considerably more complex than this 
  brief statement indicates, later in these reasons.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (“the commission”), 
  brought an application to the Divisional Court for judicial review of the board’s 
  order, which the court dismissed.  The commission, with leave, appeals to this 
  court from this decision.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Underlying Facts Relating 
  to the Disclosure Order</span></h4>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The facts relating to the board’s disclosure order and to the 
  judicial review proceeding, which is before the court, are, in the main, those 
  set forth in the pleadings filed with the board.  Pleadings are provided for 
  in the Rules 35 to 37 of the board’s Rules of Practice.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The commission’s pleading alleged that the complainant was employed 
  by Dofasco from 1976 to 1994.  She worked as a crane operator.  She was injured 
  in 1988 and re-injured in 1990.  She was diagnosed with chronic pain disability/ 
  fibromyositis/fibromyalgia.  This condition made her incapable of working as 
  a crane operator.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant was off work between 1990 and 1994 but continued 
  to have contact with Dofasco Inc. from time to time.  On March 1, 1994 Dofasco, 
  for the first and only time, raised the possibility of assigning her reasonably 
  suitable alternative work, as a switchboard operator.  Her response was to defer 
  the decision on whether or not to accept this work until after she had consulted 
  with her specialist doctor.  She informed Dofasco of this.  Because of her doctor’s 
  absence, she was unable to see him until April 26, 1994.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dofasco was unwilling to wait for this and demanded that the 
  complainant report to Dofasco Medical Services on March 11 and report for work 
  on March 14.  She did report to Dofasco Medical Services on March 11.  Despite 
  knowing that she was unable to see her specialist until April 26, Dofasco Inc. 
  terminated her employment forthwith after she did not report for work on March 
  14, claiming that her contract of employment had been frustrated because of 
  her “prolonged and ongoing refusal to report for available and suitable work”.</p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The complainant

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Dofasco did not 
      attempt to accommodate the needs arising from the complainant’s handicap 
      to the point of “undue hardship”, and therefore cannot establish that the 
      complainant was “incapable” of her essential duties;</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In fact, Dofasco 
      was not engaged in a good faith process of accommodation, given the timing 
      of its job offer, its refusal to wait for the complainant to get required 
      medical advice, and its refusal to consider any other options;</span></p>

  </span></span> Dofasco’s pleading is relatively long and detailed.  A summary 
  set forth in paragraph 37 reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>To summarize, for four years the Complainant consistently asserted inability 
      to perform productive work for Dofasco, apparently supported by her physicians, 
      while failing to provide relevant medical information and emphasizing her 
      desire for WCB vocational training.  In the four years between her second 
      accident and her termination, the Complainant never stated she was ready 
      to return to work or that her physicians had cleared her to return to work.  
      During that time period, she never suggested there were any particular jobs 
      or bundles of duties that she could productively perform, nor, to the Respondent’s 
      knowledge, did any of her physicians.  During her four year absence from 
      work, the Complainant repeatedly took the position that (initially) she 
      was not ready to return to work, and (later) that she was unlikely to ever 
      be able to return to work at Dofasco.  The Commission’s Pleadings do not 
      refer to any indication from the Complainant that she was, either prior 
      to or subsequent to her termination, medically fit to return to any productive 
      job at Dofasco.  This background, coupled with her refusal to even attempt 
      an ultra-light duty job, the WCB’s concurrence that she could do the work 
      and her clear focus on maintaining WCB eligibility, constituted ample grounds 
      for terminating the employment relationship.  For four years, the Complainant 
      had not fulfilled the basic “essential duty” of an employee to, ie., perform 
      productive work.  Apart from wishful thinking, there was no reason to believe 
      that, whatever accommodation Dofasco made for her, she ever would.  A “window 
      of opportunity”, arising out of the broader corporate restructuring process, 
      became accessible for a short period of time [earlier in Dofasco’s pleading 
      it was alleged that there was a “pressing” need to fill the switchboard 
      operator’s vacancy].  Dofasco acted reasonably in stating its preparedness 
      to accept medical clearance from a doctor other than the absent specialist 
      and its readiness to physically modify the worksite.  The Complainant declined 
      to take advantage of this, and the window “closed”.  There was no prospect 
      that such an opportunity would arise again in the foreseeable future.  Dofasco 
      then proceeded to exercise its rights of termination under Section 17 of 
      the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Dofasco also pleaded:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dofasco has now learned that in August, 1993, the Complainant was awarded 
      disability benefits under the Canada Pension Plan.  Dofasco has requested 
      but has not yet received documents explaining why this decision was reached 
      despite the findings of Dr. Darracott in November, 1992 [that “from a physical 
      point of view, there [was] no clinical evidence to suggest she has physically 
      disabling pathology”].</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>Under the Canada Pension Plan, an applicant can only receive a CPP Disability 
      Pension if they are “incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful 
      occupation” and their disability is “likely to be long continued and of 
      indefinite duration”.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Dofasco then raised 
  the following issues:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>At the time of her termination, was the Complainant capable of performing 
      any work, or was she “incapable of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation”, 
      as her CPP Disability Pension status would suggest?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>If the Complainant now claims to have been capable of performing work 
      in March, 1994, should the Board of Inquiry dismiss this Complaint as an 
      abuse of process, given the fact that such a position directly contradicts 
      the position she has successfully taken before the Canada Pension Plan i[n] 
      respect of the same time period?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>If, as her CPP status would suggest, the Complainant was totally unemployable 
      in March, 1994, did Dofasco have any obligation at all to accommodate her 
      “needs”?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>Assuming the Complainant was capable of some work in March, 1994, was 
      she capable of the switchboard duties?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>Assuming the Complainant’s needs were such that some measure of accommodation 
      would have permitted her to perform work in March, 1994, were Dofasco’s 
      efforts at accommodation sufficient to accommodate those needs?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>Did the Complainant, herself, take all reasonable steps available to 
      her to participate in the accommodative process?</span></p>

  </span></span> The board heard the motion on December 16, 1999 and gave its 
  decision orally that day.  It stated the competing submissions of the parties 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Dofasco brings a motion for production of medical files, WCB file, CPP 
      file and income tax returns (T1s and notices of assessment) from the Complainant.  
      Dofasco argues that it should have the same degree of access to original 
      documents in a file as the Complainant.  Dofasco also submits that it is 
      being denied the ability to know the case it has to meet, prepare its defence 
      under section 17 of the Code, and deal with central issues in this case 
      including the quantum of damages.  Dofasco has highlighted instances of 
      imperfect disclosure in these proceedings including sequentially numbered 
      documents not produced by the Complainant.</p>
    <p>The Commission opposes the motion and argues that the relief sought is 
      too wide and that Dofasco is not entitled to the production of files <i>per 
      se</i> and documents not relevant to the handicap of the Complainant (chronic 
      pain disability, fibromyositis, fibromyalgia).  The Commission argues that 
      the Board’s rules do not contemplate such a wide net of disclosure – a “fishing 
      expedition”.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Though not present, the Complainant, through letters by her counsel 
      in the motion materials, indicates that she has met her disclosure obligations 
      under the Rules.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>After stating that 
  “[t]he motion is granted in part”, the board gave the following reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The test for production is arguable relevance.  Section 5.4(1) of the <i>Statutory 
      Powers Procedure Act</i> and Board of Inquiry Rule 42 give me a broad power 
      to order disclosure.  Rule 42 confers on me the power to order disclosure 
      of “…anything else the panel considers appropriate for a full and satisfactory 
      understanding of the issues in the proceeding.”</p>
    <p>The threshold for disclosure here, as in the courts, is not a very high 
      one.  There must be some relevance and the production must have some nexus 
      to issues before the Board.  The general movement is toward greater disclosure.  
      This is reflected by the Ontario Court of Appeal’s comments in <i>Cook v. 
      Ip</i> (1985), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 81, at 86:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>There can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that 
          all relevant evidence is available to the Court.  This is essential 
          if justice is to be done between the parties…The production of medical 
          records is thus fundamental to a Court’s determination of the nature, 
          extent and effect of the injuries which may have been suffered and the 
          appropriate measure of damages flowing from them.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Dofasco has satisfied me that the nature of the documents sought (some 
      of which are known and some of which are not known) are crucial to knowing 
      its case to be met and preparing its key defence under section 17 of the 
      Code.  The motion materials clearly show that production by the Complainant 
      has been incomplete.  My goal is to balance the needs of Dofasco to know 
      and prepare its case and the confidentiality of the Complainant inherent 
      in such disclosure.</p>
    <p>The Commission argues against an order of disclosure of documents from 
      medical practitioners not enumerated by Dofasco and those parts of the file 
      of Dr. Leong (the Complainant’s family doctor) dealing with medical conditions 
      not enumerated above.  I find that ailments other than those listed above 
      are arguably relevant to Dofasco’s section 17 accommodation defence and 
      the quantum of damages.  Dofasco should not be prevented from presenting 
      such arguments.</p>
    <p>I find further that information contained in the Complainant’s files at 
      the WSB and CPP will arguably be relevant to the issues in this proceeding.  
      Employment related income is clearly relevant to issues in this proceeding, 
      including the quantum of damages.  Information in the Complainant’s file 
      at Dofasco’s medical department will no doubt be relevant to key issues 
      in this proceeding.</p>

  </span></span> The Divisional Court (Hartt, Carnwath and Matlow JJ.) dismissed 
  the application.  Carnwath J. gave the following reasons for the court orally 
  at the conclusion of the hearing:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We all agree the application fails.  We find it would be unreasonable to 
      interfere with the interim decision of the Board, a decision devoid of exceptional 
      or extraordinary circumstances. The hearing before the Board should not 
      be fragmented and should be permitted to run its course.  The section 17 
      issue should receive a full hearing by the Board.  Any aggrieved party may 
      appeal, based on a full evidentiary record.  Moreover, records are arguably 
      relevant to the determination of a remedy and quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>We find the Board’s decision was a reasonable exercise of its discretion 
      at this preliminary stage.  In carrying out the balancing of the fourth 
      part of the test in <i>A.M. v. Ryan</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, we find the 
      Board’s exercise of discretion to be reasonable, particularly in the light 
      of the acknowledgment of counsel that the usual undertaking of Mr. Hines 
      to maintain confidentiality is in effect.</p>
    <p>The panel, in the exercise of its discretion, awards party-and-party costs 
      of $3,500.00, inclusive of fees and disbursements, plus G.S.T. to Dofasco 
      Inc.  The costs are awarded solely against the Commission.</p>

lang=EN-US>The Issues Raised by the Commission</span></p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The basic issues raised by the commission are that the Divisional 
  Court erred in applying the review standard of reasonableness rather than correctness 
  and that the board committed jurisdictional error in ordering extensive disclosure 
  and productions of records that (a) were in the hands of non-parties to the 
  proceeding and (b) were privileged.  The commission also argued that the Board 
  erred in ordering disclosure of documents that were not arguably relevant to 
  the proceeding and documents other than those on which the disclosing party 
  intended to rely.</p>
<p class=MsoHeading7 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none'>What the Board and the Divisional Court Decided</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoHeading7 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none'>The Board’s Order </span></i></p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before the issues raised by the commission can be properly addressed, 
  it is essential to have an accurate understanding of the meaning and scope of 
  the board’s order.  No doubt, and I say this with respect to the board, its 
  order could be expressed more clearly than it is.  Following the hearing of 
  this appeal, we sought further submissions in writing from counsel for each 
  party on particular questions relating to the meaning of the order.  On the 
  basis of all the submissions made, I now express my opinion on what the board 
  did order in so far as it relates to the issues in this proceeding.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I think that paragraph 5 in the order, which relates to the provision 
  of an affidavit of documents, is the key paragraph in the order.  It refers 
  to the “documents obtained from the above sources.”  I take this to refer to 
  the documents (“files”) referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the order.  I do 
  not interpret it as referring to paragraph 2, which does not refer to either 
  files or documents, or to paragraph 4, which relates to the complainant’s income 
  tax returns and provides that they be produced to Mr. Hines, counsel for Dofasco.  
  No argument was directed to paragraph 4 and I do not regard it is being a contentious 
  matter in this proceeding.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The difficulty in interpreting paragraph 5 is that, literally, 
  it provides that both the affidavit of documents and copies of the productions 
  are to be provided to Mr. Hines by a certain date.  In my view, the only sensible 
  meaning of the paragraph is that the complainant is obliged to produce only 
  those documents for which no claim of privilege (provided for in an affidavit 
  of documents) or for which no claim to withhold production on the ground of 
  non-arguable relevance is asserted in the affidavit.  I say this because there 
  would be no point in requiring the use of the affidavit of documents if all 
  of the documents listed in it, including those, on proper grounds, sought to 
  be withheld, had to be produced to the opposite party at the outset of the process.  
  The purpose of the affidavit, as in ordinary civil litigation, is to provide 
  a framework within which the board may subsequently determine whether claims 
  of privilege and irrelevance should be upheld.  I shall expand on this point 
  further later in these reasons.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It may be noted that this interpretation is consistent with the 
  second sentence in paragraph 5: “The affidavit shall also include a section 
  listing those documents <i>not provided to Dofasco</i> for reason of not being 
  arguably relevant”  (emphasis added).</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The commission and the complainant argue against this interpretation 
  largely on the basis that the board had earlier said in its reasons: “I find 
  that ailments other than those listed above are arguably relevant to Dofasco’s 
  section 17 accommodation defence and the quantum of damages.”  In the context 
  of the reasons and order as a whole, I do not read this as expressing a final 
  decision on the producability of every document.  I read it as being subject 
  to the affidavit of documents procedure contemplated by paragraph 5.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, it may be noted that earlier in its reasons the board 
  stated its basis conclusion in these words: “The motion is granted in part”.  
  This meant that the moving party, Dofasco, was not successful in obtaining immediate 
  production of the documents it sought or, at least, all of them.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would also note that my interpretation of paragraph 5 of the 
  board’s order is in accord with the meaning contended for by counsel for the 
  board itself.  Because the correct interpretation of the order relates to the 
  question of whether the board acted within or exceeded its jurisdiction, I think 
  that it was appropriate for the board to make a submission on the subject (Brown 
  and Evans, <i>Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada</i> (1998-  
  ) at pp. 4-49 to 4-54).</p>
<p class=MsoHeading7 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:

<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is clear that the Divisional Court did not read the board’s 
  order as I have.  The court assumed that the complainant was required to produce 
  all of the documents sought by Dofasco.  For the purpose of analyzing the court’s 
  reasons, I shall accept its interpretation.  The first paragraph in its reasons 
  indicates that the commission’s application was premature and that the issues 
  respecting the production of documents should await determination until after 
  the board had heard the complaint on its substantive merits.  The court said 
  that the “records are arguably relevant to the determination of a remedy and 
  quantum of damages” and, further, that an aggrieved party could appeal “based 
  on a full evidentiary record”.  With respect, all of this overlooks the fact 
  that the right of the complainant to protection from production of documents 
  that are privileged or not arguably relevant would be irreparably infringed 
  the moment the documents were handed over to Dofasco, whether or not they were 
  used against the complainant at the hearing.  </p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I move on to the next paragraph in the Divisional Court’s reasons.  
  I do not think that it can rightly be said that the board carried out “the balancing 
  of the fourth part of the test in <i>A.M. v. Ryan</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157”.  
  The board made no reference to this decision.  The board did say that “my goal 
  is to balance the needs of Dofasco to know and prepare its case and the confidentiality 
  of the Complainant inherent in such disclosure”.  That “goal” was to be carried 
  out at the next stage of the proceeding, before the main hearing, after the 
  documents for which privilege and non-relevance was claimed had been identified 
  in the affidavit of documents.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Divisional Court 
  went on to say that the exercise of the board’s discretion was reasonable particularly 
  in light of the “usual undertaking of Mr. Hines to maintain confidentiality 
  [being] in effect.”</span></p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no document in the material setting forth an undertaking 
  and no undertaking is referred to in the order, as would be expected if an undertaking 
  was material to the order made.  The board, through its counsel, informed us 
  that “[t]he undertaking referred to by the Divisional Court was not given to 
  the Board.  The Board has no knowledge of the specific terms of the undertaking 
  and was not asked to consider or rule on this issue.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Hines informed us that he gave an undertaking “not to disclose 
  any document (or information contained therein) to my client <i>or anyone else</i> 
  (including, for example, potential expert witnesses) without the permission 
  of the Board of Inquiry.  It was expressly acknowledged that such permission 
  for further disclosure could only be obtained after argument involving the commission 
  and Mrs. Jeffrey”. (Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Hines said that he could not explain why the Divisional Court 
  referred to it as “the usual undertaking”.  He agreed with counsel for the commission 
  that the undertaking was “unusual.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The commission informed 
  us that, during the hearing of the motion, Mr. Hines offered an undertaking 
  not to disclose the documents ordered produced to him to his client Dofasco 
  but that the undertaking did not form part of the board’s order on production.</span></p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I, of course, have no hesitation in accepting Mr. Hines’ statement 
  that, in the course of argument he offered the undertaking he described.  It 
  appears, however, that it had no effect on the board’s decision.  In the circumstances, 
  I have no doubt that the undertaking should not be taken into account in determining 
  the meaning and legal effect of the board’s order.</p>

  to a tribunal’s duty, in some cases, to order pre-hearing disclosure as part

  it may not have been that clear that tribunals could provide for pre-hearing 
  disclosure, at least to the extent of having the power to order such disclosure.  
  In any event, it can be seen from s. 5.4(1) that the Legislature did not enact 
  a general provision conferring powers relating to disclosure on all tribunals.  
  It restricted the power to only those tribunals that had made rules dealing 
  with disclosure under s. 25.1.</p>

  </span></span> Having regard to the foregoing, if a tribunal was of the view 
  that power relating to pre-hearing disclosure was not relevant to or appropriate 
  for its proceedings, it would not make rules dealing with disclosure.  Obviously, 
  the Board of Inquiry provided for in the <i>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> thought 
  that power to make orders relating to pre-hearing disclosure was important to 
  its processes because it made Rules of Practice which included rules dealing 
  with disclosure (Rules 40-44) which came into effect on November 1, 1996.  It 
  appears that these rules were made under both s. 25.1 of the <i>Statutory Powers 
  Procedure Act</i> and s. 35(5) of the <i>Human Rights Code</i>.  It may be noted 
  that each of these statutory enabling provisions was enacted by the same statute, 
  S.O. 1994, c. 27: s. 56(38) for the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i> and 
  s. 65(10) for the <i>Human Rights Code</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I shall now consider some of the terms in the disclosure scheme.  
  The first observation relates to the meaning of the key word “disclosure” in 
  s. 5.4 of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i> and in the board’s rules.  
  As the context of s. 5.4 and the rules make clear, the word clearly extends 
  to the obligation of a party to furnish to the other party documents in its 
  possession for the other party’s inspection.  I mention this because in the 
  <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 194, as amended, “disclosure” 
  means something less: the disclosure in a party’s affidavit of documents of 
  the existence of documents and does not extend to making the documents available 
  to the other side for inspection.  This latter step is called production.  Disclosure 
  and production in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> together comprise the 
  total process of documentary discovery.  See, in particular, rules 30.01 to 
  30.05.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The foregoing analysis does not mean that under s. 5.4 and the 
  board’s rules the board cannot make orders which are part of, or a step in, 
  the complete disclosure process as long as their purpose is to lead to the proper 
  production of documents, e.g. an order directing the preparation and delivery 
  of an affidavit of documents.  This power would be included in the board’s general 
  power relating to disclosure.  This observation is relevant to the board’s order 
  in this case, which provided for an affidavit of documents as a prelude to ruling 
  subsequently on what documents should be produced.</p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> My second observation relates to the first.  It can be seen at 
  a glance that the disclosure provisions relating to the board are substantially 
  fewer and much less detailed that those provided for in the <i>Rules of Civil 
  Procedure</i>.  It appears to me that what is expected with respect to the board’s 
  powers is that, in many proceedings before the board, the powers would not have 
  to be exercised because parties would voluntarily exchange all relevant documents.  
  In other proceedings the board might be required to make any one or more of 
  a wide range of particular orders provided that they are directed toward the 
  ultimate proper production of documents to the party seeking production.</p>

  </span></span> I should mention at this point that, by reason of my interpretation 
  of the board’s order, which is different from that of the Divisional Court, 
  it is not necessary to consider the appropriate standard of review.  For the 
  reasons I shall give, whether the standard be reasonableness or correctness, 
  paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 in the order are within the board’s authority and paragraph 
  2 is not.  I now address the remaining issues raised by the appellant.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span lang=EN-US>Did the Board Err in not Confining its

  </span></span> The commission submits that the board’s order should have been 
  confined to only those documents on which the complainant intends to rely to 
  support her case.  It relies upon Rule 41 in making the submission.  Rule 41, 
  standing alone, appears to support the commission’s submission.  There is, however, 
  more in the governing legislation than Rule 41.  Rule 42, which is backed up 
  by s. 5.4(1) of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i>, confers on the board 
  the power to order any party to deliver to any other party “further … documentary 
  evidence … for the purposes of the hearing, and anything else the panel considers 
  appropriate for a full and satisfactory understanding of the issues in the proceeding”.  
  This would clearly include any documents in a party’s possession that are relevant 
  to an issue in the proceeding and which may be helpful to the other party.</p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This interpretation accords with one of the recognized purposes 
  of discovery, which include not only enabling a party to know the case he or 
  she has to meet but, also, to obtain documents “which <i>may</i> … enable the 
  party requiring the affidavit [of documents] either to advance his own case 
  or to damage the case of his adversary” (<i>Compagnie Financière du Pacifique 
  v. Peruvian Guano Co</i>.  (1882), 11 Q.B.D. 55 (C.A.) at 63; and see Williston 
  and Rolls, <i>The Law of Civil Procedure</i> (1970) at pp. 894-898).  This, 
  in turn, facilitates more accurate fact-finding at the trial or hearing, if 
  the proceeding has not earlier resulted in a settlement.  I refer, generally, 
  to <i>Cook v. Ip</i> (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 289 (C.A.) at 292.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Section 5.4(1) of 
  the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i>, which confers power on the board 
  to “make orders for [a] the exchange of documents”, should be read as meaning 
  the exchange of documents to carry out the basic purposes of pre-hearing disclosure 
  and so should not be read as confined to documents on which a party intends 
  to rely.</span></p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The commission has referred to Rule 43, which is concerned with 
  the sanction for failing to disclose, as being some indication that a party’s 
  disclosure rights are confined to receiving only those documents on which the 
  other party will rely.  Clearly, this sanction relates only to the case of non-disclosure 
  of a document on which a party wishes to rely, but this consideration cannot 
  reasonably result in the conclusion that the whole of the disclosure scheme 
  is confined to documents on which the producing party intends to rely.</p>

  </span></span> The commission submits that the board had no power to order disclosure 
  from the complainant’s doctors because they are not parties to the proceeding.  
  It is not necessary to determine whether the disclosure provisions in the board’s 
  rules and s. 5.4 of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i> confer power to 
  order disclosure by non-parties because I think that the order in question is 
  confined to imposing disclosure obligations on a party (the complainant) and 
  not on her doctors, who are not parties.  The complainant has a general right 
  of access to her medical records in the form of obtaining copies of them from 
  her doctors: <i>McInerney v. MacDonald</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 138.  This is consistent 
  with the general position in civil proceedings that a party has control over 
  his or her doctors’ records and has the obligation to produce them: Holmested 
  and Watson, <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i> [1984- ) at pp. 30-38 to 30-39; and 
  30-49 to 30-62.</p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is generally agreed that if documents under the control of 
  non-parties are important to the fair and accurate resolution of issues it is 
  preferable that they be produced before the hearing to avoid almost inevitable 
  adjournments if they are produced for the first time at the hearing (see s. 
  39(4) of the <i>Human Rights Code</i>) and to enable each side to prepare its 
  case more effectively.  In this regard s. 2 of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure 
  Act </i>(which provides that the Act and rules made under it “shall be liberally 
  construed to secure the just, most expeditious and cost-effective determination 
  of every proceeding on its merits”) may be of assistance in interpreting s. 
  5.4(1)(e) in a way that would support pre-hearing disclosure from third parties.  
  This point was not argued and I express no final opinion on it. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I mention at the outset that Mr. Hines conceded that the board 
  had no power to order the production of privileged documents.  This is correct 
  (<i>Statutory Powers</i> <i>Procedure Act</i>, s. 5.4(2)) and, in the same vein, 
  I think that the board has no power to order the production of documents that 
  are not arguably relevant.  The exercise of such a power would invade a party’s 
  privacy rights without any countervailing advantage to the administration of 
  justice.  This does not mean that a court should not show deference to a decision 
  by the board that a particular document is arguably relevant but this, of course, 
  is a different issue.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appropriate place to deal in general terms with the 
  question of substantive relevance in this proceeding.  In its reasons, the board 
  found that “the ailments other than those listed above [chronic pain disability, 
  fibromyositis, and fibromyalgia] are arguably relevant to Dofasco’s section 
  17 accommodation defence and the quantum of damages.”  In my view, the board 
  had a reasonable basis for this finding.  There was material before the board 
  that the complainant had satisfied the Canada Pension Plan administrators that 
  she was “incapable of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dofasco’s position, accepted by the board, is that the evidence 
  relating to this disability benefit is relevant to its defence under s. 17(1) 
  of the <i>Human Rights Code</i> that the complainant was “incapable of performing 
  or fulfilling the essential duties or requirements” of work at Dofasco.  Further, 
  there was a rational basis for the board’s finding that the “motion materials 
  clearly show that production by the complainant has been incomplete.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In dealing with the specific issues of privilege and non-relevance 
  I shall first consider paragraph 5 in the board’s order which relates to the 
  provision by the complainant of an affidavit of documents and copies of production.  
  I have, earlier in these reasons, set forth my interpretation of this paragraph.  
  It appears to be concerned with the documents in the possession of the doctors 
  named in paragraph 1 and with the documents referred in paragraph 3, which are 
  in the files of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, the Canada Pension 
  Plan, and Dofasco’s medical department.  I shall then consider paragraph 2 of 
  the order which requires the complainant to furnish to counsel for Dofasco the 
  medical information referred to in it.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I shall not consider 
  paragraph 4, which relates to the production to Mr. Hines of income tax returns 
  and notices of assessment, because, as I have earlier noted, no complaint was 
  made with respect to it.</span></p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If paragraph 5 were interpreted to require the complainant to 
  provide to Mr. Hines <i>all</i> of the documents referred to in it,  without 
  any screening of them by the board to exclude those which are privileged or 
  not arguably relevant, there would, to put it mildly, be a serious problem with 
  respect to the validity of the order.  However, as I have determined, the board’s 
  order should not be interpreted as providing for such unrestricted production.  
  The requirement of an affidavit of documents, which contains a paragraph in 
  which privilege may be claimed for specified documents (Form 30A, para. 3) and, 
  by virtue of the board’s order, a further section in which protection may be 
  claimed for documents which are not arguably relevant, is in my view, within 
  the powers of the board.  Further, the requirement of the use of the procedure 
  contemplated by the affidavit ensures that the order does not exceed the powers 
  of the board.  This procedure enables Dofasco to challenge the objections to 
  production of identified documents on the basis of privilege and non-relevance, 
  if it sees fit, and enables the board to deal with the challenges on a document 
  by document basis.  In carrying out this function the board, if it considers 
  it to be helpful, could examine the document in question. Cf. rule 30.06(d) 
  in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The requirement merely to disclose the existence of a document 
  in an affidavit of documents does not involve a breach of privilege (<i>MacPhayden 
  v. Employers Liability Assurance Corporation</i>, [1933] O.W.N. 72 (H. Ct.) 
  and Williston and Rolls, <i>op. cit</i>., at p. 897).  It is an essential step 
  to enable claims to privilege to be determined in an orderly and fair way.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In short, paragraph 5 in the order and those paragraphs related 
  to it (paragraphs 1 and 3) do not involve an infringement of the complainant’s 
  right to privilege or to keep from Dofasco documents which are not arguably 
  relevant.  On the contrary, they afford protection for these rights. </p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not think that the same can be said for paragraph 2 in the 
  order.  It requires the complainant to furnish to counsel for the Dofasco a 
  document setting forth all medical practitioners not mentioned in paragraph 
  1 who treated the complaint between March 22, 1990 and the present, their area 
  of expertise or speciality, the dates of the visits, and the ailment or condition 
  treated.  It is not known what particular information would be set forth in 
  this document but the requirement to produce it inevitably carries with it the 
  grave risk that, in complying with the order, the complainant would be providing 
  to Dofasco information of a most intimate nature relating to her physical and 
  emotional condition that is completely unrelated to her claims in this proceeding 
  from both Dofasco’s and her point of view.  In my view, this particular part 
  of the order, which contains no terms or conditions to protect the privacy interests 
  of the complainant, exceeds the board’s power under s. 5.4(1) and (2) of the 
  <i>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</i> and its own rules.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I appreciate that the board has, and should have, wide latitude 
  in making procedural orders but, it appears to me, in paragraph 2, the board 
  has made no attempt at all to balance the complainant’s right to protect privileged 
  or irrelevant information with Dofasco’s right to obtain production of relevant 
  material.  In this respect, paragraph 2 stands in stark contrast to paragraphs 
  1, 3, and 5. </p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> What is required to be produced by paragraph 2 may, of course, 
  include information and material which is not privileged and is relevant to 
  Dofasco’s defence.  If this be the case, the board has sufficient powers under 
  s. 5.4(1) of the <i>Statutory Powers Procedure A</i>ct, and its own rules, to 
  make an order which would require the information to be produced after the complainant’s 
  claims respecting privilege and non-relevance have been resolved.</p>

  </span></span> I appreciate that the foregoing will make discouraging reading 
  for those who value the speed and efficiency of the administrative process as 
  an alternative to the cost, delay, and apparent red tape of the procedure which 
  is generally thought to be part of the process in the ordinary courts.  The 
  discovery process in these courts has been subjected to severe criticism as 
  a factor contributing to increased cost and delay (see Report of the Canadian 
  Bar Association <i>Task Force on Systems of Civil Justice</i> (1996) at p. 43 
  and Andrews, <i>Principles of Civil Procedure</i> (1994) at para 21-041) and 
  yet, in the present case, we have a serious example of discovery undoubtedly 
  causing substantial delay and expense in the proceedings before an administrative 
  tribunal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> No doubt, the discovery process cannot work effectively, in either 
  civil or administrative proceedings, without substantial cooperation between 
  the parties in voluntarily disclosing the existence of all relevant documents.  
  This has been lacking in the present case but, in saying this, I wish to make 
  it clear that I do not intend to criticize the parties or their counsel.  This 
  case arose relatively early in the history of a right to disclosure under the 
  <i>Statutory Powers Procedures Act</i> and the Rules of the Board of Inquiry 
  and it appears to me that the main cause of the difficulties has been growing 
  pains with the new procedure.</p>
