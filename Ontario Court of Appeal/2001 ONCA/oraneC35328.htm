<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Russell G. Juriansz, sitting 
  with a jury, on January 29, 2000 and the sentence imposed on November 2, 2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine.  It was alleged 
  that he supplied the cocaine sold to an undercover police officer.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown’s case consisted of the evidence of officers at the scene.  
  One officer said that he made arrangements to buy cocaine from a person named 
  Kevin.  He gave Kevin a marked $100 bill.  Kevin’s supplier drove up in a vehicle.  
  That vehicle belonged to the appellant.  After the meeting with his supplier, 
  Kevin returned to the undercover officer and provided him with cocaine.  The 
  appellant was arrested in the vehicle about 30 minutes later.  He was alone 
  and the marked $100 was found on the console beside the driver’s seat.  The 
  appellant denied any involvement in the drug transaction.  He said that he was 
  not at the place where the transaction took place and he denied that he was 
  in possession of the marked $100 bill when he was arrested.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant's credibility was obviously central to this case.  During 
  examination-in-chief, the appellant testified that about 6 months before his 
  arrest he had given the police a false name when arrested on an immigration 
  warrant.  He was subsequently convicted on obstructing police and received a 
  sentence of 1 day in jail in addition to some 82 days in custody prior to conviction.  
  In cross-examination, Crown counsel merely confirmed that the appellant had 
  been convicted of obstructing police.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not give any instruction as to the use which the 
  jury could make of the evidence of the prior conviction.  He was not asked by 
  either counsel to give any such instruction and no objection was taken to the 
  instruction until after the verdict was returned.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is conceded by the Crown that the trial judge erred in law by failing 
  to instruct the jury that the evidence of prior conviction can be used only 
  in assessing the appellant’s credibility and could not be used in any way as 
  evidence that the accused committed the offence.  The Crown argues that the 
  error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that s. 
  686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> should be applied and the appeal 
  dismissed.  That section, the so called <i>curative proviso</i> must be used 
  with great care, particularly in cases where the verdict turns on credibility 
  assessments.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are satisfied that the s. 686(1)(b)(iii) can be applied here.  A 
  proper instruction would have highlighted the relevance of the evidence of the 
  prior conviction to the appellant’s credibility.  Given the nature of that conviction, 
  this part of the instruction could not possibly have helped the appellant.  
  The second part of the instruction warns against the misuse of evidence of a 
  prior criminal conviction.  We see no realistic possibility that absent a proper 
  instruction the jury could have inferred from a single prior conviction for 
  obstructing police that the appellant was the type of person who would traffic 
  in cocaine.  Nor do we think there was any real danger that the jury would conclude 
  based on evidence of one previous, relatively minor conviction for an unrelated 
  offence that the appellant was a bad person who should be convicted regardless 
  of whether the Crown had proved its case against him.  The dangers against which 
  the instruction are designed to guard were simply not present in any meaningful 
  way in the circumstances of this case.  To paraphrase the words of Lamer C.J.C., 
  concurring in <i>R. v. B.(F.F.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 112 at 119, we are 
  satisfied that it can be safely concluded that the absence of a proper instruction 
  had no material adverse effect on the deliberations of the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In oral argument, counsel suggested for the first time that part of 
  the cross-examination of the appellant required an instruction that the jury 
  should not draw any adverse inference from the fact that the appellant was illegally 
  in the country and working illegally.  We have considered that part of the cross-examination 
  and in the context of the entire cross-examination and are not satisfied that 
  a limiting instruction argued for by the appellant was necessary.  Counsel at 
  trial did not request any such instruction.  </p>
