  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>CATZMAN J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>The appeal</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In 1978, the appellant, Terry Owen, was tried 
    on a charge of second degree murder.  Found not guilty by reason of insanity, 
    he was ordered to be detained in the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre.  
    In the twenty-two years following his original detention, he has been subject 
    to twenty four separate warrants or disposition orders.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As the years passed, the appellant’s dispositions 
    provided for progressively increased access to the community, latterly residence 
    in the community under hospital supervision.  In January 2000, however, after 
    a urine sample tested positive for cannabis and cocaine, he was returned to 
    in-patient status in the custody of the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital (“KPH”).  
    In May 2000, the Ontario Review Board (“the Board”) ordered that he be detained 
    at KPH with only staff-accompanied access to the hospital grounds or the community.  
    This is an appeal from that order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For the reasons that follow, I would allow 
    the appeal, set aside the order of the Board and direct that the appellant 
    be discharged absolutely.</span></p>
  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>            The 1978 offence</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the time of the 1978 offence, the appellant 
    and his male victim had been living together for about three months.  The 
    appellant remembered feeling paranoid for some weeks before the incident.  
    That morning, he and his roommate shared an apple spiked with methamphetamine, 
    an amphetamine derivative.  After consuming the apple, the appellant became 
    fearful of his friend who, he came to believe, had been involved in the death 
    of the appellant’s grandfather.  The appellant had a gun and remembered hitting 
    the victim with a stick or other object.  He then remained at the scene until 
    the police arrived and arrested him.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Originally charged with attempted murder and 
    remanded to the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, the appellant was charged 
    with second degree murder when his friend died of his wounds.  As noted, the 
    appellant was tried and found not guilty by reason of insanity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>            Subsequent dispositions</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>After the trial, the appellant was returned 
    to Penetanguishene and detained under a Lieutenant-Governor’s warrant.  Except 
    for a brief interim transfer to St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital, he remained 
    in Penetanguishene until 1986, when he was transferred to the North Bay Psychiatric 
    Hospital.  Annual Board hearings from 1986 to 1989 resulted in increased community 
    access, progressing from day passes to permission to live in the community 
    on stated conditions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Then, in 1990, the appellant was convicted 
    of assault causing bodily harm after striking a man in the face with a pool 
    cue, fracturing the victim’s jaw.  The appellant had been drinking heavily 
    at the time.  He was sentenced to fourteen months imprisonment and two years 
    probation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Prior to his release from jail, the appellant 
    was examined and assessed by a psychiatrist.  The mental status examination 
    indicated that he was not depressed and showed no evidence of anxiety; that 
    there was no disorder of thought and speech; and that there was no evidence 
    of hallucinations or delusional thinking.  After completing his sentence, 
    he was transferred to the secure unit at KPH.  The hospital reports upon transfer 
    noted that he had an extensive history of substance abuse, and one of the 
    primary objects of his transfer to KPH was to address his problem of drug 
    and alcohol abuse. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>From 1991 to 1994, in the absence of any indication 
    of major depression or psychotic symptoms, the appellant was again allowed 
    gradually increased access to the community, first by way of staff-escorted 
    community access and later by way of permission to live in the community under 
    prescribed conditions, including abstinence from non-medical use of alcohol 
    and drugs.  Dispositions in 1994, 1995 and 1996 provided for conditional discharges.  
    In 1997, the appellant’s urine tested positive for cannabis, and dispositions 
    in that year and in 1998 and 1999 provided that he be detained at KPH but 
    live in Kingston, again on the condition that he abstain from non-medical 
    use of alcohol and drugs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>While living in the community from 1994 to 
    1999, the appellant lived with his common law wife and their son.  His common 
    law wife appeared to suffer from a mental disorder and they separated intermittently.  
    During these separations, the appellant was the sole caregiver to their young 
    son.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In 1999, the appellant requested and was granted 
    permission to relocate to the Chatham area in order to be closer to friends 
    and family.  Before his relocation could be implemented, the appellant was 
    charged with impaired driving.  He had been drinking with friends and went 
    for a drive with them.  After an altercation, the designated driver left and 
    the appellant drove the car a short distance before being stopped by police.  
    He was returned to KPH on hospital in-patient status three days later.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As a result of the appellant’s re-admission 
    to the hospital, his common law wife was left with their son.  Concerned about 
    her ability to care for the child on her own, the Children’s Aid Society took 
    him into its custody.  The appellant returned to community living two months 
    later, determined to have his son returned to him, but KPH no longer supported 
    his relocation to the Chatham area. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In January, 2000, a closely monitored urine 
    sample provided by the appellant tested positive for cannabis and cocaine, 
    and he was readmitted to hospital.  He admitted that he had continued to use 
    cannabis for many years and had avoided detection by submitting false urine 
    samples.  He denied having used cocaine.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>            The disposition under appeal

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Following a hearing in March 2000, the Board 
    concluded that the appellant’s drug-induced psychosis was in remission, but 
    that he continued to suffer from a very serious antisocial personality disorder, 
    complicated by alcoholism and substance abuse.  The Board said in their reasons:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-GB>It is unfortunate that Mr. Owen has chosen 
      to retard his progress toward rehabilitation and thwart the efforts of his 
      caregivers to return him to society.  We note that as recent as August of 
      1999 the treatment team were prepared to support his transfer to the Chatham 
      area, which remains Mr. Owen’s desired relocation.  Mr. Owen by his conduct 
      is the agent of his own misfortune, albeit he is unlikely to recognize or 
      appreciate his role in what he will undoubtedly determine to be punishment 
      by the Review Board and the hospital.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, taking into consideration 
      the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition 
      of the accused, the reintegration of the accused into society and the other 
      needs of the accused, the Board is of the unanimous view that the least 
      onerous and least restrictive disposition is as follows:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      1.      That Mr. Owen be detained at the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital.<br>
      </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      2.      That the administrator have the discretion to permit Mr.&nbsp;Owen 
      compassionate leave, staff-accompanied hospital and grounds privileges, 
      and staff-accompanied entry into the community.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      3.      That Mr. Owen be required to abstain absolutely from alcohol and 
      non&#8209;prescription drugs and submit a sample of his breath and/or urine 
      for testing purposes.</span></div>

    or suffers from the same mental disorder as that from which he or she suffered 
    at the time of commission of the index offence.  As this court has noted, 
    the section “speaks to the accused’s mental condition and not the existence 
    of a mental disorder”: <i>Peckham v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (1994), 
    93 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Ont. C.A.) at 454.  By using this broader expression, 
    Parliament intended the Board to address the overall mental state of the accused 
    without limiting itself to whether that condition, or at least some aspect 
    of it, continues to fit within the confines of the legal concept of a mental 
    disorder:  <i>Peckham</i>, at 453.  </span></p>
