<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  dated August 11, 1999, dismissing an appeal from the conviction by Judge C. 
  Roland Harris dated September 22, 1998.</span></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'></span></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [1]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant 
  was found guilty of assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of 
  his duty and sentenced to twenty-two days in jail to be served intermittently 
  and one year probation.  The appellant’s summary conviction appeal to a judge 
  of the Superior Court of Justice was dismissed.  He has now served his sentence 
  but he seeks leave to appeal to this court, and if leave is granted, appeals 
  the dismissal of his conviction.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [2]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In our view, 
  the summary conviction appeal judge erred in failing to recognize a significant 
  error in the reasons of the trial judge.  Those reasons demonstrate that the 
  trial judge applied a different standard in assessing evidence of the appellant 
  from that used to assess the credibility of the police witnesses in that he 
  subjected the appellant’s evidence to a higher standard of scrutiny.  The trial 
  judge rejected the evidence of the appellant largely on the grounds of his demeanour. 
  He identified only one minor contradiction in the appellant’s evidence with 
  respect to whether the blinds in the room where the alleged assault occurred 
  were open or closed.  He took a much more lenient approach when assessing the 
  evidence of the police officers despite a serious weakness in their testimony.  
  It was apparent that the police officers had closely collaborated in the preparation 
  of their notes.  However, both officers testified under oath that they had prepared 
  their notes independently and denied collaborating.  The trial judge found that 
  the two police officers had indeed collaborated when preparing their notes but 
  he gave little or no weight to this weakness in their evidence.  Given the importance 
  of their notes as a record of the alleged assault, this lack of candour of the 
  police officers presented a striking and fundamental weakness in their evidence, 
  certainly more significant than anything mentioned by the trial judge with respect 
  to the appellant’s evidence.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [3]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While an 
  appellate court must defer to a trial judge’s assessment of credibility, intervention 
  is appropriate where a trial judge’s reasons reflects legal error in the method 
  used to assess credibility.  In particular, this court has held that the application 
  of a stricter standard of scrutiny to the evidence of an accused than that used 
  to assess the evidence of Crown witnesses amounts to legal error justifying 
  appellate intervention: see <i>R. v. C (J.)</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 197, 
  <i>R v. C.S.</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 2200 and <i>R. v. Gostick</i> (1999), 137 
  C.C.C. (3d) 53.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [4]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Accordingly, 
  leave to appeal is granted, the appeal from the summary conviction appeal judge 
  is allowed and the conviction is set aside.  In the circumstances of this case, 
  the appropriate remedy is that an acquittal be entered.</p>
