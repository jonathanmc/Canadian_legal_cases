<p>On appeal from his conviction by Justice Lawrence W. Whalen, sitting with a 
  jury, on January&nbsp;12, 1999 and from the sentence imposed on January&nbsp;13, 
  1999.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT<span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of his common-law 
  wife.   He was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole 
  for fourteen years.  He appeals against both his conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the early evening of September 24, 1997, the appellant shot his wife 
  in the face at close range with a 12-gauge shotgun and killed her.  Both the 
  appellant and the deceased had been drinking that day.  The evidence of numerous 
  witnesses who had contact with the appellant before and after the shooting varied 
  as to the effect of the day’s alcohol consumption on the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant claimed that he had no memory of much of the day in question.  
  The appellant’s blood-alcohol level registered 0.171 and 0.175 in Breathalyzer 
  tests taken approximately four hours after the shooting.  He could not say whether 
  he had consumed alcohol after the shooting, a factor that may have affected 
  the assessment of his degree of intoxication at the time of the killing.  The 
  evidence did not resolve this question.  The deceased’s body registered a blood-alcohol 
  reading of 0.159.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury heard much evidence on the consumption of alcohol and its potential 
  effects on the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, it was the Crown’s theory that the appellant was a “mean drunk” 
  who shot and killed his wife.  The Crown contended that the alcohol the appellant 
  had consumed before he shot his wife had affected neither his capacity nor his 
  intent to commit murder.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The theory of the defence was that the appellant, a lifelong alcoholic 
  and manic depressive, did not form the requisite intent for second degree murder 
  because of his state of intoxication and/or the effect of his mental illness 
  at the time.  Alternatively, the defence argued that Mr. Paquette was not criminally 
  responsible on account of a chronic mental disorder.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was no dispute at trial that the appellant had shot the deceased.  
  The primary issue was the appellant’s mental state and the extent of his criminal 
  liability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal raises four issues:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Did 
      the trial judge err in his instructions as to the use that could be made

    <p> B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
      Did the trial judge err in failing to charge the jury on the limited use 
      of evidence of the appellant’s violent and aggressive disposition?</p>
    <p> C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
      Did the trial judge err in his instruction on the issue of intention?</p>

      fitness of the sentence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Heading>A.      Did the trial judge err in his instructions as to the 
  use that could be made of the appellant’s testimony on the <i>voir dire</i>?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before the trial proper began, a <i>voir dire</i> was held on the admissibility 
  of certain statements allegedly made by the appellant.  The appellant testified 
  at the <i>voir dire</i> and his evidence was clearly open to the inference that 
  he was far less intoxicated at the time of the shooting than was suggested by 
  his testimony at trial.  He was closely cross-examined on numerous inconsistencies 
  relating to his memory or lack of it with respect to various events before and 
  after the shooting.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that the jury may have accepted and made substantial 
  or incriminatory use of the appellant’s <i>voir dire</i> testimony.  Consequently, 
  the appellant contends that Mr. Paquette’s <i>voir dire</i> testimony should 
  have been the subject of a clear and forceful instruction prohibiting the jury 
  from using it as evidence of his capacity, mental state, or intent at the time 
  of the shooting.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge instructed the jury that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The fact that a witness has, on a prior occasion, made a statement inconsistent 
      with or contradictory to his or her evidence at this trial goes only to 
      the credibility or truthfulness of the witness.  The testimony of the witness 
      may be discredited in whole or in part by showing that he or she previously 
      made a statement which is inconsistent with his or her present testimony.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He further instructed the jury:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…I want to make it quite clear that such statement cannot be used by you 
      to prove the truth of the facts to which it relates unless in your opinion 
      the witness has, while testifying, accepted the truth of his or her prior 
      statement. …You can only use those inconsistent parts in assessing the credibility 
      or truthfulness of the witness’ testimony at this trial.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury as to the 
  proper use that could be made of the appellant’s testimony at the <i>voir dire</i> 
  as it arose during the course of the cross-examination at the trial proper.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, it is noteworthy that prior to delivering his charge to the 
  jury, the trial judge provided copies of the draft charge to counsel.  No material 
  objection was made concerning the instructions on previous inconsistent statements 
  and no objection was made following the delivery of the charge on this issue.   
  In these circumstances, defence counsel’s failure to object both before and 
  after the charge “says something about both the overall accuracy of the jury 
  instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection”.  See <i>R. v. 
  Jacquard</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 19. </p>
<p class=Heading>B.      Did the trial judge err in failing to charge the jury 
  on the limited use of evidence of the appellant’s violent and aggressive disposition?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Evidence of a violent and aggressive disposition when the appellant 
  had consumed alcohol was introduced as part of the material which formed the 
  basis of the testimony of an expert witness who testified for the defence on 
  the intoxication and mental disorder defences.  The Crown advanced the position 
  that this evidence was consistent with the appellant being a “mean SOB” or a 
  “mean drunk”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant now argues that the jury may have drawn the impermissible 
  inference that because of his prior violent acts or disposition, the appellant 
  was more likely to have formed the necessary intent to commit the offence in 
  question.  Accordingly, the trial judge was required to give the jury limiting 
  instructions as to the proper use that the jury could make of that evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While such an instruction could well have been given by the trial judge, 
  we are not satisfied that this non-direction constituted an error of law in 
  the circumstances of this case.  The following circumstances are particularly 
  noteworthy:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <span

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>the evidence

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>the appellant’s

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>the fact that 
      the appellant had shot and killed the deceased was admitted and the sole 
      issue was intent. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In these circumstances, it is our view that there was no risk that the jury 
  would have engaged in improper reasoning to convict the appellant.  It was not 
  the type of evidence that showed that the appellant had a propensity to form 
  the intent to kill, nor was it evidence of behaviour that would make the jury 
  want to punish him for his past conduct.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Once again, we note with respect to this ground of appeal that experienced 
  defence counsel made no objection to the draft charge or following the delivery 
  of the charge to the jury on this issue. Given that we are dealing with non-direction 
  as opposed to misdirection, the lack of objection from the defence is all the 
  more significant.</p>
<p class=Heading>C.      Did the trial judge err in his instruction on the issue 
  of intention?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge’s charge was inadequate with 
  respect to the nature of the intent required for murder and with respect to 
  the role that the evidence of intoxication and mental disorder could play in 
  the determination of the appellant’s criminal liability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge clearly spelled out in detail the requisite intent that 
  the Crown was required to prove for second degree murder and the included offence 
  of manslaughter, including the issues of intoxication and mental disorder or 
  mental stress falling short of insanity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It would have been preferable if the trial judge had refrained from 
  instructing the jury on the “common-sense inference”.  However, he specified 
  to the jury that this inference applied only to a sane and sober person.  In 
  addition, he directed the jury to consider the evidence of intoxication and 
  mental disorder before they could use the “common-sense” approach.  No prejudice 
  would result for the appellant as a consequence of this instruction. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are satisfied that when the charge is read as a whole, the jury could 
  not reasonably have been mistaken as to the correct law on the issue of intent.</p>
<p class=Heading> D.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge carefully considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating 
  circumstances in this case, including the appellant’s sad life and circumstances.  
  We see no error in principle, no failure to consider relevant factors, nor any 
  over-emphasis of the appropriate factors in the sentence imposed.  Moreover, 
  the sentence falls within the normal range of sentences that may reasonably 
  be imposed in cases of second degree murder of an unarmed spouse.  There is 
  no basis to interfere.</p>
