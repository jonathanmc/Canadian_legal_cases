  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This is an appeal 
  by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Local 324, from an order of the 
  Divisional Court which, on the application of the respondent, District of Parry 
  Sound Social Services Administration Board, quashed an interim award of a board 
  of arbitration established under a collective agreement between the parties.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The board held in the interim award that it had jurisdiction 
  to consider a grievance based on the discharge of a probationary employee.  
  The facts are straight forward.  The grievance in question was brought by a 
  probationary employee of the respondent who alleged:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>I grieve that I have been discharged from my position without justification 
      and that the decision was arbitrary, discriminatory, in bad faith and unfair.</span></p>

  </span></span> The key part of this grievance was the allegation that the discharge 
  was “discriminatory”.  The Union particularized the grievance with the allegation 
  that the grievor had been discharged a few days after her return from maternity 
  leave.  This involved discrimination on the basis of “family status” contrary 
  to s. 5(1) of the<i> Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 19.</p>

  </span></span> In very general terms, the issue that the board of arbitration 
  and the Divisional Court considered was the proper effect to be given to s. 
  5(1) of the <i>Human Rights Code</i> having regard to s. 48(12)(j) of the <i>Labour 
  Relations Act</i>, <i>1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A.  Further, this court 
  requested and received submissions on the bearing of ss. 44 and 64.5(1)-(5) 
  of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 14, as amended by 
  S.O. 1996, c. 28, s. 18 and S.O. 1998, c. 8, s. 35, as an additional possible 
  basis of the board’s jurisdiction to consider the grievance.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>.…[S]ection 48(12)(j) of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> obligates and 
      empowers a board of arbitration to interpret a collective agreement in a 
      manner consistent with the Human Rights legislation in this province.  The 
      <i>Human Rights Code</i> prohibits discrimination on the basis of family 
      status.  This collective agreement must be interpreted and applied in a 
      manner that is consistent with the statutory rights available to all employees, 
      including probationary employees.</p>
    <p>This collective agreement does not give a probationary employee the right 
      to grieve the justness or the <i>bona fides</i> of a discharge.  Nor does 
      the collective agreement allow a board of arbitration to interfere with 
      the discretion of the Employer in deciding to release a probationary employee.  
      The parties have agreed to leave such matters to the sole prerogative of 
      management.  But the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> imposes an overriding requirement 
      upon the parties and their collective agreement that ensures it will be 
      applied in a manner consistent with the <i>Human Rights Code</i>.  Further, 
      the power to interpret and apply that duty resides with a board of arbitration 
      constituted under the collective agreement. </p>
    <p>The case at hand is distinguishable from all the other cases cited by the 
      Employer in that we have a specific allegation of discrimination in this 
      case.  In the <i>Leeming</i> case [<i>Re The Queen in right of New Brunswick 
      and Leeming et al., </i>[1981] 1 S.C.R. 129]<i>, supra</i>, the Supreme 
      Court of Canada was able to conclude that the legislative scheme regarding 
      arbitration did not confer any substantive rights upon employees.  Therefore, 
      a board of arbitration could not apply or enforce substantive rights.  However, 
      in the case at hand, the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> does import the substantive 
      rights under the <i>Human Rights Code</i> into a collective agreement over 
      which a board of arbitration has jurisdiction.  Further, in none of the 
      cases cited by the Employer was there an allegation that the grievor had 
      been treated in a discriminatory manner.  Therefore, this case is distinguishable 
      from the case law cited above.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>For all these reasons, we have concluded that this Board of Arbitration has 
      the power and the responsibility to hear and determine the narrow question 
      of whether discrimination was a factor in the discharge of the grievor.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The dissenting member of the board of arbitration agreed with 
  the majority that if the terms of the collective agreement conflicted with the 
  <i>Human Rights Code</i>, the <i>Code</i> would prevail.  However, this did 
  not mean that the forum for determining such matters was necessarily a board 
  of arbitration.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>….Had our collective agreement not contained the provision that provided 
      that the discharge of a probationary employee was not to be arbitrated and 
      would not constitute a difference between the parties, I would have agreed 
      with the Chair’s decision.  However, in my view, the parties are free to 
      determine what constitutes a difference between them, which can then be 
      arbitrated.</p>
    <p>There is nothing at all illegal or wrong in the Employer and the Union 
      agreeing that they will not <u>arbitrate</u> the discharge of a probationary 
      employee.  If any statutory rights of the probationary employee were infringed 
      by the termination, then she is perfectly free to pursue her rights in the 
      particular forum provided under the statute in issue.</p>
    <p>In my view, the majority of the Board has exceeded their jurisdiction by 
      taking jurisdiction in this case when the parties have clearly told us that 
      an Arbitration Board was not to deal with discharge of a probationary employee.  
      Section 48(12)(j) of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> could only be utilized 
      if a Board of Arbitration had jurisdiction in the first instance to deal 
      with a particular dispute between the parties.  In our case, since there 
      was no difference between the parties, that should have been the end of 
      the matter.  Our Board has no jurisdiction to deal with this case and section 
      48(12)(j) of the <i>Labour Relations Act </i>should not even come into play.</p>

  </span></span> O’Leary J. gave the reasons of the Divisional Court for quashing 
  the Board’s decision.  His reasoning was, essentially, that of the dissenting 
  board member.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[10]            We interpret s. 48(12)(j) to confer power on an arbitration 
      board, to interpret and apply human rights and other employment-related 
      statutes when and if the Board of Arbitration has jurisdiction to hear a 
      grievance, but not otherwise.</p>
    <p>[11]            Both the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, s.48(1) and the collective 
      agreement stipulate what is to be arbitrated is “differences between the 
      parties arising from the interpretation application, administration or an 
      alleged violation of the agreement”.</p>
    <p>[12]            The agreement here states clearly that the discharge of 
      a probationary employee does not constitute a difference between the parties.  
      The grievor has chosen the wrong forum to litigate her claim.  It should 
      be before the Ontario Human Rights Commission if she feels her rights under 
      the <i>Code</i> have been violated.</p>

  show, the basic issue with respect to s. 48(12)(j) is just how the board of

  </span></span> The legislative history of s. 48(12)(j) may properly be considered 
  to include the important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>McLeod 
  v. Egan</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 517.  In this case, it was held that s. 7(1) in 
  the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, 1968 (Ont.) c. 35, which limited the number 
  of hours that an employee could be required to work, prevailed over a provision 
  in the collective agreement giving the employer the power to schedule its operations 
  “when and in its sole discretion it may deem advisable to do so…”.  At p. 523 
  Martland J. said for the court:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The basic provision of the Act is that which places a maximum limit upon 
      the working hours of an employee of eight in the day and 48 in the week.  
      Any provision of an agreement which purported to give to an employer an 
      unqualified right to require working hours in excess of those limits would 
      be illegal, and the provisions of art. 2.01 of the collective agreement, 
      which provided that certain management rights should remain vested in the 
      Company, could not, in so far as they preserved the Company’s right to require 
      overtime work by its employees, enable the Company to require overtime work 
      in excess of those limits.</p>

  </span></span> The court also held that there was no provision in the collective 
  agreement which amounted to “the consent or agreement of the employee or his 
  agent” within the meaning of these words in s. 11(2) of the <i>Employment Standards 
  Act</i> which would, in the circumstances, have allowed the employer to require 
  hours of work in excess of those provided for in s. 7(1).  It was with respect 
  to this issue that Laskin C.J.C. said in his concurring reasons at pp. 518-19:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Although the issue before the arbitrator arose by virtue of a grievance 
      under a collective agreement, it became necessary for him to go outside 
      the collective agreement and to <i>construe and apply</i> a statute which 
      was not a projection of the collective bargaining relations of the parties 
      but a general public enactment of the superior provincial Legislature.  
      On such a matter, there can be no policy of curial deference to the adjudication 
      of an arbitrator, chosen by the parties or in accordance with their prescriptions, 
      who interprets a document which is in language to which they have subscribed 
      as a domestic charter to govern their relationship. (Emphasis added.)</p>

      S.B.C. 1973, c. 122 to include the provision which subsequently became s.

  </span></span> It may be noted that in <i>McLeod v. Egan</i> Laskin C.J.C. appears 
  to have taken it for granted that arbitrators had the power to “construe and 
  <i>apply</i>” (emphasis added) relevant statutory provisions.  Notwithstanding 
  this, it may be that there is scope for regarding “interpret and apply” in s. 
  45(8) 3 and s. 48(12)(j) as conferring power to give a statutory remedy not 
  provided for in the collective agreement, as suggested by Mr. Swan.  In <i>McLeod 
  v. Egan</i> it would appear that the effect of the application of the <i>Employment 
  Standards Act</i> was fully exhausted when it was applied to override the employer’s 
  power in the collective agreement to require employees to perform overtime work 
  beyond 48 hours.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>George Surdykowski, 
  a senior arbitrator, has expressed the following, possibly more restrictive, 
  view of the meaning of s. 48(12)(j):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Section 48(12)(j) is but one 
      of ten provisions which delineate the powers of arbitrators, and I suggest 
      that its purpose and effect is the same as it was in Bill 40 [s. 45(8) 3]; 
      that is, to make it clear that collective agreements are subject to legislation 
      of general application, and that arbitrators can take such legislation into 
      account in interpreting a collective agreement.</span></p>
    <p>This does not mean that arbitrators are clothed with independent jurisdiction 
      under “human rights and other employment-related statutes”.  What it does 
      mean is that arbitrators are not required to give effect to collective agreement 
      provisions which conflict with legislation, something which ought to have 
      been, but apparently was not perceived to be, obvious.</p>
    <p>To the extent, that it has been suggested in arbitral jurisprudence that 
      section 48(12)(j) of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> enables an arbitrator 
      to interpret, apply and give relief under the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, 
      the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, the <i>Human Rights Code</i> or the 
      <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, as though the arbitrator was 
      a tribunal constituted under the particular legislation, whether or not 
      there is a breach of the collective agreement, I respectfully disagree.  
      Neither this nor any other provision of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> 
      clothes arbitrators with a plenary jurisdiction to adjudicate any and all 
      disputes between the parties to a collective agreement, regardless whether 
      there exists a connection between the dispute and the agreement.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(“Jurisdictional Overlap Between Arbitration and Other Forums: An Update” (2000), 
  8 <i>C.L.E.L.J.</i> 179 at 195-96).  Professor Adell notes on p. 196 that “anchor” 
  is his term and that “[i]t is variously referred to in the awards as a ‘nexus’, 
  a ‘hook’ or, with a contemporary ring, a ‘landing pad’”.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accepting that the interpretation and application of the relevant 
  statutory provisions is dependent on disputes that have some sort of anchor 
  in, or nexus with, the collective agreement, the real difficulty is  to determine 
  just when such a case exists.  In the present case, the Divisional Court held 
  that, looking at the terms of the collective agreement alone, there was no foundation 
  for considering human rights legislation.  The implication of this appears to 
  be that the statute may only be interpreted and applied to modify the terms 
  of a collective agreement under which there is a dispute.  With respect, I think 
  that this may give too narrow an effect to the wording of s. 48(12)(j). </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> I do not think that s. 48(12)(j) contemplates a two-step approach 
  to interpreting the collective agreement: (1) a reading of the collective agreement 
  by itself; and then, only if this reading shows that there is a dispute, (2) 
  an interpretation of the agreement in the context of the relevant statutory 
  provision.  I think that a more simple and straightforward approach is contemplated.  
  The provisions in the collective agreement should be read, initially, in the 
  context of the relevant statutory provision or provisions.  The resulting interpretation 
  should then be applied to the facts of the case.  This one-level approach is 
  consistent with the conferral of a power in s. 48(12)(j) to “interpret and apply” 
  certain legislation “despite any conflict between those statutes and the terms 
  of the collective agreement.”</p>

  </span></span> It may be that the terms of the collective agreement alone, isolated 
  from the statutory context, indicate that there is no dispute. However, if they 
  are in conflict with a statutory provision, the statutory provision will prevail.  
  This was the case in <i>McLeod v. Egan</i> and in <i>Re Queen’s University and 
  Fraser</i> (1985), 51 O.R. (3d) 140 (Div’l Ct.) and it has been held that conflict 
  between the collective agreement and a statutory provision is the “anchor” or 
  “nexus” which gives the arbitrator jurisdiction to interpret and apply the statute.  
  I refer in this respect, to the quotation from Surdykowski above “that arbitrators 
  are not required to give effect to collective agreement provisions which conflict 
  with legislation”, to Adell’s article in 8 <i>C.L.E.L.J</i> at pp. 190-194, 
  and to <i>Re Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library Board and Canadian Union 
  of Public Employees, Local 1582 </i>(1995), 46 L.A.C. (4th) 155 at 165-166:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>However, prior to this amendment [s. 45(8) 3], arbitrators, with the approval 
      of the courts, had relied upon external statutes where such statutes were 
      incorporated into the collective agreement, where such statutes aided in 
      the interpretation and/or intended application of the language of the collective 
      agreement and where such statutes were in conflict with the language of 
      the collective agreement making the language unlawful to enforce (see <i>McLeod 
      v. Egan</i> (1974), 46 D.L.R.  (3d) 150, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 512, 74 C.L.L.C.

  </span></span> The foregoing inclines me to the view that the dissenting member 
  of the board of arbitration and the Divisional Court took too narrow a view 
  of s. 48(12)(j).  The dissenting member said that the effect of a conflict between 
  the collective agreement and the <i>Human Rights Code</i> meant that the <i>Code</i> 
  would prevail, but that the only consequence of this was that the grieving employee 
  was free to assert her rights directly under the <i>Human Rights Code</i> and 
  not that the board of arbitration would have power to apply the agreement in 
  a manner that would comply with the <i>Code</i>.  If s. 48(12)(j) had merely 
  said that the statutes would prevail in the event of a conflict between them 
  and the collective agreement, which would be the case even in the absence of 
  s. 48(12)(j), this would be so.  However, the fact that the statute expressly 
  gives <i>to arbitrators</i> the power to interpret and apply certain legislation 
  suggests that its effect is greater and is to have some bearing on the arbitrator’s 
  jurisdiction.</p>

  </span></span> Applying this reasoning to the facts of this case, the conclusion 
  would be that the right of the employer under the collective agreement to discharge 
  a probationary employee “for any reason satisfactory to the employer” is in 
  direct conflict with s. 5(1) of the <i>Human Rights Code</i> and it should be 
  read down not to include the power to discharge an employee on the ground of 
  family status.  </p>

  </span></span> Although the foregoing reflects what I think is the better view 
  of the meaning of s. 48(12)(j), I think that I should indicate that the foundation 
  on which it is based may not be as solid as it should be.  The nexus between 
  the statute and the collective agreement which is based on conflict, when considered 
  in a broader context, could involve some incongruity.  Professor Adell has observed 
  at p. 197 of the article to which I have earlier referred:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The requirement of an explicit anchor or “landing pad” in the collective 
      agreement has the incongruous result that an arbitrator will find the dispute 
      arbitrable, and will resolve it on the basis of the external statute, where 
      the parties have said something inconsistent with what that statute requires 
      on a particular matter, but not where they have said nothing at all on the 
      matter.  If they explicitly reject or contradict what the statutes says, 
      an arbitrator will apply it anyway.  If they simply ignore the matter entirely 
      in their agreement, an arbitrator will shunt the dispute off to another 
      forum.  </p>

  </span></span> Section 48 (12)(j), at least by its wording, stops short of making

  are set forth earlier in these reasons.  In my respectful view, their meaning, 
  for the case at hand, is much clearer than that of s.48(12)(j).  Section 64.5(1) 
  makes s. 44 “part of the collective agreement” and s. 44 prohibits an employer

  of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> relates to the discharge of a probationary 
  employee” and that “[a]rticle 8.06(a) precludes the Appellant from grieving 
  the discharge of a probationary employee on any basis.”  It also submits that 
  “when the Appellant negotiated the Collective Agreement with the Respondent, 
  the Appellant made a decision, enforceable pursuant to section 64.5(4) of the 
  <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, not to seek the enforcement of the Act in connection

  out of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> provisions (s. 3 of the <i>Employment 
  Standards Act</i> and <i>Newfoundland Associations of Public Employees v. Newfoundland 
  (Queen Bay Centre)</i> (1996), 134 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 9 (S.C.C.)), particularly 
  where the Act is made part of the agreement.</p>

  </span></span> The respondent has also submitted that this court should not 
  consider the case on the basis of the application of the <i>Employment Standards 
  Act</i> provisions because the appellant had not sought enforcement of these 
  provisions before either the board of arbitration or the Divisional Court and 
  that it is not doing so in this court.  This latter submission does not accurately 
  describe the appellant’s position.  Before this court, the appellant submitted 
  that it clearly preferred that the case be decided on the basis of the application 
  of the <i>Human Rights Code</i> but it also submitted that the <i>Employment 
  Standards Act</i> provisions confer “stand alone” jurisdiction on the board 
  of arbitration to determine the grievance.</p>

  </span></span> Although the respondent has submitted that, because the issue 
  was not raised below, this court should not decide the case on the basis of 
  the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> provisions, it has not submitted that it 
  would be prejudiced if we did so.  The jurisdictional issue that was before 
  the board of arbitration and is now before this court is a pure question of 
  law.  The “facts” for the limited purpose of deciding this jurisdictional issue 
  are not in dispute.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that no prejudice would be 
  occasioned to the respondent if we decided the case on this basis.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In view of this direct 
  statutory incorporation of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> provisions into 
  the collective agreement, it is not necessary to consider the effect of Article 
  13.02(a), Pregnancy and Parental Leave, in the collective agreement, on the 
  issue to be decided.</span></p>

  </span></span> Although, for the reasons I have given, I am inclined to the 
  view that the Divisional Court erred in its application of s. 48(12)(j) of the 
  <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, I prefer not to express a concluded opinion on 
  this question.  I take this approach because, on the facts of the case, I regard 
  the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> provisions to be a much firmer basis of 
  decision.  In taking this minimalist approach I have dealt fully with the rights 
  of the parties on the facts but have not foreclosed a different analysis of 
  s. 48(12)(j) on the basis of further consideration given in a future case.</p>

  </span></span> For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order 
  of the Divisional Court, and make an order dismissing the application for judicial 
  review.  Although the case has taken a somewhat different turn in this court, 
  the appellant has had the better part of the argument overall, and I think it 
  appropriate to award it the costs of the application, of the motion for leave 
  to appeal (which, in any event, were to be “in the appeal”), and of the appeal.</p>
