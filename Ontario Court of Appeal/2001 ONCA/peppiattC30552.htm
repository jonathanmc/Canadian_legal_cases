<p class=headingtitle>On appeal from the Judgment of Justice James Chadwick dated 
  August 21, 1998.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>SIMMONS J.A.:</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Robert J. Nicol 
  had a dream of building a world-class golf course in Ottawa. He realized his 
  dream but some of the successful construction companies he operated in Ottawa 
  went bankrupt in the process. Nicol’s longtime banker, the Royal Bank, lost 
  a considerable amount of money because of the project.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The private golf 
  club envisaged by Nicol operated for two playing seasons. Club members abandoned 
  their memberships at the point in time when the golf club was required to purchase 
  the lands on which the course had been constructed from the Nicol companies. 
  The purchase was not completed and the Nicol companies were petitioned into 
  bankruptcy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       One hundred and 
  sixty-nine club-member investors started a class action against Nicol, his development 
  companies, the golf club, and the Royal Bank.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  They claimed Nicol or his companies 
  drew down on letters of credit delivered to R.J. Nicol Homes Limited to secure 
  memberships before the conditions for draw down had crystallized.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The trial judge 
  determined the investors were entitled to the return of their initial investments 
  based on breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. He awarded the investors 
  $3,210,000 on account of their restitutionary claim against the estate in bankruptcy 
  of R.J. Nicol Homes plus $2,754,198.45 on account of compound interest.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a> He held the Royal Bank liable for the same sums as the knowing 
  recipient of trust funds. He also awarded the investors punitive damages against 
  the estate of R.J. Nicol Homes in the amount of $845,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       On appeal, both 
  the Royal Bank and the trustee of the estate in bankruptcy of R.J. Nicol Homes 
  argued that the breaches found by the trial judge were trivial if they existed 
  at all. They also claimed the investors waived any breaches that may have occurred 
  by lifting an injunction prohibiting draw down of the letters of credit and 
  by playing at the club and participating in its governance during its two years 
  of operation. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The main issues 
  on appeal are whether there was a breach of contract, whether a fiduciary duty 
  existed and was breached, whether rescission was justified in the circumstances, 
  whether the conduct of the investors amounted to waiver, and whether a remedy 
  was available against the Royal Bank. The Royal Bank also appealed against the 
  dismissal of its claim for indemnity against the law firm that acted for it 
  during much of the transaction. Save in relation to costs, it conceded during 
  the hearing of the appeal that that portion of its appeal could not succeed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Facts</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Nicol envisaged 
  an equity golf club having up to 400 members. At the time most of the plaintiffs 
  purchased their memberships, the club was not yet incorporated and the course 
  was not yet built. They purchased their memberships in the club on the basis 
  of oral representations and written promotional material provided by R.J. Nicol 
  Homes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Most of the plaintiffs 
  were original subscribing members of the golf club. Most delivered payment for 
  their memberships in the form of letters of credit payable to R.J. Nicol Homes, 
  “in trust for Eagle Creek Golf Club”. Although the promotional material distributed 
  to prospective members was changed over time, the trial judge found “two relevant 
  conditions which were common to all brochures ”:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>i)         [I]f 260 non-resident Golf Memberships are not sold by December 
      31, 1990, the project will not be proceeded with and all amounts subscribed 
      for membership and all accompanying documents will be returned to the applicants, 
      and all letters of credit will be released;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
      [3] </span></a> and</p>
    <p> ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> [t]he Board of Governors of the club must certify that it was reasonably 
      expected that the golf course would be ready for play within 6 months of 
      the draw down of proceeds for membership.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
      [4] </span></a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He also commented as 
  follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…All the members felt secure that a safety net was provided. If the 260 
      membership level was not reached, they would receive the return of all their 
      documentation including their letter of credit.</p>
    <p>In the initial stages of soliciting memberships there was no reference 
      to R.J. Nicol or his companies purchasing any of the memberships to make 
      up a shortfall….</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It takes about three years to build a world-class golf course. Nicol 
  purchased the land necessary for construction in 1986. Construction costs for 
  the course itself were originally estimated at $6.5 million, the approximate

  some versions of the brochure indicated course construction would commence after 
  260 memberships were sold<i>, </i>layout began in the fall of 1987, and course 
  construction was completed by December 1990. The course opened for play on May

  </span> Nicol approached the Bank for financing in August 1988. They negotiated 
  a multiple-segment credit facility that Nicol accepted on March 23, 1989. Advances 
  to R.J. Nicol Homes commenced in May 1989. Part of the security for the credit 
  facility and indebtedness was an assignment to the Bank from R.J. Nicol Homes 
  of the letters of credit it held from the subscribing members. As a precondition 
  to financing, the Bank required that Nicol provide a legal opinion that in the 
  event of any shortfall in the 260-membership threshold he could purchase any 
  number of additional memberships to make up the deficiency. The credit facility 
  included a covenant that Nicol would purchase any shortfall in memberships.

  </span> A further condition of the credit facility was that all regulatory approvals, 
  including zoning, be in place. Four holes of the golf course were located on 
  lands known as “the wetlands”, the remaining fourteen holes were on lands known 
  as “the uplands”. The municipality passed separate by-laws re-zoning each of 
  the uplands and the wetlands to accommodate the golf course, however both by-laws 
  were appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. The proceedings were protracted 
  and highly publicized. Membership sales stalled as a result.</p>

  </span> The O.M.B. released its decision on August 29, 1990 dismissing the appeal 
  with respect to the uplands by-law but granting the appeal against the wetlands 
  by-law. At about the same time as the release of the decision, Nicol obtained 
  a legal opinion that the golf course would be a legal non-conforming use in 
  the wetland area and that rezoning was not therefore required. </p>

  </span> As of December 1990, the municipality had not indicated one way or the 
  other whether it would accept the opinion that the wetlands constituted a legal 
  non-conforming use. Nevertheless, as the golf course was by then fully constructed 
  and the legal opinion was in hand, the Board of Governors of Eagle Creek Golf 
  Course determined the golf course would be ready for play six months from December 
  31, 1990, the deadline for draw down of the letters of credit.</p>

  </span> During December 1990, there was extensive communication between R.J. 
  Nicol Homes, the Bank, and their respective lawyers concerning how many memberships 
  would have to be purchased to satisfy the 260-membership threshold. The general 
  manager of the golf club obtained legal advice to the effect that an accepted 
  application for membership constituted a “sold” membership unless or until the 
  member failed to make payment on or before December 31, 1990. Ultimately R.J. 
  Nicol Homes purchased a total of 81 memberships in December 1990 based on a 
  membership count that included 11 memberships for which applications, but no 
  monies, promissory note, or letter of credit, had been received; and three memberships 
  issued to persons based on services rendered to Nicol, Nicol companies, or the 
  golf club. </p>

  </span> R.J. Nicol Homes verified that the eleven memberships remained unpaid 
  by mid-January 1991. It made arrangements subsequently for the purchase of those 
  memberships. A resolution of the Board of Governors of the golf course dated 
  April 3, 1991 confirmed the eleven “members” whose memberships remained unpaid 
  were “expelled from the Corporation and permanently suspended from the privileges 
  of membership…” and that the transfer of memberships from the named persons 
  to R.J. Nicol Homes was approved. </p>

  in December 1990 seeking an injunction to restrain Nicol Homes from drawing 
  on the letters of credit. An interim injunction was issued on December 11, 1990. 
  It was subsequently dissolved on December 14, 1990 based on minutes of settlement 
  that provided for disclosure of a list of non-resident paid-up members as of 
  December 30, 1990 by January 15, 1991, production of the legal non-conforming 
  use opinion, and particulars of any pending or contemplated proceedings concerning

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found R.J. Nicol Homes was not entitled to draw on the 
  letters of credit in December of 1990 as it had failed to meet the two conditions 
  for draw down. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the trial judge determined that membership sales were 14 short 
  of the 260 membership threshold as of December 31, 1990. He found an application 
  for membership could only be considered as accepted if the necessary monies, 
  letter of credit, or promissory note accompanied the application. The eleven 
  memberships that remained unpaid as of January 15, 1991 and the three memberships 
  issued based on services rendered did not meet this criteria. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, he found the Board of Governors was not in a position to certify 
  that it reasonably expected the golf course would be ready for play within six 
  months of December 31, 1990. He relied on the fact that concerns were being 
  raised as to the validity of the legal opinion that use of the wetlands for 
  purposes of a golf course would constitute a legal non-conforming use and the 
  absence of evidence to establish that the contingency plan for building the 
  remaining four holes on adjacent lands would also fulfill the requirement of 
  a world class golf course.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also found R.J. Nicol Homes owed a fiduciary duty to 
  the investors as it was holding the letters of credit in trust for the investors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As a result of these findings, the trial judge held R.J. Nicol Homes 
  was in breach of its contractual obligations and its fiduciary duty to the investors 
  when it drew down the letters of credit in December 1990. Because the conditions 
  for draw down had not been met, the investors were entitled to a return of the 
  monies they had paid or letters of credit they had deposited in accordance with 
  the terms of the contract. As R.J. Nicol Homes held the letters of credit in 
  trust for the investors and drew on them when it was not entitled to, it remained 
  a trustee of the funds drawn, and the investors were entitled to an order for 
  restitution against it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the Royal Bank, the trial judge found the plaintiffs were entitled 
  to restitutionary relief against it based on the doctrine of knowing receipt. 
  The Royal Bank knew the letters of credit were subject to the described conditions. 
  When it received the funds and applied them against the golf club loan, its 
  position was enhanced at the expense of the investors. The Royal Bank relied 
  on statements from the golf club manager and R.J. Nicol as to the membership 
  count knowing it should not have relied upon either of them. It also relied 
  on the legal non-conforming use opinion knowing its own solicitors had concerns 
  about the opinion and that the zoning issues were controversial, and chose not 
  to inquire further. The trial judge found the Royal Bank did not act prudently 
  as it did not want to receive any advice or legal opinion that “would impede 
  the call down of the letters of credit and impede the eventual transfer of funds 
  to the bank.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge declined to award punitive damages against R.J. Nicol 
  Homes for breach of contract. He found it achieved its goal of creating a first 
  class golf course and that its conduct had not amounted to a wanton and reckless 
  disregard for the contractual rights of the investors. He did however find that 
  in breaching its fiduciary duty the principals of the company showed contempt 
  for the investors’ interests. The trial judge accordingly awarded damages for 
  breach of fiduciary duty against R.J. Nicol Homes in the amount of $5,000.00 
  per investor. He dismissed a claim for punitive damages against the Royal Bank 
  on the basis that although they made a business decision to assist R.J. Nicol 
  Homes in the draw down of the letters of credit and thereby looked to their 
  own interests and those of their customer, they did not do so for the purpose 
  of harming the investors. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge dismissed a claim for return of the profit the Royal 
  Bank had made on the investors’ money since 1990 on the basis that while the 
  bank may have earned considerable profits in the intervening years, it had also 
  lost a considerable amount of money on this transaction. The trial judge did 
  however award compound interest against R.J. Nicol Homes and the Royal Bank 
  on the basis that where there has been a wrongful detention of money, it is 
  reasonable to assume that the wrongdoer has made the most beneficial use of 
  the money and should therefore compensate the persons whose money has been detained 
  accordingly.</p>

  </span> Membership records filed at trial identified the eleven membership certificate 
  numbers subsequently purchased by R.J. Nicol Homes due to default in payment 
  of the original subscription price. All reflected an original application for 
  membership by a specified person, a certificate number, the dates of powers 
  of attorney and promissory notes filed with the application,<i> and the date 
  of acceptance by the Board of Governors and confirmation of recording in the 
  Members’ Register.</i> Minutes of the Board of Governors reflect that the original 
  applications were approved on August 11, 1990 and that the named applicants 
  were “enrolled as members of the Corporation”. Subsequent minutes dated April 
  11, 1991 reflect the expulsion of the eleven defaulters and approval of the 
  transfer of memberships to R.J. Nicol Homes. </p>

  He said he asked for and received specific legal advice to that effect.</p>

'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants also rely on the fact that R.J. Nicol Homes purchased 
  memberships by way of offset of the monies owed to it by Eagle Creek Golf Club 
  for construction of the club. As of December 31, 1990, more than $2.7 million 
  remained owing to R.J. Nicol Homes after giving credit for the full proceeds 
  of 260 memberships. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree. The trial judge specifically relied on the provisions of 
  the by-laws and brochures to conclude that in order to qualify as a “sold membership” 
  within the meaning of the threshold condition, an application for membership 
  had to be accompanied by payment of the membership price, either in cash or 
  by way of promissory note supported by a letter of credit. He found that the 
  golf club manager had acknowledged in cross-examination that “a membership sale 
  was completed when they had the money in hand”. He determined that neither the 
  eleven defaulted memberships nor the three memberships paid for in kind complied 
  with the requirements for a “sold membership”. In my view, there was ample evidence 
  to support his finding. I do not consider the membership records compiled at 
  the behest of the Nicol-controlled Board of Governors to be determinative of 
  this pivotal issue. The fact that R.J. Nicol Homes may have made an accounting 
  entry to reflect an offset against monies owed to it by the golf club equivalent 
  to the value of 260 memberships does not change the fact that eleven applications 
  for membership were in default as of December 31, 1990 and three applications 
  for membership were not accompanied by payment as required. </p>

  on the letters of credit whether the conditions were met or not. He further 
  found there were legitimate concerns about the validity of the non-conforming 
  use opinion R.J. Nicol Homes had obtained concerning the four wetland holes 
  as of December 31, 1990 and that those concerns jeopardized the viability of 
  the project as a world class golf course. The trial judge was entitled to make 
  those findings and he was correct to assess the issue from the perspective of 
  the December date. The fact that the municipality ultimately accepted the validity 
  of the non-conforming use opinion in the spring of 1991 does not make it a reasonable 
  expectation as of December 31, 1990 that that would occur.</p>

  on the funds paid to secure memberships in circumstances where the conditions 
  for doing so had not been met and could no longer be met. R.J. Nicol Homes was

  the golf course readiness condition was met and as a basis for imposing liability 
  for any breach of the draw down conditions. They say that that language was 
  intended simply to ensure the monies were kept separate from other assets of 
  R.J. Nicol Homes pending its entitlement to receive the proceeds on behalf of 
  the golf club. Once R.J. Nicol Homes was contractually entitled to receive the 
  proceeds, there could be no breach of this ‘trust’. Use of ‘trust’ language 
  did not superimpose any additional obligations on R.J. Nicol Homes in terms 
  of its legal obligations to the payors. As there was no breach of contract, 
  there can be no breach of trust.</p>

  their obligations to ensure the conditions for draw down were met prior to draw

  </span> The trial judge made the following findings on this issue at pp. 77-78 
  of his Reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In reviewing Nicol’s conduct relating to his breach of fiduciary duty to 
      the investors it has to be established that he was motivated by his own 
      self-interest and purposefully disregarded the interest of the investors.</p>
    <p>MacLachlin J. in <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226 considered 
      the type of conduct required in a breach of fiduciary duty to attach punitive 
      damages. At p. 299, she adopted a statement from <i>Fiduciary Duties in 
      Canada</i> (Richard DeBoo 1988):</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Where the actions of the fiduciary are purposefully repugnant to the 
          beneficiary’s best interests, punitive damages are a logical award to 
          be made by the Court. This award will be particularly applicable where 
          the impugned activity is motivated by the fiduciary’s self-interest.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The fact all investors are members of a class action does not prohibit 
      the awarding of punitive damages…. In this case, each individual member 
      of the class had a contractual relationship to R.J. Nicol Homes Limited. 
      The breach of fiduciary duty related to each individual investor.</p>
    <p>In this case, Nicol totally disregarded the interest of the investors to 
      whom he owed a duty. I have already referred to comments attributed to both 
      R.J. Nicol and Pat Nicol which showed their contempt for the investors’ 
      interest.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>  
      In my view that conduct would attract an award of punitive damages.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> R.J. Nicol Homes says the Reasons of the trial judge are internally 
  inconsistent. It relies on the fact that he made findings to the effect that 
  there were intervening causes, such as environmental and zoning problems, over 
  which the Nicols’ had no control, that led to the failure of the equity golf 
  club. It also says the representative plaintiffs were aware of the fact that 
  the Nicols’ conduct was dedicated to maintaining the viability of the project 
  by ensuring that funding continued, and that the investors, through the representative 
  plaintiffs, once apprised of such conduct, fully acquiesced to it, either expressly 
  or by implication. Finally, R.J. Nicol Homes says the trial judge erred by assessing 
  punitive damages in the amount of $5,000 to each of the plaintiffs, without 
  differentiating among the subclasses. </p>

  impressed with a statutory trust in favour of the insured. The bank applied 
  those monies towards the insurer’s overdraft and therefore increased its own 
  profits with no concomitant benefit to the insured. The Royal Bank says that 
  the distinguishing feature between this case and <i>Citadel</i>, and most<i> 
  </i>other knowing receipt cases, is that in <i>Citadel </i>the recipient of 
  the trust proceeds had not provided a benefit to the beneficiary of the trust. 
  The Royal Bank says it provided a direct benefit to the beneficiaries of the 
  trust in this case by advancing the capital necessary to build the golf course. 
  It had done so on the specific understanding that the proceeds of membership 
  sales would be available to make loan payments and that R.J. Nicol Homes would 
  make up any deficiency in membership sales so that the threshold membership 
  condition would be met.</p>

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Royal Bank failed to make additional inquiries relating to 
  the satisfaction of the condition although it knew it should not rely on R.J. 
  Nicol Homes for the membership count information and although it knew there 
  were questions about the legal non-conforming use opinion. The Royal Bank did

  </span> Having regard to these findings, the fact that the Royal Bank may have 
  provided a benefit to the investors by funding golf course construction is of 
  minimal significance to the determination of whether it was unjustly enriched. 
  The Royal Bank proceeded with advances based at least in part on the security 
  of the letters of credit at a time when there was no doubt that the conditions 
  for drawn down of the letters of credit had not been met. It subsequently restricted 
  its advances in a way that impeded satisfaction of the threshold membership 
  condition. The trial judge found that the conditions for draw down were never 
  met, that the Royal Bank was therefore never entitled to receive the proceeds 
  it applied, ultimately, to minimize its own losses, and that it failed to make 
  adequate inquiries when it received the funds. He found, in effect, that the 
  Royal Bank had been unjustly enriched.</p>

  language in terms of the Royal Bank failing to make <i>any</i> inquiries. It 
  is clear from his Reasons that he was aware the Royal Bank had information from 
  its customer and that his finding was that it failed to make <i>additional</i> 
  inquiries when it had been alerted they were necessary. Having regard to the

  firm. In <i>Stacey Heating &amp; Plumbing Supplies </i>this court said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Because the origin of this litigation lay in the conduct of the proceedings 
      by the third party on behalf of the defendants, who were his clients, we 
      think it fair and just in the circumstances that, as between them, the burden 
      of bearing these costs should rest with the third party, and we direct that, 
      to the extent that the defendants do not recover the costs from the plaintiff, 
      they are entitled to be indemnified for such costs by the third party and 
      to recover such costs against him.</p>

  </span> I find no merit in this submission. In <i>Stacey Heating &amp; Plumbing 
  Supplies</i> there was a direct causal link between the failure of counsel to 
  obtain leave to discontinue foreclosure proceedings before causing his client 
  [the defendant] to exercise power of sale proceedings, and the subject litigation. 
  No such causal link has been established here.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Royal Bank also requested that the finding of the trial judge that 
  there is “no evidence of negligence” by Solway, Wright be set aside on the basis 
  that it is demonstrably wrong, overly broad, and potentially prejudicial to 
  another action pending before the court. In my view, this court should not entertain 
  this request. The appeal before us is from the judgment, not the reasons of 
  the trial judge. No such finding appears in the judgment, nor is it integral 
  to any of the grounds of appeal before us.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Internal Inconsistencies 
  and Errors in Credibility Findings</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Royal Bank claims that the Reasons for Judgment are replete with 
  internal inconsistencies, that they rely on questionable and unprincipled findings 
  of credibility, and that the underlying logic of the conclusions is not apparent. 
  It says that in the event the findings of liability against it are not reversed 
  based on the foregoing grounds of appeal, a new trial is required on the basis 
  of these grounds.<span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I find no merit in these submissions. The Royal Bank lists seven examples 
  of what it says are internally inconsistent findings. Examined fairly, and in 
  context, all of the impugned findings are reconcilable.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span> 
  [10] </span></a>  As for the assessment of credibility, in my view the trial 
  judge did no more than exercise his prerogative as the trier of fact to accept 
  all, some, or none of the evidence of various witnesses. It is not surprising 
  in a case of this magnitude that he did not address every piece of evidence 
  in making his findings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In its last point under this heading the Royal Bank submits that the 
  Reasons of the trial judge are not an adequate basis to uphold his conclusions 
  as they fail to disclose the logic that informs them. It also relies on the 
  fact that the trial judge made many observations sympathetic to the plaintiffs’ 
  position from which he failed to draw legal conclusions and based on which he 
  failed to consider the potential liability of the third party law firm to the 
  Royal Bank.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The ‘observations’ in question relate to several alternate theories 
  of liability advanced at trial. For example, the trial judge made comments to 
  the effect that R.J. Nicol Homes’ purchase of memberships was not in accordance 
  with the plaintiffs’ understanding of the transaction; the alternate theory 
  of liability being Nicol was not entitled to satisfy the membership threshold 
  condition b purchasing the shortfall in memberships. Though obviously cognizant 
  of the broader basis advanced for liability, the trial judge stopped short of 
  accepting it. It is implicit, if not explicit, in the Reasons that he was not 
  persuaded it was justified. He was not required to go further. I find no merits 
  in these submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Award of Costs in Favour 
  of the Plaintiffs</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Royal Bank says the trial judge erred in awarding costs against 
  it in favour of the investors because the investors made, and failed to prove, 
  an allegation that the Royal Bank had conspired with Nicol in a fraudulent scheme 
  to harm them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found that the allegation of a fraudulent conspiracy, 
  though pleaded, was not pursued at trial.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span> 
  [11] </span></a>  While it is apparent that he adverted to the issue in his 
  Reasons,<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span> [12] </span></a> it is clear that he did not 
  consider it an issue that consumed any time during the course of this lengthy 
  trial. The trial judge made clear it would have been preferable that the allegation 
  be withdrawn prior to the commencement of trial, but declined to deprive the 
  respondents of their costs for that reason. I see no reason to interfere with 
  the exercise of his discretion in this respect. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Failure to Deliberate on 
  the Counterclaim</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In light of my findings concerning the other grounds of appeal, it is 
  unnecessary that I deal with this ground which could only succeed had the appellants 
  succeeded on appeal.</p>

<div id=ftn3> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref3"
name="_ftn3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> Versions  4 and 5 of the brochure 
    filed at tab 291 of exhibit 65 and tab 5 of exhibit 2 respectively do not 
    appear to contain this condition. This is not a matter that was raised on 
    appeal and the specific finding that this condition was common to all brochures 
    was not challenged. It may be noteworthy that it would appear that this was 
    also a common oral representation. It may also be noteworthy that version 
    4 of the brochure, marked on its face as ‘edition #3’, recited the fact that 
    the first and second series of memberships, selling for $20,000 and $25,000 
    respectively, were sold out and that the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth series 
    of memberships would sell at $28,000, $29,000, $32,000, and $35,000 respectively. 
    Version 5 of the brochure, marked on its face as ‘current version’, stipulated 
    that the first, second, and third series of memberships had been sold out. 
    Version 1 of the brochure indicated that memberships 1 to 125 would be sold 
    for $20,000 each, memberships 126 to 200 would be sold for $25,000 each, memberships 
    201 to 250 would be sold for $27,500 each and that memberships 251 to 300 
    would be sold for $30,000 each. Subsequent versions of the brochure indicated 
    that each series of memberships would consist of a number determined by the 
    Board of Governors. It appears that R.J. Nicol Homes purchased memberships 
    181 to 261. It also appears that the bulk of memberships sold to persons other 
    than R.J. Nicol Homes were sold for $20,000 or $25,000. However, according 
    to exhibit 35, fourteen of such memberships were sold for $28,000. Finally, 
    it may also be noteworthy that at p. 2 of its written submissions to the trial 
    judge the Royal Bank apparently stated: “However, the only two provisions 
    of the brochure which related specifically to the draw down of the LCs were 
    identical in all versions of the brochure…”  Condition i) was then quoted.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn4> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref4"
name="_ftn4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a> The precise wording of this condition 
    as set out in the Brochures is: “The note will be demanded and the letter 
    of credit drawn upon not earlier than 6 months before the date the Board of 
    Governors of the Club reasonably expects the golf course to open.” This wording 
    is included in versions 1,2, 3, and 4 of the brochure.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn5> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref5"
name="_ftn5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a> For example, at p. 32 of his Reasons 
    the trial judge noted that the investors were never informed that R.J. Nicol 
    had agreed with the Royal Bank to purchase the shortfall of any memberships 
    required to reach the threshold of 260. Even  though many of  the investors, 
    subsequently learned about the eventual purchase, they had not been informed 
    it was Nicol’s  intent from the outset. At p. 43, the trial judge referred 
    to the fact that R.J. Nicol had informed a representative of the Royal Bank 
    that he planned to draw down on the letters of credit whether the conditions 
    were met or not.</p>

    on this submission: While finding that Nicol Homes was at fault for failing 
    to properly satisfy the Readiness Condition (i.e. reasonable expectation that 
    the Course would open within six months of draw down), [the trial judge] also 
    finds that “the Board of Governors in their mind could meet the condition”. 
    The latter statement is a narrative comment made by the trial judge at page 
    42 of his Reasons. He clearly intended it as the precursor to his analysis 
    and not as representative of his ultimate view.</p>
