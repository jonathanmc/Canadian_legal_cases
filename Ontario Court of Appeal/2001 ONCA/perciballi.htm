    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Two further issues were raised. The first relates

    Pelliccione and Perciballi. I would allow Angelo Portante’s appeal against 
    sentence only to the extent of reducing the term of imprisonment to reflect 
    the time he spent in pre-trial custody. I would dismiss Perciballi’s appeal

    of the facts of this case in his reasons for sentencing as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-GB>The jury has convicted four men for their roles in the $3.1 million 
        robbery of a Loomis armed truck.  . . .  On August 31<sup>st</sup>, 1995, 
        about ten minutes before midnight, the truck containing the money was 
        parked in front of a Bank of Nova Scotia branch in an industrial area 
        in the North end of 13 Division, one of the police divisions of Metropolitan 
        Toronto.  The driver who was unarmed, was waiting for two co-workers who 
        were inside the branch.  A man dressed as a police officer approached, 
        making gestures suggesting there was something wrong.  When the driver 
        opened the door, the man forced him out of the truck at gunpoint, jumped 
        behind the wheel and started to drive away.  As he did so, the other two 
        Loomis employees emerged from the bank.  They saw what was happening and 
        drew their guns.  Fortunately, no shots were fired and no one was hurt.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB>Just minutes before the robbery two false emergency calls had been 
      made to the police.  The first caller said, and I quote, &quot;There's a 
      big brawl behind Kelsey's, there's, like, 50, 40 black people and they're 
      fighting.  They got baseball bats and I probably saw a gun.&quot;  In response 
      to a question by the police officer, the caller again confirmed that one 
      of the persons had a gun.  The fight location was at the opposite end of 
      the police division from the robbery scene.  </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB>The second call, which came two minutes later, reported that two police 
      officers with guns drawn were chasing two black males and needed assistance 
      at the same location.  </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      These calls achieved their intended purpose of diverting police far away 
      from the robbery scene.  Indeed, as the robbery was unfolding, at least 
      four police cruisers were speeding to the south end of 13 Division, away 
      from the crime scene to the location of the falsely reported near riot to 
      help fellow police officers in trouble.  When they got there they found 
      nothing.  One can imagine what might have happened if persons matching the 
      descriptions given by the callers had been found in the area.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      With the police focus and resources successfully diverted from the crime 
      scene, the Loomis truck was driven to a predetermined nearby location.  
      Within minutes, the money was transferred to a waiting van by two accomplices, 
      then driven away to its destination in Woodbridge.       . . .</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      The masterminds of the crime were Angelo Portante and Piero Perciballi.  
      Both men were in positions of trust.  Angelo Portante was himself a Loomis 
      guard.  He was also a former auxiliary police officer and he owned his own 
      security company.  His friend, Piero Perciballi, was and is a Metropolitan 
      Police constable.  Together these two men conceived, planned, set in motion 
      and supervised the execution of this robbery every step of the way.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      Andre Pelliccione impersonated the police officer, forced the driver out 
      of the van at gun point and drove it to the nearby exchange point.  He was 
      not involved in the planning of the robbery and was not in a position of 
      trust….</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB><br>
      Antonio Portante is the younger brother of one of the two masterminds.  
      He was by far the least involved in this crime.  He made one of the two 
      diversionary phone calls.  He was not involved in the planning.  He did 
      not profit financially from the crime.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown’s case was based primarily on the 
    evidence of three unindicted accomplices, Sam DeFrancesca, Danny Zeoli, and 
    Marc Leggieri, who testified in exchange for a grant of immunity. Also playing 
    a major role in the case against the appellants was modern cellular phone 
    technology. A series of cellular phone calls were made among the appellants 
    on the night of the robbery. Cellular phone &quot;towers&quot; located around 
    the Greater Toronto Area are capable of tracing the movements of cellular 
    phone subscribers.  In this case, the cellular phone records placed all the 
    appellants within the vicinity of the robbery immediately before, during and 
    after its commission, and established that they were constantly in touch with 
    one another that evening. The admissibility of these records is not contested.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It was not disputed at trial that Angelo Portante 
    and Perciballi were involved in the theft of money from the Loomis truck on 
    August 31, 1995. All accused argued at trial that if they were guilty of a 
    crime it was theft, not robbery, because the crime was an “inside job”. It 
    was alleged by the defence that the Crown witness, Graeme Finnell, who was 
    the driver of the Loomis truck on the night in question, was an “insider” 
    and a party to the plan. The Crown maintained, however, that Finnell was indeed 
    robbed at gunpoint. In addition, counsel for Angelo Portante suggested at 
    trial that his involvement was under duress. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The involvement of the main participants Angelo 
    Portante and Piero Perciballi in the crime is no longer an issue on this appeal.  
    Angelo Portante maintains, however, that his conviction should be set aside 
    because it was based in part on wiretap interceptions obtained unlawfully. 
    Perciballi does not appeal his conviction. Indeed, he admits in his factum 
    that:</span></p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-GB>6. …   [T]he Appellant oversaw the robbery as it occurred.  He was 
      involved in the planning and recruiting as well and was responsible for 
      the diversionary tactics as well as the police uniform and involved in the 
      distribution of money.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>What was primarily at issue in the trial was 
    the identification of Pelliccione and Antonio Portante as participants in 
    the robbery.  Pelliccione’s defence at trial was that he was not involved 
    in the crime and that it was a case of mistaken identity. He argues on appeal 
    that his conviction is unsafe as it was based in part on wiretap evidence 
    obtained unlawfully and hearsay evidence and because of certain prejudicial 
    references made by Crown counsel in his closing address.</span></p>

    made one of the two telephone calls to the police to divert patrolling officers 
    away from the location of the robbery. One of the unindicted accomplices, 
    DeFrancesca, testified that he made just one of the calls. It was the defence’s 
    theory at trial that DeFrancesca had made both calls. The Crown relied on 
    DeFrancesca’s testmony in support of its theory that Antonio Portante had 
    made one of the calls, as well as other circumstantial evidence implicating 
    the appellant. Antonio Portante maintains that his conviction should be overturned 
    because it is based in part on inadmissible hearsay. He submits further that 
    the verdict was unreasonable. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I do not find it necessary to describe in detail 
    the nature of the wiretap evidence in order to dispose of this ground of appeal.  
    Suffice it to say that the appellants acknowledge that the wiretap evidence 
    solidified the case against Angelo Portante and that it was heavily relied 
    upon in the Crown’s case against Pellicione. The appellants also state that 
    the wiretap evidence was a key factor that enabled the police to obtain the 
    cooperation of the accomplice witnesses.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Angelo Portante submits that the authorization 
    to intercept private communications was invalid on the ground of bias and 
    that, consequently, the trial judge erred in failing to exclude the wiretap 
    evidence obtained pursuant to it. He concedes that the material placed before 
    the authorizing justice, Hamilton J., supported the granting of the authorization. 
    This concession was also made at trial. The basis for challenging the admission 
    of the evidence is the fact that the authorizing justice also presided over 
    an unsuccessful bail review brought on behalf of Angelo Portante some five 
    weeks earlier. It is submitted that these circumstances gave rise to a reasonable 
    apprehension of bias.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Although the appellant concedes that the issues 
    on a bail review and on an application for authorization are different, he 
    submits that the proceedings share a common predicate – they both encompass 
    as a central factor the strength of the evidence in support of the Crown’s 
    case. Because Hamilton J. had already expressed his legal opinion on this 
    issue at the bail review, it is submitted that “[a]n appearance that the authorizing 
    justice had prejudged the wiretap application was inescapable”. The appellant 
    further submits that Hamilton J. had heard “prejudicial evidence” on the bail 
    review that was not part of the authorization package and that he had made 
    “strong comments” about the strength of the case in his reasons for dismissing 
    the bail review. </span></p>

    application. In a brief ruling, he noted firstly that, based on the material 
    before the authorizing justice, “granting the authorization was the only conclusion 
    that a Judge acting judicially could have arrived at.” He held further that 
    the evidence satisfied him that the authorizing justice “acted appropriately, 
    responsibly and fairly in all the circumstances”. </span></p>

    bias is on the person who alleges it. The Supreme Court of Canada recently 
    affirmed the test for finding a reasonable apprehension of bias in <i>R. v. 
    S.(R.D.)</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at para.&nbsp;111 (S.C.C.).  Cory&nbsp;J.,

        in <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Board)</i>, 
        [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at p.&nbsp;394, 68 D.L.R. (3d) 716:</span></p>

          and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining 
          thereon the required information. … [The] test is “what would an informed 
          person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having 
          thought the matter through – conclude.”</span></p>

    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>This test has been adopted and applied for the past two decades.  It 
      contains a two-fold objective element: the person considering the alleged 
      bias must be reasonable, and the apprehension of bias itself must also be 
      reasonable in the circumstances of the case.  See <i>Bertram</i>, <i>supra</i>, 
      at pp.&nbsp;54-55; <i>Gushman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.&nbsp;31.  Further 
      the reasonable person must be an <i>informed</i> person, with knowledge 
      of all the relevant circumstances, including “the traditions of integrity 
      and impartiality that form a part of the background and apprised also of 
      the fact that impartiality is one of the duties the judges swear to uphold”:

    that “[t]his is one of the reasons why the threshold for a successful allegation 
    of perceived juridical bias is high. However, despite this high threshold,

    judge erred “in directing himself that because the correctness of the decision 
    to grant the authorization was not attacked by the appellants, no apprehension 
    of bias was present.” He submits that where a reasonable apprehension of bias 
    exists, it taints the judicial function and it cannot be cured by the correctness

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>While the appellant is correct in his latter 
    submission, I am not satisfied that the trial judge misapplied the test as 
    contended. His reasons were brief. His comment on the correctness of the authorizing 
    justice’s decision must be considered in context. The trial judge referred 
    to the appellants’ concession on the sufficiency of the material in support 
    of the authorization and then commented that, having reviewed the material 
    himself, he was of the view that any judge would have inevitably arrived at 
    the same conclusion. It should not be presumed from this observation that 
    he viewed the correctness of the decision as determinative of the issue. It 
    is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that he went on to consider the entire 
    circumstances before ruling that nothing improper had taken place and that 
    no apprehension of partiality could arise from the proceedings. It is this 
    conclusion that is subject to review by this court.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In my view, there is no reason to interfere 
    with the trial judge’s decision on this <i>Charter</i> application. The mere 
    prior involvement of the authorizing justice in an earlier proceeding does 
    not, without convincing evidence to the contrary, displace the presumption 
    of judicial integrity and impartiality. Hence, the bare allegation that Hamilton 
    J. heard “prejudicial evidence” on the bail review that did not form part 
    of the authorization package is meaningless. Trial judges routinely exclude 
    evidence that they have heard on a <i>voir dire</i>, or hear confessions or 
    guilty pleas by co-accused, and go on to preside over the trial of an accused.</span></p>

    of the decision that must be made on either application – the bail review 
    or the wiretap authorization – that gives rise to a reasonable apprehension 
    of bias where the same justice presides over both proceedings. Although it 
    is necessary in each proceeding to make an assessment of the evidence presented 
    by the prosecution, the tests are very different and their application does 
    not require any determinative findings on the guilt or innocence of an accused 
    person. The allegation of bias must be based, rather, on what actually transpired 
    during the specific proceedings. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In this respect, the appellant relies on “strong 
    comments” made by Hamilton J. in his reasons for denying bail to Angelo Portante. 
    These comments are described in the factum as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>            On October&nbsp;30, 1995, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Hamilton denied 
      Mr.&nbsp;Portante bail on his bail review.  In his ruling, he described 
      the robbery as “mammoth”, and referred to its “enormity”.  He noted that 
      there was a police uniform used in the robbery and that Angelo Portante 
      had worked as an auxiliary police officer.  He inferred that Mr.&nbsp;Portante 
      had access to the funds and was trying to launder money from the facts that 
      Mr.&nbsp;Portante had about $13,000 in his possession on his arrest and 
      that the Crown advised that Mr.&nbsp;Portante was trying to exchange $80,000 
      with an individual, with the possibility of more money to follow.  Hamilton&nbsp;J. 
      accepted that the family members who were the proposed sureties were law 
      abiding, hard-working people, but stated that if Mr.&nbsp;Portante were 
      indeed laundering money, then he must have “hoodwinked” them.  Referring 
      to the testimony of Detective Sergeant Wilson on the bail review to the 
      effect that Mr.&nbsp;Pelliccione was suspected of being a biker and that 
      Mr.&nbsp;Portante had wired him $1,000 in Montreal, Hamilton&nbsp;J. said 
      “I don’t practice in a vacuum.  Obviously, everyone has heard about the 
      biker problem in Montreal and what is going on there, and here is a connection 
      between this young man, $3,000,000, and money being sent to a biker in Montreal 
      who turns out to be his best man at Mr.&nbsp;Portante’s wedding.”</span></div>

    to ten years’ imprisonment. Counsel for Angelo Portante submits that the trial 
    judge erred in failing to differentiate between the two participants in two 
    respects. First, it is argued that the breach of public trust by Perciballi 
    as a police officer was more shocking than Angelo Portante’s breach of his 
    employer’s trust and that, consequently, Angelo Portante’s sentence should 
    have been lower than Perciballi’s. Second, it is submitted that a different 
    sentence should have been imposed on each accused to reflect the fact that 
    Angelo Portante spent more time in pre-trial custody than Perciballi.</span></p>

    was rejected by the trial judge. In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge 
    concluded that “in all the circumstances of this case there should be no difference 
    in the sentence imposed upon the two masterminds, Piero Perciballi and Angelo 
    Portante.” The trial judge elaborated on each appellant’s role in his reasons 
    for sentence and made it clear that, in his view, they were equal participants 
    deserving of the same punishment. His views on this issue were perhaps most 
    succinctly stated during the course of submissions of counsel when he stated:

    <div class=Section1><span

      particular knowledge and abilities to this plan.  They needed each other.  
      Angelo Portante knew the inside working of Loomis and your client, as a 
      police officer, knew how the police were likely to react and was in a position 
      to provide the police uniform and to give advice on how the police would 
      react to a robbery call, how to get away from the scene and avoid detection.  
      I infer that it was your client that came up with the idea of the diversionary 
      calls.  So to me any effort to distinguish their respective roles would 
      really not be very helpful I would think.</span></div>

    submission on pre-trial custody. Although Angelo Portante’s counsel urged 
    the trial judge to take into account his pre-trial custody, the trial judge 
    made no mention of it in his reasons for sentence. It is agreed that if Mr. 
    Portante were given credit for this pre-trial custody on the basis of the 
    often-used “two-for-one” practice, his sentence would have been reduced by 
    six months. This court inquired at the hearing whether Perciballi served any 
    pre-trial custody and was advised that he did for about one month. It is not

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The following principles set out in the case 
    law apply equally to either version.  The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. 
    v. Zelensky</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 940 held that a court’s power to make a compensation 
    order as part of the sentencing process is discretionary. This court in <i>R. 
    v. Devgan</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) set out in convenient form the 
    objectives and factors that come into play in the exercise of this discretion 
    and I find it useful to refer to this summary (at pp.&nbsp;168-69):</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>         In <i>Zelensky</i>, Laskin&nbsp;C.J.C. identified certain 
      objectives and factors that relate to the application of s.&nbsp;725(1).  
      These considerations have been expanded upon in subsequent cases.  Below, 
      I have consolidated these objectives and factors, all of which are relevant 
      to the issue of what constitutes a proper exercise of discretion for the 
      purpose of s.&nbsp;725(1):</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>1.      An order for compensation should be made with restraint and 
      caution.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>2.      The concept of compensation is essential to the sentencing 
      process:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(i)     it emphasizes the sanction imposed upon the offender;</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)    it makes the accused responsible for making restitution to 
      the victim;</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)  it prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)   it provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery 
      for the victim.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>3.      A sentencing judge should consider:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(i)     the purpose of the aggrieved person in invoking s.&nbsp;725(1);</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)    whether civil proceedings have been initiated and are being 
      pursued; and</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)  the means of the offender.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>4.      A compensation order should not be used as a substitute for 
      civil proceedings.  Parliament did not intend that compensation orders would 
      displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure full compensation to victims.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>5.      A compensation order is not the appropriate mechanism to unravel 
      involved commercial transactions.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>6.      A compensation order should not be granted when it would require 
      the criminal court to interpret written documents to determine the amount 
      of money sought through the order.  The loss should be capable of ready 
      calculation.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>7.      A compensation order should not be granted if the effect of 
      provincial legislation would have to be considered in order to determine 
      what order should be made.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>8.      Any serious contest on legal or factual issues should signal 
      a denial of recourse to an order.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>9.      Double recovery can be prevented by the jurisdiction of the 
      civil courts to require proper accounting of all sums recovered.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>10.    A compensation order may be appropriate where a related civil 
      judgment has been rendered unenforceable as a result of bankruptcy.</span></div>

    <div class=Section1><span

      It is in light of these considerations that an exercise of discretion under 
      s. 725(1) must be assessed.  None of these considerations by themselves 
      are determinative of whether a compensation order should be granted.  The 
      weight to be given to individual considerations will depend on the circumstances 
      of each case.  Nor is the preceding list intended to be exhaustive.  Indeed, 
      other relevant considerations may arise in future cases.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US><br>
      I appreciate that a reviewing court should not lightly interfere with the 
      exercise of discretion necessarily involved in imposing a sentence.  As 
      made clear by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Shropshire</i>, [1995] 
      4 S.C.R. 227, (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), the appropriate standard 
      of review in this context is one of reasonableness.  This court should therefore 
      only interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in granting  
      the compensation orders under s. 725(1) if the trial judge applied wrong 
      principles or if the sentence was excessive or inadequate: see, also, <i>R. 
      v. M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In considering those principles, I see no reason 
    to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that “there is simply no principled 
    basis to refuse the order sought by the Crown” in the case of either Angelo 
    Portante or Perciballi. The arguments made by the appellants are unconvincing. 
    I will address each in turn. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The term of imprisonment imposed on each accused 
    was not “extremely severe” as contended, thereby rendering the total sentence, 
    including the compensation order, unfit. The sentence remains within the appropriate 
    range and is not subject to appellate review on this basis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The submission that the trial judge failed 
    to consider the appellants’ ability to pay is unfounded. The record reveals 
    that submissions were made on this point and therefore the trial judge was 
    well aware of their personal circumstances.  This court should not presume 
    that the trial judge failed to take this factor into account simply because 
    no express mention is made about it in his reasons. An ability to pay is only 
    one of many factors to be considered in the exercise of the discretion. It 
    is not a precondition for the making of the order. Furthermore, the appellants’ 
    plea in this respect sounds hollow considering that much of the money remained 
    unaccounted for at the end of the trial and that neither appellant offered 
    any explanation on its whereabouts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It is also argued that the order is simply 
    “crushing”.  In my view, the “crushing” amount of the order is merely a reflection 
    of the gravity of the offence and, in the circumstances of this case, where 
    a loss of this magnitude was both foreseen and planned, the order creates 
    no unfairness.  Counsel for each appellant concedes that, following the conviction, 
    a civil judgment in the same amount could have been obtained by Loomis without 
    difficulty. There is no principled basis to force the victim into bringing 
    a civil action where liability is clear and the amount readily ascertainable. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Finally, the assignment of the full value of 
    the loss to both appellants jointly and severally creates no unfairness, as 
    contended. It is entirely appropriate where the loss results from a joint 
    venture. See <i>R. v. Gaudet</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 17 (Ont. C.A.) and 
    <i>R. v. Gagnon</i>, a decision of this court released September 15, 2000. 
    The case relied on by the appellant, <i>R v. Biegus </i>(1999), 141 C.C.C. 
    (3d) 245 (Ont. C. A.) presented unusual features and can be distinguished 
    from the present case. In <i>Biegus</i> the orders were made in separate proceedings 
    against several co-perpetrators.  The appellant had not participated in all 
    of the thefts that were the basis of the compensation orders, and there was 
    evidence regarding the division of the money and what had become of the appellants’ 
    share of the money. The court was of the view that the effect of the orders 
    in <i>Biegus</i> created a potential unfairness to the accused and an unclear 
    legal situation. As stated earlier, there is no unfairness in this case, and 
    no confusion as to the legal effect of the order. The only source of confusion 
    in this case is the manner in which the appellants distributed the proceeds 
    of their crime.  It is of no concern to the court in making the order.</span></p>

    stated, I would dismiss his appeal against sentence. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As stated in the trial judge’s summary of the 
    facts, Pelliccione impersonated a police officer, forced the driver of the 
    Loomis van out at gun point and drove it to the nearby exchange point. He 
    was not otherwise involved in the planning of the robbery. His defence at 
    trial was that he was not involved in the crime and that it was a case of 
    mistaken identity. The defence suggested that the actual culprit may well 
    have been the accomplice witness Marc Leggieri. Leggieri had initially agreed 
    to be the police impersonator/gunman but he had then backed out. The case 
    against Pelliccione rested mainly on the evidence of Leggieri who knew Pelliccione 
    and recognized him as the impostor police officer just before the robbery 
    was committed, the identification evidence of the driver of the Loomis van, 
    and the wiretap evidence. There was also evidence that Pelliccione had been 
    the “best man” at Angelo Portante’s wedding and that the impostor policeman 
    at the robbery was Angelo’s best man. The evidence linking the best man to 
    the robbery forms the subject-matter of one of the grounds of appeal and it 
    will be described in greater detail later in these reasons. Pelliccione appeals 
    only against conviction and raises three grounds of appeal. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It was not in dispute at trial that Pelliccione 
    was Angelo’s best man at his wedding. Crown counsel in her factum notes three 
    witnesses who made reference in the course of their testimony to Angelo’s 
    best man – Angelo Coiro, Sam Pollari and Antonio Bandiera. Coiro testified 
    that he met Pelliccione at a barbecue at Angelo Portante’s residence in early 
    to mid-June 1995, some two and a half months before the robbery, and on that 
    occasion, either Angelo Portante or Pelliccione himself told him that Pelliccione 
    had been the best man at Portante’s wedding. Pollari testified that he knew 
    both men and that Pelliccione was Angelo’s best man at his wedding. Bandiera 
    testified that he recalled Tony [Portante] receiving calls from Angelo’s best 
    man who was in Montreal.  The link to the robbery came from the testimony 
    of one of the accomplices, Danny Zeoli. </span> </p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Zeoli testified that, some time before the 
    robbery and after Leggieri backed out as the gunman, he was told by Perciballi 
    that they had found someone else to take over the role of gunman, that the 
    person was coming in from Italy and that he was Angelo’s best man. In cross-examination, 
    the timing of this conversation was explored further.  At one point, Zeoli 
    elaborated and said that he was told that the new gunman was going to return 
    to Italy the night of the robbery which supports the fact that the statement 
    was made before the robbery. Also in cross-examination, he stated that he 
    had been told this a couple of days or so before the robbery, but then he 
    ended his evidence on this point by agreeing with the suggestion that he did 
    not know where or when the statement occurred. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant does not dispute that Perciballi’s 
    statement to Zeoli could be used as evidence against him if it was made in 
    furtherance of the conspiracy. The evidence would be admissible pursuant to 
    the well-established co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule whereby 
    the acts and declarations of alleged co-conspirators made in furtherance of 
    the conspiracy are admissible against an accused. However, the appellant submits 
    that it is not clear from Zeoli’s cross-examination whether this conversation 
    took place before or after the robbery. If Perciballi’s statement to Zeoli 
    was made after the robbery, it would not have been made in furtherance of 
    the conspiracy and would only be admissible against its maker. The appellant 
    Pelliccione therefore takes the position that it was incumbent upon the trial 
    judge to instruct the jury accordingly and that his failure to do so constitutes 
    a reversible error. He also submits that, if this instruction had been given 
    to the jury, it could have potentially applied to other evidence in the trial 
    which would have had to be excluded. He notes for example Coiro’s evidence 
    that Pelliccione was in fact best man at Angelo Portante’s wedding may have 
    been itself hearsay as Coiro testified that this statement came from either 
    Pelliccione <i>or from Angelo Portante. </i>If the jury found that the statement 
    came from Angelo Portante and it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy, 
    it would only have been admissible against its maker. </span></p>

    the parameters of the <i>Koufis/Carter</i> charge in the present case and 
    specifically what statements counsel thought would be encompassed by  the 
    co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule. During the pre-charge conference, 
    all parties agreed that it may be preferable to determine which items of evidence 
    might attract this type of charge and deal with them individually rather than 
    having a global <i>Carter</i> instruction. The statement to Zeoli was specifically 
    discussed. Crown counsel was of the view that a <i>Koufis</i> instruction 
    was required with respect to this statement but counsel for Pelliccione was 
    strenuously opposed to the suggestion. Defence counsel appeared to be mainly 
    concerned by the fact that this was one of the very few statements made in 
    the trial that may have attracted such an instruction and he did not wish 
    to highlight the evidence in such a manner.  Further, counsel for Pelliccione 
    was of the view that the statement was simply &quot;narrative&quot; and not

    was to assess how the matter was dealt with by counsel in their addresses, 
    and then make a decision regarding the context of the charge on this aspect 
    of the evidence. Crown counsel in his address relied upon Zeoli’s evidence 
    as confirmation of Leggieri's testimony. Defence counsel took the position 
    that the evidence could not be relied upon at all because Zeoli admitted he 
    had no independent recollection of Perciballi saying anything, let alone when 
    and where the conversations took place. The only reference to this evidence

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>There was no reference in Leggieri's testimony 
    to Pelliccione being Angelo's best man.  In answer to the first question, 
    the Crown submitted that it appeared as though the jury may have been confusing 
    Zeoli's evidence with Leggieri's evidence and that it would be appropriate 
    to tell the jury that while Mr. Leggieri gave no such evidence, there was 
    evidence to that effect by some other witnesses.  In answer to the second 
    question, the Crown asked the trial judge to review the conversation between 
    Angelo and Coiro referred to by the jury even though it did not contain reference 
    to Pelliccione or to the best man. Counsel for Pelliccione did not wish reference 
    to be made to Zeoli because &quot;he [Zeoli] had no idea whether the conversation 
    took place before or after [the robbery] and has no idea whether it was himself 
    or whether he picked it up from somebody else&quot;.  He submitted &quot;The 
    jury hasn't asked about Zeoli.  I trust they felt he was totally incredible&quot;.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge acceded to defence counsel's 
    request stating &quot;in the circumstances, it seems to me it would be appropriate 
    to simply answer the questions that the jury has asked and to err on the side 
    of fairness to the accused.&quot; He therefore told the jury that the answer 
    to their first two questions was that there was no such evidence. Because 
    there was no such evidence, he advised the jury there was no need to answer 
    question number three. The jury returned with a verdict two days later.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Counsel for Pelliccione submits that the jury’s 
    questions indicate that they were concerned with this evidence and that this 
    provides further support for the contention that the jury may well have used 
    inadmissible hearsay to convict. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Crown counsel submits that the absence of the 
    instruction was beneficial to the appellant. The effect of the instruction 
    would have been that, had the jury been satisfied that the necessary pre-conditions 
    existed, they would have been entitled to use Perciballi’s statement to Zeoli 
    as direct evidence that Pelliccione was the gunman. As matters stood, the 
    evidence was not highlighted for the jury and they were simply left with the 
    general notion that the Crown relied on it to support Leggieri’s testimony. 
    Crown counsel further submits that, as a result of the answers given to the 
    jury’s questions, they were left with the impression that there was no evidence 
    of Angelo’s best man being the fake cop.  Consequently, the trial judge essentially 
    removed the “best man as gunman” evidence from the jury’s consideration. Finally, 
    Crown counsel argues that defence counsel at trial made tactical decisions 
    in his submissions to the trial judge in an effort to prevent this evidence 
    from being highlighted to the jury and that these tactical decisions ought 
    to be given significant weight by this court in its determination as to whether 
    the trial judge was in error in acceding to defence counsel’s requests. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I agree with Crown counsel’s submissions on 
    this issue. In my view, the appellant likely benefited from the absence of 
    the <i>Koufis/Carter</i> instruction and from the trial judge’s answers to 
    the jury’s questions. His counsel at trial was certainly of that view and 
    there is no suggestion of incompetence or inadvertence on the part of trial 
    counsel. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that these were deliberate 
    tactical positions that were strongly urged upon the trial judge.  I find 
    the following remarks by Finlayson J.A. in <i>R. v. Lomage</i> (1991), 44 
    O.A.C. 131 at para. 17 relevant on this issue: </span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>I accept that our courts have taken a somewhat paternalistic approach 
      to the trial of an accused person, and certainly the failure to object to 
      a material error has never stood in the way of the court remedying what 
      it perceives to be an injustice.  However, we must never forget that ours 
      is an adversarial system and the role of defence counsel is every bit as 
      important as that of any other party to the proceedings, including that 
      of the judge.  When we minimize the failure of counsel to object to evidence 
      which he clearly saw as being to his client's advantage, we diminish the 
      role of defence counsel.  Defence counsel assumes a great deal of responsibility 
      in a criminal case and when he makes a decision, both he and his client 
      must live with it.  It is no function of this court to play the role of 
      what in football terminology is called a &quot;Monday morning quarterback” 
      when it comes to trial tactics employed by counsel.  If we were to do so, 
      it would have the effect of placing an unhelpful burden on the trial judge.  
      Instead of being able to rely on the competence of counsel who must know 
      more about the case than the trial judge, we would effectively be saying 
      that the trial court has an overriding responsibility to vet tactical decisions 
      of counsel and, where necessary, to vary or reverse them. Such overweening 
      paternalism denigrates the adversary system.</span></div>

      his whole family around him the night of the robbery.  Mr.&nbsp;Pelliccione 
      could have been at a bar with a whole bunch of his friends to say this is 
      where Pelliccione was at midnight, there’s no way he could have been at 
      the robbery.  Again, Mr.&nbsp;Leggieri, the reason he says Pelliccione is 
      because that’s who it is.  He knows it was him, he knows there’s not going 
      to be any alibi, he’s [sic] knows that the police aren’t going to come back 
      to him and say, well, look, Leggieri, we checked out this story about Pelliccione 
      and we have all these people who says he was nowhere near the robbery scene.  
      Marc Leggieri is not worried about that happening because he knows that 
      Pelliccione was in fact at the robbery scene.</span></div>

    was simply enumerating for the jury one of many reasons why they should believe 
    Leggieri when he fingered Pelliccione as the gunman. This comment is not in 
    any way tantamount to an adverse comment on the failure of the accused to 
    testify. The focus of the comment was Leggieri’s credibility and the reasons 
    why the defence theory did not add up. In this context there was no risk that 
    the jury would have perceived a shift in the burden of proof. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It was the Crown’s position at trial that Antonio 
    Portante participated in the offence by making one of the two telephone calls 
    to the police to divert patrolling officers away from the location of the 
    robbery. The first call was made to the emergency line, at “911”. The caller 
    claimed to see a brawl behind a Kelsey’s restaurant at the corner of Martingrove 
    and Dixon Roads in Toronto. The reported fight involved forty or fifty black 
    people armed with baseball bats and perhaps a gun. Within two minutes, a second 
    telephone call was made to the police reporting further trouble at the same 
    intersection. This call was made to the non-emergency line at 324-2222. The 
    caller claimed that he had seen police officers pursuing two black suspects. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The second call, to 324-2222, was traced to 
    Sam DeFrancesca’s cellular telephone. DeFrancesca testified at trial and conceded 
    that he made this call. He denied making the other one. The first call, to 
    911, was traced to a public telephone outside a donut store at the intersection 
    of Martingrove and Dixon Roads.  An expert in voice identification compared 
    the tapes of the two calls with samples of DeFrancesca’s voice and concluded 
    that it was probable that DeFrancesca had made the 324-2222 call and “far 
    more likely” that the same person had made the disputed 911 call to the police 
    than someone else. The defence relied heavily on the expert evidence at trial. 
    The trial judge instructed the jury in clear terms that the expert opinion 
    alone was capable of raising a reasonable doubt on whether Antonio Portante 
    made the 911 call. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>However, the expert testimony was not without 
    some frailties and, despite the expert’s conclusions, it was the Crown’s position 
    at trial that the 911 call was placed by the appellant. In support of this 
    contention, the Crown relied mainly on DeFrancesca’s testimony that he had 
    made just one call, on the testimony of one Antonio Bandiera who stated he 
    was with the appellant at the donut shop at Martingrove and Dixon Roads at 
    the relevant time, and on cellular telephone records showing calls between 
    Bandiera’s cellular telephone and the robbers, again in the relevant time

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At issue on this appeal are two items of evidence 
    that supported the Crown’s case against Antonio Portante. The first item, 
    a statement made by Angelo Portante to the witness Antonio Coiro, supported 
    DeFrancesca’s testimony that he made just the one call, and the second item, 
    a police officer’s testimony, contradicted Bandiera who denied any knowledge

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At some point during the trial, the question 
    arose as to the admissibility of a statement made by Angelo Portante that 
    his brother [the appellant Antonio Portante] had made a call to divert the 
    police from the location of the robbery. This statement was allegedly made 
    to a witness, Antonio Coiro, sometime after the robbery. There was no dispute 
    at trial that this statement was admissible against its maker, Angelo Portante, 
    as an admission under the well-recognized hearsay exception. The Crown relied 
    on the statement to show Angelo Portante’s knowledge about how the robbery 
    had gone down. Counsel for <i>Antonio</i> Portante, however, disputed the 
    admissibility of this evidence, arguing that, although admissible against 
    Angelo Portante, the statement should not be admitted at the joint trial because 
    of its highly prejudicial effect against the co-accused Antonio Portante.

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge dismissed Antonio Portante’s 
    motion. He held that, although the possible prejudice to Antonio Portante 
    was a concern, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial 
    effect and any danger of misusing this evidence against Antonio Portante could 
    be removed by a strongly worded limiting instruction to the jury. The appellant 
    applied for a severance of his trial after this ruling. His motion for a severance 
    was also denied. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The evidence was therefore introduced at the 
    joint trial and, immediately after the jury heard the evidence, the trial 
    judge instructed the jury in clear and strong terms that the statement allegedly 
    made by Angelo Portante was not admissible against Antonio Portante. It was 
    only admissible against Angelo Portante, if the jury accepted that it was 
    made. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant does not take issue with the 
    trial judge’s ruling on the admissibility of this evidence on his appeal. 
    He initially appealed against the ruling on the motion for severance but that 
    ground of appeal was abandoned at the hearing. What is at issue on this appeal 
    is the reference made by Crown counsel to this evidence in his closing address, 
    indicating to the jury that they could consider Angelo Portante’s statement 
    to Coiro in their assessment of DeFrancesca’s credibility. The question becomes 
    whether this constituted a permissible use of the evidence or whether it offended 
    the rule against hearsay.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This issue was canvassed at trial at the conclusion 
    of the evidence.  Crown counsel sought leave to make reference to this statement 
    in his closing address as one of ten items of evidence which could be considered 
    by the jury in support of DeFrancesca’s testimony. Counsel for the appellant 
    was opposed to the Crown addressing the jury in this fashion arguing that, 
    since this evidence was inadmissible against Antonio Portante, it was impermissible 
    and highly prejudicial for the Crown to tell the jury that they could nonetheless

    at issue in the trial and that he intended to give a strong caution in his 
    charge against relying on the testimony of accomplices. In view of this anticipated 
    caution, the context in which the Crown intended to make reference to this 
    evidence simply as one of ten items to consider in assessing DeFrancesca’s 
    credibility, and the instruction given during the course of the trial that

    a strong caution against accepting the evidence of accomplices such as DeFrancesca. 
    In reviewing the Crown’s theory against Antonio Portante, he made a brief 
    reference to the fact that “the Crown relies on the testimony as well of Sam

    also common ground between the parties that this statement was <i>not</i> 
    admissible against Antonio Portante. The statement, made after the robbery, 
    was not in furtherance of the conspiracy and could not be admitted under the 
    co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule. Nor did it fall within any 
    other recognized exceptions to the rule. The appellant submits that Crown 
    counsel’s address had the effect of negating the trial judge’s instruction 
    to the jury that Angelo’s statement did not constitute evidence against Antonio. 
    The jury was invited to do indirectly what they were told they could not do 
    directly. The Crown takes the position that the statement could be considered 
    by the jury as confirmatory evidence of DeFrancesca’s testimony because such 
    use did not require the jury to assess the truth of Angelo’s statement and 
    hence it did not infringe the rule against hearsay. Alternatively, Crown counsel 
    argues that, in the context in which this was done, no substantial wrong or 
    miscarriage of justice resulted. </span></p>

    use of this evidence. It infringed basic principles of evidence. The governing 
    principles were fully canvassed and the same issue was determined by our court 
    in <i>R. v. C.(B.)</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 467 (Ont. C.A.), leave ref'd 
    (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) vi (S.C.C.). Unfortunately, counsel did not provide

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In <i>C.B., </i>the appellant was tried on 
    a charge of sexual assault jointly with one co-accused. The complainant alleged 
    that the appellant had inserted a foreign object into her vagina. This allegation 
    was supported by a statement of the co-accused admitted at trial. The co-accused 
    in his testimony recanted the statement. The trial judge rejected the co-accused’s 
    recantation, accepted his statement for the truth of its contents against 
    him and convicted him. An issue arose from the fact that the trial judge, 
    in convicting the appellant, relied in part on the co-accused’s statement. 
    He stated that the statement given by the co-accused confirmed much of the 
    complainant’s testimony and, in particular, confirmed the events involving 
    the use of the foreign object. On appeal from the appellant’s conviction, 
    this court held that the trial judge erred in relying on the co-accused’s 
    statement and ordered a new trial. </span></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>I think it is necessary to go back to first principles.  The tension 
      that exists in this case is between the desirability of having confirmatory 
      evidence that makes more reliable the evidence of the complainant, and the 
      long-standing prohibition in criminal cases against the admission into evidence 
      of the confession of one co-accused against his fellow accused.  An out-of-court 
      confession is admissible against the accused who made the statement because 
      it is a statement against interest and falls within that recognized exception 
      to the hearsay rule.  However, the statement remains hearsay against the 
      co-accused and the trial judge is under a heavy burden to instruct the jury 
      as to the limited use it can make of it.  In <i>McFall v. The Queen</i> 
      (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 225, 100 D.L.R. (3d) 403, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 321, Estey&nbsp;J. 
      stated at p.&nbsp;240:</span></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>This burden is discharged only by the clearest instruction to the jury 
          that only the statement made by the accused himself is admissible against 
          him, and his statement in turn is inadmissible against his co-accused.  
          There is in these circumstances a constant risk because any instruction 
          short of the foregoing will jeopardize and may destroy any chance of 
          a fair and proper trial.</span></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>This rule as to the restricted use of confessions is so closely observed 
      that where a statement is to be tendered by the Crown against one co-accused 
      that has the potential to be strongly prejudicial against a co-accused, 
      the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the better course is to hold a 
      separate trial of each: see <i>Guimond v. The Queen</i> (1979), 44 C.C.C. 
      (2d) 481, 94 D.L.R. (3d) 1, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 960.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US><br>
      The Crown now submits that this long-standing rule has been modified by 
      the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 
      1, 136 D.L.R. (3d) 89, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, when it relaxed the rule relating 
      to corroboration.  Corroboration is evidence which confirms a witness’s 
      testimony making the testimony more likely to be true.  In <i>R. v. Baskerville</i>, 
      [1916] 2 K.B. 658, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England gave corroboration 
      a more technical meaning. It required that such evidence be: (a) independent; 
      (b) evidence that a crime has been committed, and (c) evidence that the 
      accused committed the crime. </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>While most statutory requirements of corroboration have been eliminated, 
      there remained a common law requirement that a jury be warned against the 
      dangers of convicting without corroboration in three instances where the 
      prosecution's case consisted of: (a) the evidence of an accomplice; (b) 
      the evidence of a sworn but still young child, or (c) the evidence of a 
      witness with a ''disreputable'' reputation.<br>
      </span><br>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-US>In <i>Vetrovec</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada discarded the technical 
        meaning of corroboration adopted in <i>Baskerville</i>, <i>supra</i>, 
        in favour of the more common meaning of the word, <i>i.e.</i>, that it 
        is evidence tending to confirm other evidence. <i>The operative word is 
        still ''evidence'', however. Hearsay is not evidence, and where it is 
        admitted as evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule solely against 
        one co-accused, it does not become evidence against the other</i>. It 
        is difficult to see how this change in the law with respect to corroboration 
        affects the rule regarding the restricted use of confessions which are 
        hearsay.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>In <i>Vetrovec</i>, an accomplice gave testimony regarding the appellants' 
      involvement in drug trafficking. The court questioned why corroboration 
      should be required for the testimony of all accomplices, as a class of witnesses. 
      Instead the court suggested that common sense be used to determine in which 
      cases a common law warning is necessary. The court's analysis suggested 
      that the same approach be used in cases involving young children and, by 
      implication, in cases involving ''disreputable'' witnesses.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span

        Dickson J., in delivering the judgment of the court, made reference to 
        <i>R. v. Murphy</i> (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 417, 70 D.L.R. (3d) 42, [1977] 
        2 S.C.R. 603 (S.C.C.), where the principal issue in a rape case was whether 
        the complainant's distraught condition was corroboration of her testimony 
        against Butt as well as Murphy. Both the complainant's cousin and a police 
        officer testified as to her distraught condition. Murphy testified that 
        he had intercourse with her but that she consented. Butt testified that 
        he had no sexual contact with her. The question, as put by Dickson J. 
        in <i>Vetrovec</i> at p. 14 was: ''[h]ow, then, could the hysterical condition 
        corroborate the complainant's testimony as against Butt?''. He resolved 
        the problem by stating at p. 15: </span></p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>Evidence implicating the accused is a possible but not a necessary 
          element for corroboration.  Here, even though there was no evidence 
          implicating Butt, there was evidence confirming the story of the complainant 
          and thus it was safe to convict.  The important question, as Wigmore 
          pointed out, is not how our trust is restored, but whether it is restored 
          at all.</span></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-US>In the case on appeal, the co-appellants did not adopt in the witness-box 
        their earlier statements to the police. Therefore, those statements were 
        made out of court and if they were offered to establish that they were 
        true, they were hearsay. While counsel for the Crown acknowledged that 
        admissions made by a party are exceptions to the hearsay rule and can 
        only be used against the person who made them, she argued that the trial 
        judge properly used the statements of each appellant to confirm the evidence 
        of the complainant. As authority for this submission, she referred to 
        <i>Vetrovec</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>R. v. D.(S.)</i> (1992), 10 O.R. 
        (3d) 402, 58 O.A.C. 2, 17 W.C.B. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.).  In particular, 
        she picked up on Dickson J.'s reference to Wigmore and submitted that 
        the approach now is to determine if the complainant is worthy of credit. 
        In making this submission, she overlooked the significance of the word 
        ''evidence''. We do not look everywhere and anywhere for confirmation. 
        We look to evidence. Evidence used to confirm a complainant's evidence 
        against B.C. must still be admissible against B.C.</span></p>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Finlayson J.A. went on to distinguish the earlier 
  decision of this court relied upon by the Crown,<i> R. v. D.(S.) </i>(1992), 
  10 O.R. (3d) 402 (C.A.). An issue arose again on the hearing of this appeal 
  whether the reasoning in <i>D.(S.) </i>should govern rather than Finlayson J.A.’s 
  analysis in <i>C.(B.). </i>In my view, on principles of <i>stare decisis</i> 
  alone, this court’s decision in <i>C.(B.)</i>, as the most recent and more comprehensive 
  judgment on this issue, clearly governs. Furthermore, I agree with Finlayson 
  J.A. that the earlier decision in <i>D.(S.)</i> can be distinguished on the 
  basis that there was other evidence to confirm the complainant’s evidence in 
  that case. For convenience, I reproduce Finlayson J.A.’s analysis on this point 
  (pp.&nbsp;474-76):</span></div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The facts in <i>D.(S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, are similar to those in the 
      case on appeal; however, some facts are distinguishable. There was other 
      evidence, in the form of a tape recording, to confirm the complainant's 
      lack of consent to at least some of the actions which formed a basis of 
      the charges. Therefore, the evidence supported her credibility generally. 
      Additionally, two of the accused testified and provided confirmatory evidence. 
      The problem arose out of the trial judge's treatment of the out-of-court 
      statements of the six accused. While the trial judge acknowledged that the 
      out-of-court statement of one accused could not be admitted against another 
      accused, he instructed himself in a hypothetical way that such statements 
      could be used to confirm a complainant's evidence. The Court of Appeal upheld 
      the trial judge's decision stating at pp. 407-8: </span></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge clearly convicted the appellants on the basis of his 
          belief of the complainant’s evidence.  He did not found the conviction 
          of one appellant upon the statement of another appellant.  Moreover, 
          while it is not necessary to review them in detail, the statement of 
          each appellant contains an admission of some fact which tends to support 
          the credibility of the complainant on the crucial issue of absence of 
          consent.</span></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>Counsel for the Crown referred us to the trial judgment in <i>D.(S.)</i> 
      and to the trial judge’s instruction to himself.  After stating the conventional 
      rule that one accused's statement is not admissible against another accused, 
      the trial judge stated:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><br>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>In a hypothetical situation, if the complainant swears that B held 
        a knife to her throat while A had intercourse with her and that the rape 
        was thereby accomplished, it may be, as here, that the court would be 
        unwilling to convict based solely on her assertion.  If A then confessed 
        the rape was accomplished in [the] very manner, A’s confession is not 
        admissible against B.  However, A’s confession, if believed, is capable 
        of confirming or corroborating, to use a loaded word, the complainant’s 
        evidence.  The court may then convict B, based not on the confession but 
        on the confirmed evidence of the complainant.</span></div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The above appears to be an inaccurate paraphrase of an illustration 
      given by Dickson&nbsp;J. in <i>Vetrovec</i> at p.&nbsp;14:</span></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The point can be illustrated with the following simple example.  The 
        accomplice, “A”, <i>testifies</i> against the accused “B” and “C”. There 
        is <i>evidence</i> implicating “B” in the crime, but no <i>evidence</i> 
        implicating “C”.  Nevertheless, since the supporting <i>evidence</i> relates 
        to a vital issue in the case (the guilt of one of the accused) it bolsters 
        the credibility of “A” and increases the probability that he is telling 
        the truth.  We therefore believe his story and convict both “B” and “C”. 
        </span></div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>[Emphasis is Finlayson&nbsp;J.A.’s.]<br>
      <br>
      </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The Court of Appeal did state, by way of <i>obiter</i>, that the trial 
      judge's hypothetical in <i>D.(S.)</i> was in accord with that illustration. 
      However, this quotation from <i>Vetrovec</i>, clearly dealt with the <i>testimony</i> 
      of an accomplice. The question of hearsay was not in issue. It is difficult 
      to see how <i>Vetrovec</i> could be authority for a widening of one of the 
      hearsay exceptions to include statements made by one accused to implicate 
      another. The trial judge's distinction between admitting evidence directly 
      against a co-appellant and admitting evidence simply to confirm a complainant's 
      allegations is untenable.</span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Finally, this court in <i>C.(B.)</i> concluded 
  that the out-of-court statement of the co-accused did not fit any of the traditional 
  hearsay exceptions nor would it meet the criteria of necessity and flexibility 
  under the flexible approach adopted in more recent cases. Again, the court’s 
  analysis on this point is entirely apposite to this case:</span></div>
<div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The out-of-court statement in the case on appeal does not fit in any 
  of the traditional hearsay exceptions. Moreover, the flexible approach adopted 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in recent cases such as <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1990), 
  59 C.C.C. (3d) 92, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, 79 C.R. (3d) 1; <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1992), 
  75 C.C.C. (3d) 257, 94 D.L.R. (4th) 590, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, and <i>R. v. B. 
  (K.G.)</i>, unreported, released February&nbsp;25, 1993 [since reported 79 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 257, 18 W.C.B. (2d) 588], would not support the admission of such a statement 
  as proof of the truth of the contents thereof. The new approach emphasizes necessity 
  and reliability as well as fairness to the accused. Assuming such evidence could 
  be shown to be necessary, which is doubtful in the present case since the Crown 
  could have severed the charges against the two young offenders and made K. a 
  compellable witness against B., it is obvious that the out-of-court statement 
  of one accused implicating another is not reliable. An accused could have many 
  personal reasons for wanting to implicate another, particularly when he is first 
  arrested. Therefore, such a statement must be tested through cross-examination 
  and should not be admitted as a hearsay exception unless in compliance with 
  the principles set forth in <i>R. v. B.(K.G.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Since writing this judgment, I have had the 
    opportunity of reading the dissenting reasons of my colleague, Doherty J.A. 
    on this issue. Despite their usual clarity and persuasive force, I respectfully 
    disagree with his conclusion that <i>Vetrovec</i> is determinative of the 
    exact issue that concerns us in this case and that it decides the issue in

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As I read my colleague’s reasons, he bases his 
  conclusion on the finding in <i>Vetrovec</i> that the out-of-court statements, 
  made to an undercover officer by the accused Gaja and showing Gaja to be a drug 
  dealer, could be used to corroborate an accomplice’s testimony implicating both 
  Gaja and the co-accused Vetrovec. My colleague acknowledges that Gaja’s out-of-court 
  statements were potentially admissible as substantive evidence against Vetrovec 
  under the co-conspirator’s exception to the hearsay rule and that the same cannot 
  be said of Angelo’s statement to Coiro, as against Antonio. My colleague, however, 
  points out that the potential admissibility of Gaja’s statements against Vetrovec 
  played no role in the reasons of Dickson J. for determining that those statements 
  could be considered in assessing the accomplice’s credibility at large. He therefore 
  concludes that the confirmatory value of those statements with regard to Vetrovec 
  did not turn on any preliminary finding that the statements of Gaja were admissible 
  against Vetrovec.</span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I am unable to reach the same conclusion. In 
  my view, the reasons in <i>Vetrovec</i> are silent on the question of the admissibility 
  of the confirmatory evidence because that question was not in issue. There was 
  no suggestion in <i>Vetrovec</i> that Gaja’s statements to the undercover officer 
  constituted <i>inadmissible</i> evidence as against Vetrovec. In and of themselves, 
  the statements may have been of no probative value as against Vetrovec because 
  they did not implicate him, but there is no indication that the evidence was 
  inadmissible or subject to any limited use as against him. It is my view that 
  if one of Gaja’s statements had been a post-offence confession, implicating 
  Vetrovec and admitted at trial <i>as against Gaja only</i>, the potential use 
  of the corroborative value of that statement as against Vetrovec would have 
  given rise to different considerations and would have been the subject of comment 
  by the Supreme Court.</span></div>
<div class=Section1><span lang=EN-GB><br>
  [84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>There is no doubt in this case that the statement 
  made by Angelo to Coiro is confirmatory of DeFrancesco’s testimony as defined 
  in <i>Vetrovec</i>.  Angelo’s statement that his brother Antonio made a diversionary 
  call to the police on the night of the robbery strengthens the belief that DeFrancesco’s 
  testimony is truthful when he says that he, DeFrancesco, only made one of the 
  two calls. The statement must nonetheless be excluded from consideration in 
  the case as against Antonio, not because it lacks corroborative value from a 
  logical or a common sense standpoint,  but for the same policy</span></div>
<div class=Section1><span lang=EN-GB>considerations that define the scope of admissibility 
  of an accused’s out-of-court statement and limit its use as against its maker 
  only. The underlying principle is one of fairness to the party who cannot cross-examine 
  the maker of the statement. While the maker can hardly complain about the inability 
  to cross-examine himself, the same cannot be said of the co-accused.</span></div>

  the analysis of this court in <i>C.(B.)</i> constitutes a departure from the 
  approach in <i>Vetrovec</i>. Nor in my view does it conflict with any of the 
  other decisions referred to by my colleague Doherty J.A. There is no question 
  that the corroborative nature of any item of evidence is determined according 
  to the approach in <i>Vetrovec.</i> Evidence that tends to confirm other evidence 
  is corroborative in nature. This does not mean however that the admissibility

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The same result as in <i>C. (B.)</i> follows 
    in this case. Coiro’s testimony about a statement made to him by Angelo Portante 
    was evidence of the most common form that gives rise to hearsay concerns. 
    The fundamental concern behind the rule against hearsay is the unavailability 
    of the declarant for cross-examination. Because the declarant, Angelo Portante, 
    was not a witness at trial, the appellant Antonio Portante could not test 
    the reliability of his statement through cross-examination. Did Angelo know 
    that Antonio had made a call based on personal observations? Did he get this 
    information from Antonio himself?  Or from a third party who may have heard 
    it from a fourth? Did he get this information from DeFrancesca? Indeed, if 
    the latter was the source of the information, Angelo’s statement could not 
    in any way be said to be confirmatory of DeFrancesca’s testimony. This reflection 
    brings us to a consideration of the use to which the evidence is sought to 
    be put, which lies at the crux of the definition of hearsay. The Supreme Court 
    of Canada in <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, a decision released 
    after the hearing of this appeal on September 29, 2000, reiterated this basic 
    principle of evidence at para.&nbsp;162:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>… [H]earsay evidence is defined not by the nature of the evidence <i>per 
      se</i>, but by the use to which the evidence is sought to be put: namely, 
      to prove that what is asserted is true. When the out-of-court statement 
      is offered for its truth, the inability to cross-examine or “test” the source 
      of the evidence in court under oath or solemn affirmation as to the truth 
      of the assertion undermines its reliability: see I. Younger, <i>An Irreverent 
      Introduction to Hearsay</i> (1977), an address to the American Bar Association 
      Annual Meeting, Atlanta, Georgia, August 11, 1976. In short, the essential 
      defining features of hearsay are the <i>purpose</i> for which the evidence 
      is adduced, and the absence of a meaningful opportunity to <i>cross-examine</i> 
      the declarant in court under oath or solemn affirmation as to the truth 
      of its contents. [Emphasis added.] </span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In my view, the invitation to the jury to consider 
  Angelo Portante’s statement in their assessment of DeFrancesca’s credibility 
  necessarily involved an assessment of the truth of Angelo’s statement. If Angelo’s 
  statement that Antonio made the call was true, it indeed confirmed DeFrancesca’s 
  testimony that he only made one call and did not make the other one. If Angelo’s 
  statement was false, of course it provided no confirmatory value. Crown counsel 
  suggested that the jury could find confirmation of DeFrancesca’s testimony in 
  the fact that Angelo stated that “a person” made a call without having to consider 
  whether that person was Antonio. In fact, Crown counsel conceded that the jury 
  could not consider the truth of that part of the statement that implicated Antonio. 
  In my view, this is a distinction without a difference. Even following the Crown’s 
  approach, the jury would have to assess whether Angelo’s statement that “a person” 
  made a call was true (presumably a person other than DeFrancesca) before the 
  evidence would have any confirmatory value. The inquiry would still involve 
  an assessment of the truth of Angelo’s statement.</span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The reasoning that the jury was invited to make 
  in this case is not unlike that in <i>U. (F.J.) </i> where the Supreme Court 
  found that it necessarily entailed a consideration of the truth of the out-of-court 
  statement. In <i>U. (F.J.), </i>the appellant was charged with sexual offences 
  on his daughter. The complainant gave a statement to the police alleging that 
  she had repeatedly been sexually assaulted by her father. The appellant was 
  then interviewed and, in his statement, confirmed many of his daughter’s allegations. 
  At trial, both the complainant and the appellant recanted their earlier statements. 
  In these circumstances, either out-of-court statement, if admitted for the truth 
  of its contents, constituted hearsay. The appellant’s statement, as an admission, 
  was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule and could be considered for 
  the truth of its contents. The complainant’s prior inconsistent statement did 
  not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule. The trial judge nonetheless 
  instructed the jury that they could compare the complainant’s out-of-court statement 
  with the accused’s statement to assist them in their deliberations. A question 
  arose whether such use offended the rule against hearsay. A majority of this 
  court held that it did not. Houlden J.A. dissented. The Supreme Court of Canada 
  agreed with Houlden J.A. in his conclusion ((1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 541 at 544):</span></div>
<div class=Section1><span

  was otherwise admissible for the truth of its contents according to the principles 
  set out in <i>R. v. B.(K.G.)</i> and therefore that no substantial wrong was 
  occasioned by the absence of the appropriate instruction. In this case, no suggestion 
  is made that the evidence about Angelo Portante’s statement could meet the criteria 
  in <i>B. (K.G.), </i>or the <i>Smith/Khan </i>criteria of necessity and reliability.</span></div>

  in the circumstances of this case. I am not satisfied that the verdict would 
  necessarily be the same if the jury had not been invited to consider this evidence 
  in assessing DeFrancesca’s credibility. DeFrancesca’s testimony formed a crucial 
  part of the Crown’s case against Antonio Portante. Given the expert opinion 
  evidence, the issue whether DeFrancesca had himself made the 911 call contrary 
  to his evidence was a very live one. In assessing his credibility, the jury 
  was invited to consider Angelo’s statement that Antonio made the call. In doing 
  so, the jury necessarily had to consider the truth of Angelo’s statement. If 
  they determined that Angelo’s statement was true, given the nature of the case 
  against the appellant, this would be determinative not only of DeFrancesca’s 
  testimony on this point but of the guilt of the appellant. I would therefore 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></div>

  he drove him to the corner of Martingrove and Dixon Roads where they stopped 
  to have a coffee at the donut shop. As stated earlier, the 911 call to the police 
  was traced back to one of the public telephones at that location. This testimony 
  therefore placed the appellant at the relevant location at the time in question. 
  Bandiera testified, however, that the appellant did not direct him to that corner, 
  and that he did not see the appellant make a telephone call from the pay telephones.

  about many aspects of his evidence. Of particular relevance here, Bandiera did 
  not adopt his prior accounts about events at the donut shop on August 31, 1995 
  in which he said that the appellant had used a pay telephone. He stated that 
  he had lied both to the police and in his prior sworn testimony. </span></div>

  interviewed by the police in October 1996. After the interview was complete, 
  Bandiera drove with him in a police cruiser to the donut shop at Martingrove 
  and Dixon Roads. There, Bandiera pointed out two pay telephones from the seven 
  phones around the donut shop and adjacent gas station. The 911 call had originated 
  from one of these telephones. Bandiera testified that he did accompany an officer 
  to the donut shop, but denied that he had pointed out anything. </span></div>

    </span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>Then we have Bandiera pointing out to P.C. Carbone, the police officer, 
      who went with him and asked Bandiera to point out the donut shop and point 
      out the phone if he could.  And P.C. Carbone says that Bandiera pointed 
      to one of the two phones at some side of the donut shop and it was one of 
      those two phones that in fact made the 911 call.  So, again, how does Bandiera 
      know to point out that particular phone, there are seven phones at this 
      donut shop.  Bandiera knows the right donut shop, he knows the right phone, 
      and he knows that because he saw Tony Portante make the call to 911 on August&nbsp;31st.</span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant submits that Bandiera’s pointing 
  to a telephone is an assertion by conduct. It is tantamount to Bandiera having 
  made an assertion about the telephone and that is the precise inference that 
  the Crown urged the jury to draw. It is therefore submitted that, since Bandiera 
  did not adopt this out-of-court assertion, Cst. Carbone’s evidence constitutes 
  inadmissible hearsay if admitted for the truth of its contents. It is submitted 
  that, at most, this evidence could be considered as proof of a prior inconsistent

  was incumbent upon the trial judge to give the jury the appropriate limiting 
  instruction. </span></div>

  However, if this were the only ground of appeal, I would not give effect to 
  it for the following reasons. This evidence was admissible, albeit for a limited 
  purpose. No objection was made at trial. The trial judge gave extensive general 
  instructions on the assessment of credibility of witnesses, including the use 
  of prior inconsistent statements with appropriate examples taken from the evidence. 
  Although the evidence was not identified as tantamount to a prior inconsistent 
  statement for the jury, it was obvious from a logical point of view that it 
  contradicted Bandiera’s denial in the witness stand and that it therefore affected 
  his credibility. There was a substantial body of evidence that otherwise placed 
  the appellant at the place and time in question. I am satisfied that no substantial 
  wrong resulted from this non direction. </span></div>

  the robbery was to take place.  Sam DeFrancesca testified for the Crown and 
  admitted that he made one of the calls.  The Crown alleged that Antonio Portante 
  made the other call.  The Crown relied on evidence placing Antonio Portante 
  at the location from which the call was made at the time it was made, and on 
  certain after-the-fact conduct of Antonio Portante.  That conduct, although 
  not connecting Antonio directly to either of the diversionary phone calls, could

  the evidence indicated that he became aware of the robbery after it occurred, 
  it could not establish that he had any actual involvement in the robbery, and 
  specifically, could not establish that he made one of the diversionary phone 
  calls.  He placed considerable reliance on the evidence of a Crown expert who 
  had examined tape recordings of both phone calls.  That expert testified that 
  DeFrancesca had likely made the first call and that it was more likely than

  Antonio Portante that the jury accept DeFrancesca’s evidence that he had made 
  only one of the two diversionary phone calls.  On the Crown’s theory, if the

  because his evidence was consistent with other credible evidence.  This argument 
  is hardly novel and is reflective of the common sense notion that a witness’s 
  credibility is enhanced if his or her testimony on a material matter is consistent 
  with other evidence that the jury finds credible.  Juries are routinely told 
  as part of the general instruction on credibility assessment that they should 
  consider whether a witness’s evidence is consistent with the evidence of other 
  credible witnesses.  The Crown’s argument amounted to nothing more.

  had to decide whether it could believe DeFrancesca’s evidence that he had made 
  only one call.  The jury had heard Coiro’s evidence that the appellant said 
  his brother made one call.  It was open to the jury to believe that evidence.  
  If the jury believed that evidence, it would, as a simple matter of common sense, 
  factor the acceptance of that evidence into its assessment of whether DeFrancesca 
  was to be believed when he said that he had made only one call.  To instruct 
  the jury to ignore Coiro’s evidence in determining whether to accept DeFrancesca’s 
  evidence that he made only one call, would be to tell the jury to do the exact 
  opposite of what their common sense would dictate.  Test the matter this way.  
  Suppose Angelo’s out-of-court statement was to the effect that one person had 
  made both calls.  Could it be argued that the jury should ignore that evidence, 
  even if believed, when deciding whether it should find as a fact that DeFrancesca 
  had made only one call?  To hold that the jury should ignore such evidence is 
  to invite the conviction of an accused despite the jury’s acceptance of evidence

  require the jury to assess the credibility of DeFrancesca’s evidence that he

  assessments of credibility, the jury could look only to other evidence which 
  was admissible against each accused.  On this approach, the jury could reach 
  different conclusions as to the veracity of DeFrancesca’s assertion that he 
  made one call as regards each accused.  For example, in so far as the case against 
  Angelo was concerned, the jury might find as a fact that the appellant made

  one co-accused could be used to confirm the evidence of a witness as to the 
  involvement of another accused in the offence.  A little over six months later, 
  a different panel of this court unanimously came to the opposite conclusion 
  in <i>R. v. C.(B.)</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 467 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal

  made by one co-accused to confirm a witness’s evidence as to the involvement 
  of another accused in the offence amounted to an impermissible use of hearsay 
  evidence.  In <i>R. v. D(S.), supra</i>, this court relied on <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> 
  (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In <i>R. v. C.(B.), supra</i>, this court

  canvassed in the two authorities from this court.  As I read <i>R. v. Vetrovec,

  trial judge referred separately to evidence which could implicate Vetrovec and 
  evidence which could implicate Gaja.  Included in the latter category were certain 
  statements allegedly made by Gaja to an undercover officer.  These out-of-court

  corroborative.  The potentially corroborative evidence included an out-of-court 
  statement made by a co-conspirator and certain notes in a journal kept by Bulleyment’s 
  co-accused, a man named O’Donoghue.  For present purposes, O’Donoghue’s notes 
  are no different than an out-of-court statement made by O’Donoghue.  </span></div>

  hearsay evidence that was not admissible against an accused could not confirm 
  the evidence of a suspect witness in so far as that evidence implicated the 
  accused.  In <i>R. v. U.(F.J.), supra</i>, the Crown argued that an out-of-court 
  statement made by a recanting complainant could be considered by the jury in 
  assessing the truthfulness of certain admissions made by the accused in a statement 
  to the police.  There were significant similarities between the statement of 
  the recanting complainant and the admissions made by the accused.  The Crown 
  argued that a comparison of the two statements for the purpose of determining 
  the veracity of the accused’s confession did not amount to a hearsay use of 
  the complainant’s out-of-court statement.</span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Several recent decisions from this court, while 
  not concerned with the exact issue now before this court, have emphasized the 
  common sense approach to the search for confirmatory evidence enunciated in 
  <i>R. v. Vetrovec, supra</i>.  These cases firmly establish that the confirmatory 
  value of evidence is tested not solely by its ability to prove the guilt of 
  a particular accused, but also by its ability as a matter of common sense to 
  “strengthen our belief that the suspect witness is telling the truth”: <i>R. 
  v. Krugel</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 367 at 395 (Ont. C.A.).  Evidence may 
  be confirmatory of the credibility of a suspect witness even though that evidence 
  does not implicate any, much less all of the accused in the commission of the 
  crime: <i>R. v. Winmill</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 380 at 408-09 (Ont. C.A.); 
  <i>R. v. Gagnon</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 204-07, 248-49 (Ont. C.A.).</span></div>

  </span></span><i><span lang=EN-GB>R. v. Phillips and Baker</span></i><span lang=EN-GB>, 
  [2001] O.J. No. 53 (C.A.), provides an excellent example of the post-<i>Vetrovec</i> 
  approach to confirmatory evidence.  A witness named McLean, whose credibility 
  was suspect for many reasons, identified both accused as the two persons who 
  shot the deceased.  McLean knew both accused, and unlike many identification 
  cases, the issue was primarily McLean’s credibility and not the reliability 
  of his identification.  The Crown’s case against Baker rested on McLean’s identification 
  of him.  There was substantial evidence, apart from McLean’s identification, 
  identifying Phillips as one of the shooters.  </span></div>

      of McLean.  This was something the jury could take into account as a means

      was telling the truth about Baker. (See <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> [citation

  evidence against Baker.  If, however, that evidence was believed, it could, 
  as a matter of common sense and logic, confirm the accuracy of McLean’s evidence 
  identifying Phillips as one of the shooters.  If the jury found it to be confirmatory, 
  it would “strengthen” the jury’s belief that McLean was telling the truth when 
  he identified Phillips.  If the jury accepted McLean’s identification of Phillips 
  as credible, that conclusion could lead the jury to believe the rest of McLean’s

  placed before the jury in deciding whether there was credible evidence which 
  tended to confirm the accuracy of McLean’s evidence that Baker was one of the 
  shooters.  On that approach, it did not matter whether the evidence which tended 
  to enhance McLean’s credibility was in and of itself admissible to prove Baker’s 
  involvement in the crime.  What mattered, was whether, as a matter of common 
  sense and human experience, the evidence which the jury found credible led the 
  jury to believe McLean’s evidence implicating Baker in the crime.  </span></div>

  </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Judicial instructions on the assessment of credibility 
  should not require juries to step with Alice through the looking glass.  Neither 
  an accused’s right to a fair trial, nor the community’s interest in an accurate 
  verdict is served where credibility instructions run directly against the grain 
  of common sense.  Where the credibility of a witness is open to serious doubt, 
  the jury should be able to look to the entirety of the evidence for credible 
  evidence which assists it in determining whether to believe all or part of that 
  witness’s evidence.  This search is for evidence which informs the jury’s assessment 
  of the veracity of the evidence given by the suspect witness.  That evidence 
  may lead the jury to believe the suspect witness or it may lead the jury to 
  disbelieve the suspect witness.  The jury’s search for evidence which can assist 
  in assessing the credibility of the suspect witness should not be limited to 
  evidence which is also admissible to prove the Crown’s case against a particular 
  accused, but should extend to all evidence which, as a matter of common sense, 
  can assist in that assessment.</span></div>

  special difficulties.  Where some evidence is not admissible against all accused, 
  there is a danger that the jury will improperly use that evidence.  That danger 
  must be carefully measured.  In some cases, despite the prophylactic measures 
  available, a trial judge may conclude that the risk that a jury will misuse 
  evidence is sufficient to require severance.  That risk could arise where an 
  out-of-court statement made by one accused is heavily relied on as confirmatory 
  of the evidence given by an accomplice implicating another accused in the offence.  
  That is not, however, this case.  Coiro’s evidence was but one of many pieces
