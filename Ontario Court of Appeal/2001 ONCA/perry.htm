  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h3>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant claims 
    declaratory and related relief in an action brought pursuant to the <i>Fraudulent 
    Conveyances Act</i>.  The appellant alleges that the transfer of certain assets 
    to the respondent Outerbridge Management Limited (OML) is void as a fraudulent 
    conveyance and that, as a creditor of the transferor, it is entitled to immediate 
    possession of the assets or the proceeds from the assets.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant moved 
    for summary judgment on its claim under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> 
    and was met with the respondents' cross-motion for summary judgment, asking 
    that the appellant's claim be dismissed on the ground that it was barred by 
    the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15.  The motions court judge 
    accepted the respondents' limitations argument and gave summary judgment, 
    dismissing the appellant's action.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In view of the narrow 
    issues before this court, it is unnecessary to review the facts in detail.  
    What follows appear to be the essential and undisputed facts.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant carried 
    on the practice of law in partnership with the respondent Ian W. Outerbridge 
    during 1987 and 1988.  Lexicom Systems Limited (“Lexicom”) was the management 
    firm for the Outerbridge practice. </span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Before the partnership 
    was formed, in July 1985, Lexicom sold furniture, fixtures, equipment, and 
    antiques used by Outerbridge in connection with his law practice (the “assets”), 
    appraised at over $400,000, to First City Capital Limited (“First City”) for 
    a purchase price of $300,000.  At the same time, First City leased the assets 
    back to Lexicom, and granted Lexicom an option to repurchase the assets for 
    $60,000 at the expiry of the three-year lease.  This financing transaction 
    provided Lexicom with working capital.  In view of the value of the assets, 
    the option clearly had a value in excess of the $60,000 required to redeem 
    the assets.  </span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In connection with 
    its partnership with Outerbridge, the appellant guaranteed Lexicom’s line 
    of credit with the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  On June 28, 1988, at a time when 
    it owed the Toronto-Dominion Bank approximately $360,000 Lexicom advised First 
    City that it was exercising the option and that title to the assets should 
    be transferred to the respondent OML.  OML is a company owned by Outerbridge’s 
    wife, and is related to both Lexicom and Outerbridge.  On July 4, 1988, the 
    assets were transferred to OML by First City, apparently for the stated purchase 
    price of $64,815 equal to the option price plus tax and transfer fees.  This 
    transfer was not disclosed to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant was 
    called upon to pay more than $350,000 pursuant to its guarantee to satisfy 
    Lexicom’s indebtedness to the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  On December 1, 1989, 
    Lexicom made an assignment for the general benefit of its creditors pursuant 
    to the provisions of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, 
    c. B&#8209;3, (the “<i>BIA</i>”).  The appellant proved its claim as a creditor 
    of Lexicom for the amount it had paid to the Toronto-Dominion Bank on the 
    guarantee.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Despite the transfer 
    of the assets to OML, they remained in Lexicom's possession until Lexicom’s 
    bankruptcy. In the fall of 1990, some of the assets were destroyed in a fire 
    in a warehouse where they were being stored. Lexicom's bankruptcy Trustee's 
    inquiries revealed that there was no insurance to cover the loss and, in the 
    absence of insurance or any other apparent source of recovery, the Trustee 
    took no steps to challenge the transfer of the assets by Lexicom to OML. </span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Unbeknownst to the 
    Trustee and the appellant, in May 1991 Outerbridge commenced an action for 
    damages for the loss and destruction of the assets.  The defendant in that 
    action had been working on a vehicle stored near the assets.  Although coverage 
    was denied, the named defendant was eventually found to be covered under an 
    insurance policy.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It was not until 
    February 1996 that the Trustee and the appellant learned of the Outerbridge 
    action.  Inquiries revealed that the action was being vigorously defended.  
    No steps were taken, either by the appellant or by the Trustee, with respect 
    either to the action or to the 1988 transfer to OML.  However, in July 1999, 
    a tentative settlement of Outerbridge's claim was reached and, as it appeared 
    there could be exigible proceeds, the appellant asked the Trustee to commence 
    proceedings to attack the 1988 transfer.  The Trustee refused, as there were 
    no funds available in Lexicom’s estate to commence the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant obtained 
    an order pursuant to s. 38 of the <i>BIA</i>, authorizing it to commence proceedings 
    in its own name.  This action was commenced on February 22, 2000, claiming 
    a declaration that the 1988 transfer was void as a fraudulent conveyance, 
    a declaration that the respondents held the assets or the proceeds therefrom 
    on trust for the appellant, and payment of $500,000 as compensation for the 
    loss of the assets.  Outerbridge subsequently was awarded damages in excess 
    of $500,000 in the action for the fire loss. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As indicated earlier, 
    the appellant moved for summary judgment on its claim under the <i>Fraudulent 
    Conveyances Act</i>.  The appellant also moved to amend the statement of claim 
    to include a claim for priority under the <i>Personal Property Security Act</i>, 
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 and for summary judgment on the claim as amended.  The 
    respondent brought a cross-motion to dismiss the claim on the grounds that 
    it was barred by the <i>Limitations Act</i>, or in the alternative, that it 
    was barred by laches.</span></p>
  <p style='

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The primary focus 
    of the proceedings before the motions court judge was the limitations argument.  
    She found that the claim under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act </i>was barred 
    by the six-year limitation period prescribed by s. 45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations 
    Act, </i>either as an action on a &quot;simple contract&quot; or as an &quot;action 
    on the case&quot;.  She also concluded that even if the action were not barred 
    by the statute, it would be barred by laches.  She noted, however, that &quot;[t]here 
    is no question in my mind that, had [the appellant's] claims not been barred 
    by the operation of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, [the appellant] would have 
    been able to make out [its] claims under both the [<i>Fraudulent Conveyances 
    Act</i>] and the [<i>Personal Property Security Act</i>]&quot;.</span></p>

  Act</i> does not apply to all civil actions, only to those that are specifically 
  enumerated.  As held by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.),</i> 
  (1992), 96 D.L.R. (4th) 289 at p. 329, the <i>Act</i> &quot;applies only to 
  a closed list of enumerated causes of action&quot;.  It follows that unless 
  a claim for relief under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> can be identified 
  as included within one of the causes of action enumerated in the <i>Limitations 
  Act</i>, the appellant's action is not subject to any statutory limitation period.<br>

    an action on &quot;a simple contract&quot;; (2) an action &quot;upon the case&quot;; 
    or (3) an action upon &quot;a specialty&quot;.  If the cause of action falls 
    within either of the first two possibilities, it is barred as having been 
    brought more than six years after it arose.  If it falls within the third 
    category, it is not barred.  A fourth possibility is that the Act simply does 
    not apply.</span></p>

    ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1994) at p. 124 states that there is no limitation 
    period governing claims under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>. The very 
    point at issue here did arise in <i>Re Abco Asbestos Co. Ltd., Carmichael 
    and Milne</i> (1981), 40 C.B.R. (N.S.) 250 (B.C. S.C.) where it was held that 
    the claim was caught by the residual, catch-all provision in the British Columbia 
    limitations statute, governing claims not specifically provided for.  As I 
    have noted, there is no similar provision in Ontario.</span></p>

    relief under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act </i>relates to a contract, 
    it is an action to set aside and nullify the contract, the very opposite of 
    asserting rights acquired by way of contract.  The source of the legal right 
    asserted is not the contract, but the statute.  The object of the action is 
    to void and defeat the rights and obligations the contract purports to confer.

    at p. 296: &quot;The forms of action we have buried, but they still rule us

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The action on the case was a derivation from 
    the action of trespass.  Maitland explained at p. 359 that all personal actions 
    branched out from trespass.  The writ of trespass contained the words “<i>vi 
    et armis contra pacem</i>”.  The need to allege violence necessarily limited 
    the scope of trespass, and gradually the clerks of Chancery allowed modified 
    versions of the writ that omitted the words “<i>vi et armis</i>”.  In these 
    instances, the plaintiff was said to bring an action “upon his case” or “upon 
    the special case”, the particular facts of which were set out in the writ.  
    By the end of the fourteenth century, a new and very flexible form of action 
    had evolved.  It became what Maitland described at p. 361 as “a sort of general 
    residuary action; much particularly, of the modern law of negligence developed 
    within it.”  Blackstone, <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>, vol. 
    3 (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co., 1897), at p. 122, described the action 
    on the case as “a universal remedy, given for all personal wrongs and injuries 
    without force; so called because the plaintiff’s whole case or cause of complaint 
    is set forth at length in the original writ.”  The writ of trespass was available 
    for immediate injury to person or property “but where there is no act done, 
    but only a culpable omission, or where the act is not immediately injurious, 
    but only by <i>consequence</i> and collaterally; there no action of trespass 
    <i>vi et armis</i> will lie, but an action on the special case, for the damages 
    consequent on such omission or act.”  Bacon’s <i>Abridgment</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> 
    ed. (London: J. &amp; W.T. Clarke Co., 1832) vol. 1 at p. 86 explained that 
    “where the law has made no provision, or, rather, where no general action 
    could be framed before-hand, (the ways of injuring, and methods of deceiving 
    being so various,) every person is allowed…to bring a special action on his 
    own case, which is liberal action.”</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The action on the case was general and flexible 
    and it allowed for the evolution of new claims based upon unintended and consequential 
    harm.  Much of the modern law of torts derived from the action on the case.  
    The actions for deceit and nuisance were developed as actions on the case, 
    as were the more modern actions of defamation and negligence.  The historical 
    evolution of the action on the case is canvassed in J.G. Fleming, <i>The Law 
    of Torts</i>, 8th ed. (Sydney: The Law Book Company, 1992) and L.N. Klar, 
    <i>Tort Law</i>, 2nd ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1996).  Both authors explain 
    that the action on the case developed to provide a remedy for cases where 
    the injury suffered was not “direct”, but was due to an omission or an act 
    only consequentially injurious to the plaintiff’s interests.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>There can be little 
    doubt, then, that the action on the case served as a residual category.  Indeed, 
    the action on the case also produced two highly significant off-shoots that 
    became independent actions, namely assumpsit, from which much of the modern 
    law of contract and restitution is derived, and trover, from which the modern 
    law of personal property evolved.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>When used in the 
    context of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, it would appear that the category of 
    &quot;action upon the case&quot; does retain something of its traditional 
    residual character.  To some extent, it serves as a catch-all or short-hand 
    expression to embrace personal actions for damages based upon breach of a 
    legal duty not otherwise caught by the <i>Act</i>.  Mew, <i>The Law of Limitations</i> 
    (Butterworths: Toronto, 1991) at p. 92, describes the common law action as 
    encompassing &quot;all actions that did not amount to trespass, namely, those 
    injuries that were neither forcible or direct, but only consequential.&quot;  
    When used in modern limitations legislation, Mew states that the term &quot;refers 
    to actions that were included in these traditional definitions, and are still 
    not otherwise described in the limitations statutes, and includes causes of 
    action sounding in both contract and tort.&quot;  This interpretation is supported 
    by the dictum of Strayer J. in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality)</i> v. <i>Canada</i>, 
    [1987] 3 F.C. 103 (T.D.), rev’d on other grounds [1989] 2 F.C. 562 (C.A.), 
    rev’d on other grounds [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762, holding that a restitutionary 
    action was an action upon the case within s. 45(1)(g):</span></p>

      to distinctions having their origin in the fourteenth century and their 
      significance in the forms of action which Anglo-Canadian law purportedly 
      abandoned over a century ago.  But the wording of the Ontario statute obliges 
      me to do so.  An “action upon the case” should in the context of a modern 
      statute be viewed somewhat as a residual category of action, which is indeed 
      a role not inconsistent with its original development.</span></div>

    it cannot be that the phrase &quot;action upon the case&quot; is a residual 
    category broad enough the capture <i>all </i>personal actions not otherwise 
    specified by the <i>Limitations Act</i>, for as I have already noted, it is 
    established on the highest authority that the <i>Act</i> contains no residual 
    provision.  One significant limit that would seem to flow from the origins 
    of the action on the case is that damages are a necessary element. The element 
    of damages was referred to by Blackstone at p. 123, where it is stated that 
    an action on the case could be brought for &quot;any special consequential 
    damage[s]…which could not be foreseen and provided for in the ordinary course 
    of justice&quot;.  Another essential element appears to be the allegation 
    of a legal duty and a breach of that duty.  In <i>Robert Simpson Co.</i> v. 
    <i>Foundation Co. of Canada</i> (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 97 (C.A.), Cory J.A., 
    considered the interpretation of s. 45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, 
    and suggested at p. 101 that the “three fundamental aspects” of an action 
    on the case were:</span></p>

    the cases in which actions grounded on a statute have been classified as actions 
    upon the case for limitation purposes, one finds that damages and the breach 
    of a legal duty have been essential elements.  <i>Thompson v. Lord Clanmorris</i>, 
    [1900] 1 Ch. 718 (C.A.) involved an action brought under The <i>Director's 
    Liability Act, 1890</i>, imposing liability on company directors for losses 
    suffered by reason of an untrue statements in a prospectus.  It was argued 
    that the action was barred by a two-year limitation period for &quot;all actions 
    for penalties, damages, or sums of money given to a party grieved, by any 
    statute.&quot;  The English Court of Appeal rejected that argument on the 
    ground that the statute created a legal duty, the breach of which gave rise 
    to a right of action. Vaughan Williams L.J. held at p. 727 &quot;what the 
    section really does is to give a new action on the case.  It creates a new 
    negative duty.&quot;</span></p>

    (1981), 20 C.P.C. 126 (Fed C.A.) dealt with an action for compensation for 
    the loss of the right to carry on a business flowing from the enactment of 
    a statute.  The plaintiff's claim was based on the principle established in 
    <i>Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R., </i>[1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 that a right of 
    action arises where a statute puts a party out of business without compensation.  
    The plaintiff commenced the action more than six years after the cause of 
    action arose and was met with the defendant’s argument that the claim was 
    barred by the <i>Statute of Limitations</i>, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 168, s. 2.  
    In response, the plaintiff contended that the claim was for a &quot;specialty&quot; 
    and that the applicable limitation period was twenty years.  The plaintiff's 
    argument was rejected by Ryan J.A. who characterized the action as one &quot;upon 
    the case&quot;.  The plaintiff's claim was for an unliquidated sum and, in 
    Ryan J.A.'s view, at p. 139 &quot;actions for unliquidated sums based on causes 
    of action provided by statute&quot; are included in the category of actions 
    upon the case.</span></p>

    stretches the admittedly elastic category of &quot;action upon the case&quot;

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This provision neither 
    creates a right of action that sounds in damages, nor does it create a legal 
    duty, the breach of which gives rise to a cause of action.  The plaintiff 
    in a fraudulent conveyance action does not assert the breach of a legal duty, 
    but rather asserts that the debtor has improperly placed assets beyond the 
    reach of ordinary legal process.  Any entitlement to the payment of money 
    or damages in favour of plaintiff exists independently and apart from the 
    action to set aside the fraudulent conveyance.  The <i>Act</i> gives no right 
    of damages nor compensation for loss.  It provides for a declaratory type 
    proceeding that has the effect of nullifying transfers and conveyances of 
    the debtor's property so as to make possible execution of the creditor's debt.

    more, delay in asserting a claim does not give rise to the equitable defence 
    of laches.  A party relying on the defence must show a combination of delay 
    and prejudice.  As was stated in the often quoted passage from the leading

    <div class=Section1><span

      laches must be resolved as a matter of justice as between the parties, as

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I respectfully disagree 
    with the conclusion of the motions court judge that the respondents have made 
    out case for granting summary judgment on the basis of laches.  It seems to 
    me that, at the very least, there is a triable issue on whether it would be 
    inequitable for the appellant's claim to proceed.  While the motions court 
    judge correctly stated that prejudice must be shown, she did not specify the 
    nature of the prejudice suffered by the respondents that would justify barring 
    the claim.  It may perhaps be inferred from her reasons that she considered 
    Outerbridge's pursuit of the claim for damages for the loss of the assets 
    in the fire to be such a change of position giving rise to prejudice that 
    made it inequitable for the appellant to pursue the fraudulent conveyance 
    claim.  If that is the basis for a finding of prejudice, I do not agree with 
    it.  It seems to me that the respondents' conduct vis-à-vis both the trustee 
    and the appellant gives rise to a live issue as to whether it would be inequitable 
    for the appellant now to assert the claim.  As I have concluded that on the 
    present record, neither party is entitled to summary judgment, I need say 
    no more. </span></p>
  <p><b><i><span

    appellant entitled to summary judgment?</span></i></b></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant submits 
    the motions court judge's statement in her reasons that but for the limitations 
    defence, it would have made out its claim constitutes a finding in its favour, 
    sufficient to support its claim for summary judgment.  I do not agree.  It 
    was common ground on this appeal that the merits of the summary judgment motion 
    were not fully argued or considered on the motion.  As the limitations argument 
    raised a discrete legal point capable of ending the litigation, the parties 
    and the motions court judge focussed entirely on it as a preliminary point 
    and the merits of the summary judgment motion were not considered.  Accordingly, 
    it would be inappropriate for this court on appeal to treat the quoted passage 
    from the motions court judge's reasons as constituting a finding capable of 
    supporting summary judgment in the appellant's favour.  This, of course, is 
    without prejudice to the right of the appellant to seek summary judgment if 
    so advised. </span></p>
  <p><b><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Issue 4  Did the motions court judge err 
    in refusing to award the respondents costs?</span></i></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As I have concluded 
    that the motions court judge erred in awarding the respondents summary judgment, 
    the cross-appeal as to costs must be dismissed as moot.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Accordingly, I would 
    allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the motions court judge in 
    its entirety.  The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal and of 
    the proceedings before the motions court judge. The cross-appeal as to costs 
    is dismissed without costs.</span></p>
