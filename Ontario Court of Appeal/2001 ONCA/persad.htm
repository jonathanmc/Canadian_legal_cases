  <p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice David G.

  <h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ORAL   ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted and sentenced to 
    three years’ imprisonment on four arson-related charges following his trial 
    before Humphrey J. sitting without a jury.  He appeals against his convictions 
    on three grounds and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant submits that the trial 
    judge erred in concluding that his s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter</i> rights were not 
    infringed when the police obtained samples collected by the fire marshal at 
    the scene without first obtaining a search warrant.  In support of this ground 
    of appeal, the appellant relies mainly on <i>R. v. Colarusso</i> (1994), 87 
    C.C.C. (3d) 193, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada released after 
    the seizure in question, but before his trial. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Regardless of the correctness of the trial 
    judge’s ruling with respect to the s.&nbsp;8 violation, we are of the view 
    that the trial judge did not err in refusing to exclude the evidence under 
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  There was no evidence at trial that the fire 
    marshal had acted outside the scope of her statutory authority when she collected 
    the samples that were sent to the Centre of Forensic Science for analysis.  
    The samples, and the test results derived from their analysis, were not conscriptive 
    evidence and it is conceded that their admission did not affect the fairness 
    of the trial.  There is no dispute that the police were acting in good faith 
    when they obtained these samples.  Further, when advised of the <i>Colarusso</i> 
    decision, the police returned the samples and obtained a search warrant to 
    validate the subsequent seizure.  In these circumstances, it was certainly 
    open to the trial judge to conclude that the admission of the evidence would 
    not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  We would therefore 
    not give effect to this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant submits that the trial 
    judge erred in reversing the onus of proof when, following the completion 
    of the evidence at trial, he asked defence counsel to make submissions on 
    who, other than the accused, might have set the fire.  This comment, made 
    during an exchange between the trial judge and counsel, in our view amounted 
    to no more than a legitimate direction to defence counsel to focus his submissions 
    on the central issue in the case, namely the identity of the arsonist.  We 
    see no merit to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellant submits that trial counsel 
    was incompetent in arguing the s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter </i>application on a basis 
    that was doomed to fail.  It is submitted that trial counsel failed to marshal 
    evidence that was available to support the s.&nbsp;8 application, and also 
    prejudiced the appellant’s position at trial when the incendiary nature of 
    the fire was admitted at the conclusion of the unsuccessful <i>Charter</i> 
    application. It is further argued that trial counsel could and should have 
    brought a constitutional challenge to the <i>Fire Marshals Act</i>, R.S.O. 
    1990, c.&nbsp;F-17, particularly having regard to the decision in <i>Colarusso</i>.   
    It is submitted that the sections of the <i>Fire Marshals Act</i> allowing 
    for the entry, search and seizure powers of the fire marshal should have been 
    challenged on the basis that the legislation was <i>ultra vires</i> the province 
    of Ontario or, in the alternative, that the investigative powers contained 
    in the <i>Fire Marshals Act</i> violated s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Charter.</i> 
    It is submitted that there is a reasonable probability that this alternative 
    basis for the s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter</i> application would have proven successful 
    and that the evidence would have been excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2) thereby 
    affecting the verdict.  </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to this ground of appeal, the 
    comments of the Supreme Court of Canadain <i>R. v. G.D.B</i>. (2000), 143 
    C.C.C. (3d) 289 are particularly instructive.  The Supreme Court reviewed 
    the general approach to take when determining a claim of incompetent representation.  
    Both a performance component and a prejudice component must be considered, 
    with the prejudice component requiring the establishment of a miscarriage 
    of justice. Where it isapparent that no prejudice has occurred, the Supreme 
    Court cautions that it would usually be undesirable for appellate courts to 
    consider the performance component of the analysis. In accordance with this 
    approach, we consider firstly whether there was a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are not satisfied that a miscarriage of 
    justice resulted from counsel’s actions or omissions.  <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>In 
    our view, even if the suggested constitutional challenge succeeded, it would 
    not affect the result with respect to the exclusion of the evidence under 
    s.&nbsp;24(2). The legal foundation for the fire marshal's authority would 
    disappear, but based on the record before us, a finding that the fire marshal 
    had acted in good faith would be inevitable. Further, the appellant has not 
    discharged the burden of establishing that the other relevant considerations 
    under s.&nbsp;24(2) would be different in any material way. In view of our 
    conclusion that no miscarriage of justice resulted from counsel's conduct 
    of the trial,&nbsp;we find it inappropriate to embark on an analysis of counsel's 
    performance. Consequently, it is not necessary to consider the&nbsp;motion 
    to introduce fresh evidence.</span></span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, the appeal against conviction 
    is dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the appeal against sentence, 
    it is our view that there is no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed.  
    Leave to appeal the sentence is granted but the appeal against sentence is 
    dismissed. </span></p>
