<p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Robert Abbey with 
  a jury dated May 23, 1997 and from sentence imposed June 23, 1997.</p>
<h3>BORINS J.A.:</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue in this appeal is the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge 
  to the jury on reasonable doubt in a case that was tried before the decisions 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320 
  and <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144.  Although charged with first degree 
  murder on the basis of an alleged contract killing, the appellant was convicted 
  of second degree murder after a two month trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was a large body of evidence consisting of exhibits and forensic 
  material that confirmed that the appellant had the deceased’s blood on his clothing, 
  in his car and on his knife.  The jury also had in evidence a total of five 
  videotaped statements of the appellant to the police that were played in court 
  during the trial, and which the Crown submits were riddled with inconsistencies.   
  A jailhouse informant testified that the murder was a contract killing.  As 
  the jury did not convict of first degree murder, the Crown submits that it implicitly 
  rejected the evidence of the jailhouse informant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the appellant admitted that he was present in the area just prior 
  to and immediately after the deceased was beaten and killed, he maintained that 
  he left just as the fatal beating was getting underway.  He claimed the fatal 
  beating was committed by another party.  There was also testimony of jailhouse 
  informants that in large measure was consistent with the physical evidence and 
  the statements of the appellant.  The testimony of one jailhouse witness, Patrice 
  Adams, was supported by a series of approximately 12 hours of audiotape evidence, 
  that was reduced to a transcribed synopsis and filed in evidence.  The only 
  real issues for the jury’s consideration were: (1)&nbsp;the extent to which 
  the appellant was the principal or a party to the fatal beating; and (2)&nbsp;whether 
  this was a contract killing that constituted first degree murder.  The appellant 
  did not testify.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the only issue concerns the trial judge’s charge on reasonable doubt, 
  it is appropriate that it be set out in full.  However, before doing so I would 
  observe that defence counsel raised no objection at trial to this aspect of 
  the trial judge’s instructions which required over six hours to deliver and 
  fills 200 pages of the trial transcript.  The only objections raised by defence 
  counsel related to the trial judge’s review of the evidence.  In my view, with 
  the exception of the impugned aspect of the charge, it represents a model charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is what the trial judge, Abbey J., said about reasonable doubt:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I want now, continuing with my discussion of general principles that have 
      application in a case of this kind, to explain to you the presumption of 
      innocence which applies in any criminal trial.  Simply put, the presumption 
      of innocence means that an accused person is presumed to be innocent until 
      the Crown has satisfied you, beyond a reasonable doubt, of his guilt.  That 
      is a presumption which remains with the accused and for his benefit from 
      the beginning of the case until the very end of the case.  The onus or the 
      burden of proving the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests 
      always on the Crown and it never shifts.  There is no burden on an accused 
      person to prove his innocence.  The Crown must prove, beyond a reasonable 
      doubt, that the accused person is guilty of the offence with which he is 
      charged before he can be found guilty.  If you have, therefore, any reasonable 
      doubt as to whether the accused in this case committed the offence with 
      which he is charged and the offences that I will discuss with you, then 
      it is your duty to give to this accused the benefit of that doubt and to 
      find him not guilty.</p>
    <p>You will appreciate, I know, that when we are dealing with matters of human 
      relations, it is not always possible to prove anything to an absolute or 
      to a mathematical certainty and that is not the obligation that rests upon 
      the Crown.  The burden upon the Crown is to prove the guilt of an accused 
      person beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond a shadow of a doubt.  <i>When 
      I use the words “reasonable doubt”, I use those words in their ordinary 
      and natural meaning and not as a legal term having any particular legal 
      connotation</i>.  A reasonable doubt is an honest doubt, a fair doubt based 
      upon reason, based upon common sense and the evidence.   It is not imaginary, 
      it is not frivolous and it is not a doubt that may be used by a juror in 
      order to avoid the responsibility of making a decision in the case.</p>
    <p>It must, as well, be a reasonable doubt in regard to an essential element 
      of the crime and not in regard to a non-essential matter.  It must not be 
      a doubt which is born of sympathy or prejudice as I have discussed with 
      you, against either the accused or the victim.  To put the matter shortly, 
      it must be a reasonable doubt based upon the evidence introduced in this 
      case and neither speculative, fanciful, illusionary, imaginary or the result 
      of sympathy or prejudice.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s position, relying on <i>Lifchus </i>and <i>Starr</i>, 
  is that in failing to “locate the reasonable doubt standard above the probability 
  standard”, the trial judge’s charge constituted non-direction amounting to misdirection, 
  thereby requiring this court to set aside his conviction and to direct a new 
  trial.  It is the respondent’s position that the trial judge’s charge on reasonable 
  doubt, when considered in the context of judgments delivered by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada subsequent to <i>Lifchus</i> and <i>Starr</i>, was in substantial 
  compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> model charge.  The respondent submits that 
  the charge, when read as a whole, does not give rise to a likelihood that the 
  jury misapprehended the meaning of reasonable doubt and thereby applied an incorrect 
  standard of proof in convicting the appellant.  As I agree with the respondent’s 
  submission, I would, therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Since the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Lifchus</i> 
  and <i>Starr</i> there have been many judgments of this court, and other appellate 
  courts, that have considered the adequacy of jury instructions on reasonable 
  doubt delivered before the release of <i>Lifchus</i> that, for obvious reasons, 
  did not track the model charge recommended by that case.  As well, subsequent 
  to <i>Starr</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada has decided five cases where a 
  pre-<i>Lifchus</i> charge was challenged as giving rise to the reasonable likelihood 
  that the jury had misapprehended the correct standard of proof:  <i>R. v. Beauchamp</i>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 720; R<i>. v. Avetysan</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745; <i>R. v. Russell</i>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731; <i>R. v. Pan; R. v. Sawyer</i> (2001), 200 D.L.R. (4th) 
  577 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Rhee</i>, 2001 S.C.C. 71.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With the exception of <i>Rhee</i>, which was released on October 19, 
  2001, these judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada have now informed the majority 
  of the appellate court opinions across Canada that have reviewed pre-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  instructions on reasonable doubt.  In reviewing these cases, it is apparent 
  that some appellate courts have come to different results on the adequacy of 
  similar, or identical, instructions on reasonable doubt found in model instructions 
  in general use before the <i>Lifchus</i> judgment.  However, it is apparent 
  from these authorities that there has now emerged a generally accepted standard 
  of review that an appellate court is to apply when considering whether, in a 
  particular case, a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> instruction on reasonable doubt contains 
  misdirection or non-direction warranting a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Doherty J.A. of this court has described the standard of review in his 
  dissenting reasons in <i>R. v. Feeley</i> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 455-456 
  (Ont. C.A.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In <i>Lifchus</i>, at p. 14, Cory J. was careful to stress that no one 
      verbal formulation was required to adequately convey the meaning of reasonable 
      doubt.  Later cases have stressed that the adequacy of the reasonable doubt 
      instruction must be determined by the overall meaning conveyed by the instruction 
      and not by the particular words used:  <i>R. v. Avetysan</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
      745 at 748; <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144 at 264-65.</p>
    <p>The task for appellate courts reviewing reasonable doubt instructions given 
      prior to <i>Lifchus</i> is to determine whether those instructions are in 
      substantial compliance with the principles set down in <i>Lifchus</i>:  
      <i>R. v. Starr, supra</i>, at p. 269; <i>R. v. Russell</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
      731 at pp. 741-42.  Substantial compliance is measured by reference to the 
      overall effect on the instruction.  As Iacobucci J. said in <i>R. v. Russell, 
      supra</i>, at p. 743:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p> The appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> 
          principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of 
          that decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge, language that 
          will likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts recommended 
          in <i>Lifchus</i>, is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment 
          call on whether the deficiencies in the charge fall below the <i>Lifchus</i> 
          standard such as to cause serious concern about the validity of the 
          jury’s verdict, and lead to the conclusion that the accused did not 
          have a fair trial.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Beauchamp</i>, speaking for the court, Iacobucci J. reiterated 
  the standard of review at pp. 728-729:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As noted in <i>Starr</i>, <i>Avetysan</i>, and <i>Russell</i>, the criterion, 
      in reviewing a trial judge’s instructions to the jury, remains one of “substantial 
      compliance” with the principles set out in <i>Lifchus</i> (<i>Starr, supra</i>, 
      at paras. 238 and 243).  An appellate court must assess whether “the essential 
      elements of a fair and accurate instruction on reasonable doubt are present 
      and have been properly explained” (<i>Starr, supra</i>, at para. 233), such 
      that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the 
      proper burden and standard of proof.  The charge in this case was delivered 
      prior to <i>Lifchus</i>.  However, it was reviewed by the Quebec Court of 
      Appeal after <i>Lifchus</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Iacobucci J. did not sit in <i>Avetysan</i> in which the standard of 
  substantial compliance was stated by Major J. at pp. 752-753:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Starr, supra</i>, stated that in considering a jury charge given prior 
      to the release of <i>Lifchus</i>, the test is whether there was substantial 
      compliance with the principles set out in that case.  It is worth stressing 
      that the principles in <i>Lifchus</i> are to be applied in a manner that 
      will encourage improvements in the wording of jury charges, but do not vitiate 
      past charges where the language used, although no longer preferred, meets 
      the substantially correct test.  A jury charge given before or after the 
      <i>Lifchus</i> decision should not be faulted merely for imprecise language.  
      Rather, as was stated in <i>Starr, supra</i>, it should be reviewed to determine 
      whether it substantially complies with the <i>Lifchus</i> principles.  As 
      applied in <i>Russell, supra</i>, and <i>Beauchamp, supra</i>, the basic 
      question remains:  Does the charge, read as a whole, give rise to a reasonable 
      likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of proof?  
      If not, the charge is adequate.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Pan</i>, Arbour J. considered a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> reasonable 
  doubt instruction in the light of <i>Lifchus, Starr</i> and the subsequent decisions 
  from the Supreme Court of Canada.  At p.&nbsp;631 she stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While some of the required elements in <i>Lifchus</i> were omitted from 
      Watt J.’s charge and some of the terms that should have been avoided were 
      included, I do not think that the deficiencies are such that they “cause 
      serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to the 
      conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial”:  <i>Russell, supra</i>, 
      at para. 23.  For the reasons given in the recent cases from this Court, 
      I agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that this ground of appeal 
      should be dismissed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury charge in this case is also similar to that in <i>Rhee</i>, 
  decided by the Supreme Court of Canada subsequent to the hearing of this appeal.  
  As in this case, the jury charge in <i>Rhee</i> was delivered without the benefit 
  of the model charge in <i>Lifchus</i>.  In a decision reported at (2000), 134 
  B.C.A.C. 135, a majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal found the charge 
  to be in substantial compliance with <i>Lifchus. </i> However, two judges dissented 
  and held that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to give the term 
  “reasonable doubt” its plain and natural meaning, which error was compounded 
  by the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury that more than probable guilt 
  was required for a conviction.  Thus, the issue before the Supreme Court of 
  Canada, like the issue in this appeal, was whether an instruction to the jury 
  that reasonable doubt is not a legal term having some special connotation, as 
  compounded by the failure to instruct the jury that more than probable guilt 
  is required for a conviction, amounted to a reversible error in the circumstances 
  of that case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbour J., on behalf of the majority of the court, dismissed the appeal.  
  She was satisfied that although certain aspects of the charge were deficient 
  in light of <i>Lifchus</i>, other parts of the charge dealing with credibility 
  and circumstantial evidence served to clarify the proper definition of reasonable 
  doubt so that there could be no reasonable concern that the jury may have convicted 
  by applying the wrong standard of proof.  Based upon her review of <i>Lifchus</i> 
  and the subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada that considered 
  reasonable doubt instruction, she defined the standard of review of pre-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  charges.  The following passage from the headnote of the case found at 2001 
  S.C.C. 71 accurately reflects Arbour J.’s reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Appellate review of a charge to the jury is not a mechanical task, but 
      rather an assessment of whether the deficiencies in the charge, as compared 
      to the <i>Lifchus</i> standard, cause serious concern about the jury’s verdict.  
      The key question is whether the charge, in the context of the entire trial, 
      substantially complies with the principles expressed in <i>Lifchus</i> so 
      that as a whole it does not give rise to the reasonable likelihood that 
      the jury misunderstood the correct standard of proof.  When reviewing a 
      pre-<i>Lifchus</i> charge there is no particular mistake or omission that 
      will automatically constitute a reversible error in and of itself, nor is 
      there an additional instruction that will immediately cure a particular 
      shortcoming.  Where the majority of a charge complies with <i>Lifchus</i> 
      principles, but the trial judge has omitted to expressly indicate that more 
      than probable guilt is required, or has made that omission in conjunction 
      with another error, such as defining reasonable doubt as having a plain 
      and ordinary meaning, these shortcomings can be countered by other parts 
      of the jury instructions that serve to make the proper definition of reasonable 
      doubt more clear.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the basis of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, the test 
  of substantial compliance with the principles of <i>Lifchus</i> rests on whether 
  the charge, when assessed as a whole, conveys an instruction on reasonable doubt 
  that avoids any reasonable likelihood that the jury could have misunderstood 
  its content.  The standard of substantial compliance is not to be applied mechanically.  
  Reversible error will not result inevitably from either the failure to include

  </span> In this appeal, the only error that the appellant assigns to the trial 
  judge’s instruction on reasonable doubt is its failure to “locate the reasonable 
  doubt standard above the probability standard”.  This was also the complaint 
  in <i>Beauchamp</i>, which Iacobucci J. addressed in the passage from his reasons 
  which I have reproduced in paragraph 10.  In support of his position, counsel 
  focused on the italicized portion of the trial judge’s charge reproduced in 
  paragraph 5.</p>

  </span> A submission that the trial judge erred in failing to expressly compare 
  and distinguish the criminal standard of proof from the civil standard of proof 
  was one of the alleged errors made by the trial judge in instructing the jury 
  on reasonable doubt in <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (Ont. 
  C.A.).  In instructing the jury, the trial judge used language similar to that 
  used by the trial judge in this case which the appellant submits constitutes 
  misdirection.  In <i>Phillips</i>, the trial judge stated:  “When I speak of 
  reasonable doubt, I use the words in their ordinary, natural meaning, not as 
  a legal term having some special connotation.”  In <i>Phillips</i>, the appellants 
  also contended that the trial judge erred in describing reasonable doubt as 
  an “ordinary term” and not a “legal term having some special connotation”.  
  Similar wording was used in this case, which counsel contends was disapproved 
  in <i>Lifchus</i>.</p>

  </span> In <i>Phillips</i>, as in this appeal,  defence counsel at trial raised 
  no objection to the impugned instruction.  To Moldaver J.A., who wrote the decision 
  of the court, this indicated that counsel “were satisfied that the jury fully 
  appreciated the high standard of proof needed to support a conviction and it 
  serves as a yardstick against which to measure the contrary position now advanced 
  for the first time on appeal”. (p. 359)  The same can be said of the position 
  taken at the trial by defence counsel in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In considering the adequacy of the trial judge’s instruction, Moldaver 
  J.A. considered the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Starr, Beauchamp, 
  Russell</i> and <i>Avetysan</i>.  He went on to state at pp. 360-361:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The second concern relates to the description of reasonable doubt as an 
      &quot;ordinary term&quot;, not a &quot;legal term having some special connotation&quot;. 
      In light of <i>Lifchus, supra</i>, and its progeny, it is clear that this 
      language should not have been used. It is equally clear however, that standing 
      alone, this error could not realistically have misled the jury into applying 
      the civil standard of proof. Rather, its impact, if any, must be assessed 
      in context, having regard to the instruction as a whole.</p>
    <p>That brings me to the third concern, namely, the failure on the part of 
      the trial judge to expressly compare and distinguish the criminal standard 
      of proof from the civil standard of proof.</p>
    <p>Manifestly, the impugned instruction does not track the language used by 
      Cory J., at p.13 of <i>Lifchus, supra</i>, to differentiate the criminal 
      and civil standards of proof. In and of itself, however, that is not fatal. 
      The crucial issue is whether the instruction, read as a whole, raises a 
      reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard 
      of proof.</p>
    <p>Measured against that yardstick, I am satisfied that the language used 
      by the trial judge adequately distinguished the criminal standard of proof 
      from the civil standard of proof.</p>
    <p align="center">…..</p>
    <p>Read as a whole, I am satisfied the jury would have appreciated the high 
      standard of proof needed to support a conviction. Expressed somewhat differently, 
      it is speculative to think that this jury would have been left with the 
      impression that proof on a balance of probabilities or anything close to 
      it was sufficient to justify a conviction.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Reading the trial judge’s instructions as a whole and assessing the 
  effectiveness of the instructions, rather than particular words that might have 
  been omitted or included, I am satisfied that the trial judge conveyed to the 
  jury that a very high standard of proof had to be achieved before they could 
  convict the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the trial judge in this case, like the trial judge in <i>Phillips</i>, 
  should not have said that he was using the words “reasonable doubt” in “their 
  ordinary and natural meaning and not as a legal term having any particular legal 
  connotation”, on reading his instructions as a whole it is clear that this error, 
  standing alone, could not realistically have misled the jury into applying the 
  civil standard of proof.  As I have observed, this lengthy 200 page charge, 
  delivered in a case that on its evidence was relatively complex, was a model 
  charge.  The jury took their time in reaching a verdict, and from the few questions 
  that they asked it is clear that they understood the two issues that they were 
  required to decide.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> What stands out from reading the instructions is the care taken by the 
  trial judge to make it clear to the jury that a very heavy burden rested on 
  the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Throughout his instructions, 
  in discussing the elements of the offence, and other matters on which the Crown 
  had the burden of proof, the trial judge consistently described the degree of 
  proof necessary to satisfy the burden of proof as proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. For example, he did so when discussing the defence of alibi at p. 1543 
  of the transcript, in explaining circumstantial evidence at pp. 1488-1491, in 
  explaining the difference between murder and manslaughter at pp. 1551-1553 and 
  p. 1641, in explaining parties to an offence at pp. 1630-1637, in outlining 
  the available verdicts at pp. 1643-1644, in explaining the use of a verdict 
  sheet at pp. 1664-1669, and on several other occasions.  These accurate instructions 
  on reasonable doubt as it pertains to these issues reinforced the specific charge 
  on reasonable doubt.  Counsel for the respondent stated that the trial judge 
  used the expression “beyond a reasonable doubt” on 75 occasions throughout his 
  charge.  A good example of the trial judge’s emphasis on the burden of proof 
  is found at p. 1561 in what he reminded the jury when they returned to court 
  following the noon recess of the day on which he delivered his instructions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Secondly, I would like you to bear in mind as I have now said previously 
      also, it is the burden upon the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 
      doubt, not the burden of the accused to refute it.  Even if you disbelieve 
      all of the evidence in this case which may favour the accused, you must 
      consider that which remains of the evidence, hold it up against the prosecution’s 
      burden of proof and only find guilt upon an offence in the event that the 
      evidence satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a 
      party to that offence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the trial judge’s instructions, when read as a whole, conveyed 
  the core meaning of the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It 
  was in substantial compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> principles.  I am satisfied 
  that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the proper 
  burden and standard of proof.  Moreover, I have no serious concern about the 
  validity of the jury’s verdict, with the result that I am satisfied that the 
  appellant had a fair trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant seeks leave to appeal, and if leave is granted, appeals 
  from his sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 12 
  years.  Given the paramount sentencing principles of denunciation and specific 
  and general deterrence, as well as the aggravating circumstances surrounding 
  the commission of the offence, I am satisfied that the trial judge did not err 
  in extending the period of parole eligibility beyond the statutory period of 
  10 years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the foregoing reasons, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  
  Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
