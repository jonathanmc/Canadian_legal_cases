<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Alan C.R. Whitten dated June 30, 2000 
  (7 C.P.R. (4th) 193). </p>
<p>CARTHY J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The plaintiff, Pro-C Limited (&quot;Pro-C&quot;), recovered a judgment 
  at trial for $450,000 in general damages and $750,000 in punitive damages for 
  infringement of a trade-mark by the defendant, Computer City, Inc. The plaintiff&#146;s 
  trade-mark &#147;Wingen&#148;, covering its software product, was adopted by 
  the defendant in association with a non-competitive product (personal computers) 
  sold in the United States. Pro-C used the trade-mark as the name of its website 
  and when Computer City's American customers sought information or service they 
  mistakenly arrived at Pro-C's website. Pro-C alleged that their site was so 
  overwhelmed that it could not service its own customers and its business was 
  ruined.</p>
<p>[2] Computer City's position on appeal is that the Trade-Marks Act, R.S.C. 
  1985 c.T-13 (the &quot;Act&quot;), does not embrace the conduct complained of 
  and that, in any event, no damages were proved. Pro-C cross-appeals for increased 
  damages.</p>
<p>[3] Pro-C is a small Waterloo, Ontario, company operated from the home of its 
  principal, selling source code generators for software to be used in the production 
  of computer programs. Computer City is a large American corporation operating 
  many retail stores across the United States and, at the relevant time, five 
  stores in Canada.</p>
<p>[4] In 1994 Pro-C purchased the trade-mark WINGEN, registered in both Canada 
  and the United States for &#147;computer programs used to generate programs 
  for Windows.&#148; The commercial purpose was to suggest an association with 
  Microsoft's &#147;Windows&#148; software. Pro-C was not alone with that thought. 
  In 1996, Computer City developed an in-house line of computers that it called 
  Wingen. From the outset of production of these computers the appellant was aware 
  of the registrations of the trade-mark Wingen owned by Pro-C. The computers 
  were offered for sale in all the United States outlets but, due to costs in 
  crossing the border, in none of the Canadian stores.</p>
<p>[5] This litigation springs from the use of Internet websites rather than competition 
  between products. Pro-C had an interactive website &#147;www.wingen.com&#148; 
  which it used to sell its software, transfer it to a purchaser and provide service. 
  Computer City established a passive site &#147;www.computercity.com&#148;, used 
  to advertise and provide product information. Being a passive website, Computer 
  City's site did not have interaction with customers -- it used the site only 
  to post information. A phone number was included for receiving orders but no 
  sales were made directly to Canada or in Canada. </p>
<p>[6] There is no directory for website names and a purchaser wishing information 
  about a product would either guess the domain name or use keywords on a search 
  engine. In this fashion many Computer City customers seeking information or 
  service for their purchased computers mistakenly found their way to Pro-C&#146;s 
  website. They saw the label Wingen on their units and sought out a site in that 
  name rather than Computer City. Pro-C&#146;s evidence at trial was that over 
  a period of some months it received over 100,000 hits (visits) per month by 
  Computer City&#146;s customers. Because of the unwanted traffic to its website, 
  Pro-C alleged that it could no longer service its clients or effectively sell 
  its programs and that its business was destroyed. Its statement of claim is 
  based solely on infringement of its trade-mark in Canada.</p>
<p>Liability</p>
<p>[7] The trial judge saw this as a case requiring him to expand the traditional 
  protections of trade-mark law to accommodate the emerging technology and, in 
  particular, the Internet and websites with world wide reach. In extensive reasons, 
  reported at 7 C.P.R. (4th) 193, he sets forth a step-by-step analysis of the 
  Act and jurisprudence under it to reach a conclusion that the respondent had 
  established a trade-mark infringement. He saw this as a problem to be resolved 
  in contemporary terms, recognizing the international nature of trade and media 
  communications. In his concluding words, &#147;The determination of &#145;use&#146; 
  in Canada requires a holistic approach.&#148;</p>
<p>[8] The appellant argues that the trial judge made six fundamental errors each 
  of which undermines the traditional functions of the Act in its day-to-day application. 
  In effect, the appellant says that the trial judge was misguided in his effort 
  to embrace the Internet within the protections of the Act without regard to 
  the carefully crafted requirements of that Act. I agree with the appellant, 
  but it is unnecessary to deal with all six of the points of error. It is sufficient 
  to conclude that there was no &#147;use&#148; of the trade-mark in Canada in 
  association with wares to deny the respondent a claim under the Act.</p>
<p>[9] The first error of the trial judge was in using s. 19 of the Act as the 
  foundation of his reasoning. That section reads: </p>
<p>19. Rights conferred by registration &#150; Subject to sections 21, 32 and 
  67, the registration of a trade-mark in respect of any wares or services, unless 
  shown to be invalid, gives to the owner of the trade-mark the exclusive right 
  to the use throughout Canada of the trade-mark in respect of those wares or 
  services. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[10] This section clearly refers to the use in Canada of the trade-mark in 
  association with the wares or services described in the trade-mark registration. 
  The computer hardware being sold by the appellant was not sold in Canada and 
  cannot be considered as &#147;computer programs used to generate programs for 
  Windows&#148; (the description in the respondent&#146;s trade-mark registrations). 
  Thus, before even considering &#147;use&#148;, s.19 has no application to the 
  facts of this case.</p>
<p>[11] If there was an infringement under the Act it would have to be under s.20 
  which reads:</p>
<p>20. (1) Infringement &#150; The right of the owner of a registered trade-mark 
  to its exclusive use shall be deemed to be infringed by a person not entitled 
  to its use under this Act who sells, distributes or advertises wares or services 
  in association with a confusing trade-mark or trade-name, but no registration 
  of a trade-mark prevents a person from making</p>
<p>(a) any bona fide use of his personal name as a trade-name, or</p>
<p>(b) any bona fide use, other than as a trade-mark,</p>
<p>(i) of the geographical name of his place of business, or</p>
<p>(ii) of any accurate description of the character or quality of his wares or 
  services, </p>
<p>in such a manner as is not likely to have the effect of depreciating the value 
  of the goodwill attaching to the trade-mark.</p>
<p>(2) Exception &#150; No registration of a trade-mark prevents a person from 
  making any use of any of the indications mentioned in subsection 11.18(3) in 
  association with a wine or any of the indications mentioned in subsection 11.18(4) 
  in association with a spirit.</p>
<p>[12] Infringement under this section is dependent upon &#147;use&#148; of the 
  registered mark. In normal parlance the word &#147;use&#148; is very broad and 
  would include advertising on the Computer City website. Under the Act this is 
  the case for services but, importantly, not for wares.</p>
<p>[13] The word &#147;use&#148; throughout the statute is governed by s. 4, reading:</p>
<p>4. (1) When deemed to be used &#150; A trade-mark is deemed to be used in association 
  with wares if, at any time of the transfer of the property in or possession 
  of the wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves 
  or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner 
  so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to 
  the person to whom the property or possession is transferred. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>(2) Idem &#150; A trade-mark is deemed to be used in association with services 
  if it is used or displayed in the performance or advertising of those services.</p>
<p>(3) Use by export &#150; A trade-mark that is marked in Canada on wares or 
  on the packages in which they are contained is, when the wares are exported 
  from Canada, deemed to be used in Canada in association with those wares.</p>
<p>[14] Computer City's passive website could not constitute a use in association 
  with wares because no transfer of ownership was possible through that medium. 
  In Syntex Inc. v. Apotex Inc. (1984), 1 C.P.R. (3d) 145 at 151 (F.C.A.) Stone 
  J.A. speaks to a stronger case for infringement in these terms:</p>
<p>The respondents put their case that the flyer constitutes a &#147;use&#148; 
  of [their trade-mark] in this way: &#133; (a) The flyer is not simply an advertisement; 
  it is a binding &#147;offer&#148; made by the Appellant pursuant to which its 
  customers are expected to purchase and effect delivery to them of the Appellant&#146;s 
  product. (b) The order form at the bottom of the flyer is the means by which 
  the [Canadian] accepts the offer and, when completed and mailed, obtains the 
  product. (c) The flyer is an integral part of the act or method of transferring 
  both property and possession and constitutes notice of association referred 
  to in s.4 of the Trade-Marks Act. &#133;</p>
<p>I have difficulty seeing how this argument could be sustained at trial &#133; 
  In order to show that the appellant has made use of [the plaintiff/respondent&#146;s 
  trade-mark] &#133; the respondents will have to show that the trade-mark is 
  so associated with the appellant&#146;s wares in the flyer that notice of such 
  association would be given to the person to whom the property in or possession 
  of wares is transferred at the time of such transfer. &#133; which is the critical 
  point in time &#133; [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[15] Without further analysis of the trial judge&#146;s reasons, or the other 
  points of appeal, I am satisfied that there was no &#147;use&#148; in Canada 
  by the appellant of the respondent&#146;s trade-mark and that the action for 
  infringement must fail.</p>
<p>[16] The format for relief for this type of loss may exist outside the Act 
  in proper circumstances. It is incidental that the plaintiff has a registered 
  trade-mark. No wares competed in the marketplace and the damage, if damage there 
  be, would have been the same if the name of the website did not have trade-mark 
  protection. If a party intentionally or negligently causes injury and the ingredients 
  for establishing a tort can be proved, then the new technology of the Internet 
  and websites can be readily accommodated. It is much more sensible to apply 
  tort principles to accommodate new technologies than to distort statutory trade-mark 
  rights.</p>
<p>[17] Pro-C's argument was in part directed to Computer City's failure to produce 
  documents and, in particular, those associated with its sales of computers. 
  We are asked to infer from the failure to produce that there were sales in Canada 
  of computers bearing the trade-mark Wingen, and thus that the arguments against 
  &#147;use&#148; in Canada have been met. The trial judge did not draw that inference 
  and I am not prepared to do so. Pro-C's counsel wrote a letter requesting documents 
  early in the proceeding and was told that the defendant had no documents other 
  than those produced. No steps were taken to compel production and the respondent 
  did not even conduct an oral discovery of the appellant. The shares of Computer 
  City (Canada) were sold to a conglomerate during these proceedings and it might 
  be that the business records were transferred to the new owner. No effort to 
  seek third party production was made.</p>
<p>[18] In these circumstances it does not seem appropriate to fill in the major 
  holes in the respondent&#146;s proof of its claim by an inference against the 
  appellant, particularly because there are no rulings, even at trial, indicating 
  impropriety concerning production.</p>
<p>Damages</p>
<p>[19] Pro-C has cross-appealed for increased damages and, of course, that must 
  be dismissed. </p>
<p>[20] If it were necessary to deal with damages I would unhesitatingly set aside 
  the trial judge&#146;s awards of general and punitive damages. </p>
<p>[21] The trial judge&#146;s reasons open with the observation that the plaintiff&#146;s 
  expert, Mr. Meijer, has no experience in the valuation of trade-marks, used 
  financial statements prepared long after the relevant dates and was largely 
  reliant for assumptions on Mr. Johnson, Pro-C's principal. He then concludes 
  that the statements &#147;could not provide any meaningful predictors for the 
  evolution of an entirely new product&#148; (trial reasons: at p. 209, &para; 
  55). </p>
<p>[22] He then observes &#147;it cannot be said that the plaintiff has actually 
  proved a loss of revenue. &#133; The same comments can be made with respect 
  to the calculation of a loss of revenues for a &#133; product launch.&#148; 
  (p. 210, &para;&para; 58-59). Then, he finds no development costs were proved, 
  no foreign language rewrite justified and that it would be &#147;foolhardy&#148; 
  to attribute significance to correspondence concerning a potential sale of the 
  business (p. 213, &para; 73). Finally, under the heading &#147;Conclusion&#148;, 
  the trial judge states &#147;The losses claimed are unsupported. They are, if 
  anything, mystical calculations&#148; (p, 214, &para; 79).</p>
<p>[23] After that extensive analysis, each step of which involved findings of 
  fact which I adopt, the trial judge surprisingly concluded that there was a 
  business disruption and, without any reference to evidence, fixed the loss at 
  $450,000.</p>
<p>[24] In my view, the trial judge should have found that the plaintiff failed 
  to meet the onus of proving damages. This was not a case where the difficulty 
  of proof was such that the trial judge should make an unaided assessment. The 
  facts concerning damages were all available and in the hands of the plaintiff. 
  If they could not be moulded into anything but a mystical claim the conclusion 
  must be that damages were not proved. </p>
<p>[25] As to punitive damages, it suffices to observe that, accepting the factual 
  findings of the trial judge and, assuming liability, I would not consider the 
  conduct of the defendant, appellant, to be so &#147;malicious, oppressive and 
  high-handed that it offends the court&#146;s decency&#148; and thus deserving 
  of a punitive judgment award. See Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, 
  [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130.</p>
<p>[26] I would allow the appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal, set aside the judgment 
  below and dismiss the claim with costs. The appellant should have the costs 
  of the appeal.</p>
