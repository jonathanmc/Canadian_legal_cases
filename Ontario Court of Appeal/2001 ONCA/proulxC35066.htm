<p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from 
  the judgment of Justice James M. Spence dated August 30, 2000.</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US>BORINS J.A.:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The only issue in this appeal is the liability of the directors 
  of a corporation to its employees “for all debts not exceeding six months’ wages 
  that become due and payable while they are directors for services performed 
  for the corporation” under s. 131(1) of the <i>Ontario Business Corporations 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (“OBCA”).  On the employees’ motion for partial 
  summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Spence 
  J. held that the directors were liable to reimburse the employees for expenses 
  they incurred on behalf of the corporation in carrying out their contracts of 
  employment with the corporation, which had ceased to operate.  The directors 
  have appealed, contending that the motion judge erred in his interpretation 
  of s. 131(1) of the OBCA.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the 
  appeal.</p>
<h1><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Background</span></u></h1>

  </span></span> The facts on which the motion judge relied are brief and are 
  not in dispute.  Indeed, the directors did not cross-examine the employees on 
  their affidavits filed in support of their motion and failed to file any responding 
  evidence.</p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents were hired by Sahelian Goldfields Inc. (“Sahelian”) 
  to provide their services at the corporation’s mine in West Africa.  Typical 
  of the provisions for the remuneration of the employees are those contained 
  in the contract between the respondent Roy and Sahelian:</p>

  </span></span> The employees worked for the corporation until it failed and 
  was unable to pay their salaries, vacation pay and expenses which they had incurred 
  in carrying out their employment duties, such as air fare and food and lodging 
  while at the mine site.  The appellants were directors of Sahelian during all 
  relevant times.</p>

  </span></span> Consequently, the employees commenced an action against Sahelian 
  and its directors to recover unpaid wages, vacation pay and expenses that they 
  had incurred while performing their employment contracts.  Their claim against 
  the directors is based on s. 131(1) of the OBCA which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>131.(1)     </b><span lang=EN-US>The directors of a corporation are 
      jointly and severally liable to the employees of the corporation <i>for 
      all debts not exceeding six months’ wages that become payable while they 
      are directors for services performed for the corporation</i> and for the 
      vacation pay accrued while they are directors for not more than twelve months 
      under the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, and the regulations thereunder, 
      or under any collective agreement made by the corporation. </span>[Emphasis 
      added.]      </p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thereafter, the employees moved for partial summary judgment 
  against the directors for a total of $83,527.47 for vacation pay and a total 
  of $60,556.86 for unpaid expenses.  Before the motion judge, the directors contested 
  their liability for unpaid expenses on the ground that expenses do not constitute 
  wages within the meaning of       s. 131(1) of the OBCA.  The motion judge rejected 
  the directors’ contention and awarded the employees the amounts claimed for 
  vacation pay and unpaid expenses.</p>

  reasons for his decision:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Counsel made helpful submissions.  The plaintiffs provided affidavit evidence 
      as to the factual matters.  Defendants did not cross-examine or submit their 
      own material as to the facts.  From the submissions, I cannot conclude I 
      should not rely on the Plaintiffs’ material.  As to the points of law, the 
      court can order interest, as the Plaintiffs submit, and the corporate expenses 
      are properly to be regarded as wages since they were to be compensation 
      in respect of services performed.  Accordingly, summary judgment to go for 
      the plaintiffs as to vacation pay, expenses and interest.  The bonus matter 
      was not pursued for this motion.  Interest is to be per the <i>Courts of 
      Justice Act</i>.  Costs of $2,000 payable forthwith to the plaintiffs.</p>

<h1><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Analysis</span></u></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before this court the directors maintained their contention that 
  they were not liable to pay the employees’ unpaid expenses on the ground that 
  the expenses do not constitute wages within the meaning of s. 131(1) of the 
  Act.  They focused on the clause “all debts not exceeding six months’ wages 
  . . . for services performed for the corporation”, and submitted that as expenses 
  do not constitute wages, they incurred no liability under s. 131(1).  As neither 
  debts nor wages are defined in the OBCA, they provided a number of definitions 
  of these terms from dictionaries and other legislation which they contended 
  supported  their position.  In addition, they relied on the decision of the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Barrette v. Crabtree Estate </i>(1993), 101 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 66 (S.C.C.).  As I will explain, on the view that I hold of the proper 
  interpretation of s. 131(1) there is no need to determine whether expenses fall 
  within the meaning of wages.  This is because expenses which an employee incurs 
  in the course of providing services for a corporation constitute a debt of the 
  corporation for which its directors are liable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I will explain, the directors have misconstrued the language 
  of s. 131(1) of the OBCA.  The issue is not whether the employees’ claim for 
  the unpaid expenses constitutes a claim for wages.  Rather, the issue is whether 
  their claim for unpaid expenses constitutes a debt for services which they performed 
  for the corporation.  Thus, on the facts of this appeal there is no need to 
  determine whether “wages” can include expenses incurred by an employee on behalf 
  of his or her employer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As Arnup J.A. pointed out in <i>Zavitz v. Brock</i> (1974), 3 
  O.R. (2d) 583 at 588, the first legislation protecting employees of a corporation 
  whose wages were unpaid, and imposing a limited liability on its directors to 
  pay the wages, was s. 52 of the<i> Ontario Joint Stock Companies Letters Patent 
  Act</i>, <i>1874</i> (Ont.), c. 35.  As such, it is an exception to the principle 
  that normally directors are not liable for the debts of a corporation absent 
  an express statutory provision imposing such liability on them.  Significantly, 
  the clause “all debts . . . due for services performed for the company” in s. 
  52 of the 1874 legislation is virtually identical to the clause “all debts . 
  . . for services performed for the corporation” in s. 131(1) of the OBCA.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A provision similar, but not identical to s. 131(1) of the OBCA<i>,</i> 
  imposing liability on directors of federally incorporated corporations for unpaid 
  wages of employees is contained in s. 119 of the <i>Canada Business Corporations 
  Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (“CBCA”).  Section 119(1) of the CBCA contains 
  language similar to that of s. 131(1) of the OBCA, imposing liability for “all 
  debts . . . payable to each employee for services performed for the corporation”.  
  Both provisions limit the amount of a director’s liability to six months’ wages.  
  For more than a century, these provisions have been the subject of judicial 
  scrutiny.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Zavitz</i> this court interpreted s. 73(1) of the <i>Corporations 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1960, c.71 which, although somewhat different from s. 131(1) 
  of the OBCA, contained the clause “all debts due . . . for services performed 
  for the company”.  From the reasons of Arnup J.A. it is clear that liability 
  imposed by s. 131(1) is not limited to the unpaid wages of an employee.  At 
  p. 590 he stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Some further limited assistance is gained from the fact 
      that the right of a person in the prescribed class to sue is a right to 
      claim “for all debts due . . . for services performed for the company, not 
      exceeding six months wages, and for the vacation pay. . . .”</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Mesheau v. Campbell</i> (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 702 (C.A.) 
  this court interpreted s. 114(1) of the <i>Canadian Business Corporation Act</i>, 
  1975 (Can.), c.33, which is identical to s. 119(1) of the CBCA.  At p. 704 Weatherstone 
  J.A. interpreted s. 114(1) as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The history of the section and its manifest purpose make 
      it perfectly clear that the words “all debts” are modified by the phrase 
      “for services performed for the corporation” and are subject to the quantitative 
      limit of six months’ wages payable to each such employee.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=No style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>This interpretation was 
  applied in <i>Mills-Hughes v. Raynor</i> (1988), 47 D.L.R. (4th) 381 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have stated, the appellants relied on the decision of the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Barrette</i> in support of their submission they 
  are not liable for payment of the respondents’ expenses.  In my view, this reliance 
  is misplaced as the reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé J. in <i>Barrette</i> confirm 
  the interpretation which this court has placed on s. 131(1) of the OBCA and 
  s. 119(1) of the CBCA in the cases to which I have referred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Barrette</i>, as in <i>Mesheau</i>, the Supreme Court was 
  required to interpret s. 114(1) of the 1975 federal Act.  The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé 
  J. are instructive.  She traced the remedy provided by s. 114(1) to a New York 
  state law dating from 1848.  The earliest version of s. 114(1) appeared in s. 
  49 of the <i>Canada Joint Stock Companies Letter Patent Act, 1869</i>, S.C. 
  1869, c. 13, which, as in the earliest version of the Ontario legislation, contained 
  the clause “all debts . . . due for services performed for the Company”.  At 
  p. 74 she stated that the purpose of the legislation is to place “the liability 
  for certain debts of the corporation to its employees on the shoulders of the 
  directors”, adding at p. 75:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The primary purpose of the remedy provided for in s. 114(1) 
      C.B.C.A. is to protect employees in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency 
      of the corporation. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>L’Heureux-Dubé J. continued at p. 78:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In this regard, there are two important parameters in connection with employees’ 
      remedy. First, the directors’ maximum liability is set at six months’ wages.  
      This parameter provides a ceiling which, while establishing a quantitative 
      limit to the liability of the directors, does not in so doing determine 
      the nature of the amounts covered by the action.  The nature of the sums 
      which Parliament had in mind must be considered instead from a second angle: 
      regardless of quantum, the amounts claimed must be “debts . . . for services 
      performed for the corporation”.  I therefore cannot subscribe to the appellant’s 
      arguments that the first question to be answered is whether the job loss 
      compensation falls within the broad concept of “wages”.  In the context 
      of s. 114(1)<i> </i>C.B.C.A., the word “wages” refers solely to the quantum 
      of the director’s liability and cannot in itself guide the court in disposing 
      of the present case.</p>
    <p>The parameter which is at the heart of the appeal is therefore not the 
      concept of “wages”, but the expression “debts . . . for services performed 
      for the corporation”.  In thus limiting the debts covered by the remedy, 
      Parliament indicated that directors will not be personally liable for all 
      debts assumed by the corporation to its employees.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At p. 81 L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated the following 
  as the two critical factors in defining the remedy provided by the legislation:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Section 114(1) C.B.C.A. establishes a quantitative limit on the amounts 
      for which directors will be personally liable, and that is a sum equivalent 
      to six months’ wages.  Directors are therefore in a position to know in 
      advance the maximum amount of their potential liability in the event the 
      company becomes bankrupt or insolvent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>. 
  . . . .</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In the absence of additional legislative <i>indicia</i>, 
      the performance of services by the employee remains the cornerstone of the 
      director’s personal liability for debts assumed by the corporation.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>At p. 82 she concluded that “the only bench-mark provided 
  by the wording of s. 114(1) CBCA is the performance by the employee of services 
  for the corporation”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, it is clear from the above authorities that under 
  s. 131(1) of the OBCA and s. 119(1) of the CBCA directors are not liable for 
  all debts owed by a corporation to its employees.  Rather, liability will be 
  imposed only where the debts are for “services performed for the corporation”.  
  The maximum amount for which a director may be held liable is an amount equivalent 
  to six months wages payable to each employee.  Although not relevant to this 
  appeal, I would note that under the OBCA, unlike the <i>CBCA</i>, a director 
  has an additional liability for up to twelve months vacation pay of each employee.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Based on the foregoing analysis of s. 131(1) it was unnecessary 
  for the motion judge to decide whether the employees’ unpaid expenses were “properly 
  to be regarded as wages”.  All that had to be decided was whether the expenses 
  they incurred constituted a debt owed to them for services that they had performed 
  for the corporation.  On the uncontested evidence of the employees there is 
  no doubt that the expenses which the employees claimed resulted from the performance 
  of their individual employment contracts with the corporation and were included 
  within the provisions for remuneration contained in the contracts.  The expenses 
  constitute a debt of the corporation owing to the employees for services which 
  they had performed for the corporation within the meaning of s. 131(1) of the 
  OBCA which the directors are required to pay.  Although my analysis differs 
  somewhat from that of the motion judge, I am satisfied that he reached the correct 
  result.</p>
