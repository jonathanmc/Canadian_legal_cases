style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted 
  of one count of  conspiracy to commit the offence of possession of stolen property 
  and one count of fraud. He was sentenced to fifteen months’ imprisonment on 
  each charge, to be served concurrently. The appellant appealed against the two 
  convictions only. He has served his sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant submitted that a reversible 
  error was made when the trial judge read in its entirety, and provided the jury 
  with a copy of, s.&nbsp;354(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C-46 
  that contained an unconstitutional evidentiary presumption. The impugned provision 
  was provided to the jury as part of a notebook that contained the indictment, 
  a flow chart relating to the evidence, other provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  and blank pages for note-taking. The section provided to the jury read as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>354.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proceedings in respect of an 
      offence under subsection&nbsp;(1), evidence that a person has in his possession 
      a motor vehicle the vehicle identification number of which has been wholly 
      or partially removed or obliterated or a part of a motor vehicle being a 
      part bearing a vehicle identification number that has been wholly or partially 
      removed or obliterated <u>is</u>, in the absence of any evidence to the 
      contrary, <u>proof</u> that the motor vehicle or part, as the case may be, 
      was obtained, and <u>that such person had the motor vehicle or part, as 
      the case may be, in his possession knowing that it was obtained</u>,</span></p>
    <p>(a)            by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by 
      indictment; or</p>
    <p>(b)            by an act or omission anywhere that, if it had occurred 
      in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable by indictment.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This court held, in <i>Re Boyle and The Queen</i> 
  (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), that while the presumption that the vehicle 
  was obtained by the commission of an indictable offence was constitutionally 
  valid, the presumption of guilty knowledge was not constitutional. This case 
  was discussed during the pre-charge conference and the trial judge agreed that 
  the unconstitutional portion would have to be deleted from the material given 
  to the jury. However, in giving her instructions to the jury, the trial judge 
  inadvertently read all of s.&nbsp;354(2) and neglected to delete the unconstitutional 
  portion of the section.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>While the trial judge erred in reading and providing 
  to the jury the full text of s.&nbsp;354(2), we are of the view that this error 
  caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of 
  this case. We note the following: </span></p>

      <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Immediately 
      after reading s.354(2), the trial judge instructed the jury on its meaning 
      in a manner that was entirely consistent with this court’s holding in <i>Boyle.</i></span></p>

      <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Throughout the 
      charge, the trial judge gave emphatic and correct instructions on the Crown’s 
      burden of proof in relation to all the elements of the offence, including 
      knowledge. </span></p>

      <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crown counsel 
      submitted, and we agree, that it is highly unlikely that the jury applied 
      this provision to the other two charges against the appellant. If the jury 
      simply ignored the trial judge’s instructions on the meaning of s.354(2) 
      and relied on the text as contended, they would have noted that s.354(2) 
      applied only “in proceedings in respect of an offence under subsection (1)”. 
      Further, the fraud charge did not require knowledge that the vehicle had 
      been repaired with stolen parts but simply knowledge that the vehicle had 
      been in an accident and repaired. Proof of such knowledge could not have 
      been derived from the statutory presumption.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant submitted that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to warn the jury that evidence of the co-accused’s post-offence 
  conduct was not admissible against him.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At the beginning of the charge, before dealing 
  with each particular count, the trial judge explained a number of general concepts, 
  one of which was “consciousness of guilt”. The trial judge then described four 
  incidents the jury could consider as probative of a guilty conscience, all involving 
  actions by a co-accused. Two of those incidents occurred after the conspiracy 
  was ended and hence were not admissible against the appellant under the co-conspirator’s 
  exception to the hearsay rule. The appellant submitted that the jury may have 
  nonetheless used this evidence against him because the trial judge never expressly 
  cautioned the jury on the limited use that could be made of this evidence when 
  she made reference to it. He submitted further that the problem was exacerbated 
  by the trial judge’s reference to the Crown’s theory sometime later in the charge. 
  The trial judge noted that the Crown’s theory included a consideration of these 
  incidents but did not go on to distinguish between the incidents in terms of 
  their admissibility as against each accused.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We do not agree that the trial judge failed 
  to adequately caution the jury as contended. The charge must be considered as 
  a whole. In our view, it would have been clear to the jury from the context 
  that the specific reference to the four incidents in question was made in a 
  general way to explain the concept of post-offence conduct. It is later in the 
  charge that the trial judge explained how the jury could use the various items 
  of evidence against each accused. While the trial judge did not expressly refer 
  to the two incidents in question in that later portion of the charge, she clearly 
  instructed the jury that what one person says or does is not admissible as evidence 
  against another unless it fell within the limited exception for acts and declarations 
  done and made in furtherance of the conspiracy. She also instructed the jury 
  that, unless she pointed out otherwise, acts and declarations after the offence 
  was complete, that is after February 1st, 1993, would not fall within that exception. 
  We are not persuaded that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to make further 
  specific references to these items of evidence. It is noteworthy that no objection 
  was made in this respect at trial.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellant submitted that Crown counsel 
  improperly cross-examined him in a manner that resulted in an unfair trial. 
  He argued that Crown counsel improperly suggested that he was using knowledge 
  obtained from disclosure and the preliminary inquiry to concoct his testimony. 
  He argued further that Crown counsel improperly relied on defence counsel’s 
  failure to put certain questions to the complainants in support of the contention 
  that the appellant was fabricating his evidence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We see no merit in the first part of the argument.  In our view, 
  the questions asked by Crown counsel with respect to the disclosure and the 
  preliminary inquiry would not have had the effect contended by the appellant. 
  However, while we agree that Crown counsel should not have confronted the appellant 
  with his counsel’s failure to put certain questions to the complainants, we 
  are not satisfied that the cross-examination, when considered in the context 
  of the appellant’s entire testimony, affected the fairness of the trial. The 
  impugned passage was an isolated instance in the course of an otherwise appropriate 
  cross-examination.</p>

  appeal.</span></p>
