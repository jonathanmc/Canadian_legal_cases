  </span> Christopher Ramsaroop is a former president of the Students’ Administrative 
  Council of the University of Toronto. On January 26<sup>th</sup>, 2001 he enrolled 
  as a part-time student at the university. He filed nomination papers seeking 
  to run for a position on the university’s Governing Council on the same day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Chief Returning Officer rejected Mr. Ramsaroop’s nomination based 
  on a provision of the <i>Election Guidelines</i> enacted by the Governing Council, 
  which requires that a candidate be “a member of the constituency in which he 
  or she is nominated throughout the election period.” There is no dispute that 
  the election period began on January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2001, being the first 
  day for filing nominations. Mr. Ramsaroop clearly did not meet this requirement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On an application for judicial review brought by Mr. Ramsaroop, a single 
  judge of the Superior Court quashed the decision of the Chief Returning Officer. 
  The judge found that the provision in the <i>Election Guidelines</i> which requires 
  a candidate to be a member of his constituency “throughout the election period”, 
  conflicts with a section in The <i>University of Toronto Act, 1971<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></i> which provides that “[e]very 
  student is eligible for election to the Governing Council whether or not he 
  has attained the age of eighteen years.” The judge declared the offending portion 
  of the <i>Election Guidelines</i> provision to be of no force and effect. The 
  Governing Council of the University of Toronto appeals from that decision.</p>

  </span> Mr. Ramsaroop was enrolled at the University of Toronto as a full-time 
  student from September 1993 through to April 1998. He was elected as President 
  of the Students’ Administrative Council in April 1998. He served in that position 
  on a full-time basis for one year. </p>

  </span> At the beginning of 2001 Mr. Ramsaroop decided to enrol at the university 
  as a part-time student and take one of the two courses he still requires to 
  complete his degree. Due to financial constraints and the eventual need to obtain 
  a grant from the university, Mr. Ramsaroop was unable to enrol until January 
  26<sup>th</sup>, 2001, which was also the last day for filing nominations for 
  election to student positions on the Governing Council.</p>

  </span> The Chief Returning Officer wrote to Mr. Ramsaroop on January 30<sup>th</sup>, 
  2001. She advised him that his “nomination form for the part-time undergraduate 
  student constituency ha[d] been invalidated because [he was] not a member of 
  that constituency at the beginning of the nomination period…” She added: “[t]his 
  is a technical invalidation and is not open to appeal.”</p>

  </span> The Governing Council of the University of Toronto is constituted under 
  The <i>University of Toronto Act, 1971</i>. It is composed of 50 members who 
  are elected or appointed from particular constituencies such as teaching staff, 
  administrative staff, full-time undergraduate students, part-time undergraduate 
  students. Relevant sections of the <i>Act</i> relating to the Governing Council 
  include the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(4) No person shall serve as a member of the Governing Council unless he 
      is a Canadian citizen.</p>
    <p>(5) Every student is eligible for election to the Governing Council whether 
      or not he has attained the age of eighteen years.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>(8) A member of the governing Council appointed by the President or elected 
      ceases to hold office if he ceases to be eligible under the clause under 
      which he was appointed or elected.</p>

    <p>(14) the government, management and control of the University… and of the 
      property, revenues, business and affairs thereof, … are vested in the Governing 
      Council, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Governing 
      council has power to,</p>

  </span> The Governing Council has set out procedures to govern the election 
  of its members in <i>Election Guidelines</i>, first promulgated in 1972. It 
  approved the current <i>Election Guidelines</i> on December 14, 2000. Relevant 
  provisions include the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chapter I – <u>AUTHORITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS</u></p>
    <p>1. In the event of any conflict between these Guidelines and the provisions 
      of the <u>University of Toronto Act, 1971</u> as amended, the provisions 
      of the <u>Act</u> prevail.</p>
    <p><u>Chapter IV - REGULATIONS</u></p>
    <p><u>a) Nominations </u></p>
    <p><u>ii) Eligibility of Candidate </u></p>
    <p>A candidate must be a Canadian citizen and a member of the constituency 
      in which he or she is nominated throughout the election period. …</p>
    <p><u>xii) Technical Invalidation</u></p>
    <p>Despite the existence of the correction procedure, nomination papers which 
      are obviously in error or on their face are not appropriately verifiable 
      or are not accompanied by the other papers required by these Guidelines 
      and by the Chief Returning Officer will be automatically invalidated on 
      technical grounds by the Chief Returning officer. Such decision will be 
      final. The correction period detailed in section xii) does not apply.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Judicial Review Application</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Leave was granted for Mr. Ramsaroop’s application for judicial review 
  to be heard by a single judge of the Superior Court based on urgency, in accordance 
  with s. 6(2) of the <i>Judicial Review Procedure Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Ramsaroop’s sole submission on the application for judicial review 
  was that the provision of the <i>Election Guidelines,</i> which effectively 
  requires a student to be registered as a student as of a certain date prior 
  to the nomination deadline, conflicts with the broad eligibility right established 
  by s. 2(5) of The <i>University of Toronto Act, 1971, </i>and therefore cannot 
  stand.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The presiding judge explained his reasons for granting the application 
  as follows:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>[10] …I am persuaded that the alleged conflict exists and 
  that the eligibility provision in the Act must take precedence over that contained 
  in the <i>Guidelines</i>. The authority conferred upon the Governing Council 
  by section 2 (14) (nb) of the <i>Act</i> does not include the authority to restrict 
  the broad and unqualified provision regarding eligibility clearly and unambiguously 
  set out in the <i>Act</i>. It follows, in my view, that every person who is 
  a student at any time during the period when nominations were open and files 
  his nomination form within that period is entitled to be a candidate for election.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>[11] A statutory right to stand for election, in the context 
  of this case, is a right to participate in the democratic process by which The 
  University of Toronto is governed. It reflects the will of the Legislature and 
  it cannot be varied or restricted in any way by a measure taken by the Governing 
  Council without statutory authority. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I respectfully disagree with the Superior Court judge’s conclusion that 
  there is a conflict between Chapter IV (a) (ii) of the <i>Election Guidelines</i> 
  and s. 2(5) of The <i>University of Toronto Act, 1971</i>. In reaching the conclusion 
  that a conflict exists, The Superior Court judge appears, in paragraph 10 of 
  his Reasons, to have equated the concepts of eligibility and entitlement. In 
  my opinion, s. 2(5) of the <i>Act </i>is restricted on its face to eligibility 
  and does not address the concept of entitlement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Chapter IV (a) (ii) of the <i>Election Guidelines</i> is a provision 
  aimed primarily at establishing a connection with one’s constituency. It is 
  rationally connected with the power of the Governing Council to determine the 
  manner and procedure of elections pursuant to s. 14 (nb) of the <i>Act. </i>I 
  do not see any conflict between that provision and the eligibility provision 
  contained in s. 2(5) of the<i> Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, although “eligible” clearly signifies that a candidate is 
  able to run for office, it does not also imply entitlement. In other words, 
  it does not mean that someone who is eligible to be a candidate under s.2(5) 
  is thereby entitled to be a candidate whether or not that person meets other 
  properly set criteria.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> “Eligible”, as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary 1999, means 
  “fit or proper to be chosen (for an office or position).” Black’s Law Dictionary, 
  7<sup>th</sup> ed., lists that meaning as well as: “legally qualified for an 
  office, privilege or status”. Notably, neither meaning connotes creation of 
  entitlement, or of a right.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These dictionary definitions are consistent with prior judicial interpretation 
  of the concept of eligibility. Horridge J. stated the following, in <i>Morriss 
  v. Winter</i>, [1930] 1K.B. 243:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think the question is a difficult one, but I have come to the conclusion 
      that if it was intended to confer a legal right on prisoners clearer and 
      stronger words than “eligible for remission” would have been used. The statute 
      itself only enacts that rules may be made, and rr. 36 and 37 (A) do not 
      say, as they might have done, that the prisoners shall be entitled to a 
      remission.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fact that the Governing Council is given specific power by s. 14 
  (nb) of the <i>Act </i> “to determine the manner and procedure of election of 
  its members” also supports the proposition that s. 2(5) of the <i>Act </i>is 
  not an entitlement section. Of necessity, virtually any procedural rule governing 
  the conduct of an election will derogate to some degree from any entitlement 
  a person has to be a candidate for office<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>. The Legislature cannot be presumed 
  to have given on the one hand that which it allows to be diminished on the other. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Ramsaroop submitted in this court that the requirement that a student 
  be registered on or before an arbitrary date prior to the nomination deadline 
  is not rationally connected with the power afforded to the Governing Council 
  by s. 14 (nb) of the <i>Act </i>to “determine the manner and procedure of election 
  of its members”. He submitted that this requirement is distinguishable from 
  other requirements in the <i>Election Guidelines</i>, both in terms of its connection 
  with the powers of the Governing Council and in terms of conflict with s. 2(5) 
  of the <i>Act,</i> because it focuses on the status of a person as a student 
  whereas the other requirements address what are clearly election procedures.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Again, I disagree. The <i>Act</i> specifically addresses the specific 
  constituencies the Governing Council is intended to reflect and spells out the 
  required representation from each constituency. A mechanism for establishing 
  sufficient connection with a particular constituency to permit a candidate to 
  represent it is therefore an essential component of election procedure. The 
  gravamen of the impugned provision is connection with a constituency, not status 
  as a student. As such, it falls squarely within, and is rationally connected 
  to, the power of the Governing Council. Moreover, it does not in any way conflict 
  with s. 2(5) of the <i>Act,</i> which confirms the eligibility of every student 
  to be elected as a member of the Governing Council, but does not address how 
  a sufficient connection with a particular constituency is to be established.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In these circumstances, it is unnecessary that I determine whether the 
  decision of the Chief Returning Officer is entitled to deference. It follows, 
  that in my view, there was no basis for interfering with the decision of the 
  Chief Returning Officer or for declaring a portion of the <i>Election Guidelines</i> 
  to be invalid. I would accordingly allow the appeal and dismiss the application 
  for judicial review.</p>
