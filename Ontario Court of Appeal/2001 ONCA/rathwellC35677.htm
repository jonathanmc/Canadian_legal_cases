'>On appeal from the order of Justice Bernard Manton dated December 22, 2000</p>
<h3 style='line-height:200%' align="center">ENDORSEMENT<br>
  <b>Released Orally: September 7, 2001</b></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant company contends that the respondent’s claim cannot be 
  litigated because an arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute 
  on the principles set out in <i>Weber</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The parties have changed their positions.  In 1997 the union filed a 
  grievance claiming that the dispute was arbitrable.   The appellant then took 
  the position that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction and that the Union had 
  to seek relief before the Unemployment Insurance Commission.  The arbitrator 
  held that he had no jurisdiction over the grievance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Union sought redress from the Commission but was denied relief.  
  It then issued its statement of claim.  The appellant brought an earlier motion 
  contending first that the court had no jurisdiction over the Union’s claim because 
  that jurisdiction resided solely with the Commission, and second that the Commission’s 
  ruling raised an issue estoppel against the Union.  This court disagreed with 
  the appellant’s contention holding that the Commission did not have jurisdiction 
  to make the decision it made and that the Union’s claim could go forward in 
  the courts.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant now contends that the Union’s claim must be arbitrated 
  and that the court has no jurisdiction over it.  The appellant argues that the 
  arbitrator’s decision is not binding because neither party put before him the 
  provision of the earlier collective agreement that expressly spells out the 
  trade off between the ongoing medical benefits and the waiver of the employees’ 
  right to share in the premium reductions.  The appellant submits that had the 
  arbitrator been aware of this earlier provision he would have come to a different 
  conclusion.  The appellant says that issue estoppel cannot confer jurisdiction 
  on the court, a jurisdiction precluded by the application of <i>Weber</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We do not need to reach <i>Weber</i> because the question whether the 
  dispute should be arbitrated is res judicata.  Issue estoppel applies to the 
  arbitrator’s decision because the parties were the same, the issue was the same 
  and the decision was final.  The subsequently discovered evidence, the provision 
  of the earlier collective agreement, cannot affect the application of issue 
  estoppel at least absent the appellant showing that it could not have put their 
  evidence before the arbitrator by the exercise of due diligence. The appellant 
  has not met the due diligence requirement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even however, if the arbitrator’s decision does not raise an issue estoppel, 
  the earlier decision of this court operates to make the position now asserted 
  by the appellant <i>res judicata</i>.  Although the appellant, for its own reasons, 
  may not have wanted to raise the <i>Weber</i> point on the earlier motion and 
  appeal, the principle of res judicata requires it to have done so.  A party 
  cannot re-litigate a claim that it could have raised in an earlier proceeding.  
  Finality demands no less.  By the time of that earlier motion and appeal all 
  the facts including the earlier provision of the collective agreement, were 
  known to both parties.  Res judicata therefore applies.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons the appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
