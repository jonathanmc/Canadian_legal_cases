    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The consent judgment that was the centerpiece 
    of the dispute between the appellants and the respondents required the appellants 
    Carbone and Horvath to “prepare and submit to the City of Toronto all necessary 
    plans for the removal of the beams supporting the glass roof structure at 
    297 King Street West, Toronto from the easterly wall of the one story concrete 
    block edition at the rear of 299 King Street West, Toronto on or before November 
    30, 1999”.  It appears that the sticking point in the carrying out of the 
    consent agreement was the requirement by the City of Toronto that before issuing 
    a building permit it would require that the plans submitted include work already 
    done for which no permit had been obtained and provide for the removal of 
    the support beams in the westerly wall between 297 and 295 King Street West 
    unless the permission of the owner of 295 King Street West could be obtained 
    to the construction as built on its property. No such permission was obtained.</span></p>

    J. was entitled to look to prior discussions to identify mutual intent.  It 
    is clear that the intent was to file plans that would solve the problem at 
    hand.  The language of the consent judgment did not accomplish this.  This 
    rectification was justified.</span></p>
