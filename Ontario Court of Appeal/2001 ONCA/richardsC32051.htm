<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Peter A.

<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery with a weapon – 
  count five involving an appliance store known as Caplan’s in October, and count 
  one involving a Ministry of Transportation (“MOT”) office in November.  He was 
  sentenced to four years’ imprisonment on each count to be served consecutively.  
  The appellant concedes his conviction and sentence with respect to the MOT robbery 
  were proper.  The alleged errors with respect to conviction relate to the Caplan 
  robbery.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, 
  appeals from the total sentence of eight years.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to properly 
  separate the evidence as between the two counts of robbery.  We do not agree 
  that the trial judge made that error.  He relied on the totality of the evidence, 
  including surveillance and wiretap evidence, to show the association between 
  the appellant and the other persons involved in the robbery as confirmatory 
  of the identification evidence of the appellant as being involved in the Caplan 
  robbery as well as the MOT robbery.  In any event, the identification evidence 
  amply supported a finding that the appellant committed the Caplan robbery.  
  At a minimum, the appellant was guilty of robbery and we did not call upon the 
  Crown to respond to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant further submits that there is no evidence that the objects 
  pointed at the witnesses were firearms as that term as defined within the meaning 
  of s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The relevant portion of s. 2 reads, “Firearm 
  means a barrelled weapon from which any shot … can be discharged and that is 
  capable of causing serious bodily injury…”.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It was unwise of the Crown to abandon a count in the indictment relating 
  to the use of an imitation weapon in the commission of a robbery.  Nevertheless, 
  having regard to the description of the gun given by the witnesses, the circumstances 
  surrounding the use of the gun – namely that the witnesses were ordered to get 
  down on the floor, had a gun pressed to the head, were threatened, and the <i>modus 
  operandi</i> indicating that the appellant had ready access to guns called up 
  from different locations prior to the subsequent robbery – it was open to the 
  trial judge to come to the conclusion that the gun used by the appellant was 
  a firearm.  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to sentence, although the trial judge was obliged to impose 
  minimum sentences, he was not obliged to impose two consecutive minimum sentences.   
  Mandatory minimum sentences must still be imposed in a manner that is consistent 
  with general principles of sentencing.  One of those principles is that the 
  total sentence imposed must not be unduly long or harsh.  Having regard to the 
  circumstances of the offender in this case, we are of the opinion that the sentence 
  imposed was too long.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal 
  with respect to sentence, set aside the sentences imposed and in their place 
  impose a sentence of six years with respect to count one and a sentence of four 
  years concurrent with respect to count five.</p>
