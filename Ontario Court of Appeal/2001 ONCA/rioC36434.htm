<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice James 
  M. Farley dated May 30, 2001.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent Rio Tinto Canadian Investments Limited (“Rio Tinto”) 
  brought an application in the Superior Court seeking a declaration concerning 
  the validity of a “Unitholder Rights Plan” (the “rights plan”) announced by 
  the Trustees of a public unit trust, the Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Income Fund.  
  The rights plan was created by the trustees through unilateral amendments to 
  the Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration”) that governs the trust.  Farley 
  J. held that the amendments to the Declaration permitting the creation of the 
  rights plan and the rights plan were null and void.  The Trustees have appealed 
  that decision.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Rights plans are one of the defensive measures permitted under 
  Canadian securities law.  In the event of a hostile or unpermitted takeover 
  bid, unitholders have the right to subscribe for a number of shares equal to 
  the number held by the unitholder at half-price.  Rights plans are commonly 
  adopted to encourage hostile bidders to make a “permitted bid”, namely a bid 
  that has the approval of the directors or trustees of the public entity and 
  to prevent “creeping” take-over bids by way of private agreements with major 
  shareholders as opposed to all shareholders.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Rio Tinto owns approximately 20.3% of the units of the trust.  
  Most of its units were acquired pursuant to a failed hostile take-over bid that 
  was below an independent valuation of the fair market value of the units.  Rio 
  Tinto’s legal right and ability to purchase further units of the trust was the 
  direct target of the Trustees’ creation of the rights plan. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There is no issue concerning the <i>bona fides</i> 
  of the Trustees or the genuineness of their stated belief that in creating the 
  Plan they were acting for the protection of the unitholders. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the time the Trustees amended the Declaration, the trustees 
  were aware of section 3.3(b) of the Declaration which provides that no further 
  units can be issued unless authorized by an extraordinary resolution, which 
  requires a 75% vote by the unitholders.  There is no issue that this provision 
  of the Declaration maintained the passive nature of the Fund and prevented dilution 
  to the original unitholders either by the Fund issuing new units for cash or 
  as currency for an acquisition.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having regard to Rio Tinto’s shareholding, the Trustees were 
  uncertain they would be able to obtain the necessary 75% approval.  The Trustees 
  therefore sought a way to overcome the Declaration’s prohibition against the 
  issuance of new units without a 75% vote by the unitholders in order to create 
  the rights plan.  Without an ability to issue new units under the terms of the 
  rights plan, the plan could not be implemented.  In the face of this obstacle, 
  the Trustees unilaterally purported to amend the Declaration by deleting subsection 
  3.3(b) and replacing it with a new subsection.  The replacement subsection 3.3(b) 
  was identical to the existing subsection with the exception of the portion underlined 
  below:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Units may not be issued by the Fund or the Trustees, other 
      than:</span></p>
    <p>(i)            pursuant to this Offering;</p>
    <p>(ii)            pursuant to Section 5.8;</p>
    <p>(iii)            <u>pursuant to the limited circumstances contemplated 
      in the Unitholders Rights Agreement</u>; or</p>
    <p>(iv)            an issue of units approved by a resolution of the Unitholders 
      passed by an Extraordinary Resolution.</p>
    <p>[Emphasis added.  Section 5.8 is not relevant to this appeal.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Rio Tinto contended that the amendment to the declaration of 
  trust was null and void on the basis that the Trustees did not have the power 
  to make this amendment under the terms of the trust.  The Trustees powers to 
  amend the trust are found in s. 12 of the Declaration.  The relevant portion 
  of Section 12 provides: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The provisions of this Declaration of Trust, except where 
      specifically provided otherwise, may only be amended by Extraordinary Resolution; 
      provided that the provisions of this Declaration of Trust may be amended 
      by the Trustees without the consent, approval or ratification of the Unitholders 
      or any other person:</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>at any time for the purpose of:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>providing, in the opinion of the Trustees, 
        additional protection for the Unitholders;</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>but notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment shall reduce the 
      fractional undivided interest in the Trust Assets represented by any Unit 
      without the consent of the holder of such Unit ….</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Farley J. held that the issuance of shares pursuant to the Plan 
  would have a diluting result overall and particularly on Rio Tinto’s holdings 
  as a unitholder of 20.3% of the units.  He declared that the Rights Plan and 
  the Second Supplement to the Declaration of Trust were null and void since they 
  contravened the notwithstanding proviso of s. 12.1 of the Declaration of trust. 
</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that, having regard to the purpose of the 
  trust and to the wording of the trust as whole, the trustees had the power to 
  amend the Declaration.  The purpose of the trust was to create a public traded 
  vehicle that would maximize value to shareholders.  All the trustees have done, 
  it is submitted, is to give the shareholders additional protection which they 
  are entitled to do under s. 12 (b)(ii) of the Declaration. By amending the Declaration 
  and enacting the rights plan the Trustees submit they are filling a gap that 
  would otherwise exist and enabling the commercial expectations of the unit holders 
  to be realized.  The Trustees submit that the concluding words of s. 12, “…no 
  amendment shall reduce the fractional undivided interest in the Trust Assets 
  represented by any Unit without the consent of the holder of such Unit…” only 
  mean that each individual share must have the same characteristics. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We do not agree that this is the correct interpretation to be 
  given to s. 12 when read in the context of the Declaration as a whole.  We agree 
  with Farley J. that the amendment to s. 3.3(b) and the rights plan violate the 
  anti-dilution aspect of the notwithstanding clause contained in  s. 12 and would 
  require an amending resolution passed by 75% of the shareholders.  Accordingly, 
  the rights plan is <i>ultra vires</i> the Declaration that governs the powers 
  of the Trustees of this public unit trust and is therefore void.  In view of 
  our decision on this fundamental issue, it is not necessary for us to consider 
  the other bases on which Farley J. made his order.</p>
