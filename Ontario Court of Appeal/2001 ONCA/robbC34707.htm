<h4><span lang=EN-US><b>BY THE COURT</b></span></h4>
<p class=headingtitle>1.            INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In 1985, the 
  plaintiffs, Wayne Robb, Gray Rintoul and Christopher Farrow, received a manufactured 
  blood factor concentrate known as Factor IX (F-IX) to treat a blood disorder 
  known as Hemophilia B. F-IX was allegedly contaminated with the human immunodeficiency 
  virus (HIV) with the result that each of the plaintiffs became infected with 
  HIV.  Later, Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul contracted acquired immunodeficiency 
  syndrome (AIDS).  Mr.&nbsp;Robb died on November 3, 1993 and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul 
  died on August 18, 1995 – both due to AIDS related complications.  At the time 
  of trial, Mr. Farrow was 18 years old and was HIV positive.  He had not then 
  contracted full-blown AIDS.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> At the relevant 
  times, the Canadian Red Cross Society (CRCS) was the licensed distributor of 
  factor concentrates in Canada, including F-IX.  The CRCS also identified blood 
  donors, collected blood, did primary processing of blood, contracted with private 
  sector manufacturers of factor concentrates such as F&#8209;IX, and distributed 
  blood and blood products to hospitals and clinics. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The federal government 
  (Canada) regulated all pharmaceutical products, including F-IX, through the 
  Bureau of Biologics (BoB). The BoB is part of the Drugs Directorate of the Health 
  Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare. It is responsible 
  for approving new drugs in Canada.  The <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c.&nbsp;F-27 sets out what is required for new drug approval in Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>F-IX was manufactured in the United States by Cutter Biological (Cutter) 
  (now Bayer Corp. and Bayer Inc., collectively, Bayer) and in Canada by Connaught 
  Laboratories Limited (Connaught). These companies manufactured F-IX for the 
  CRCS using blood collected by the CRCS in Canada. Although Bayer is the defendant 
  in these proceedings, Cutter was the entity directly involved with the issues 
  raised by these appeals. Accordingly, we will refer to these entities interchangeably 
  as either Bayer or Cutter. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In 1992, Mr.&nbsp;Robb 
  and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul commenced actions against the CRCS, Her Majesty the Queen 
  in Right of Ontario (Ontario) and Bayer.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> In 1996, Mr. Farrow, by his litigation guardian, commenced his 
  action against the same defendants.  In November 1998, the three actions were 
  ordered to be tried together. The CRCS and Ontario brought third-party actions 
  against Canada. The CRCS added Connaught as a third party; however, Connaught 
  was released from the litigation at an early stage. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In their actions, 
  the plaintiffs claimed that they contracted HIV from taking unheated F-IX.  
  They contended that by 1984 at the latest, it was well known in the medical 
  and blood communities that factor concentrates such as F-IX could contain HIV, 
  and that hemophiliacs taking unheated F-IX could become infected with HIV. The 
  parties accepted, and the trial judge found, that heat-treating F-IX killed 
  viral agents, including HIV. The plaintiffs submitted that the CRCS, Bayer and 
  Ontario breached the duty of care each owed to them by delaying the introduction 
  of heat-treated F-IX into Canada and by failing to warn users of the risks associated 
  with the use of unheated F&#8209;IX. The plaintiffs further claimed that Ontario 
  and the CRCS stood in the relationship of principal and agent and that Ontario 
  was therefore responsible for the CRCS’s negligence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The plaintiffs 
  also alleged that Ontario (and others) ordered the Secretariat of the Canadian 
  Blood Committee (CBC) to destroy transcripts and audiotapes of meetings of the 
  CBC between 1982 and 1989.  They contended that these materials were destroyed 
  in an attempt to cover up wrong-doing by government officials regarding Canada’s 
  blood program.  Thus, the plaintiffs sought damages from Ontario on the basis 
  that Ontario committed the tort of spoliation. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In their third-party 
  claims against Canada, the CRCS and Ontario contended that any delay in the 
  introduction of heat-treated F-IX into Canada was Canada’s responsibility.  
  In particular, the CRCS contended that the BoB unreasonably delayed the issuance 
  of the statutorily required Notice of Compliance (NoC) for heat-treated F-IX.   
  Canada responded that the application for the NoC for heat-treated F-IX was 
  processed with reasonable dispatch and, in any case, more quickly than was normal 
  for a new drug product.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Before the trial 
  began, each of the plaintiffs received $120,000 ($30,000 a year for four years) 
  from Canada under a federal no-fault payment plan known as the Extraordinary 
  Assistance Plan (EAP).  In consideration for the EAP payments, the plaintiffs 
  executed full and final releases relieving Canada of any liability to the plaintiffs.  
  This explains why the plaintiffs made no claim against Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The plaintiffs’ consolidated actions, various cross-claims that 
  need not be detailed here, and the third-party claims against Canada were tried 
  together before Madam Justice E.M. Macdonald from November 1998 to August 1999.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In her reasons for judgment released on June&nbsp;29, 2000, the 
  trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs against the CRCS, which she found 
  to be 100% negligent for failing to do “everything possible to facilitate” the 
  transition to heat-treated F-IX and for delaying the introduction of heat-treated 
  F-IX into Canada.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  
  The trial judge ordered the CRCS to pay the Robb family $599,358.36, the Rintoul 
  family $362,650, and the Farrow family $542,450, exclusive of prejudgment interest.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In dealing with the CRCS’s third-party claim against Canada, 
  the trial judge found that Canada should indemnify the CRCS to the extent of 
  25%.  She provided no explanation for the 75%-25% apportionment of liability 
  as between the CRCS and Canada.   Canada’s liability as a third party was based 
  on the trial judge’s finding that the BoB did not process the heat-treated F-IX 
  application expeditiously in the prevailing circumstances. As a result of the 
  manner in which the trial judge credited the EAP payments, the CRCS had to pay 
  100% of the plaintiffs’ assessed damages but Canada’s obligation to indemnify 
  the CRCS to the extent of 25% was reduced by the total EAP payments made to 
  each of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims in negligence 
  against Ontario.  She found that the CRCS was not Ontario’s agent or under the 
  control of Ontario and that Ontario did not provide blood services or purchase 
  them from the CRCS.  She dismissed the plaintiffs’ spoliation claim on the basis 
  that there was no evidence to support it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also dismissed the plaintiffs’ 
  claims in negligence against Bayer, concluding that Bayer did not owe a duty 
  to warn the plaintiffs nor to ensure the timely delivery of heat-treated F-IX 
  to those who required this product. The trial judge also observed that there 
  was no evidence that the plaintiffs were infected by a Bayer product.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The CRCS and Canada appeal from the trial judge’s findings of 
  negligence in the main action and in the third-party proceedings.  They also 
  appeal from some of the trial judge’s damage assessments.  The plaintiffs cross-appeal 
  from: (i)&nbsp;some of the trial judge’s damage assessments; (ii)&nbsp;the trial 
  judge’s dismissal of their claim against Bayer; and (iii)&nbsp;the trial judge’s 
  conclusion that Ontario did not commit the tort of spoliation.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>II.            FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To better understand the issues in this appeal, we think it would 
  be helpful to provide a brief description of the blood program that was in place 
  in Canada at the relevant times and to identify the various entities that were 
  involved with the collection, manufacture and distribution of regulated blood 
  products, particularly F-IX, which the plaintiffs required to treat their hemophilia. 
  As already mentioned, the plaintiffs suffered from Hemophilia B.  Hemophilia 
  B patients lack the normal quantities of F-IX that enhances the clotting capacity 
  of their blood.  (Hemophilia A patients lack the factor concentrate referred 
  to as F-VIII.)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Manufactured factor concentrates were first provided to hemophiliacs 
  in about 1970.  This represented a major medical advance for those suffering 
  from hemophilia. Manufactured factor concentrates enable hemophiliacs to lead 
  more normal lives.  The manufacturing of factor concentrates involves the extraction 
  of small amounts of F-VIII (for those suffering from Hemophilia A) or F&#8209;IX 
  (for those suffering from Hemophilia&nbsp;B) and other blood molecules, from 
  whole blood.  There are minute amounts of these factor concentrates in each 
  unit of blood.  Thus, many units of blood are needed to manufacture a single 
  dose of F-VIII or F-IX.  Because of the number of donors required to manufacture 
  useable F-VIII or F-IX, the risk of infection is substantially greater than 
  is the case where blood is provided by a single donor.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1981, the CBC was formed to oversee Canada’s blood program.  
  The CBC acted in an advisory capacity to the various Ministers of Health on 
  issues relevant to the blood program in Canada.  The CBC’s members were senior 
  provincial, federal and territorial officials.  Its mandate included making 
  recommendations regarding funding and budgets for the CRCS's blood-donor and 
  transfusion services.  The CBC established an advisory sub-committee composed 
  of doctors and other knowledgeable experts in the blood industry.  The advisory 
  sub-committee was the forum through which the CBC first dealt with the issue 
  of heat-treating factor concentrates to make them safer for hemophiliacs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The CRCS was funded by the federal and provincial governments.  
  It was responsible for the distribution of factor concentrates manufactured 
  by private sector companies from whole blood that the CRCS collected in Canada 
  from volunteer donors.  The CRCS distributed F-IX, and other blood products 
  required by hemophiliacs, to Canadian hospitals and clinics which in turn made 
  them available to hemophiliacs by prescription.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In Canada, as we have said, the BoB was responsible for the approval 
  of new drugs.  Under the applicable legislation a drug manufacturer may not 
  sell or distribute a new drug product until the BoB has issued a NoC for the 
  new drug.  The NoC is separate from licences issued to pharmaceutical companies, 
  which are renewable annually – so long as the manufacturer’s premises and conditions 
  of manufacture meet Canada’s safety standards.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A NoC was required before the CRCS could distribute heat-treated 
  F-IX because, under the applicable regulations, heat-treated F-IX constituted 
  a new drug. The BoB had to be satisfied that heat-treated F-IX was safe and 
  effective before it would issue a NoC to permit its distribution and use.  In 
  layman’s terms, the BoB had to be satisfied in the public interest that heat-treated 
  F-IX would not harm hemophiliacs and that the heating process specified in the 
  NoC submission did indeed eliminate viral agents.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We should note here that at relevant times there 
  was a federal program called the Emergency Drug Release Program (EDRP), now 
  called the Special Access Program, that permitted access to unapproved drugs 
  – that is, drugs for which no NoC had been issued. Access to the EDRP was through 
  a treating medical practitioner. No medical practitioner treating the plaintiffs 
  sought access to the EDRP. However, the plaintiffs argued that the EDRP is relevant 
  because its existence establishes that the BoB could exercise flexibility regarding 
  NoC requirements. We will refer to this argument further when we address Canada's 
  appeal. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> By 1982, there was some evidence in Canada and the United States 
  of hemophiliacs who presented with HIV symptoms. Dr. Mozen, the director of 
  research at Cutter from 1970 to 1992, testified that by March 1983 he knew that 
  there was a connection between the use of factor concentrates and the transmission 
  of HIV to hemophiliacs.  He also testified about developments that eventually 
  led to heat-treating F&#8209;VIII at 68 degrees centigrade for 72 hours.  It 
  was determined that this heat-treating would deactivate viral agents such as 
  HIV.  Although much of Dr. Mozen’s research focused on the preparation of heat-treated 
  F-VIII, it was also relevant to F-IX.</p>

  </span></span> In July 1984, Cutter made a new drug submission to the BoB to 
  permit it to add heat-treatment to the processing of F-VIII and F-IX. The BoB 
  issued a NoC for heat-treated F-VIII in December 1984, and on April 10, 1985, 
  it issued a NoC for heat-treated F-IX.  The time that it took the BoB to issue 
  the NoC for heat-treated F-IX is a critical issue in respect of the plaintiffs’ 
  claims in negligence against the CRCS and the CRCS’s third-party claim against 
  Canada.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge concluded that the risk of HIV infection through 
  blood products was well known by “the informed medical community” by October 
  or November 1984.  The informed medical community included the CBC, the CRCS, 
  the BoB and the companies that manufactured factor concentrates. The trial judge 
  also concluded that by this time it was also known that heat-treating factor 
  concentrates inactivated HIV. However, hemophiliacs had, as the trial judge 
  put it, “no feasible alternatives” to treat their condition.  This explains 
  why hemophiliacs continued to take unheated F-VIII and F-IX even after they 
  and their treating physicians knew that such products could contain viral agents.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On October 30, 1984, the advisory sub-committee of the CBC met 
  to discuss changing from unheated to heated factor concentrates.  The minutes 
  of this meeting record a motion that there be a Consensus Conference to deal 
  with heat-treating factor concentrates. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On November 16, 1984, because of the recognized 
  risk that unheated factor concentrates contained viral agents such as HIV, the 
  BoB issued a directive to the CRCS recommending that the CRCS move to heat-treated 
  factor concentrates “as soon as possible”, on the ground that further reliance 
  on unheated products “cannot be justified”. The BoB issued a second directive, 
  also on November 16, 1984, to licensed manufacturers of factor concentrates 
  (including Cutter) advising them to move to heat-treated factor concentrates 
  “as soon as feasible”. Both BoB directives (BoB Directives) refer to &quot;AHF&quot;, 
  which is the generic term for F-VIII. The trial judge found, and the parties 
  did not dispute, that it was understood at the time that the BoB Directives 
  related to F-IX as well as F-VIII. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Within about three weeks after the issuance of the BoB Directives, 
  that is, by early December 1984, Cutter had in fact heat-treated 10,000 vials 
  (a five-month supply) of F&#8209;IX for the CRCS.  This supply of heat-treated 
  F-IX remained at the Cutter plant in North Carolina pending completion of the 
  regulatory steps required to permit shipment to Canada.  In addition to Canadian 
  regulatory requirements, Cutter could not export blood products, including heat-treated 
  F-VIII and F-IX, without the regulatory approval of the Office of Biologics, 
  the American equivalent of the BoB. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> Key players in the Canadian blood industry met on December 10, 
  1984 at what was called the Consensus Conference. There was some conflict at 
  trial about the evidence concerning what was and was not discussed at the Consensus 
  Conference and more will be said about this evidence later in these reasons. 
  What is clear is that, as a result of the BoB Directives, the discussion at 
  the Consensus Conference focused not on the efficacy of heat-treating, but rather 
  on how heat-treating should be implemented.  The trial judge viewed this shift 
  in emphasis to be important.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We do not propose to review the eleven recommendations 
  made at the Consensus Conference in any detail. It is sufficient to say that 
  the Consensus Conference endorsed, and asked the BoB to expedite, the introduction 
  of heat-treated F-VIII in Canada as soon as feasible before May 1985, with a 
  transition period of between six to eight weeks, during which time both heat-treated 
  and non-heat-treated F-VIII would be given to those suffering from Hemophilia 
  A. Again, there is no issue that any discussion at the Consensus Conference 
  about F-VIII was also relevant to F-IX. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As events unfolded, the BoB did not issue the required NoC for 
  heat-treated F-IX until April 10, 1985. The trial judge found that the BoB would 
  not, and we would add could not, issue a NoC for heat-treated F-IX unless it 
  received viral deactivation data establishing, among other things, that heat-treatment 
  in fact eliminated HIV and would not harm hemophiliacs.  The trial judge recognized 
  that although Cutter filed its new drug submission for heat-treated F-IX in 
  July 1984, the BoB did not receive the required viral deactivation data from 
  Cutter until March 1985.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When the BoB issued its NoC for heat-treated F-IX on April 10, 
  1985, Cutter began selling this product to the CRCS.  Heat-treated F&#8209;IX 
  manufactured in the United States by Cutter first arrived in Canada at the end 
  of May 1985. The CRCS began distribution of heat-treated F&#8209;IX in July 
  1985. Messrs. Robb, Rintoul and Farrow did not receive heat-treated F-IX until 
  July 1985.  In the meantime, they continued to be treated with unheated F-IX. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To summarize, the evidence is clear that by December 1984, the 
  major participants in the Canadian and American blood communities knew that 
  factor concentrates, if not heated to certain specifications, could contain 
  viral agents such as HIV.  It was accepted that heat-treating eliminated viral 
  agents and that the blood community should move to heat-treated F-VIII and F-IX 
  as soon as was possible or feasible.  It was also accepted that the transition 
  to heat-treated F-VIII and F-IX could not be made until the regulatory authorities 
  in Canada (the BoB) and the United States (the Office of Biologics) were satisfied 
  that heat-treated F-VIII and F-IX were safe and effective.  Finally, it appears 
  to have been accepted that there would be a transition period of between six 
  to eight weeks following the issuance of the required NoC, during which time 
  both heated and unheated F-VIII and F&#8209;IX would be given to hemophiliacs.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The parties do not take issue with the requirement 
  that there be a NoC for heat-treated F-IX before the CRCS could distribute this 
  product to hemophiliacs. The critical factual issues in this case as related 
  to the plaintiffs’ claims in negligence against the CRCS and the CRCS’s third-party 
  claim against Canada centre on the time it took the BoB to issue the NoC for 
  heat-treated F-IX and what control the CRCS could, should, and did exercise 
  over the NoC process.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle>III.            REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge made numerous findings of fact and drew a number 
  of inferences against the CRCS and Canada for their failure to call certain 
  witnesses.  These inferences were not, as frequently occurs, insignificant.  
  They were material to the trial judge’s conclusions and the appropriateness 
  of them will be discussed later in these reasons.  At this point we will review 
  some of the trial judge’s principal findings in a summary way.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>CRCS</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge concluded that the CRCS owed a duty of care to 
  the plaintiffs.  She found that the standard by which the reasonableness of 
  the CRCS’s conduct should be measured was “exacting and high”.  In reaching 
  this conclusion, she relied on evidence that the CRCS was a specialized body 
  with specialized knowledge and that by the fall of 1984 it was common knowledge 
  in the medical community that HIV could be transmitted through blood products.  
  The trial judge framed the standard of care relevant to the CRCS as follows 
  (at para. 75):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…the CRCS had a duty to take immediate action to manage the crisis 
      by <u>doing everything possible to facilitate the transition from non-heated 
      to heat-treated products</u>.[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded, in the face of disputed 
  evidence, that plaintiffs were infected with HIV through the use of unheated 
  F-IX in April and May 1985. She found that Mr. Rintoul was infected on April 
  7, 1985; Mr. Robb was infected on April 21, 1985; and Mr. Farrow was infected 
  between April 26 and May 14, 1985. The trial judge's findings regarding the 
  dates of infection form the basis of one of the grounds of appeal by the CRCS 
  and Canada that is reviewed later in these reasons.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that the CRCS did not facilitate the transition 
  to heat-treated F-IX.  In her view (at para.&nbsp;76), “rather than taking steps 
  to make the transition to heat-treated products as quickly as possible, the 
  evidence suggests that the CRCS embarked on a course of action which delayed 
  the transition.” By that, the trial judge meant that certain actions of the 
  CRCS worked to delay the issuance of the NoC for heat-treated F-IX. The trial 
  judge concluded that but for the negligence of the CRCS, heat-treated F-IX could 
  have been distributed in Canada by March 1985, that is, before the dates that 
  she found the plaintiffs were infected.  She rejected the CRCS’s submission 
  that even if the CRCS had performed its duty as defined by her, the required 
  NoC would not have been issued any sooner than it was and, therefore, that the 
  plaintiffs would have been infected in any event.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In dealing with causation, the trial judge relied on the decision 
  of this court in <i>Walker Estate v. York Finch General Hospital</i> (1999), 
  43 O.R. (3d) 461, aff’d (2001), 198 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 193 (S.C.C.), to 
  conclude that the necessary causal link between the plaintiffs’ HIV infections 
  and the negligence of the CRCS and Canada was presumptively established.  More 
  particularly, she concluded (at para. 115) that &quot;it does not fall to the 
  plaintiffs to prove that, had the CRCS lived up to its duty, the BoB would have 
  issued the NoC on an earlier date.&quot;</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs’ claims 
  relating to the CRCS’s duty to warn and to strict liability in tort; neither 
  of those matters are issues on the appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Canada</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that Canada also faced 
  “a high standard of care” that required it to expedite the issuance of the NoC 
  for heat-treated F-IX. She held (at para.&nbsp;140) that Canada breached this 
  duty by “the delay caused by the BoB’s bureaucratic lethargy in failing to respond 
  to the crisis in a manner which was commensurate with the magnitude of that 
  crisis”. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge based her critical conclusions regarding Canada’s 
  liability on the evidence that the BoB received the new drug approval application 
  for heat-treated F&#8209;IX in July 1984, but did not issue the NoC for heat-treated 
  F-IX until April 10, 1985.  She concluded that the BoB had the capacity to respond 
  to urgent circumstances by being flexible with respect to regulatory requirements, 
  but the approval of the application was treated “in the normal course” by the 
  BoB.  As was the case with the CRCS, on the issue of causation in relation to 
  the CRCS’s claim-over against Canada, the trial judge, relying on this court’s 
  judgment in <i>Walker</i>, concluded that causation could be presumed.  </p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Bayer</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs' actions against Bayer 
  for two reasons. First, she found that Bayer did not owe a duty of care to the 
  plaintiffs to warn them about the risks associated with using unheated F-IX.  
  She noted that Cutter manufactured F-IX pursuant to an agreement under which 
  the CRCS retained ownership over the factor concentrates used to produce F-IX.  
  Thus, she found that it was up to the CRCS to decide whether to include an AIDS 
  warning on their product.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the trial judge rejected the plaintiffs’ delay submissions 
  as related to Bayer.  She found that Bayer was not required to apply for a NoC 
  at any particular time or to pressure the BoB (or the American Office of Biologics) 
  to provide new drug approval. The trial judge’s finding that Bayer was not required 
  to facilitate the application for approval of heat-treated F-IX stands in obvious 
  contrast to her finding that the CRCS was obligated to facilitate the application 
  for the NoC for heat-treated F-IX.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Ontario</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs’ claim against Ontario.  
  She disagreed with the plaintiffs’ submission that Ontario exercised control 
  over the CRCS and that the CRCS was an agent of Ontario for the delivery of 
  blood products to hemophiliacs.  She concluded that since the CRCS was not Ontario’s 
  agent, or acting for a public purpose, the CRCS could not rely on the limitation 
  period found in s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. P.38.  The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs’ spoliation claim against 
  Ontario.  She found that there was no admissible evidence that Ontario destroyed 
  documentary evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingtitle>IV.            STANDARD OF APPELLATE 
  REVIEW</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Since the assessment of the evidence is for the trial judge, 
  an appellate court will not reassess the evidence in the absence of palpable 
  and overriding error.  Thus, in the absence of palpable and overriding error, 
  an appellate court will not intervene even where it takes a view of the evidence 
  different from that of the trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Where it is alleged, as in this case, that the trial judge disregarded, 
  misapprehended or failed to appreciate relevant evidence, an appellate court 
  will and indeed must, review the trial record to determine if the trial judge 
  has failed to appreciate or consider relevant evidence bearing upon issues of 
  significance to the trial result.  See <i>R. v. Harper</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 
  2;  <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.);  <i>Equity Waste 
  Management of Canada v. The Halton Hills (Town)</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 
  (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Where damages are in issue on appeal, an appellate court will 
  recognize that there is a wide discretion to be exercised by the trial judge, 
  or jury, in assessing damages. The standard is reasonableness and it is accepted 
  that reasonable minds may differ.  See <i>Woelk v. Halvorson</i>, [1980]  2 
  S.C.R. 430;  <i>Gottardo Properties (Dome) Inc. v. Toronto (City)</i> (1998), 
  162 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 574 (Ont.&nbsp;C.A.);  <i>Robert McAlpine Ltd. v. 
  Byrne Glass Enterprises Ltd.</i> (2001), 141 O.A.C. 167 (C.A.).  However, in 
  this case, there is an issue about one of the trial judge’s assessments of non-pecuniary 
  general damages that exceeded the limit ($265,000 at the time of trial) set 
  out by the Supreme Court of Canada in the trilogy of <i>Andrews v. Grand and 
  Toy Alberta Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229, <i>Arnold v. Teno</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 
  287, and <i>Thornton (Next Friend of) v. Prince George School District No. 57</i>, 
  [1978] 2 S.C.R. 267.  Whether such an award can be sustained is an issue of 
  law and, therefore, the standard of review is correctness. </p>
<p class=headingtitle>V.         OVERVIEW OF THE NEGLIGENCE ISSUES AGAINST THE 
  CRCS AND CANADA</p>

  </span></span> Apart from the spoliation claims against Ontario, the plaintiffs' 
  claims against all the defendants and the third-party claims against Canada 
  were based in negligence. Negligence is frequently defined as acts or omissions 
  exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span> Below we address in a somewhat general way 
  the three core negligence issues (duty of care, standard of care, and causation), 
  with particular reference to the CRCS and Canada. Later in these reasons we 
  address the specific submissions made by the CRCS and Canada in relation to 
  the trial judge's findings of negligence. We also address later in these reasons 
  the standard of care owed by Bayer in the context of the plaintiffs' cross-appeal 
  from the dismissal of their action against Bayer.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It was acknowledged on appeal that the plaintiffs 
  were warned of the risks of taking unheated F-IX and the plaintiffs did not 
  pursue the duty to warn, other than in relation to Bayer. Thus, we do not discuss 
  the duty to warn further other than later in the context of the plaintiffs' 
  cross-appeal against Bayer.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>A.            
  Duty of Care</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The existence of a duty of care is an essential element of the 
  tort of negligence.  The duty of care arises out of a particular relationship 
  (sometimes referred  to  in  the context of the neighbour principle or proximity) 
  between the plaintiff and the defendant.  It implicates foreseeability and raises 
  the question: is the plaintiff within the ambit of the risk created by the relationship 
  between the plaintiff and defendant?  See <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>, [1932] 
  A.C. 562 (H.L.).  The existence of a duty of care in respect of a particular 
  plaintiff requires the defendant to take reasonable precautions, that is, to 
  measure up to an objectively determined standard of care.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In assessing whether a duty of care exists, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada has endorsed the two questions set out in <i>Anns v. Merton London 
  Borough Council</i>, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.).  See <i>Kamloops (City) v. Neilsen</i>, 
  [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2.  The two questions are: (i) is there a relationship of proximity 
  based on foreseeability objectively assessed; and, if there is, (ii) is there 
  nonetheless a policy basis to limit or negate the <i>prima facie</i> duty of 
  care.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is a sufficient relationship of proximity between the plaintiffs 
  and the defendants.  There is no policy basis that would limit or negate the 
  duty of care each of the defendants owed to the plaintiffs.  Indeed, none of 
  the defendants submitted that they did not owe a duty of care. Thus, the existence 
  of a duty of care is not an issue in this case.  That cannot be said of the 
  standard of care and causation issues. </p>

  </span></span> What a defendant must do to discharge the duty of care owed to 
  a plaintiff is determined by the conduct expected of the law's invention, the 
  reasonable person, as adjusted to the circumstances of each case. Since, as 
  we have observed, negligence involves exposing another to an unreasonable risk 
  of harm, the risk to which a defendant is expected to respond must be real and 
  consideration must be given to what a defendant should do, or not do, to guard 
  against the objectively determined risk. The precautions that must be taken 
  to guard against a particular risk will vary directly with the magnitude of 
  the risk.  We would add that the trier of fact should not assess a defendant’s 
  conduct with the benefit of hindsight.  See <i>Lapointe v. Hôpital Le Gardeur</i>, 
  [1992] 1 S.C.R. 351.  </p>

  </span></span> The standard-of-care question then, in relation to the plaintiffs’ 
  negligence claims against the CRCS and the CRCS’s third-party action against 
  Canada, is what did the CRCS and Canada have to do (or not do) to discharge 
  the duty of care imposed upon them as a matter of law.  While there may well 
  be expert evidence in particular cases directed towards the applicable standard 
  of care, we do not think that expert evidence on the standard-of-care issue 
  was required in this case and  agree with the trial judge’s conclusion in this 
  regard.</p>

  </span></span> The CRCS conceded that it owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs 
  as recipients of F&#8209;IX that the CRCS distributed to Canadian hospitals.  
  It accepted that it was required to distribute safe F-IX or to warn recipients 
  of the risks of which it knew or ought to have known. It denied that it had 
  any obligation to provide any particular blood product at any particular time. 
  The CRCS took the position that it was not required to interfere with the BoB’s 
  consideration of the application for a NoC for heat-treated F-IX and that it 
  did nothing to delay the processing of the NoC for heat-treated F-IX. </p>

  to warn recipients of risks of which it knew or ought to have known.  In our 
  view, to discharge the duty of care imposed by law, the CRCS could not in a 
  direct or indirect way impede the lawful transition from unheated to heat-treated 
  F-IX.  That is to say, the CRCS could not interfere with, and thus retard, the 
  regulatory process leading to the issuance of the required NoC for heat-treated 
  F-IX.  We do not think that, to discharge the duty of care it faced, the CRCS 
  was required to take positive steps to accelerate the NoC process.  </p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>The CRCS faces,</span></u> in the context of the analysis, <u>an exacting 
      and high standard.</u>  The first factor which puts the standard at a high 
      level is the nature of the relationship between the CRCS and Canadian hemophiliacs, 
      who comprise a sick and vulnerable population.  …  </p>
    <p>The second factor that causes me to find that the standard of care is a 
      high one stems from the position of the CRCS as a specialized body with 
      specialized knowledge.  ...  </p>
    <p>The third factor impacting on the standard of care comes from my factual 
      finding concerning the state of medical knowledge in the fall of 1984 and 
      earlier.  By the time the BoB directive was issued on November 16, 1984, 
      the CRCS was facing a clearly identified crisis.  … Since an emergency was 
      identified, and a course of action was mandated by an authoritative regulatory 
      body, <u>the CRCS must be held to a high standard of care when its responses 
      to the BoB directive are assessed.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In light of the trial judge’s findings and conclusions 
  on the standard-of-care issue, the role of the CRCS in relation to the BoB must 
  be examined, particularly since there is no real conflict in the evidence about 
  the areas of responsibility relevant to the application for, and issuance of, 
  the required NoC for heat-treated F-IX.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Three aspects of the regulatory process require brief comment.  
  First, the BoB, as Canada’s statutory regulator, was solely responsible for 
  the NoC process.  The CRCS was a distributor of factor concentrates and could 
  act only when it was lawful to distribute a particular new drug such as heat-treated 
  F-IX.  The CRCS was not an arm of government, federal or provincial. The CRCS 
  was not involved in the regulatory process that had to be completed before anyone 
  could lawfully distribute heat-treated F-IX.  Second, the CRCS had nothing to 
  do with the data (mainly viral inactivation data) that had to be supplied to 
  the BoB by NoC applicants such as Cutter as part of the new-drug-approval process. 
  Third, the CRCS was not a part of the EDRP through which drugs not approved 
  in Canada could be made available to a physician applicant for use by the physician’s 
  patient.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> By way of summary on the standard-of-care issue as it relates 
  to the CRCS, there is no doubt that in November 1984 the BoB recommended that 
  unheated factor concentrates be replaced with heat-treated factor concentrates 
  “as soon as feasible” and “as soon as possible”. However, as we have said, it 
  was the BoB, not the CRCS, that was responsible for and controlled the regulatory 
  process to approve heat-treated factor concentrates in Canada.  The BoB required 
  data to establish that heat-treated F-IX would deactivate viral agents such 
  as HIV.  That data had to be supplied by the manufacturer of factor concentrates, 
  not the CRCS.  As we have stated, the CRCS was under a duty not to impede the 
  regulatory process; however, for reasons on which we will expand shortly, there 
  is no evidence that the CRCS did anything that delayed the issuance of the required 
  NoC for heat-treated F-IX.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, in our view, the trial judge (in stating that the CRCS 
  had a duty to do “everything possible” to introduce heat-treated F-IX) placed 
  the standard of care at too high a level, a level that ignores regulatory reality.  
  The CRCS was under no obligation at any time to provide any particular product 
  to consumers.  It did, of course, have a duty to warn consumers of dangers of 
  which it knew or ought to have known.  Moreover, there was no substitute for 
  F-IX for persons, like the plaintiffs, suffering from Hemophilia B.  Thus, withdrawal 
  of unheated F-IX pending the issuance of a NoC for heat-treated F-IX was not 
  a viable option.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated as follows (at paras.&nbsp;139-140) 
  regarding the standard of care against which to measure whether Canada had discharged 
  its duty to the plaintiffs:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Canada, as regulator of the blood industry, owed a duty of care to 
      the plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The BoB was dealing with hemophiliacs, a sick 
      and vulnerable population in the midst of the AIDS epidemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      hemophiliac population was totally dependant on the BoB for regulatory approval 
      of the heat-treated blood products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the BoB, like the CRCS, 
      must be held to a high standard of care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the language 
      of the second recommendation of the Consensus Conference contemplated that 
      the BoB would expedite licensing, the content of the BoB's duty of care 
      was exactly this, to expedite the licensing.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The breach of this duty of care was the delay caused by the BoB's bureaucratic 
      lethargy in failing to respond to the crisis in a manner that was commensurate 
      with the magnitude of that crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;…</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Canada takes issue with the trial judge’s findings of negligence 
  against it.  First, Canada argues that there was no evidence to support the 
  plaintiffs’ contention that it unreasonably delayed the regulatory process leading 
  to the approval of heat-treated F-IX. Second, Canada argues that the plaintiffs 
  were really advancing an unpleaded, new case against it; that is, that Canada 
  should have taken a different, more flexible approach to the approval of heat-treated 
  F-IX. With respect to this second matter, Canada denies that it had the option 
  of dispensing with the statutory requirement for a NoC before heat-treated F-IX, 
  or any other new drug, could be distributed to the public.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We will consider later in these reasons the evidence that the 
  trial judge relied on to conclude that Canada unreasonably delayed the issuance 
  of the NoC for heat-treated F&#8209;IX.  For now, we observe that there is no 
  evidence that the regulatory process for the approval of new drugs in Canada 
  and the issuance of an NoC (in particular, the requirement for the submission 
  of viral inactivation data) fell below any common-law standard. In our view, 
  in order to discharge its duty of care, Canada was required to take reasonable 
  steps to abide by its own regulatory processes.  It had no obligation to, nor 
  in our view could it, dispense with the regulatory requirements for the approval  
  of heat-treated F-IX. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To succeed against the CRCS, the plaintiffs 
  had to establish, on a reasonable balance of probability, that their injuries 
  (contracting HIV) were caused by the negligence of the CRCS. They established 
  that taking unheated F-IX caused these injuries. As the principal finding of 
  negligence against the CRCS consisted of the CRCS’s failure to do “everything 
  possible” to expedite the introduction of heat-treated F&#8209;IX, the plaintiffs 
  had to establish that the CRCS’s failure to do &quot;everything possible&quot; 
  (assuming that this is a valid finding of negligence) was the probable cause 
  of their injuries. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To prove causation, the plaintiffs had to establish, to a probability 
  standard, that they were infected at a time when heat-treated F-IX would have 
  been available to them but for the CRCS’s negligence.  Thus, the dates upon 
  which the plaintiffs were infected were of paramount importance. Indeed, counsel 
  at trial and the trial judge all recognized the significance of the dates of 
  infection to the causation issue.  We agree with the trial judge that expert 
  evidence was required to establish the dates of infection.  The interpretation 
  of the serology test results as well as the significance of these results are 
  things that are foreign to the skill and knowledge of lay persons. More will 
  be said later in these reasons about the evidence that the trial judge relied 
  on determine the dates of infection. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, in light of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada’s judgment in <i>Walker</i>, above, (released after the trial judge released 
  her reasons for judgment) we are of the view that causation cannot be presumed 
  in this case. It must, at the very least, be established to a standard of probability 
  that the negligence of the CRCS materially contributed to the plaintiffs being 
  infected with HIV. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> In <i>Walker</i>, the deceased contracted HIV (and later developed 
  AIDS) from transfused blood collected and distributed by the CRCS.  The trial 
  judge concluded that even if the CRCS had met the requisite standard of care 
  and screened blood donors, the infected donor would likely still have given 
  blood.  Accordingly, he dismissed Mrs.&nbsp;Walker’s claim on the basis that 
  she had failed to establish a causal link between her loss and the CRCS’s breach 
  of duty.  On the CRCS’s appeal, this court (Morden A.C.J.O., Doherty and Moldaver 
  JJ.A.) disagreed with the trial judge’s finding on the causation issue.  Relying 
  on <i>Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp.</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634, this court concluded 
  that causation was presumptively established.  On the CRCS’s appeal to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada, Major J. rejected a presumption of causation in cases where 
  there is no learned intermediary through which a defendant would be expected 
  to discharge its duty to warn.  In doing so, he limited the application of <i>Hollis 
  v. Dow Corning</i> to cases in which there was a learned intermediary. </p>

  </span></span> The case before us  is not a case where the defendants alone 
  possessed evidence as to the dates of infection.  Quite the contrary, although 
  difficult to assemble, that evidence was generally under the control of the 
  plaintiffs.  We do not think it is correct to presume, or assume, as the trial 
  judge did, that the plaintiffs were infected at a time when the CRCS, acting 
  reasonably, could have made heat-treated F-IX available to the plaintiffs and 
  other hemophiliacs. Accordingly, although Sopinka J. advocated a pragmatic and 
  robust approach to causation in <i>Snell v. Farrell</i>, [1990] 2 SC.R. 311, 
  we see no reason to modify the burden of proof on the causation issue in this 
  case. </p>

  </span></span> Last, this was not a case of multiple causes or a case where 
  there were learned intermediary issues (except in respect of the duty to warn).  
  Nor was it a case where the plaintiffs were asked to prove the hypothetical 
  (for example whether, if warned, the plaintiffs’ treating physicians would have 
  in fact conveyed the warning to the plaintiffs: see <i>Hollis v. Dow Corning</i>, 
  above.)  Here, as we have said, the causation question based on the standard 
  of care imposed by the trial judge was whether the plaintiffs became infected 
  with HIV because the CRCS did not take steps to accelerate, or because the CRCS 
  delayed, the lawful introduction of heat-treated F-IX.  </p>

  not establish, what steps could have been taken by the CRCS to effectively hasten 
  the regulatory process.  Indeed, the evidence does not even suggest that the 
  process could have safely been hastened. Nor does the evidence support the trial 
  judge's conclusion that the CRCS embarked upon a course of action that delayed 
  the transition to heat-treated F-IX.  </p>

  the plaintiffs, there is no evidence that such breach caused their injuries. 
  It is our view that the plaintiffs failed to prove the facts underlying the 
  expert testimony about their dates of infection.  Accordingly, the trial judge 
  erred in relying on this expert testimony to conclude that the plaintiffs became 
  infected in April and May 1985. In any event, even if the plaintiffs became 
  infected in April and May 1985 as found by the trial judge, the CRCS’s conduct 
  would not have had any impact on this unfortunate result since, through no fault 
  of its own, heat-treated F&#8209;IX was not available for distribution in Canada 
  until May 30, 1985. </p>

  </span></span> Finally, it is our view that the trial judge’s findings were 
  based, in large part, on  adverse inferences drawn against the CRCS for the 
  failure to call witnesses in circumstances where no such inferences were warranted.  
  On that ground alone, even if the trial judge's reasons could otherwise be supported

  10, 1985 rather than May&nbsp;30, 1985; and third, that the plaintiffs became

  </span></span> The CRCS had always purchased custom F-IX that was manufactured 
  from blood collected by the CRCS.  The trial judge held that the CRCS had an 
  obligation to consider the feasibility of purchasing commercially manufactured 
  heat-treated F-IX and that it failed to do so. The trial judge stated as follows 
  [at para.&nbsp;78]:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Although the CRCS had purchased commercial F-VIII from Cutter in the past 
      when there were plasma shortages in Canada, the CRCS had never purchased 
      commercial F-IX from Cutter…. The plaintiffs suggested that as part of the 
      discharge of its duty to them, the CRCS should have explored this option 
      in the late fall of 1984. The reality is that there is no evidence either 
      way that suggests that it would have been feasible for the CRCS to respond 
      to the BoB Directive by purchasing American-sourced commercial F-IX. But 
      this does not end the matter. While the plaintiffs called no evidence that 
      commercially-sourced F-IX could have been imported from the U.S. any quicker 
      than custom-fractionated product, they did prove that the importation of 
      commercial product had precedent in emergency circumstances.  The option 
      of buying commercial product was explored at the Consensus Conference.  
      Contrary to the submissions of the CRCS, its duty of care, as defined in 
      these reasons, obligated it to look at the feasibility of this option instead 
      of baldly saying that there was no way of knowing that commercial product 
      could have been labelled and licensed any quicker than custom manufactured 
      product. Similarly, it is no answer for it to say, without leading evidence 
      on the point, that ordering commercial product would have been a waste of 
      money and effort.<br>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our view, the trial judge effectively reversed 
  the burden of proof in faulting the CRCS for any failure to consider purchasing 
  commercial heat-treated F-IX. The CRCS was entitled to rely on the fact that 
  the plaintiffs adduced no evidence to suggest that commercial heat-treated F-IX 
  could have been brought into Canada from the United States faster than custom 
  heat-treated F-IX. </span></p>

  have been a benefit to purchasing commercial product ran counter to the evidence 
  that was called. Since commercial heat-treated F-IX had never been distributed 
  in Canada before, there was no NoC or approved labelling for this product. Accordingly, 
  commercial heat-treated F-IX could not have been distributed until these requirements 
  were met. As the principal obstacle to getting heat-treated F-IX into Canada 
  was regulatory, the evidence gives no reason to believe that heat-treated F-IX 
  would have been available in Canada earlier had the CRCS sought to bring in 
  commercial heat-treated F&#8209;IX instead of custom heat-treated F&#8209;IX.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The evidence showed that Cutter had some heat-treated 
  F-IX in its inventory in North Carolina as early as December 1984. The trial 
  judge found that the CRCS did not disclose this fact at the Consensus Conference 
  on December 10, 1984. She regarded this as a “serious omission” that would have 
  had some impact on the assessment of the transition period to move to heat-treated 
  F-IX made by the Consensus Conference participants. The relevant parts of her 
  reasons for judgment on this point are as follows (at paras. 79, 82&#8209;84):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>After the BoB Directive was issued, the CRCS instructed Cutter to heat-treat 
      approximately 10,000 vials (a five month supply for Canada) of F-IX from 
      the CRCS plasma. As early as December of 1984, this heat-treated F-IX was 
      sitting in inventory at Cutter's plant in Clayton, North Carolina.  It was 
      available for shipment to Canada, pending the completion of the necessary 
      regulatory steps.  The existence of this inventory was disclosed to senior 
      members of the CRCS at a meeting held with Cutter representatives on December 
      4, 1984.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p>Six days after the December 4, 1984 meeting at Clayton, the Consensus Conference 
      took place in Ottawa. Although the Conference was focused on how to respond 
      to the BoB Directive and make the transition to heat-treated products as 
      quickly as possible, the CRCS representatives did not disclose to the meeting 
      the existence of the 10,000 heat-treated product vials in inventory.  Dr. 
      Martin Davey, the Assistant National Director of Canadian Blood Transfusion 
      Services of the CRCS at the relevant times, when asked about this at discovery, 
      stated that it did not occur to him to disclose the existence of this heat-treated 
      supply. </p>
    <p>Given the agenda of the Consensus Conference, I regard this as a serious 
      omission.  To my mind, it would have been imperative to give the experts 
      assembled at the Conference as much information as possible concerning the 
      ability of the CRCS to make a speedy transition.  I note that the timeline 
      for making the transition to heat-treated product was a central topic at 
      the Conference, which seems to make the existence of heat-treated inventory 
      all the more relevant.  I find that reasonable persons, charged with the 
      responsibility for the safety of the Canadian blood supply, would have assessed 
      the transition period differently if they had known of the existence of 
      this heated supply.</p>
    <p>Dr. Furesz, the Director of the BoB, attended the Consensus Conference.  
      He made a projection that the transition to heat-treated product could be 
      made in two to three months.  Since he was not aware of the 10,000 vials 
      of heat-treated product in inventory, this projection must have included 
      time to heat-treat the factor product.  The failure of the CRCS to disclose 
      the existence of the inventory at the Conference constitutes additional 
      circumstantial evidence that the CRCS unjustifiably delayed implementation 
      of the Directive. </p>

  </span></span> The trial judge appears to have placed considerable weight on 
  the CRCS’s failure to disclose the existence of the heat-treated inventory in 
  support of her conclusion that the CRCS “unjustifiably delayed” the implementation 
  of the BoB Directives. In our view, however, it is not at all clear on the evidence 
  that the existence of the heat-treated inventory was not disclosed at the Consensus 
  Conference. Indeed the evidence, which we will review in a moment, appears to 
  suggest otherwise. More importantly, even if the CRCS did not mention the heat-treated 
  inventory at the Consensus Conference, there is no rational basis to infer from 
  this evidence any intent by the CRCS to delay the transition to heat-treated 
  F&#8209;IX.  There is also no rational basis to infer from this evidence that 
  the CRCS's failure to mention the heat-treated inventory in any way delayed 
  the regulatory process in either Canada or the United States or could have had 
  any impact on these processes.  The inference drawn by the trial judge ignores 
  the fact that the very existence of heat-treated inventory at this early stage 
  was the result of the CRCS having taken immediate action to send all of its 
  factor concentrates for heat-treatment upon the issuance of the BoB Directives.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We will now review the evidence of what occurred 
  at the Consensus Conference as it relates to this issue. The evidence consisted 
  of: various documents admitted for a limited purpose; the testimony of Dr. Langley; 
  and read-ins from the discovery of Dr.&nbsp;Davey. The evidence can be briefly 
  summarized as follows. </span></p>

  </span></span> The documentary evidence was silent on the issue of the heat-treated 
  inventory. Undoubtedly, this formed the basis of the trial judge’s conclusion 
  that the existence of the inventory had not been disclosed at the Consensus 
  Conference. The main document was a “Summary Report” (Walcroft Summary Report) 
  prepared by one of the attendees, Dr.&nbsp;Walcroft, who died before the commencement 
  of the trial. His assistant gave evidence on Dr. Walcroft's note-taking habits 
  and the trial judge admitted the Walcroft Summary Report as a business record. 
  It was understood, however, that the Walcroft Summary Report did not constitute 
  minutes of the Consensus Conference but rather, Dr. Walcroft’s personal recollections 
  of what took place at the Consensus Conference. Other documents consisted of 
  copies of some of the speeches made by various participants at the Consensus 
  Conference. Although the absence of any notation in these documents about the 
  heat-treated inventory is consistent with the trial judge’s finding that the 
  existence of heat-treated F-IX inventory was not discussed, the other evidence 
  on this point must also be considered.  </p>

  </span></span> The only person in attendance at the Consensus Conference who 
  testified at trial was Dr. Langley. It was Dr. Langley’s recollection that the 
  CRCS representatives who attended the Consensus Conference did advise the participants 
  that the CRCS channelled all of its factor concentrates to Cutter to be heat-treated 
  immediately after the BoB Directives were issued. He also recalled that the 
  CRCS representatives advised the participants that the heat-treating process 
  took about a month.  Dr. Davey (whose examination for discovery was read in 
  as part of the plaintiffs' case) agreed that no reference was made to the existence 
  of the heat-treated inventory in the formal presentations at the Consensus Conference 
  as evidenced by the copies of the speeches but stated that the issue may have 
  come up during the course of the informal discussions. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is our view that it cannot be said that the 
  existence of Cutter’s heat-treated inventory was not disclosed if the CRCS in 
  fact informed the participants at the Consensus Conference that it had sent 
  factor concentrates for heat-treatment about a month earlier (as Dr. Langley 
  recalled). The participants who attended the Consensus Conference would have 
  been aware, at the very least, that some heat-treated product was already in 
  Cutter's inventory in North Carolina, or would be shortly. </span></p>

  could have made. At that time, the heat-treated inventory had not gone through 
  quality control at Cutter, the BoB had not received the viral inactivation data 
  from Cutter, the heat-treated inventory had not gone through the various testing 
  protocols required at the American Office of Biologics, the labelling had not 
  been submitted to either Canadian or American regulatory agencies, and the vials 
  for the heat-treated inventory were unlabelled. In these circumstances, it is 
  doubtful that the existence of the heat-treated inventory could have played 
  any role in the Consensus Conference’s assessment of the transition period or 
  in the timing of the availability of heat-treated F&#8209;IX in Ontario. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made two significant findings 
  on the issue of delay based on a memorandum to file prepared by Dr. Naylor (of 
  the CRCS) recording the events of a meeting between senior members of the CRCS 
  and Cutter representatives on December 4, 1984 (Naylor Memorandum). The trial 
  judge described the Naylor Memorandum as follows [at para. 80]:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The CRCS representatives present at that meeting included Dr. Naylor, Dr. 
      Tom Walker and Mr. Anhorn.  The BoB Directive had been received two weeks 
      prior to this meeting, and was discussed.  Dr. Naylor's memo to file recording 
      the events of this meeting confirms that 10,000 vials of F-IX concentrate 
      (lots C9N005A and C9N006A) were heat treated from earlier plasma shipments.  
      The memo records that the shipment of these products back to Canada would 
      coincide with the first deliveries of F-VIII concentrate.  It is on this 
      basis that the plaintiffs allege that the CRCS decided to time the delivery 
      of heated F-IX to coincide with the delivery of F&#8209;VIII.  The memo 
      also mentions that &quot;licence approval&quot; for F-IX was anticipated 
      in January, 1985, and that Mr. Phil LeBlanc (Cutter's representative in 
      Canada) suggested that it might be beneficial for him and a CRCS representative 
      to visit the BoB in January to discuss the progress of the license application.  
      There is no evidence that such a visit took place.  I took the reference 
      to &quot;licence approval&quot; to refer to the NoC, as there was a frequent 
      tendency to use the term &quot;licence&quot; when what was actually meant 
      was the NoC. </p>

      of the heat treated F-IX back to Canada so that it would coincide with the 
      F-VIII shipments, rather than planning to ship the F-IX as soon as it was 
      available.  Second, the CRCS was anticipating that a NoC would be issued 
      by January, 1985, but did not follow through on the suggestion that a CRCS 
      representative should visit the BoB.  There is no evidence that the CRCS

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We agree with the CRCS’s submission that the 
  trial judge erred in considering the Naylor Memorandum in isolation, without 
  regard for the purpose for which it was introduced, and without considering 
  the other evidence on this point. In our view, the Naylor Memorandum, when properly 
  considered in context, cannot provide support for the trial judge’s inference

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the allegation that the CRCS 
  intended to tie in the introduction of heat-treated F-IX with heat-treated F-VIII, 
  we make the following observations. The purpose for which the Naylor Memorandum 
  was introduced must be considered in assessing its weight. The Naylor Memorandum 
  was introduced in the context of the plaintiffs’ read-ins from Dr. Davey’s examination 
  for discovery on matters related to the December 4, 1984 meeting but unrelated 
  to the question of timing for the introduction of heat-treated F-IX. In fact, 
  the CRCS submits, and the plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary, that the 
  record reveals that the questions and answers on the discovery that do relate 
  to the portion of the Naylor Memorandum in issue were intentionally not read 
  in by counsel for the plaintiffs at trial. In these circumstances, it is clear 
  that only those parts of the Naylor Memorandum that were referred to as part 
  of the read-ins were properly introduced in evidence. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if the entire Naylor Memorandum had been introduced for 
  the truth of its contents, the reference to the timing of the delivery of heat-treated 
  F-IX is, at best, equivocal. The Naylor Memorandum does not identify if a CRCS 
  representative or someone from Cutter made the statements about delivery.  And 
  it is not at all clear whether such a statement was referring to an intention 
  with respect to the delivery of heat-treated F-IX, or was simply an estimation 
  that the delivery of heat-treated F-IX was expected to be made coincidentally 
  with the delivery of heat-treated F-VIII. The other evidence on this point supports 
  an interpretation that the CRCS did not plan the delivery of heat-treated F&#8209;IX 
  to a time when F&#8209;VIII was also available.  Dr.&nbsp;Mozen, who was present 
  at the meeting in question, testified that he had no recollection of the CRCS 
  tying the delivery of heat-treated F-VIII to heat-treated F-IX.  Further, in 
  the Walcroft Summary Report, which was heavily relied upon by the trial judge 
  on other issues, Dr.&nbsp;Davey was reported to have expressed his belief that 
  the use of heat-treated F&#8209;IX could be implemented sooner than heat-treated 
  F&#8209;VIII.</p>

  of the delivery, the evidence demonstrated that <i>in fact</i> the heat-treated 
  F&#8209;VIII and heat-treated F&#8209;IX were not delivered at the same time.

  to the CRCS’s alleged failure to follow up with the BoB in January 1985, we 
  see little evidentiary value in the CRCS’s belief on December 4, 1984 that the 
  NoC would be issued in January 1985, as recorded in the Naylor Memorandum. It 
  is clear on the evidence that everyone was advised differently a few days later 
  on December 10, 1984 at the Consensus Conference and that no one at that time 
  expected the NoC for heat-treated F&#8209;IX to be issued in January 1985. </span></p>

  CRCS made efforts to influence the timing of the NoC or to discuss the progress 
  of Cutter’s submission. More germane to the issues at hand was the lack of evidence 
  that the CRCS could have influenced the timing of the NoC. It was incumbent 
  upon the plaintiffs to show what steps the CRCS could have taken to hasten the 
  regulatory process, if indeed the process could have been safely hastened. No 
  such evidence was adduced. Thus, the inferences that the trial judge drew from

  She sets out the relevant parts of the Walcroft Summary Report as follows (at 
  paras.&nbsp;85-86):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Persuasive evidence of unjustifiable delay is found in the remaining records 
      from the Consensus Conference. At the Conference, Dr. Naylor, on behalf 
      of the CRCS, made a presentation in which he addressed concerns about the 
      existing inventory of non-heated factor product.  The Walcroft Summary records 
      the following from Dr. Naylor's presentation: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>[Dr. Naylor] Discussed the current inventory 
        of AHF .... Existing inventory of non-heated AHF is estimated to last

        heat treated AHF by May 1, 1985 by which time inventories of non-heat 
        treated product would be depleted.</span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'><u>This statement generated wide ranging discussion on the ethical and 
        legal implications arising if heat treated product became available prior 
        to May 1, 1985:  should introduction of heat treatment be delayed until 
        all non-heat treated inventories are depleted or should the CRC be prepared 
        to discard non-heat treated inventories. This question was unresolved</u>.</span>
       [Emphasis added.]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The Walcroft Summary also records the comments of Dr.&nbsp;Rivard, 
      expressed as follows: </span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span

  <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge correctly noted that a number of statements from the 
  Walcroft Summary Report were incompatible with the suggestion that the CRCS 
  intended to exhaust existing unheated inventory but she found that it was incumbent 
  upon the CRCS to call a witness to explain these apparent inconsistencies. She 
  therefore drew an adverse inference and concluded that the CRCS indeed intended 
  to exhaust unheated inventory before distributing heat-treated F&#8209;IX.</span></p>

  In our view, there is no evidence to support this conclusion. It is based solely 
  on the trial judge’s interpretation of one ambiguous statement in the Walcroft 
  Summary Report. However, this interpretation is incompatible with a number of 
  other statements in the same document, as the trial judge noted.  As well, contrary 
  to what the trial judge said, Dr. Langley’s testimony was inconsistent with 
  her interpretation of the Walcroft Summary Report. Dr. Langley testified that 
  the date when the CRCS expected to receive the heat-treated F&#8209;IX coincided 
  with the date the unheated F&#8209;IX would be depleted. Dr.&nbsp;Langley was 
  asked if anyone at the Consensus Conference advocated a position that unheated 
  product should be depleted even if heat-treated F&#8209;IX was available.  Dr.&nbsp;Langley 
  answered, no. He further recalled that the gist of the CRCS’s presentation was 
  that it had to get the heat-treated product out “as fast as we can”. </p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>Another witness called by the plaintiffs also rejected any notion that 
  the CRCS intended to deplete the existing inventory. Ms. Good, a former CRCS 
  board member, was briefed on the CRCS’s implementation plan shortly after the 
  Consensus Conference. In her testimony in chief she stated that there was “no 
  idea of any delay” and in fact a great deal of “urgency” within the CRCS. According 
  to Ms. Good:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

  <span
lang=EN-US>Finally, and perhaps more importantly, regardless of any statement 
  of intention that may have been made in December 1984 with respect to depleting 
  the existing unheated inventory, in actual fact the CRCS did not choose this 
  course of action when heat-treated F&#8209;IX finally became available. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  We turn to the trial judge’s finding that the CRCS intended to deplete its unheated 
  inventory because it mistakenly assumed that “all but virgin hemophiliacs” were 
  already infected.  This finding is based entirely on a brief excerpt from a 
  memorandum from Drs.&nbsp;Naylor and Derrick (of the CRCS) to Dr. Perrault (National 
  Director of the Blood Transfusion Service for the CRCS) dated October 29, 1984 
  dealing with the anticipated introduction of heat-treated factor concentrates. 
  In the memorandum, a statement is made to the effect that it will take years 
  to determine whether the use of heat-treated F&#8209;VIII will lower the incidence 
  of AIDS in hemophilia patients “since all but ‘virgin hemophiliacs’ have almost 
  certainly been exposed to the putative AIDS agent”. When read in the context 
  of the entire memorandum and the other evidence at trial, it is, in our view, 
  unreasonable to infer from this brief excerpt that the CRCS intended to deplete 
  its existing inventory because it erroneously assumed that all hemophiliacs 
  were already infected. In fact, the memorandum itself concludes with the recommendation 
  that a Consensus Conference be held “at the earliest opportunity” to deal with 
  the issue of heat-treating factor concentrates. Further, as noted by the CRCS 
  in its factum, read-ins from Dr. Davey’s examination for discovery reveal that 
  the CRCS had no such belief in respect of persons suffering from Hemophilia&nbsp;B 
  at the time that the BoB Directives were issued in November 1984 (which followed 
  the memorandum of Drs.&nbsp;Naylor and Derrick by two weeks). </p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  Finally, there is no evidence that the CRCS had “unfounded concerns” about the 
  financial implications of writing off the old unheated inventory. In fact, the 
  evidence was to the contrary. The only witness who was asked about the financial 
  implications of the transition to heat-treated factor concentrates was the Ontario 
  representative on the CBC, Stephen Dreezer. Mr. Dreezer testified that there 
  was no financial impact on the CRCS in respect of this transition. His evidence 
  was not contradicted or challenged.  The suggestion that the CRCS might have 
  been concerned about financial implications did not come from evidence but rather, 
  from an unproven assertion made by counsel for the plaintiffs during the course 
  of Mr.&nbsp;Dreezer’s cross-examination.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>            2.         Can the 
  CRCS rely on the fact that heat-treated F&#8209;IX was<br>
                                      not available for distribution in Canada 
  until May 30, 1985 for<br>
                                      reasons beyond its control?</p>

  It is undisputed that heat-treated F-IX first became available for distribution 
  in Canada on May 30, 1985 after all necessary Canadian and American regulatory 
  approvals had been obtained. The trial judge, however, held that the CRCS was 
  not exculpated by that fact and that it could have had heat-treated F&#8209;IX 
  available by March 10, 1985. As noted earlier, she based this conclusion on 
  a number of findings.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>First, the trial judge found the CRCS could not rely on the fact that 
  heat-treated F&#8209;IX was not available before May 30, 1985 because, in her 
  view, this wrongly assumed that the CRCS could not have had an impact on the 
  timing of the regulatory process. Yet the trial judge does not set out in her 
  reasons why this assumption is erroneous and the plaintiffs have not identified 
  any evidence that showed that the CRCS could have accelerated the Canadian and 
  American regulatory processes. </span></p>

  Second,  the trial judge held that there was no evidence that April 10, 1985 
  was the earliest possible date for the issuance of the NoC by the BoB.  In our 
  view, it was wrong to say that there was no evidence to explain why the BoB 
  did not issue the NoC until April 10, 1985. It is uncontradicted that the BoB, 
  amongst other matters, required viral inactivation data from Cutter before it 
  would give its approval. This data was not received by the BoB until March 5, 
  1985.  The BoB’s review was on March 22, 1985 and the BoB issued the NoC on 
  April 10, 1985. No evidence was called to show that this process could have 
  been completed before April&nbsp;10, 1985. In fact, the only evidence is from 
  a representative of the BoB who stated that the regulatory approval time for 
  the heat-treated F-IX had been “average or shorter.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>Third, the trial judge held that the BoB did not expedite the NoC process 
  because the CRCS maintained from the beginning that it would not be ready to 
  distribute heat-treated F&#8209;IX until May 1, 1985 at the earliest. This finding 
  is without support in the evidence and, indeed, as noted by the CRCS in its 
  factum, is inconsistent with the evidence on this point that showed that the 
  CRCS merely anticipated that heat-treated F&#8209;IX might not be available 
  until May 1, 1985 but that it was ready to distribute heat-treated F&#8209;IX 
  when the BoB issued the required NoC and when heat-treated F&#8209;IX was available.

  <span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, we see no basis in the reasons identified by the trial 
  judge why the CRCS was not entitled to rely on the fact that, regardless of 
  its own conduct, heat-treated F&#8209;IX was not available in time to prevent 
  the plaintiffs from becoming infected. </span></p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>Further, it is our view that the trial judge’s finding that the product 
  could have been available on March 10, 1985 cannot reasonably be supported on 
  the evidence. This finding appears to be entirely based on the contents of Dr. 
  Furesz’s presentation at the Consensus Conference on December 10, 1984. The 
  trial judge noted in her reasons that Dr. Furesz, the Director of the BoB, estimated 
  that heat-treated products would be available for distribution in Canada “within 
  two to three months”. On the basis of this evidence the trial judge concluded 
  as follows (at para.&nbsp;109):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I take from this evidence that, but for the breach by the CRCS in its 
      failure to conduct the transition as soon as possible, heat-treated product 
      could have been in Canada, at the latest, three months after the Consensus 
      Conference, on March 10, 1985, or one month before the first plaintiff was 
      infected. </span></p>
  </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The CRCS correctly notes that the trial judge’s reliance on the written 
  copy of Dr.&nbsp;Furesz’s presentation ignores the purpose for which the trial 
  judge permitted it to be introduced. In answer to the defendants’ objection 
  to the admission of this document at trial, counsel for the plaintiffs stated 
  at trial that it was introduced solely to prove that Dr. Furesz made these statements 
  and not for the truth of its contents. Indeed, counsel for the plaintiffs stated 
  that the document “could have been a pack of lies”. Hence, this document cannot 
  constitute proof that the BoB in fact estimated that the delay would be two 
  or three months. In any case, the trial judge’s conclusion ignores the fact 
  that Dr.&nbsp;Furesz’s estimate was expressly stated to be contingent upon the 
  manufacturers’ compliance with the regulatory requirements. The relevant excerpt 
  from this presentation reads as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>While it is difficult to predict how quickly the companies will comply 
      with the requirements, it is anticipated that lots could be available for 
      release onto the Canadian market within two or three months. </span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  As events unfolded, the regulatory requirements were not complied with within 
  the estimated two- or three-month time frame. Thus, we fail to see how an estimate 
  of time, made contingent upon Cutter’s compliance with regulatory requirements, 
  provides any evidence to support the conclusion that the CRCS could have distributed 
  heat-treated F&#8209;IX within the estimated time frame. In addition, there 
  was general agreement at the Consensus Conference that a six- to eight-week 
  implementation period would be required after heat-treated factor concentrates 
  became available in Canada before such products would reach all consumers. The 
  trial judge’s finding that the plaintiffs would not have been infected if heat-treated 
  F&#8209;IX had been available for distribution on March 10, 1985 appears to 
  ignore this additional implementation period. We note further that the trial 
  judge appears to have ignored this implementation period as an explanation for 
  the delay from May 30, 1985, when heat-treated F&#8209;IX became available, 
  to its distribution on July&nbsp;1, 1985.  </p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>It was, of course, crucial to the plaintiffs’ case that they establish 
  when they became infected with HIV. It was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to 
  prove that they became infected at a time when their infections could have been 
  prevented if the CRCS had acted differently. In the absence of such evidence, 
  there could be no finding that the CRCS’s alleged breach of duty caused their 
  injuries. The trial judge made the following findings with respect to the dates 
  of infection of each plaintiff (at paras.&nbsp;100-103): </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The plaintiffs did tender evidence which established the dates and existence 
      of test results for Mr. Farrow, and the dates on which samples were taken 
      from Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul.  It is at this point that expert evidence 
      becomes necessary.</p>
    <p>Dr. Remis reviewed complete medical records of each of the plaintiffs, 
      including medical notes from clinic visits and hospitalizations, F-IX administrations, 
      laboratory reports and demographic and clinical background information. 
      He also had access to serologic tests results.  He determined the exposure 
      period, which took into account the &quot;window period&quot; of roughly 
      two to three months <u>before the last seronegative test result</u> and 
      two weeks before the seropositive test results.  Dr. Remis then estimated 
      when each patient experienced acute retroviral syndrome, which occurs, in 
      most patients, two to six weeks after infection. [Emphasis added.]</p>
    <p>Dr. Remis concluded that all three patients were likely infected by the 
      same lot of F-IX, lot 3321-1, manufactured by Connaught Laboratories.  Mr. 
      Rintoul received F-IX from this lot on April 7 and April 25, 1985, Mr. Robb 
      received it on April 21, 1985 and Mr. Farrow received it four times between 
      April 26 and May 14, 1985.  Dr. Remis opined that a patient receiving contaminated 
      F-IX would likely be infected on the first infusion. </p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Based on Dr. Remis' evidence, I conclude that Mr. Rintoul was infected 
      on April 7, 1985, Mr. Robb was infected on April 21, 1985, and Mr. Farrow 
      was infected between April&nbsp;26 and May 14, 1985.</span></p>

  As can be seen from this extract from the trial judge’s reasons for judgment, 
  Dr.&nbsp;Remis based his opinion about the plaintiffs’ infection dates, in part, 
  on the dates when the plaintiffs’ blood last tested negative.  Although the 
  trial judge concluded that the plaintiffs tendered evidence that established 
  the dates and existence of blood tests for Mr.&nbsp;Farrow, and the dates on 
  which the blood samples that tested negative were taken from Mr.&nbsp;Robb and 
  Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul, she did not set out the evidence upon which she relied to 
  reach these conclusions.  This absence of reasons is unfortunate because the 
  admissibility and weight of the evidence relating to these issues were highly 
  contested at trial and formed the subject-matter of a number of evidentiary 
  rulings. </p>

  The importance of the dates and existence of blood tests for Mr.&nbsp;Farrow 
  and the dates on which blood samples were taken from Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul 
  lies in the fact that these matters formed an integral part of the foundation 
  for Dr.&nbsp;Remis’s opinion.  The CRCS argues that there was no admissible 
  evidence to establish these matters and that, consequently, Dr.&nbsp;Remis’s 
  opinion on the dates of infection cannot be given any weight.  In the absence 
  of reasons from the trial judge on this point, it is incumbent upon this court 
  to conduct its own review and assessment of the relevant evidence.</p>

  testing. Dr.&nbsp;Inwood became unavailable to testify, for reasons we do not

  of the dates on which the blood samples were taken from Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul 
  became highly contentious given the unavailability of Dr. Inwood to testify. 
  In the result, after a number of exchanges between counsel and the trial judge, 
  the Serology Reports were admitted as business records under s.&nbsp;35 of the 
  <i>Evidence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;E.23. The trial judge ruled that the 
  Explanatory Letter did not satisfy the requirements of s.&nbsp;35 but that it 
  could be admitted for  “limited purposes” only. The limited purposes for which 
  the Explanatory Letter was admitted were not specified but the trial judge made 
  it clear in her ruling (which concerned other documents as well) that “where 
  the letters offer opinions on matters which may be germane to issues in this 
  litigation, there is a requirement for further proof of the truth of their contents.”

  relating to the collection of blood samples from Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul. 
  With respect to Mr.&nbsp;Robb, there is a record from St. Joseph’s Hospital 
  entitled “Patient’s Clinic Log” with an entry stating “8 May 85 – Dr. Inwood

  a record from St. Joseph’s Hospital entitled “Patient’s Progress Notes”, which 
  stated “May 9, 1985 – Gray is in good spirits. Annual assessment. Dr. Inwood 
  discussed concerns regarding transmission of HTLVIII virus with Gray”, and a 
  corresponding record of “peripheral blood tests” being performed during the 
  assessment. We will comment further on this evidence later in these reasons.

      1986 he was positive by the screening assay (Elisa) and I’m awaiting Western

  <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge preferred the evidence of Dr. Remis. She found that

  The significance of the dates on which the samples of blood were drawn for HIV 
  testing is readily apparent upon review of the testimony of Dr. Remis. Dr. Remis 
  was called as an expert in epidemiology, and in particular, the surveillance 
  of HIV and AIDS and the transmission of HIV through blood products.  In his 
  examination-in-chief, Dr.&nbsp;Remis offered his opinion on the dates and sources 
  of the HIV infections of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  With respect to Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul,  Dr. Remis arrived at his opinion 
  after reviewing their medical records that included information on the administrations 
  of various products, visits to clinics and hospitals, and most importantly, 
  their test results for HIV.  The first step in Dr.&nbsp;Remis’s analysis was 
  to define the “exposure period” for each plaintiff – the period during which 
  Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul would have been infected with the HIV virus. He testified 
  that this period was typically two to three months before the last negative 
  test and up to two weeks before the first positive test. Dr. Remis defined the 
  beginning of the exposure period based on May 8, 1985 and May 9, 1985 being 
  the last times that HIV-negative blood samples were drawn from Mr. Robb and 
  Mr. Rintoul.  Dr.&nbsp;Remis assumed these dates, presumably, from the Serology 
  Reports and the Explanatory Letter. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  After defining these exposure periods, Dr. Remis looked at the factor concentrate 
  products that were received during each exposure period, as well as other possible 
  sources of HIV infection to determine what was the likely source of each plaintiff’s 
  infection.  Then, after identifying a single ‘lot’ of factor concentrate as 
  the most likely source of all three plaintiffs’ infections, Dr. Remis pinpointed 
  the dates on which the plaintiffs were infected. He concluded that Mr. Robb 
  was infected on April&nbsp;21, 1985, and Mr. Rintoul on either April 7, 1985 
  or April 25, 1985.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  During his examination-in-chief, Dr. Remis was asked if he relied on anything 
  else to determine the likely source and dates of infection. Dr.&nbsp;Remis replied 
  that he also considered evidence of symptoms consistent with HIV. According 
  to the medical records, Mr. Robb had experienced “protracted fever, sweats and 
  chills” in the first two weeks of June 1985, and had a lab test at the time 
  that showed “a low lymphocyte count”.  According to Dr. Remis, these were indicators 
  of an acute primary retroviral syndrome, signifying a possible infection with 
  HIV anywhere from two to six weeks earlier.  As for Mr. Rintoul, Dr. Remis noted 
  that the records showed a pancytopenia (or “a lack of cells across the board”) 
  on May 9.  This, too, was described by Dr. Remis as being consistent with a 
  recent HIV infection.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>Finally, in determining the probable source of infection, Dr. Remis 
  testified that he also considered distribution patterns of blood products in 
  Canada and the link to HIV infection. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In the end, Dr. Remis concluded that all of the factors combined assisted him 
  in reaching his opinion.  He stated that “everything in [the] case added up, 
  one thing after the other”.               </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  With respect to Mr. Farrow, based on the same methodology that was used for 
  Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr. Rintoul Dr.&nbsp;Remis opined that Mr.&nbsp;Farrow was 
  infected any time between April 26, 1985 and May 14, 1985,.  This methodology 
  included a preliminary consideration of the “exposure period” for Mr. Farrow, 
  which was determined from the dates of HIV testing noted in the Blanchette Letters.  
  However, Dr. Remis had greater difficulties in arriving at an opinion for Mr. 
  Farrow than he did for Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul.  He recognized the ambiguity 
  in the dates in the Blanchette Letters that made it uncertain whether the last 
  negative test was obtained in May 1985 or September 1985. He noted that his 
  conclusions with respect to Mr. Farrow were tempered by this uncertainty and 
  that, for the purpose of his opinion, he assumed that there was no negative 
  result for Mr.&nbsp;Farrow in September 1985.  Had it been proven that there 
  was in fact a negative result in September 1985, Dr. Remis stated that his opinion 
  would have to be reconsidered.  Dr. Remis also noted that Mr. Farrow, unlike 
  Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul, did not have an acute retroviral syndrome that was 
  clinically evident. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In determining the source of Mr. Farrow’s infection, Dr. Remis relied on the 
  conclusion that he had reached in respect of Mr. Robb and Mr. Rintoul because 
  he was of the opinion that all three plaintiffs were probably infected from 
  a single source.   Dr.&nbsp;Remis stated:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>So all we could say, Mr. Farrow does not really help us 
      a lot except it was likely one of these five lot numbers, but aside from 
      other considerations, doesn’t help us to distinguish between which one it 
      was.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the dates of infection was clearly 
  raised at trial. With respect to Mr. Rintoul and Mr. Robb, counsel for the CRCS 
  took the following position in his written submissions concerning the dates 
  when Mr.&nbsp;Robb and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul were last HIV-negative and the dates 
  when their blood samples were taken:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>…the plaintiffs rely upon test results from 1992 to indicate that these 
      plaintiffs were HIV negative in May, 1985.  These test results, in turn 
      were interpreted by [the expert] who based his conclusions upon them.</p>
    <p>The CRCS takes no issue with the accuracy of the test results as being 
      admissible under the <i>Evidence Act </i>as business records, so long as 
      they are entered as evidence of a contemporaneous transaction. That is, 
      these records demonstrate that the samples tested by the provincial testing 
      laboratory were negative for HIV when the tests were done for HIV.  <u>The 
      question that they do not answer is when the samples themselves were taken.  
      As noted previously unless there is some evidence that blood was drawn and 
      stored from these patients on the dates advanced by the plaintiffs and it 
      was this blood that was sent to the provincial testing laboratory in 1992, 
      it is not permissible to draw the conclusion that these patients had not 
      developed detectable antibodies in early May, 1985</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>With respect to Mr. Farrow, counsel for the CRCS argued that the “opinion 
  evidence” of Dr. Blanchette about the blood test results and the date of such 
  tests, as contained in the Blanchette Letters, should be given no weight. Counsel 
  noted that Dr.&nbsp;Blanchette’s opinion was based entirely on unproven hearsay 
  evidence: there was nothing in the way of contemporaneous documentation to ground 
  the dates reported, nor was there evidence to establish that the tests were 
  ever conducted. Hence the CRCS took the position that the Blanchette Letters 
  could not be relied on to establish the infection date for Mr. Farrow.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  Counsel for the plaintiffs did not really address these issues in his written 
  submissions. Rather, his submissions were based on the assumption that the dates 
  in the Serology Reports, the Blanchette Letters and other records established 
  as a fact the dates upon which blood samples were drawn from Mr.&nbsp;Robb and 
  Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul and the date and existence of Mr.&nbsp;Farrow’s blood tests.  
  It appears from the trial judge’s reasons that she accepted the plaintiffs’ 
  position without further analysis.  </p>

  For the reasons that follow, it is our view that the position adopted by the 
  CRCS in its submissions at trial and on this appeal is correct. There was no 
  admissible evidence as to the date and existence of blood tests for Mr.&nbsp;Farrow.  
  There was also no admissible evidence as to the dates the negative blood samples 
  were collected from Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul and Mr.&nbsp;Robb or that such samples 
  came from Mr.&nbsp;Robb or Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul. Consequently, the trial judge erred 
  in finding that the plaintiffs had established these matters. We are also of 
  the view that these factual issues were crucial to Dr. Remis’s opinion with 
  respect to the dates of infection. It follows that, without proof of these important 
  facts that provide the foundation for his expert opinion evidence, Dr.&nbsp;Remis’s 
  opinion could not be given much weight, if any. Consequently, the trial judge’s 
  conclusion with respect to the dates of infection, which was based solely on 
  Dr.&nbsp;Remis’s testimony, is not reasonably supported by the evidence. </p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>As noted earlier, with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Robb, the only evidence 
  in the record as to the date on which the crucial blood sample may have been 
  taken is as follows: (a)&nbsp;a notation contained in the 1992 Serology Report 
  in the box entitled “Date Specimen Collected” that stated “1985 May”; and (b) 
  a record from St. Joseph’s Hospital entitled “Patient’s Clinic Log” with an

  <span
lang=EN-US>At best, one could infer from the latter record that Mr. Robb was referred 
  to the hemophilia clinic for assessment on May 8, 1985. However, in and of itself, 
  this record provides no evidence that a blood sample was taken that day and 
  certainly cannot constitute proof that, if a blood sample was taken at the St. 
  Joseph’s Hospital on that date, it is the same sample that made its way to the 
  provincial testing laboratory some seven years later. </span></p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>As for the Serology Report, it constituted proof that the sample tested 
  by the provincial testing laboratory was negative for HIV when the test was

lang=EN-US>The trial judge correctly ruled that the Explanatory Letter did not 
  meet the requirements of s.&nbsp;35 of the <i>Evidence Act</i> and could not 
  provide proof of the truth of its contents. Even if the Explanatory Letter is 
  considered with the remaining evidence on this point, the same limitations already 
  noted apply. At best, there was evidence of the existence of HIV testing done 
  in 1992 in respect of a blood specimen that the laboratory was informed was 
  taken from Mr. Rintoul in 1985. However, for the reasons just stated, the Serology 
  Report and the hospital records were not admissible to prove that blood samples 
  that tested negative in 1992 were taken in May 1985 or that such samples were 
  taken from Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In the Blanchette Letters, Dr. Blanchette expressed certain opinions 
  with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Farrow’s treatment. The Blanchette Letters also referred 
  to the results of Mr.&nbsp;Farrow’s HIV testing. As noted earlier, one letter 
  referred to the last negative test as being in May 1985 and the other in September 
  1985. Dr. Remis’s opinion on the date of infection, which was accepted by the 
  trial judge, was based on the May 1985 date. </span></p>

  Even disregarding the ambiguity with respect to the date of Mr.&nbsp;Farrow’s 
  last negative test, the reference to Mr. Farrow’s May 1985 record cannot be 
  accepted for its truth. The admission of Dr. Blanchette’s opinion, whether it 
  be under s.&nbsp;52, or by way of oral testimony, does not establish the facts 
  upon which the opinion is based. The facts reported by Dr. Blanchette with respect 
  to the results of the HIV testing for Mr. Farrow are admissible as having been 
  accepted as true by Dr. Blanchette but they are not admissible for their truth.  
  Put another way, the facts on which Dr.&nbsp;Blanchette’s opinion was based 
  must be established: See <i>Reimer v. Thivierge</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 309 
  at 314 (C.A.); see also <i>McGregor v. Crossland</i>, above, at para.6.  </p>

  Even assuming that Dr. Blanchette’s reference to the timing of the negative 
  testing could be considered as an opinion rather than a statement of the basis 
  for the opinion, the weight of that opinion would have to be properly assessed. 
  In this case, it becomes apparent, when the Blanchette Letters are considered 
  as a whole together with Dr.&nbsp;Blanchette’s testimony, that very little weight, 
  if any, can be given to Dr. Blanchette’s opinion on this issue given the following 
  factors: no supporting documentation was adduced; the date of last negative 
  testing is uncertain in the Blanchette Letters; no record was kept of the HIV 
  testing; Dr. Blanchette did not perform the HIV tests himself, and was not involved 
  in the taking of the blood samples that were tested; Dr. Blanchette could not 
  recall precisely how the results of the tests were communicated to him; and 
  the results were not communicated to Mr. Farrow or his family when the tests 
  were completed.  In any event, it is our view that the reference to the HIV 
  testing is not an opinion but a fact upon which the opinion is based, the truth 
  of which was not proven.   </p>

  Hence, it is our view that the plaintiffs, having failed to prove the facts 
  upon which Dr.&nbsp;Remis based his opinion regarding the dates of infection, 
  have failed to prove the dates upon which they were infected.  Without evidence 
  to support the trial judge’s conclusions on the dates of infection, the plaintiffs 
  have not established that the negligence of the CRCS, as found by the trial 
  judge, caused the plaintiffs to contract HIV.</p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>The CRCS takes the position that the trial judge improperly drew adverse 
  inferences against it for failing to call certain witnesses. It is submitted 
  that these inferences were not permissible at law, and were contrary to the 
  trial judge’s own rulings during the course of the trial. The CRCS takes particular 
  issue with the adverse inferences drawn from its failure to call Drs. Davey, 
  Herst, Perrault, Walker and Mr.&nbsp;Anhorn as witnesses. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  It is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that adverse inferences stemming 
  from the failure to call material witnesses played an important role in her 
  analysis of the evidence against both the CRCS and Canada. Before dealing with 
  the evidence against the CRCS, she stated as follows (at paras. 60-62):  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The CRCS and Canada chose not to call material witnesses on issues that 
      were raised by the plaintiffs. Persons with knowledge of events that were 
      the subject matter of testimony and documents tendered by the plaintiffs 
      did not testify.  As a result, it is proper for the court to draw an adverse 
      inference against the defendants.  I now refer briefly to the law.  In <i>Kaytor 
      v. Lion's Driving Range</i> (1962), 40 W.W.R. 173 (B.C.S.C.), this statement 
      of principle appears at p. 176 of the judgment of Aikens J.: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>It is, I think, well established that where 
        a party fails to call a witness, and it is apparent from the evidence 
        in the case that the witness would have been able to give evidence on 
        a material issue, then the court may draw such inferences as the particular 
        circumstances of the case warrant against the party failing to call the 
        witness.  This would apply, of course, only where the failure to call 
        the witness is not satisfactorily explained.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The CRCS and Canada were particularly possessed of resources which would 
      enable them to lead evidence on important issues raised by the plaintiffs.  
      The fact that these important witnesses were not called cannot fall at the 
      feet of the plaintiffs.  To do so would place an impossible burden on them 
      in the circumstances of this case. </p>
    <p>At this point, I identify persons who would have been able to give evidence 
      on material issues relating to the delay of the implementation of the BoB 
      directive, and who were not called by the CRCS or Canada.  The failure to 
      call these persons was not explained.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge then identified seven potential witnesses, including 
  those mentioned above, and concluded as follows (at para.&nbsp;70):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I conclude that, had these persons been called as witnesses, their evidence 
      would not be favourable to the CRCS or Canada.  The plaintiffs have tendered 
      sufficient admissible evidence that the delay in the implementation of the 
      Directive was negligent.  It is no answer for the CRCS or Canada to say 
      that these persons are no longer employed by them, or that they are unfriendly.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge then proceeded with her analysis and drew adverse inferences 
  from the CRCS’s failure to call certain witnesses with respect to a number of 
  significant issues, including some of the issues reviewed earlier in this judgment. 
  The extent to which adverse inferences played a role in the trial judge’s analysis 
  is apparent from her concluding observations on the issue of causation where 
  she refers to a number of those earlier findings (at paras.&nbsp;123-125):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The circumstantial evidence tendered by the plaintiffs, taken together 
      with the CRCS's failure to meet the standard of care (which materially increased 
      the risk to the plaintiffs) permits the court to draw an inference of causation, 
      thus placing the last pieces in the puzzle, which leads to a finding of 
      negligence.  The inferences of negligence in these actions come from certain 
      documentary and <i>viva voce</i> evidence.  Examples are the Walcroft Summary, 
      the notes and memoranda of Dr. Naylor, and the testimony of Ms. Krepps. 
    </p>
    <p>… </p>
    <p>Once the documents are before the court, the court is required to examine 
      the documents closely to ascertain whether or not they contain sufficient 
      circumstantial evidence to permit the court to draw the inferences of negligence.  
      In these cases, the strength of the inferences of negligence is sufficient 
      to compel the CRCS to submit evidence to meet them.  The plaintiffs' evidence, 
      including that of the witnesses called, suggests that the CRCS probably 
      subordinated safety concerns to matters such as using up contaminated inventory 
      prior to the distribution of heat-treated inventory.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the analysis under this heading is that the CRCS and 
      others appeared to believe that by December of 1984, all but virgin hemophiliacs 
      were infected in any event.  The reality is that there was no statistical 
      basis for this assumption.  Furthermore, the evidence is that by December, 
      1984 and through to March, 1985, Mr. Robb, Mr. Rintoul and Mr. Farrow were 
      not infected.  In these circumstances, this assumption is shocking, if not 
      reckless.</p>

  <span
lang=EN-US>In the circumstances of this trial, the adverse inferences drawn by 
  the trial judge with respect to the witnesses in question were unwarranted. 
  An inference may be drawn against a party for failure to call a witness who 
  may give material evidence when that party alone could bring the witness before 
  the court: See <i>Lambert v. Quinn</i> (1994), 110 D.L.R. (4th) 284 at 287-88

  <span
lang=EN-US>None of the witnesses was, at the time of trial, an employee of the 
  CRCS. There is no reason to believe that they were not equally available to 
  the plaintiffs. Indeed, during the course of the trial, counsel for the plaintiffs 
  expressed an intention to call many of these witnesses. His motion to compel 
  the attendance of Dr. Davey and Mr. Anhorn (amongst others) as adverse witnesses 
  under Rule 53.07 was unsuccessful, the trial judge ruling that neither was an 
  officer, director or employee of the CRCS. Counsel for the plaintiffs even conceded 
  on the record on different occasions during the trial that the CRCS was not 
  in a position to call Dr. Davey or Mr. Anhorn. Further, two of the witnesses, 
  Dr.&nbsp;Herst and Dr.&nbsp;Davey, were examined for discovery by the plaintiffs 
  and extensive parts of their examination were read in as part of the plaintiffs’ 
  case. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the CRCS was entitled to rely on 
  the trial judge’s own rulings with respect to the calling of these witnesses. 
  The following exchanges, noted by the CRCS in its factum, are of particular 
  relevance:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>During its case, the CRCS advised that it was calling no evidence on the 
      standard of care.  The plaintiffs moved to re-open their case and have the 
      court revoke a number of rulings it had previously made.  During the course 
      of the argument, plaintiffs<span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span> 
      counsel suggested that one of the reasons for revoking her rulings could 
      be that it was anticipated that certain witnesses would testify, specifically, 
      Dr. Walker, Dr.&nbsp;Perrault and Dr. Davey.  The trial judge  immediately 
      disabused all present in the court of that suggestion: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
11.0pt;'>But Mr. Arenson [counsel for the plaintiffs], I never had it in my mind, 
          just so youre very clear, that 
          Mr. Boeckle [counsel for the CRCS] was going to call these people. ...  
          Because I knew that... [the witnesses they would call] ... would very 
          much be the by-product of what they considered they had to meet in terms 
          of the case that you had proven, or had laid out before the Court. ... 
          and no judge should draw any inference from the fact that names appear 
          on a witness list at some point and then that person doesn't  materially turn up at the trial.  </span></p>

          issues raised in the pleadings... Throughout the trial [Mr. Arenson] 
          made tactical decisions as to which witnesses he would or would not 
          call. For example, <u>he decided not to call Dr. Martin Davey, Mr. Craig

        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

          exhibits marked at the trial. The list identified the date on which 
          such exhibit was marked; who was testifying when it was marked and whether 
          or not it was the subject matter of a ruling by the court.</span></p>
        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

          This step was taken so that all parties in the court would have a clear

          to agree or disagree with the status of this list of exhibits. Mr.&nbsp;Arenson 
          refused to participate in this process and closed his case. I agree 
          that it should have been obvious that the CRCS was attempting, by the 
          use of the list, to determine what evidence was in against the CRCS...</span></p>

          this extra step, I would assist counsel in having a clear understanding 
          of the parameters of such rulings<i>... </i><u>It also goes without

  In our view, the trial judge’s conclusion in her reasons for judgment (at para.&nbsp;61) 
  that it “would place an impossible burden” on the plaintiffs to call these witnesses

          in this case.  It follows, in our view, that the Plaintiff’s non-pecuniary 
          damages cannot exceed the adjusted rough upper limit.</span></p>

  Christopher Farrow was nine years old when his brother Steven was born, approximately 
  three years after Christopher's HIV diagnosis. The trial judge was of the view 
  that a person could not &quot;marry into&quot; a claim under the <i>Family Law 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;F.3.  For example, Judith Rintoul, who married 
  Gray Rintoul after learning of his HIV status, received no award for her <i>Family 
  Law Act</i> claim. However, the trial judge concluded that the policy considerations 
  for excluding &quot;marrying into&quot; claims did not apply where, as in Steven’s 
  case, he was born after his brother was infected.  The trial judge awarded Steven 
  $15,000 for loss of care, guidance and companionship under the <i>Family Law 
  Act</i>.</p>

  <span> </span>We think that the trial judge erred in making this award.  The 
  authorities have consistently held that a person can no more be “born into” 
  a <i>Family Law Act</i> claim than he or she can “marry into” a claim:  <i>Ficht 
  v. Kitchen</i> (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 495 at 499 (H.C.J.); <i>MacIsaac v. Smith</i>

  two types of claim.  Had we affirmed the trial judge on the question of liability, 
  we would have set aside the award of $15,000 to Steven Farrow under the <i>Family 
  Law Act</i>.</p>

  The plaintiffs each received $120,000 under the EAP and released Canada from 
  all claims relating to their having become infected with HIV.  The trial judge’s 
  reasons for judgment suggested that these payments were collateral benefits 
  and deductible from the plaintiffs' awards.  In her supplementary reasons for 
  judgment, however, she refused to give the CRCS any credit for the EAP payments.  
  She wrote in her supplementary reasons (at paras. 20 and 21):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>In assessing both interest and damages in this case, one important 
      preliminary issue is the effect of the Government of Canada’s Extraordinary 
      Assistance Plan (EAP) payments to the plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this 
      action, Canada paid each of the plaintiffs $120,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange, 
      the plaintiffs released Canada from any liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada became 
      a party to these proceedings following a motion which was heard by Feldman&nbsp;J. 
      (as she then was) in her capacity as Trial Management Judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
      her endorsement, adding Canada as a third party, Feldman J. provided as 
      follows: </span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Any costs award shall be 
          subject to the right of the Red Cross to seek reimbursement for some 
          or all of the costs it is required to pay, from the third parties at 
          trial.</span></p>
        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>As requested, the Red Cross 
          shall be precluded from passing over to a plaintiff any set-off allowed 
          to the Government of Canada as a result of the EAP release.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span

      it should receive credit for the EAP payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  Much of the argument before us on this issue addressed the endorsement of Feldman 
  J. and a similar endorsement of Benotto J., both made in the course of case 
  management of these actions prior to trial.  In our view, these endorsements 
  were not intended to determine the issue of whether the EAP payments should 
  or should not be deducted from the amounts of the plaintiffs’ damages.  That 
  issue remained to be resolved at the trial and the trial judge was not constrained 
  by the case-management endorsements, although her supplementary reasons suggest 
  that she believed she was so constrained. </p>

  We agree with the trial judge’s initial determination that the $120,000 represented 
  a collateral benefit that should have been deducted from each of the plaintiffs’ 
  damages.  Accordingly, had we affirmed the trial judge on the questions of the 
  liability of the CRCS to the plaintiffs for damages and of Canada to the CRCS 
  for contribution, we would have deducted the $120,000 payment from each plaintiff’s 
  damages payable by the CRCS and we also would have deducted that sum from the 
  amount payable by Canada to the CRCS by way of contribution.  By way of illustration, 
  if a plaintiff’s damages had been $1,000,000, we would have ordered the CRCS 
  to pay to that plaintiff $880,000 (i.e. $1,000,000 less $120,000) and we would 
  have ordered Canada to pay to the CRCS by way of contribution $100,000 (i.e. 
  25% of $880,000, which is $220,000, less $120,000).  </p>

  In addition to a number of motion-specific and witness-specific orders, the 
  trial judge ordered that the plaintiffs recover their costs against the CRCS 
  on a party-and-party scale following assessment.  In her supplementary reasons 
  for judgment, the trial judge rejected the plaintiffs’ request for costs on 
  a solicitor-and-client scale, and also rejected the CRCS’s request for a reduction 
  of the plaintiffs’ costs by 40% to signal her disapproval of unnecessary delay 
  caused by Mr. Arenson’s conduct of the trial.  The trial judge gave thorough 
  reasons explaining why she chose not to make these orders.  We are not persuaded 
  that her decision regarding costs was clearly wrong or made in the improper 
  exercise of her discretion.  Had we affirmed the trial judge on the question 
  of liability, we would not have disturbed her decisions regarding the scale 
  or the quantum of her costs award.</p>

  In view of our conclusion that the plaintiffs’ claims against the CRCS must 
  be dismissed, it follows that the appeal by Canada must also be allowed and 
  the judgment against it set aside.  Regardless of the fact that this result 
  is dictated by our findings on the CRCS’s appeal, we are also of the view that 
  the finding of negligence against Canada cannot be supported by the evidence.</p>

  Even assuming that Canada, as regulator of blood products, had the duty to expedite 
  the regulatory process (as found by the trial judge), we are not satisfied that 
  there was any basis in the evidence to find that Canada breached this duty. 
  The principal cause of the BoB’s delay in approving heat-treated F-IX was the 
  time it took to obtain the viral inactivation data from Cutter.  We agree with 
  Canada’s submission that, in order for the CRCS to prove its case against Canada, 
  the CRCS had to prove that the BoB could have caused Cutter to send this data 
  sooner, or that the BoB could have dispensed with the requirement for such data. 
  No suggestion of that kind was made by anyone at trial. <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s finding of liability against Canada was essentially 
  based on her conclusion that Canada had the capability, within the BoB, to expedite 
  the regulatory process. She cited two examples of regulatory flexibility in 
  support of this conclusion: (i)&nbsp;one instance where she found that the labelling 
  requirements for some heat-treated F&#8209;VIII were dispensed with; and (ii) 
  the existence of the EDRP. <span style='text-transform:

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The first example is mentioned in para.&nbsp;142 of the trial judge’s reasons 
  for judgment. The trial judge referred to a memorandum written by Ms. Krepps 
  from the BoB dated March 25, 1985.  The memorandum recorded a conversation between 
  Ms.&nbsp;Krepps and a Cutter employee in which the employee asked permission 
  to send heat-treated F-VIII to the CRCS with American labelling. The American 
  labelling would subsequently be “overstickered” with the Canadian licence number 
  and the drug identification number. Dr. Boucher of the BoB satisfied himself 
  that there was some urgency to the request and gave permission for this procedure. 
  The trial judge concluded that this incident provided evidence that the BoB 
  had the capability, in collaboration with the CRCS, to respond to “urgent circumstances” 
  by dispensing in that case with labelling requirements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[178]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  We agree with Canada’s submission that this example provides no support for 
  the conclusion that the BoB could dispense with any regulatory requirement. 
  Ms. Krepps testified that the difference between the American and Canadian labelling 
  was that in Canada the labels of the drugs had to show the company’s Canadian 
  licence number as well as the drug identification number. In the example relied 
  on by the trial judge, the BoB agreed that the vials of F&#8209;VIII could be 
  “overstickered” to include this information. Hence the labelling requirements 
  were not dispensed with. Rather, the required information was pasted to the 
  American labels pending the printing of the Canadian labels. Further,  Canada 
  points out that, unlike the heat-treated F-IX at issue in this litigation, heat-treated 
  F-VIII was a commercial product manufactured by Cutter with an American label. 
  Cutter would never have printed an American label for the custom manufactured 
  F-IX at issue in this appeal.<span style='text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:-.15pt'></span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The second example referred to by the trial judge as providing evidence of the 
  BoB’s flexibility was the EDRP. The EDRP is expressly provided for under the 
  <i>Food and Drug Regulations</i> and allows a treating physician to request 
  an unapproved drug for his or her patient. The BoB can authorize the manufacturer 
  to provide the physician with the requested drug. Ms.&nbsp;Krepps, a BoB employee, 
  testified about the release to a physician of an unapproved drug under the EDRP.  
  The trial judge concluded (at para.&nbsp;144):<span style='text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:-.15pt'></span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Ms.&nbsp;Krepps’ evidence demonstrated that <u>there was a capability in 
      the BoB to be flexible with respect to regulatory requirements in emergency 
      circumstances</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  We agree with Canada’s submission that the existence of the EDRP provides no 
  assistance in determining the issues raised in this case because no request 
  was ever made by any of the plaintiffs’ physicians for heat-treated F-IX. Moreover, 
  in our view, the existence of the EDRP does not demonstrate a general regulatory 
  flexibility.  Rather, it demonstrates that the regulatory window of flexibility 
  was open only to the limited extent that physicians in prescribed circumstances 
  could gain access to unapproved drugs.  We note that in 1998, provision was 
  made to the EDRP for the issuance of a NoC with conditions. </p>

  The trial judge fixed the value of the claim for future care costs for Mr. Farrow 
  at $85,000, less 20% for contingencies.  Mr. Arenson suggested that this was 
  a “slip of the pen” and that the trial judge must have intended to award a higher 
  figure, approximately $180,000, on the basis of expert evidence that he described 
  as uncontradicted.  Although a number of damages issues were clarified before 
  the trial judge at a hearing subsequent to the delivery of her original reasons 
  for judgment, Mr.&nbsp;Arenson did not ask in those submissions for clarification 
  of the future care costs award or suggest that she had made an error in the 
  amount of that award.</p>

  Mr. Arenson’s suggestion that the evidence regarding future care costs was uncontradicted 
  is not entirely accurate.  Counsel for the CRCS made submissions at trial that 
  certain items of future care and the associated calculation of costs proposed 
  by the experts called by Mr. Arenson should be reduced to reflect other aspects 
  of the evidence given at the trial.  The CRCS suggested an amount for future 
  care costs between $76,745 and $86,143, less contingencies.  The trial judge 
  appears to have agreed with that submission and made an award at the high end 
  of the range suggested by the CRCS.  The figure she selected is supportable 
  by reference to the evidence and the submissions made to her.  Had we affirmed 
  the trial judge on the question of liability, we would not have disturbed her 
  award for Christopher Farrow’s future care costs.</p>

  The trial judge accepted the submissions of the CRCS that the value of the award 
  for Mr. Farrow’s future income during the “lost years” (when a claimant is alive 
  at the time of trial but has a shortened life expectancy) was $80,000, less 
  contingencies.  Mr.&nbsp;Arenson submitted that this value, inappropriately, 
  represented a reduction of Mr.&nbsp;Farrow’s income by over 90%, and argued 
  that we should substitute a figure of approximately $373,000, based on a 50% 
  reduction, the amount of the reduction made by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
  <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell (Guardian ad litem of) v. Burnaby Hospital</i>, [1994]

  In subsequent cases, trial judges have deviated from the 50% reduction on the 
  basis of the evidence before them, adopting the view that <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell</i> 
  enunciated the principle but did not dictate the percentage in calculating an 
  award for “lost years”. See <i>Marchand (Litigation guardian of) v. Public General 
  Hospital Society of Chatham</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 4420 (Gen. Div.), aff’d on

  no less than the award for Mr. Farrow.  In support of increased awards, he cited 
  the tragic personal circumstances of the lives and eventual deaths of Mr. Robb 
  and Mr. Rintoul.  In response, the CRCS directed our attention to a number of

  The trial judge dismissed the action against Bayer with costs.  She stated in 
  her supplementary reasons for judgment (at para. 33) that there was “no evidence 
  at any stage of the trial that Mr. Robb, Mr. Rintoul and Mr. Farrow were infected 
  by use of a non-heat-treated product manufactured by Bayer”.  Although Mr. Arenson 
  sought to reopen this question on the appeal, we are satisfied that the trial 
  judge’s finding had a sound foundation, and we would not disturb it. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The trial judge rejected the two allegations made by the plaintiffs against 
  Bayer.  The first was that Bayer should have warned the plaintiffs against the 
  risks of using unheated factor concentrates and provided them with information 
  about the alternatives to that method of treatment.  The second was that Bayer 
  was liable to them because of the length of time it took to get heat-treated 
  F-IX into Canada.  On appeal, Mr. Arenson pursued only the first of these two 
  allegations. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In holding that Bayer owed no duty to warn the plaintiffs, the trial judge relied 
  on unchallenged evidence that Cutter manufactured F-IX for the CRCS under a 
  plasma-processing agreement under which the CRCS retained ownership of the factor 
  concentrate.  She held that in these circumstances the duty to include an AIDS 
  warning on the manufactured product lay with the CRCS; in her view, the highest 
  duty that Cutter (now Bayer) owed was to warn the CRCS about the risk.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In 1983, when Cutter first considered the subject, it advised the CRCS about 
  its plan to add an AIDS warning to its own products and the content of that 
  warning.  From October 1984, Cutter’s own commercial unheated F-IX products 
  carried such a warning.  The CRCS chose not to add a warning at that time to 
  the F-IX products that Cutter manufactured for the CRCS.  The trial judge found 
  that, against this background, Bayer had discharged any obligation it had to 
  warn the CRCS. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>We agree with the trial judge's reasons regarding Bayer's duty and 
  for the further reason that, as she found and as we agree, there was no causal 
  connection between any suggested failure on the part of Bayer to warn the plaintiffs 
  and their infection with HIV, because there was no evidence that the plaintiffs 
  were infected by unheated F-IX manufactured by Bayer.</span></p>
<p><b><span>            </span>2.              Costs</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The plaintiffs also appealed the order that they pay Bayer’s costs of the action.  
  Instead, the plaintiffs sought an order refusing Bayer its costs, ordering Bayer 
  to pay their costs, or ordering that Bayer’s costs be paid by the CRCS pursuant 
  to either a <i>Bullock</i> or a <i>Sanderson</i> order.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[199]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The trial judge ordered that Bayer receive its costs from the plaintiffs for 
  two reasons: first, because these costs should follow the event; and second, 
  because, as stated in the supplementary reasons for judgment (at para.&nbsp;39), 
  “the reality [is] that Bayer should have been let out of these actions before 
  the trial started”.  Having regard to these factors and to our conclusion respecting 
  Bayer’s liability, there is no merit in the plaintiffs’ submission that we interfere 
  with the trial judge’s decision by refusing Bayer its costs or ordering Bayer 
  to pay costs. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The third suggestion – that Bayer’s costs be paid by the CRCS – was specifically 
  put to the trial judge. She observed that the case against Bayer had focused, 
  unsuccessfully, on the question of whether Bayer had a duty to warn the plaintiffs 
  and that the plaintiffs had advanced, also unsuccessfully, the same claim against 
  the CRCS.  The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs' submission that the CRCS 
  pay Bayer's costs on the basis that: (a) it was not reasonable for the plaintiffs 
  to keep Bayer in the action in the absence of evidence that they were infected 
  by the use of a Bayer product; and (b) it would be inequitable to require the 
  CRCS to pay Bayer’s costs given that the CRCS and Bayer both successfully defended 
  the same claim relating to the duty to warn.  We see no error in the trial judge’s 
  refusal to make a <i>Bullock</i> order or a <i>Sanderson</i> order with respect 
  to Bayer’s costs. </p>

           Bayer’s cross-appeal against the plaintiffs on costs</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The trial judge ordered the plaintiffs to pay Bayer’s costs from and after June&nbsp;29, 
  1998, the date on which Feldman J. added Bayer as a defendant in these actions.  
  Bayer asked leave to appeal that order and sought slightly earlier starting 
  dates in March (in respect of Mr. Farrow) and April (in respect of Mr.&nbsp;Robb 
  and Mr.&nbsp;Rintoul) of the same year.  Bayer’s position is that it attended 
  examinations for discovery of the plaintiffs in one of the actions and case 
  management meetings from and after these earlier dates in its capacity as a 
  “potential addition to the action as a defendant”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In our view, the decision of the trial judge to award costs to Bayer from the 
  date it became a defendant is more sensible than the suggested award of costs 
  from the date it participated in these actions as a “potential addition as a 
  defendant”.  We would grant leave to Bayer to appeal costs, but would dismiss 
  its appeal with costs in this court. </p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>C.            
  Claim against Ontario</p>

              Spoliation</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their claim against Ontario for spoliation 
  or destruction of evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[204]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The claim for spoliation in this case has had a chequered history.  Feldman&nbsp;J. 
  granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their statement of claim to plead spoliation 
  in May 1998: 24 C.P.C. (4th) 392 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  In her view, spoliation 
  was “a novel cause of action” that should not be struck out at the pleading 
  stage.  The Divisional Court reversed Feldman&nbsp;J.’s ruling in October 1998:  
  42 O.R. (3d) 379.  The majority in the Divisional Court held, at p. 384, that 
  “the foreseeable trend is to view ‘spoliation’ as an evidentiary rule that raises 
  a presumption and not as a stand-alone, independent tort”.  No leave to appeal 
  from the Divisional Court to this court was sought, undoubtedly because the 
  trial of these actions began in November 1998.  Notwithstanding the state of 
  the pleadings, evidence regarding the spoliation claim was led at the trial 
  and the trial judge requested submissions on the subject, which she heard in 
  February 2000.  In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge found against the 
  plaintiffs on the spoliation issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[205]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In this court, the plaintiffs renewed their claim for damages for spoliation 
  in their cross-appeal.  Ontario’s motion to quash that portion of the cross-appeal 
  was dismissed on the basis that there was a sufficient factual record in the 
  evidence at trial to permit the question to be addressed on appeal:  [2001] 
  O.J. No. 606 (C.A.).  The spoliation issue was therefore aired before us on 
  the argument of these appeals and cross-appeals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The plaintiffs’ claim for spoliation was summarized in their factum 
  in these words:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In a nutshell: at the direction of Ontario and other member provinces of 
      the Canadian Blood Committee [CBC], verbatim transcripts and audiotapes 
      of key CBC meetings were destroyed.  Members of the CBC did this in order 
      to hide evidence of wrongdoing.  The CBC was a committee of the provinces 
      and territories through which the Red Cross was paid to operate the blood 
      system in Canada.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[207]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  In dismissing this claim at trial, the trial judge adverted to the allegation 
  that “at a meeting of the CBC in May of 1989, the Secretariat of the CBC was 
  directed to destroy the verbatim transcripts and audio tapes of all meetings 
  of the CBC held between 1982 and 1989”.  Although she expressed unease about 
  the destruction of this material, she concluded (at para. 178) that she had 
  “no evidence as to who is responsible for the decisions that led to the destruction 
  of the verbatim transcripts and audio tapes” and accepted (at para. 181) Ontario’s 
  submission that: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>there is no admissible evidence to support the conclusion that Ontario 
      spoliated or destroyed evidence.  The plaintiffs did not prove that the 
      tapes and transcripts prepared by the Secretariat or the CBC were ever in 
      the possession or control of Ontario; the evidence is to the contrary.  
      The Secretariat was comprised of employees of Canada.  These employees were 
      not controlled by Ontario.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[208]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  We did not call upon counsel for Ontario to respond to the plaintiffs’ submissions 
  regarding spoliation.  In our view, assuming for the purposes of disposing of 
  this appeal that there is a separate tort of spoliation, this claim is completely 
  answered by the above-quoted extract, which accurately reflects the evidence 
  adduced at the trial. There is no merit in the claim for spoliation against 
  Ontario. </p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>            
  2.            Admissibility of documents</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[209]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The plaintiffs argue that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit certain 
  documents that they allege establish Ontario's role in the destruction of the 
  CBC audio tapes and transcripts.  These documents were: the minutes of the May 
  1989 meeting of the CBC, the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into 
  the Blood System (commonly referred to as the Krever Report), and the report 
  of the Information Commissioner of Canada John W. Grace into a complaint against 
  Canada regarding the destruction of audio tapes and transcripts of the CBC. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[210]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>In an unreported oral ruling made on June 30, 1999, the trial judge 
  refused to admit the CBC minutes as a business record under the <i>Ontario Evidence 
  Act</i> without the requisite evidentiary foundation. With respect to the Krever 
  Report and the Grace Report, the trial judge rejected the plaintiffs' submission 
  that these reports could be admitted under the public document exception to 
  the hearsay rule: 31 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 99 (Sup.&nbsp;Ct.). We agree with 
  the trial judge's rulings regarding the admissibility of these documents and 
  would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>D.         Disposition of the Cross-appeals

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[211]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  For these reasons, we would dismiss the cross-appeals by the plaintiffs.  We 
  would also grant leave to Bayer to cross-appeal on costs alone but would dismiss 
  that cross-appeal with costs.</p>
