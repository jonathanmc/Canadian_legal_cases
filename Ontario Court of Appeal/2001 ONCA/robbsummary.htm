<p align="center"><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Synopsis of appeal 
  judgment in <i>Robb v. Canadian Red Cross Society </i><br>
  and in the related cross-appeals and third-party appeal</span></b></p>
<h4><font size="3">Overview: </font></h4>
<p><font size="3">The Court of Appeal (Osborne A.C.J.O., Catzman and Charron JJ.A.) 
  today released its decision allowing an appeal by the Canadian Red Cross Society 
  (CRCS). The principal issues are the liability of the CRCS for damages sustained 
  by three hemophiliacs as a result of taking a manufactured blood factor concentrate 
  known as Factor IX (F-IX) and the trial judge's assessment of damages. </font></p>
<h4><font size="3">Background:</font></h4>
<p><font size="3">By late 1984, it was known in the Canadian and American blood 
  communities that factor concentrates, if not heated to certain specifications, 
  could contain viral agents such as HIV.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In 1985, the plaintiffs, Wayne Robb, Gray Rintoul and Christopher 
  Farrow, received F-IX to treat a blood disorder known as Haemophilia B. The 
  F-IX was allegedly contaminated with HIV with the result that each of the plaintiffs 
  became infected with HIV. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The CRCS distributed F-IX in Canada. The federal government, 
  through the Bureau of Biologics (BoB) (part of the Department of National Health 
  and Welfare), is responsible for the approval of new drugs in Canada. Bayer 
  (formerly known as Cutter) was a manufacturer of some of the F-IX distributed 
  by the CRCS.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The BoB must issue a notice of compliance (NoC) before a new 
  drug can be distributed in Canada. A NoC was required before heat-treated F-IX 
  could be distributed in Canada. The time it took for the NoC for heat-treated 
  F-IX to be issued and the responsibilities of the CRCS and the federal government 
  in regard to this process were central issues in this case. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The plaintiffs sued the CRCS, Bayer and Ontario for negligence 
  relating to the introduction of heat-treated F-IX into Canada. The plaintiffs 
  did not sue the federal government, having previously released the federal government 
  in exchange for payment of $120,000 each on a no-fault basis. The CRCS sued 
  the federal government as a third party, claiming that the federal government 
  was responsible for any delay in the issuance of the NoC.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The trial judge concluded that the CRCS and the federal government 
  delayed the introduction of heat-treated F-IX into Canada. She awarded the plaintiffs 
  damages in negligence against the CRCS and ordered the federal government to 
  indemnify the CRCS to the extent of 25%. The trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs' 
  negligence claims against Ontario and Bayer. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The CRCS and the federal government appealed the findings of 
  negligence. The CRCS also appealed some of the trial judge's damage assessments. 
  The plaintiffs cross-appealed on some of the trial judge's damage assessments 
  and the dismissal of their claims against Bayer and Ontario. The Court of Appeal 
  allowed the appeals by the CRCS and the federal government and dismissed the 
  plaintiffs' actions and the third-party claims.</font></p>
<h4><font size="3">Liability of the CRCS</font></h4>
<p><font size="3">In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal disagreed with 
  the trial judge's conclusion that the CRCS had a duty to do everything possible 
  to facilitate the transition from non-heated to heat-treated F-IX. The Court 
  of Appeal held that the CRCS was required to distribute safe F-IX or to warn 
  recipients of risks of which the CRCS knew or ought to have known and that, 
  to discharge this duty of care, the CRCS could not in a direct or indirect way 
  impede the lawful transition from unheated to heat-treated F-IX. That is to 
  say, the CRCS could not interfere with, and thus retard, the regulatory process 
  leading to the issuance of the required NoC for heat-treated F-IX. The Court 
  of Appeal, however, held that the CRCS was not required to take positive steps 
  to accelerate the NoC process. The Court of Appeal also concluded that the CRCS 
  did nothing to delay the issuance of the NoC.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Even assuming that the trial judge had correctly framed the 
  standard of care owed by the CRCS, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial 
  judgment for other reasons:</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The court concluded that the trial judge's findings of negligence 
  against the CRCS were based on a number of findings of facts with little or 
  no support in the trial evidence and that often ran counter to the trial judge's 
  evidentiary rulings. <br>
  The court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to prove the facts underlying 
  the expert testimony about when they became infected with HIV and that therefore 
  there was no evidence to support the trial judge's conclusion about these dates. 
  The trial judge's conclusion regarding the dates of infection was significant 
  to whether the CRCS's negligence caused the plaintiffs' injuries.<br>
  The court concluded that the trial judge's findings were based, in large part, 
  on adverse inferences drawn against the CRCS for failure to call certain witnesses 
  in circumstances where no such inferences were warranted. </font></p>
<h4><font size="3">Liability of the federal government</font></h4>
<p><font size="3">The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge's conclusion 
  that the federal government was required to expedite the issuance of the NoC 
  for heat-treated F-IX. The Court of Appeal observed that there was no evidence 
  that the regulatory process regarding the approval of new drugs in Canada fell 
  below any common-law standard. The Court of Appeal concluded that, in order 
  to discharge its duty of care, the federal government was required to take reasonable 
  steps to abide by its own regulatory processes and that it had no obligation 
  to, nor could it, dispense with the regulatory requirements for the approval 
  of heat-treated F-IX. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Even assuming that the federal government had the duty to expedite 
  the regulatory process, the Court of Appeal concluded there was no evidentiary 
  basis for the trial judge's conclusion that the federal government breached 
  this duty. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge's finding that 
  the evidence established that the federal government had the capability, within 
  the BoB, to expedite the regulatory process regarding the introduction of heat-treated 
  F-IX. The Court of Appeal also noted that its analysis regarding the adverse 
  inferences drawn by the trial judge against the CRCS applied equally to the 
  appeal by the federal government. <br>
