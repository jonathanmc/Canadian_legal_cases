  </span> This Court’s judgment in McAlpine’s appeal from the trial judgment of 
  Wein J. was released on February 9, 2001.  Problems have arisen with respect 
  to the form of the judgment.  Counsel have resolved some of them.  Two issues 
  remain.  One concerns costs related to the letter of credit that Woodbine was 
  required to obtain and keep in place and the other the post-judgment interest 
  rate applicable to the costs of the trial.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I advised counsel, I think that costs related to the letter of credit 
  which Woodbine was required to keep in place until McAlpine’s appeal was disposed 
  of should, consistent with Doherty J.A.’s interlocutory order, be borne by McAlpine, 
  but only to February 9, 2001 when this Court’s judgment was released.  I agree 
  with McAlpine’s submissions that the cancellation of the letter of credit, which 
  I am told came due about a month after the release of this Court’s judgment, 
  should be McAlpine’s responsibility only until the release of this court’s judgment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel also raised the issue of the post-judgment interest rate as 
  related to costs of the trial and the appeal.  It arises in this limited context.  
  Woodbine was awarded costs of the trial.  The applicable post-judgment interest 
  rate, determined administratively having regard to the relevant provisions of 
  the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, was 5%.  On the appeal, the trial judge’s 
  costs order in favour of Woodbine was not disturbed.  Because McAlpine achieved 
  substantial success on the appeal, it was awarded costs of the appeal.  The 
  applicable post-judgment interest rate on those costs was 7%.  Woodbine takes 
  issue with being required to pay 7% on the appeal costs, but being limited in 
  its entitlement to interest on its trial costs to 5%.  Thus, it seeks to vary 
  the post-judgment interest as related to the trial costs from 5% to 7%, as of 
  February 9, 2001, the date when McAlpine’s entitlement to post-judgment interest 
  on its appeal costs crystallized.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For purposes of settling the order, I accept, but do not decide, that 
  “the Court” has authority to vary the post-judgment interest rate.  I should, 
  however, say that I question whether this Court has jurisdiction to vary a post-judgment 
  interest rate imposed by the trial court in circumstances where no error is 
  shown in respect of post-judgment interest by the trial court.  Because I am 
  of the view that there is no proper basis to vary the post-judgment interest 
  rate with respect to the trial costs, I need not decide the issue of jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The rationale for post-judgment interest is entirely compensatory.  
  The obligation to pay, and the entitlement to, post-judgment interest recognizes 
  that the payor in theory has the benefit of the funds in question and the payee 
  is denied the benefit of those funds.  The <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> establishes 
  a coherent scheme for determining the applicable post-judgment interest rates.  
  It is not perfect.  Perfection is sacrificed in the interest of consistency 
  and certainty.  There will, of course, be cases where circumstances will require 
  a change in the post-judgment interest rate.  These cases will be exceptional.  
  See <i>Eastwalsh Homes Ltd. v. Anatal Development Corp.</i> (1995), 26 O.R. 
  (3d) 528.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, <i>prima facie</i>, the statutory post-judgment interest 
  rate should apply unless there are compelling and exceptional circumstances 
  to change the interest rate.  There are none in this case as I see it.  Both 
  the 5% trial post-judgment interest rate and the 7% Court of Appeal post-judgment 
  interest rate reflect the bank rate at the end of the first day of the last 
  month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which the order attracting post-judgment 
  interest falls.  See <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, s. 127(1).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I acknowledge that adjusting the post-judgment interest rate at some 
  reasonable intervals in response to interest rate changes, up or down, would 
  more precisely compensate the beneficiary of post-judgment interest.  The same 
  can be said of using compound, instead of simple, interest.  However, the Legislature 
  has chosen to follow a different path.  There is a <i>prima facie</i> entitlement 
  to the statutory pre and post-judgment interest rates.  See <i>Andani v. Peel 
  (Regional Municipality)</i>, [1993] O.J. 1604.  I see no basis upon which to 
  depart from the statutory post-judgment interest scheme.  Put another way, there 
  is nothing exceptional about this case that would justify the post-judgment 
  interest change that Woodbine seeks.</p>

'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would, therefore, not accede to Woodbine’s submission that the post-judgment 
  interest rate on Woodbine’s trial costs be varied to 7% as at February 9, 2001.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I think this disposes of the issues that were of concern to counsel.  
  Assuming that it does, counsel can prepare a draft judgment reflecting their 
  agreement on matters with respect to which there was a consensus and the reasons.
