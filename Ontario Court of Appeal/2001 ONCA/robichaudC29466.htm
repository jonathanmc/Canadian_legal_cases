<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>This is an appeal from the appellant’s conviction 
  for second degree murder, following trial before Then J. and a jury.  Mr. Wright’s 
  submissions on behalf of the appellant were grouped under four principal headings, 
  set out below substantially in the form in which they were expressed in his 
  factum.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>First, that the trial judge erred in permitting 
  the Crown to lead the expert evidence of Patricia Newall relating to the significance 
  of finding foreign DNA under the fingernails of the deceased.  We agree with 
  Crown counsel that the evidence of Ms.&nbsp;Newall and the use to which it was 
  put in this case met the analysis set out in <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 
  9.  In the recent decision of <i>R. v. J.-L.J</i>., [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, on 
  which Mr. Wright placed much reliance, Binnie J. observed (in para. 61) that 
  the <i>Mohan</i> analysis reposes a good deal of confidence in the trial judge’s 
  ability to discharge the gatekeeper function, and that his discharge of that 
  function is entitled to a high degree of respect.  The appellant’s defence was 
  based partly on the supposition that, if the DNA under the deceased’s fingernails 
  was his, it could have been transferred through casual conduct or during the 
  theft of her jewellery.  It was open to the Crown to rebut this aspect of the 
  defence by demonstrating that transference of DNA under fingernails does not 
  commonly occur, and Ms. Newall was qualified to furnish this testimony.  The 
  fact that part of the foundation for her evidence constituted hearsay did not 
  preclude its admissibility.  The basis for her opinion was simple to understand 
  and was fully canvassed during the course of her testimony.  We are not persuaded 
  that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Ms. Newall concerning 
  the frequency with which foreign DNA is detected underneath fingernails or in 
  the careful instructions he gave the jury to assess critically the weight they 
  chose to attach to all of the expert opinions presented before them and the 
  specific caution he gave to the jury with respect to the DNA evidence that Ms. 
  Newall had given. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Second, that the trial judge erred in instructing 
  the jury that the admission of the appellant (who was not a witness at the trial) 
  that he stole jewellery from the deceased could be used by them in the assessment 
  of the credibility of his statements to the police. Despite the fact that the 
  appellant did not testify, his credibility as a declarant was clearly an issue 
  at trial, and his admission of dishonesty by reason of the theft of the deceased’s 
  jewellery was relevant to the jury’s assessment of his credibility.  We see 
  no error in the trial judge’s instruction to the jury on this issue. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Third, that the trial judge erred in effectively 
  prohibiting the appellant from leading evidence of the disposition for violence 
  of Charles Schroeder.  If accepted, the propositions put forward by Mr. Wright 
  under this heading would have permitted the appellant to present an entirely 
  distorted picture to the jury.  The position advanced by Mr.&nbsp;Wright is 
  not supported by authority and, indeed, runs counter to the view expressed by 
  this court in <i>R. v. Parsons </i>(1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 226 and <i>R. v. Rodgers</i> 
  (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 568.  The trial judge did not err in making the ruling 
  he did.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Fourth, that the trial judge failed to instruct 
  the jury adequately with respect to the defence of drunkenness and the evidence 
  in support of that defence.  At trial, experienced defence counsel – whose position 
  was that the appellant did not kill the deceased, not that he did so under any 
  theory of diminished responsibility – specifically disavowed the defence of 
  drunkenness.  Having regard to evidence given by a number of witnesses regarding 
  the appellant’s apparent condition at the relevant times, the trial judge, properly 
  in our view, felt obliged to charge the jury on the defence of drunkenness.  
  He did so in a manner that put the issue before the jury without diminishing 
  the force of the defence position.  We find no error in the way in which the 
  trial judge charged the jury on this subject.</p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  </p>
