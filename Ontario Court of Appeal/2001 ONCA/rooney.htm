    </span>These reasons deal with two appeals from the trial judges dispositions 
    of costs. In the first appeal, the plaintiff Rooney seeks a Bullock or Sanderson 
    order that would direct the unsuccessful defendant Hnatiuk to pay for the 
    costs of the successful defendant, Graham. In the second appeal, Hnatiuk seeks 
    to set aside the Rule 49 order for solicitor and client costs for Rooney, 
    and seeks to alter the distribution of responsibility for those costs as between 
    the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In March of 1989, Jodi Rooney was struck by a vehicle driven by Dennis 
    Graham while she was driving her parents car. She sustained multiple and 
    serious injuries, including a brain injury that was accompanied by twelve 
    days in a coma.  Graham claimed that he was run off the road by Janet Hnatiuk, 
    causing him to lose control and cross the road into Rooneys path. Rooney 
    launched an action for negligence against the owners and drivers of both vehicles. 
    Because Graham was uninsured, Rooney also filed an action in contract against 
    her own insurer, State Farm, on the uninsured endorsement in her policy. State 
    Farm denied liability. It alleged that the accident was caused by Hnatiuk, 
    and it brought third party proceedings against Hnatiuk and others. Graham 
    did not defend at trial, his position being asserted by counsel for State 
    Farm. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Approximately one year later, Jodi Rooney was involved in a second 
    motor vehicle accident. This time, she was struck by a car driven by Jeffrey 
    Hill. The injuries sustained during the second collision overlapped, in part, 
    those sustained during the first. She sued Hill, which led to concerns as 
    to the allocation of damages between the various defendants. What were now 
    five separate actions were directed to be tried together. Only three of the 
    actions are part of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>At the conclusion of the trial the jury found Hnatiuk 100 per cent 
    responsible for the first accident, with the result that the uninsured defendant, 
    Graham, was not at fault. They found Hill 50 per cent responsible for the 
    second accident. They awarded Rooney $1,035,182.60 for damages in the first 
    accident and, after a reduction for contributory negligence, $61,452.25 for 
    the second accident. Because no fault was found on the part of Graham, the 
    action against State Farm was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In these reasons I will refer to each group of plaintiffs or defendants 
    as a single party. Pursuant to Rule 49, the trial judge ordered that Rooney 
    was entitled to party and party costs up to the date of her offer to settle, 
    and solicitor and client costs thereafter. She ordered that the costs were 
    to be divided between the unsuccessful defendants, Hnatiuk and Hill, in proportion 
    to their liability. Finally, she ordered that the costs of the successful 
    defendant, State Farm, were to be paid on a party and party basis by the plaintiff, 
    Rooney. Rooney sought that those costs be paid by Hnatiuk pursuant to a Sanderson 
    or Bullock order, but the trial judge refused. The trial judge's reasons are 
    reported at <i>Rooney (Litigation Guardian of) v. Graham, </i>[1998] O.J. 
    No. 2722.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>The First Appeal: The 
    Sanderson and Bullock Order </u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>A Bullock order directs an unsuccessful defendant to reimburse the 
    plaintiff for the recovered costs of a successful defendant. A Sanderson order 
    directs that the payment go directly to the successful defendant. The rational 
    behind both orders is the same. Where the allocation of responsibility is 
    uncertain, usually because of interwoven facts, it is often reasonable to 
    proceed through trial against more than one defendant. In these cases, a Bullock 
    or Sanderson order provides a plaintiff with an appropriate form of relief. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>A Bullock or Sanderson order has been said to be inappropriate when 
    an independent cause of action is alleged against each defendant, for example 
    when one is based in contract and the other in tort, or when separate actions 
    have been instituted against each defendant. See <i>Scarboro Golf &amp; Country 
    Club Ltd. v. City of Scarborough et al. (No. 2) </i>(1986), 32 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
    at p. 732 and <i>Dellelce Construction and Equipment v. Portec Inc. </i>(1990), 
    73 O.R. (2d) 396 (Ont. HC.) at p. 442.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In my view, these authorities do not provide a blanket rule that a 
    Bullock or Sanderson order can never be made when the causes of action are 
    independent, or when separate actions are instituted. Although such circumstances 
    may indicate the appropriateness of these orders, and will at times be determinative, 
    each case must be assessed on its own facts. The proper approach to issuing 
    a Bullock or Sanderson order will consider each case in its context. Thus, 
    there may be times where the causes of action are independent or the actions 
    separate, but it is nevertheless fair that the responsible defendant be called 
    upon to pay for the inclusion of others in the trial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In this case, a separate action was brought on the contract with State 
    Farm and was tried together with the negligence claims. Recall that Graham, 
    the uninsured motorist, did not defend. It was therefore necessary for State 
    Farm to present his defence. Further, if State Farm had not been sued directly, 
    it most certainly would have made itself a party in some guise in order to 
    protect its $1 million coverage of Rooney. Therefore, even though State Farm 
    was sued in contract, in reality it was defending against Grahams alleged 
    negligence. To put it another way, if Graham had defended the action and won, 
    a Sanderson or Bullock order against Hnatiuk would have been awarded in the 
    normal course. Why should the outcome be any different simply because Grahams 
    defence was provided by State Farm?  I see the form as one of separate actions 
    and distinct causes of action but the substance being one of a plaintiff suing 
    two persons in negligence, one or both of whom may have caused her injuries 
    in the first accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In finding that Hnatiuk was not responsible for any of State Farms 
    costs, the trial judge relied on the plaintiffs refusal to accept State Farms 
    offer to settle. She concluded at paragraph 33:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that 
    the defendants Hnatiuk should not be responsible for any costs of the defendant 
    State Farm. The decision to include State Farm in the trial and the decision 
    not to accept  State Farms  offer to settle was made by the plaintiffs alone 
    and they must abide by the consequences of that decision. The costs in the 
    contract action cannot be settled on the unsuccessful defendant in the negligence 
    action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>State Farms offer asked Rooney to accept a dismissal of the claim 
    with, costs to be assessed. This was not an offer which could engage Rule 
    49 because that rule, by its wording, only applies when a plaintiff recovers 
    a judgment. A dismissal of a plaintiff's claim is not a recovery. Therefore, 
    a defendant who offers a dismissal is not making a Rule 49 offer. See <i>S.A. 
    Strasser Ltd. v. Richmond Hill (Town) </i>(1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 243. In refusing 
    this offer, Rooney was doing no more than re-affirming her original decision 
    to sue State Farm. It was certainly reasonable to sue the owner and driver 
    of the vehicle that struck her and, when they didnt defend, to pursue the 
    responsible insurer. There is nothing on the record to show that at the time 
    the offer was made it would have been unreasonable to continue the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Therefore, it is my conclusion that the trial judge erred in relying 
    on the refusal of the offer to settle as a factor in her decision not to make 
    a Bullock or Sanderson order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge also relied upon the reasons of this court in <i>Katsiroumbas 
    v. Dasilva et al. </i>(1982), 132 D.L.R. (3d) 696 (C.A.) per McKinnon A.C.J.O. 
    at p. 700:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>The trial Judge made a form of Bullock order based on 
    the following facts. He assessed the damages in the second action, which was 
    being tried by him alone, at a lesser amount than the defendant Schack had 
    paid into Court. As a result, the respondent (plaintiff) was called on to 
    pay to that defendant her costs of the second action from the time of payment 
    on the Supreme Court scale. The trial Judge ordered the appellant to pay to 
    the respondent all costs the respondent might have to pay Schack. The trial 
    judge did this because he was of the view that the  Schack action would have 
    been  settled were it not for the fact of the Dasilva action and that  the 
    appellants were seeking in that action to shift as much of the damages as 
    possible to the Schack action. This, it seems to us, was quite a legitimate 
    position for the appellants to take.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>There were, as stated, two separate actions which were 
    not consolidated and indeed the appellants could not have served a jury notice 
    in the second action as they had in the first. We have grave doubts as to 
    the trial Judges <i>jurisdiction</i> to award costs against one who was, 
    in effect, a stranger to that action. In any event, we do not think the circumstances 
    warranted any such unusual order. The respondent was <i>dominus litus</i> 
    in both actions and he could not shift the burden of settling one or other 
    of the actions onto the shoulders of the defendant or defendants in the other. 
    The respondent conducted his cases as he saw fit, assessing the risks and 
    other considerations and he cannot place the risk of costs on another party 
    for his (the respondents) failure to take an advantageous settlement [emphasis 
    added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Justice McKinnons reference to jurisdiction is clearly obiter. The 
    operative sentence is: we do not think the circumstances warranted any such 
    unusual order. In that case, a plaintiff was being penalized for failing 
    to accept an offer greater than the amount eventually recovered at trial. 
    The plaintiff was being prevented from obtaining reimbursement for the penalty 
    from a defendant who had nothing to do with either the offer, or the failure 
    to accept. I therefore take the decision in <i>Katsiroumbas</i> as confirmation 
    of my view that in considering whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff 
    to continue to trial against a defendant, and whether it is fair to visit 
    the costs of that decision upon an unsuccessful defendant, all the circumstances 
    of the case must be considered.  The plaintiff in <i>Katsiroumbas</i> clearly 
    failed the fairness test. However, I do not take from this that the mere fact 
    of two actions is in itself a bar to a Bullock or Sanderson order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The question as to the jurisdiction to award costs against strangers 
    to the action arose in the context of attempts to visit costs upon the principals 
    of corporate plaintiffs. In <i>Rockewell Developments Ltd. v. Newtonbrook 
    Plaza Ltd</i>. (1972), 27 D.L.R. (3d) 651 (Ont. C.A.) this court set aside 
    an order for costs against such a principal. Arnup J. held at p. 658 that 
    what is now s.131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, Chap. C.43 
    should be interpreted as restricted to awarding costs against &quot;parties 
    to the proceeding before the court or judge&quot;. Exceptions were noted in 
    such cases as where a &quot;straw person&quot; was put forward by the &quot;real 
    plaintiff&quot;. The same principle was applied to a similar fact situation 
    in <i>Television Real Estate Ltd. v. Rogers Cable T.V. Ltd</i>. (1997), 34 
    O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>That is the context in which the courts have used the term &quot;stranger 
    to the action&quot;. Hnatiuk is not a stranger to the action against State 
    Farm in any real sense, and certainly not to the proceedings as a whole. Hnatiuk 
    and State Farm were active opponents in the struggle to deny liability or 
    foist it on the other, albeit from the vantage point of separate actions. 
    I see no reason to limit the jurisdiction of the court under s.131 in these 
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I conclude that the trial judge erred in failing to recognize that, 
    despite multiple causes of action and separate actions, the plaintiffs were 
    in substance pursuing two potential perpetrators of negligent conduct. Furthermore, 
    the plaintiffs acted reasonably throughout. Under the circumstances, therefore, 
    fairness dictates that the party found to be responsible pay for the consequences 
    of her negligent conduct; those consequences being in part the trial that 
    was held in order to determine who, in fact, was responsible for the collision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I would therefore allow this appeal and award a Sanderson order for 
    payment by Hnatiuk of State Farms party and party costs. </p>

    </span>The first element of Hnatiuks appeal has to do with the distribution 
    of Rooneys costs as between her and Hill. The trial judge divided these costs 
    95 per cent to Hnatiuk and five per cent to Hill. She based her assessment 
    on the apportionment of recovered damages by the plaintiffs in each action. 
    Hnatiuks counsel submitted that there were other possible approaches. This 
    is true, but I cannot say that the trial judge erred in principle in choosing 
    the approach that she did, and I would therefore not interfere with her decision 
    in this regard.</p>

    </span>The second element of Hnatiuks appeal is her submission that Rooney 
    should not have been awarded her solicitor and client costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In four of the five actions filed the plaintiff served an offer to 
    settle on the defendants well before trial. The terms of the offer required 
    payment of $800,000, plus prejudgment interest at the rate of ten per cent 
    on the sum of $225,000 from the date of the offer to the date of acceptance. 
    In addition, the offer sought party and party costs to the date of the offer 
    and solicitor and client costs as assessed or agreed upon thereafter. The 
    offer was to be held open until five minutes after the opening of trial. An 
    issue was raised as to the offer not being served on all parties. I see this 
    as a technicality that should not govern the outcome. It is clear Hnatiuk 
    had the opportunity to accept the offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>As of the date of trial, Rooneys offer would have resulted in a payment 
    to her of approximately $822,000 plus costs, $200,000 short of the judgment 
    against Hnatiuk. The value of the offer at the opening of trial, including 
    the solicitor and client cost differential, was not calculated, presumably 
    because it was felt the amount would not fill the gap. Accordingly, the trial 
    judge awarded solicitor and client costs following the date of the offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Several authorities have discussed the appropriateness of including 
    solicitor and client costs in an offer to settle. Most of these authorities 
    have found that such offers lack the certainty or precision that is required 
    by Rule 49. See <i>Schumacher v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</i> (1999), 173 D.L.R. 
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 577 (Ont. C.A.); <i>MacDonald (c.o.b. P &amp; L Services) 
    v. Klein</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 812 (Ont. Gen. Div.); <i>Cass v. Muir</i> (1996), 
    29 O.R. (3d) 476 (Div. Ct.); <i>Daniels</i> <i>v. Crosfield (Canada) Inc.</i>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>There are distinctions among these authorities and with the instant 
    appeal, but the problem I see is even more fundamental than uncertainty. The 
    basic defect in the plaintiffs offer is that it was not fixed in place until 
    trial. Rather, according to the terms of the offer both the solicitor and 
    client costs and the interest on the $225,000 escalate each day leading to 
    trial. In substance, therefore, it is a different offer on each successive 
    day.</p>

    </span>This issue was identified by J. MacDonald J. in <i>Yepremian v. Weisz</i> 
    (1983), 16 O.R (3d) 121 (Ont. Gen. Div.). In that case, the offer by the defendant 
    was fixed for a month and then reduced from time to time by the defendants 
    party and party costs. J. MacDonald J. states at p.123:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>The format of para. 1 of this offer to settle is continuously 
    varied for purposes of any settlement by means of acceptance after April 6. 
    I conclude it is thus withdrawn and has something fresh substituted for it 
    on each occasion that the defendants party-and-party costs including assessable 
  </p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>disbursements vary. Consequently, if the plaintiff were 
    to wish to settle this action, he would have no knowledge of what it offered. 
    That injects a note of substantial instability into the settlement scenario, 
    contrary to the meaning of the rule in my opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>It is not only the parties, it is also the administration 
    of justice which has an interest in stimulating settlement. Settlement can 
    only be contemplated and accomplished if there is something fixed and determinable 
    to contemplate and accept. There was no such fixed and determinable offer. 
    Right through the period of seven days prior to trial this offer was continuously 
    variable. In fact, the closer the trial came, the more the defendants trial 
    preparation likely was and the less the offer, at the very time the plaintiff 
    was most likely to focus on the benefits, costs and risks of proceeding to 
    trial.</p>

    </span>After considerable thought and debate with the members of this panel 
    it is my conclusion that as the rules now stand there should be no cost consequences 
    under r.49.10 for failure to accept an escalating offer. In arriving at that 
    conclusion I concede that there are logical arguments to the contrary, particularly 
    when considering settlement of an action. The focus of my attention is upon 
    the trial judge who has awarded judgment and must assess whether it is more 
    favourable than an earlier offer. As a simple example, assume a plaintiffs 
    offer made on October 1, 1999 of $100,000 and a judgment awarded on October 
    1, 2000 of $120,000 including prejudgment interest. The judgment is clearly 
    more than the offer and solicitor and client costs from October 1, 1999 would 
    be awarded. That is the simple, clear way the rule was intended to operate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>If an offer can include an escalating amount for solicitor and client 
    costs the simplicity is lost. Not only must the opposite party consider accepting 
    an offer with an unquantified feature, but the trial judge would have to conduct 
    a double assessment of costs from October 1999 to October 2000 in order to 
    determine how much the excess is over party and party costs. That is because 
    party and party costs are not part of the equation under r.49.10 and only 
    the increment would be added to the offer to obtain its overall value. I cannot 
    believe that the rule was drafted with the intention of throwing this burden 
    on the trial judge. And, if condoned, it will predictably be the rule rather 
    than the exception to include solicitor and clients costs in all offers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Assume the trial judge follows the above procedure and concludes that 
    the increment for costs to the offer in my example should be $13,000. That 
    makes the recovery greater than the offer and the plaintiff will recover that 
    $13,000 as part of the solicitor-client entitlement. Note that the result 
    is the same if the offer did not contain the incremental feature. The plaintiff 
    still gets that $13,000 on top of the party and party costs. Now suppose the 
    increment was assessed at $22,000. This would make the judgment less than 
    the offer and, in the result the plaintiff would lose solicitor and client 
    costs because she asked for them. Neither scenario is the intended operation 
    of r.49.10. The inclusion of ongoing solicitor and client costs in an offer 
    can have a salutory effect in encouraging settlement, but creates an artificial 
    effect after judgment. That artificiality extends to the potential that counsel 
    for the offeror might have to compromise the claim for costs to assure that 
    the judgment is greater than the offer, or face a conflict with the client 
    over whose interest should prevail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The rule is geared to a single offer or sequential offers, each rescinding 
    the last. When that structural feature is altered by the introduction of a 
    single escalating (or declining) offer the cracks begin to appear. For instance, 
    r.49(10)(1)(a) provides that an offer must be open for seven days prior to 
    trial. This is obviously intended to provide an opportunity for a contemplative 
    decision. Yet, the escalation feature is at a boil as counsel prepare for 
    trial and add significant amounts to the solicitor and client increment. The 
    concept of contemplation is defeated by the pressure of watching the offer 
    rise or fall by unquantifiable amounts justified by the opponents preparation 
    for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>To this point I have restricted my comments to escalating solicitor 
    and client costs. The inclusion of a general claim for prejudgment interest 
    in an offer presents no problems to the trial judge because it appears as 
    the same amount in both the offer and the judgment. However, if presented 
    as a general claim (in the present case it was fixed at 10% of $225,000) it 
    does provide problems to the offeree. Section 128 of the <i>Courts of Justice 
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.43, provides for different rates for different types 
    of claims and, thus, whenever the claim is a mixed one there would be no means 
    whereby the offeree would know the current amount being offered. Further s.128 
    refers to persons entitled to an order for the payment of money and must 
    be read in the context of s.130 providing for compromise awards where appropriate. 
    The sections are designed for application by a judge exercising a discretion 
    in all the circumstances and not for parties who are not entitled to an order, 
    do not know the mix of the award or the entitlement to compromise. This is 
    not to say that prejudgment interest  should not form part of a settlement. 
    It is rather that if a fixed dollar amount is not in the offer there is no 
    mathematical formula to produce what a court would award. While a stipulation 
    for prejudgment interest at a fixed rate might raise no practical problems, 
    the next step would be offers of, say, $100,000 to increase or decrease by 
    $5,000 a month until trial. That is the ultimate extension of any escalation 
    feature in an offer and would introduce an element of tactical use of offers, 
    which is quite appropriate generally in litigation, but distorts the function 
    of r.49.10 under which the trial judge should be considering solely a penalty 
    to a party who has a single offer presented and refuses to accept in knowledge 
    of the consequences. Anything more complicated than that can be left to the 
    discretionary power of the trial judge under r.49.13 permitting consideration 
    of any offer in awarding costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Rule 49.07(5)(b) provides that if an offer does not deal with costs 
    then party and party costs are recoverable to the date of acceptance. If this 
    be viewed as an escalation clause, it is one that is specifically permitted 
    by the wording of the rule and works in conjunction with the other mechanisms 
    of the rule. In reality it is a simple recognition that if an offer is accepted 
    it should carry with it party and party costs to that date, and should be 
    distinguished from the penalty provisions for refusing an offer. If the Rules 
    Committee wishes to include prejudgment interest it could be added to this 
    rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Rule 49 has been, perhaps, the most successful innovation of the 1984 
    amendments. It is the one rule that clients are attuned to. Lawyers deal with 
    the other rules regulating the progress of litigation largely on their own 
    judgment. The offer to settle and its implications come straight home to the 
    client for a decision. It should remain easy to understand and respond to 
    without doubt as to its effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I am not unmindful of the fact that the underlying purpose of Rule 
    49 is to encourage imaginative approaches to offers to settle and induce settlement. 
    An escalating or declining offer is an effective means of attracting the serious 
    attention of the opposite party. Arguably, these offers should be encouraged. 
    However, the tactical purpose of such an offer can be accomplished without 
    undermining the Rules, simply by withdrawing an offer and serving it afresh 
    from time to time. A demand for additional amounts in each successive offer 
    will compensate for any decrease in the ultimate recovery of solicitor and 
    client costs, while maintaining the integrity of the offer to settle machinery.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In reaching the conclusion that an escalating offer is inconsistent 
    with Rule 49, I recognize that two general division judges have made findings 
    to the contrary. See <i>McGregor</i> <i>v. Crossland</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 
    2513 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 28 and <i>Innovative</i> <i>Automation Inc. 
    v. Candea Inc.,</i> [1998] O.J. No. 1499 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 3. However, 
    neither of these decisions analyzes this issue in any depth, and both should 
    in my opinion be considered overruled.</p>

    </span>Having expressed my views on the appropriate operation of r.49.10 I 
    return to the merits of this appeal. While I do not accept the trial judges 
    approach to r.49.10 I must recognize that the recovery was well above the 
    offer and that the offer was made in good faith at a time when there was uncertainty 
    as to the appropriate interpretation of the rule. I would exercise the discretion 
    under r.49.13 to support the trial judges ruling.</p>

    </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Carthy J.A. On the 
    first appeal (Rooneys appeal), I agree with his analysis and I agree that 
    the plaintiff Rooney is entitled to a <i>Sanderson</i> order directing Hnatiuk 
    to pay the costs of Rooney<span lang=EN-US>s</span> insurer State Farm. On 
    the second appeal (Hnatiuks appeal), I too would not interfere with the trial 
    judges distribution of Rooneys costs between Hnatiuk and Hill. I also would 
    not interfere with the trial judges order that Rooney is entitled to party-and-party 
    costs up to October 7, 1996, the date of her offer to settle, and solicitor-and-client 
    costs afterwards. However, I disagree with my colleagues analysis. Carthy 
    J.A. concludes that Rooneys offer to settle was not a rule 49 offer but he 
    affirms the trial judges costs order by applying rule 49.13. I conclude that 
    Rooneys offer to settle was a rule 49 offer and I would affirm the trial 
    judges order by applying rule 49.10 and holding that Rooney obtained a judgment 
    more favourable than her offer.</p>
  <p class=headingtitle>Background</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>On October 7, 1996, Rooney served a written offer to settle on all 
    defendants in four separate actions. She agreed to settle the actions for 
    the following:</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>$800,000 (after deduction of advance payments);</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>prejudgment interest at 10% per year on the sum of $225,000 from the 
    date of the offer to the date of settlement or judgment; and</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>reasonable party-and-party costs, as assessed by an assessment officer 
    or agreed upon, up to the date of the offer, and afterwards reasonable solicitor-and-client 
    costs as assessed or agreed upon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The offer to settle remained open to all defendants until five minutes 
    after the trial began when it was automatically withdrawn. Hnatiuk did not 
    accept Rooneys offer and did not make any offer herself. The jury awarded 
    Rooney damages of $1,035,182.60 against Hnatiuk and $61,452.25 against Hill. 
    The trial judge found that at the date of trial Rooneys offer to settle would 
    have resulted in a payment of $821,945.21 plus costs as agreed or as assessed. 
    In awarding Rooney her solicitor-and-client costs after the date of the offer 
    to settle, the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Here, the plaintiff has clearly obtained a judgment generally 
    more favourable than any offer to settle. The jury awarded $200,000.00 more 
    than the amount the plaintiffs were willing to settle for. As  I noted earlier, 
    the defendants Hills offer was less than that recovered by the jury and the 
    defendants Hnatiuk served no offer at all.</p>
  <p class=headingtitle>Discussion</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Hnatiuks main ground of appeal  accepted by Carthy J.A.  is that 
    by including a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs, Rooneys 
    offer was not an offer to settle under rule 49 and therefore could not attract 
    the cost consequences of rule 49.10. I disagree. In part, our disagreement 
    turns on how Rooneys offer should be characterized. Because both solicitor-and-client 
    costs and prejudgment interest increase each day, Carthy J.A. concludes that 
    in substance  it is a different offer on each successive day.  I prefer 
    to characterize Rooneys offer as a single offer that varies in amount over 
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I think, however, that two more important considerations justify treating 
    Rooneys offer to settle as a rule 49 offer. The first is the wording of rule 
    49.07(5); the second is the purpose of rule 49.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Rule 49.07(5) deals with what happens when an accepted offer to settle 
    does not provide for costs. It states:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><b>49.07 (5)</b>  <i>Costs</i>  Where an accepted offer 
    to settle does not provide for the disposition of costs, the plaintiff is 
    entitled,</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)    where the offer was made by the 
    defendant, to the plaintiffs costs assessed to the date the plaintiff was 
    served with the offer; or</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)    where the offer was made by the 
    plaintiff, to the plaintiffs costs assessed to the date that the notice of 
    acceptance was served.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>By stating what happens when 
    an offer contains no provision for costs, rule 49.07(5) implicitly affirms 
    that a rule 49 offer can contain a provision for costs. Indeed a plaintiff 
    must be able to include a provision for ongoing party-and-party costs in a 
    rule&nbsp;49 offer because even absent such a provision the plaintiff is entitled 
    to its party-and-party costs once the offer is accepted. If, therefore, a 
    rule&nbsp;49 offer can provide for ongoing party-and-party costs I see no 
    valid reason why a rule&nbsp;49 offer cannot also provide for ongoing solicitor-and-client 
    costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>A provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs is, in some measure, 
    uncertain. But so too is a provision for ongoing party-and-party costs. This 
    uncertainty should not invalidate rule 49 offers. I recognize that some 
    courts have taken the opposite view. It seems to me, however, that in evaluating 
    a rule 49 offer any uncertainty that arises from a provision for costs should 
    only be relevant in deciding whether the party relying on the offer has met 
    its burden of proof under rule 49.10(3). In other words, uncertainty or lack 
    of clarity in an offer may prevent a party from showing that the judgment 
    it obtained was as favourable as the terms of the offer to settle, or more 
    or less favourable, as the case may be.  See <i>Schumacher v. Toronto-Dominion 
    Bank</i> (1997), 153 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 187 (Ont. Gen. Div.); affd (1999), 
    173 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 577 (Ont. C.A.). I do not think the court should 
    interpret rule 49 in a way that limits the creativity of the bar in fashioning 
    offers to settle. A party wishing to make its offer more, or less, attractive 
    by including a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs should be 
    free to do so. If the drafters of the rule had intended that rule 49 offers 
    could not contain a provision for ongoing costs or a provision for ongoing 
    solicitor-and-client costs, presumably they would have said so, and rule 49.07(5) 
    would have been worded differently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The purpose of rule 49 is to encourage parties to make reasonable offers 
    to settle and to facilitate the early settlement of litigation. Holding that 
    a rule 49 offer cannot include a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client 
    costs does not promote the purpose of the rule in two ways.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>First, parties may have less incentive to make reasonable offers to 
    settle because the opposite party can depreciate the real value of the offer. 
    Correspondingly the opposite party may have less incentive to accept an offer 
    when it is made. Suppose a year before trial a plaintiff makes an offer to 
    settle a case for $100,000. The offer is left open until five minutes after 
    the trial begins but contains no provision for ongoing costs after the date 
    it was made. If the defendant waits until the day before trial to accept the 
    offer, under rule&nbsp;49.07(5)(b) it will be responsible for the plaintiffs 
    party-and-party costs for that year. The plaintiff, however, will have to 
    absorb a years worth of the difference between solicitor-and-client and party-and-party 
    costs. The real value of the plaintiffs offer will therefore be substantially 
    diluted. This result should not be forced on the plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In making rule 49 offers a party should be entitled to try to protect 
    itself fully against ongoing costs should it choose to do so. If the action 
    is not settled, including a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs 
    in an offer carries the risk  as I will discuss  that the party making the 
    offer will lose the benefit of rule 49.10. But parties should be free to accept 
    that risk if they wish to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Holding that a rule 49 offer cannot contain a provision for ongoing 
    solicitor-and-client costs does not promote the purpose of the rule in a second 
    and related way. To protect itself from having ongoing costs depreciate the 
    value of its offer, a party may feel obliged to make successive and increasing 
    offers to settle. Indeed, Carthy J.A. suggests this as a practical solution. 
    He acknowledges that an escalating or declining offer is an effective means 
    of attracting the serious attention of the opposite party and he recognizes 
    that these offers should be encouraged. Therefore, he proposes that a party 
    simply withdraw its offer and serve it afresh from time to time, asking for 
    additional amounts in its successive offers. I find this proposal an unsatisfactory 
    solution in part because a party may not be able to rely on its earlier offer 
    and, therefore, may lose some of the benefit of rule 49. See <i>Mortimer v. 
    Cameron</i> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 1 at 22 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>What I have said about ongoing costs provisions in an offer applies 
    to provisions for prejudgment interest. Carthy J.A. suggests that even some 
    provisions for prejudgment interest may deprive a party of the cost consequences 
    of rule 49.10. Rule 49 offers routinely contain provisions for prejudgment 
    interest, either a specified amount or, as in this case, a specified rate. 
    The calculation of prejudgment interest ordinarily is not difficult. I see 
    no justification for interpreting rule 49 to preclude provisions for ongoing 
    prejudgment interest in offers to settle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>What underlies Justice Carthys reasoning is the concern that including 
    a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs (or even some provisions 
    for prejudgment interest) in an offer to settle may prevent rule 49 from being 
    simply and easily applied, and may impose an additional burden on the trial 
    judge. I acknowledge this to be a valid concern. The concern would not arise 
    in offers containing a provision for ongoing party-and-party costs, because 
    that provision would ordinarily be offset exactly by the usual award of party-and-party 
    costs to the successful litigant. However, a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client 
    costs in an offer may require the trial judge to conduct what amounts to a 
    mini-assessment in order to apply rule 49.10. I see no way of avoiding this 
    result without undermining the wording or the purpose of rule 49. At least 
    the party making the offer will have the burden of satisfying the court that 
    its offer meets the test in rule 49.10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Further, a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs in an offer 
    may also require cooperation from the bar. A party to whom an offer is made 
    must be able to evaluate the offer at any time after it is made in order to 
    decide whether to accept it. Thus, the party making the offer must be forthright 
    and candid in disclosing the amount of solicitor-and-client costs incurred. 
    A failure to cooperate may be dealt with by the trial judges overall discretion

    </span>I therefore conclude that provisions in an offer to settle for ongoing 
    costs or ongoing solicitor-and-client costs and for ongoing prejudgment interest 
    do not deprive the party making the offer  in this case, the plaintiff Rooney 
     from the benefits of rule 49.</p>

    </span>Hnatiuk makes one further submission why Rooneys offer to settle is 
    not a rule 49 offer. Hnatiuk contends that because Rooneys offer was one 
    overall offer, it could not be partially accepted by any one defendant and, 
    therefore, was not entitled to the benefit of rule 49. This contention is 
    effectively answered by Justice Rutherfords comments in <i>Carleton Condominium 
    Corp. No. 97 v. Costcan Development Corp.</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 4091 (Gen. 
    Div.):</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>I think Rule 49 permits a plaintiff to make a global offer 
    to multiple defendants putting the onus on them to come up with a method of 
    sharing the burden of accepting the offer or risking the burden of solicitor-client 
    costs if the offer is not accepted and, overall, the trial result is more 
    favourable to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>This approach creates a considerable incentive for multiple 
    defendants to try to find a formula for acceptance of an offer to settle. 
    Such global offer does not prejudice individual defendants, all of whom can 
    deal with such a global offer in concert with the other defendants or as individuals 
    by offering an amount to settle just as against it. In this case, while the 
    global offer by the plaintiff was not accepted by the defendants, each of 
    them submitted a subsequent offer to the plaintiff, in an amount significantly 
    less than each was adjudged liable to pay in the trial judgment.</p>

    </span>I therefore conclude that Rooneys offer to settle, which includes 
    provisions for ongoing solicitor-and-client costs and prejudgment interest 
    after the date of the offer is a rule 49 offer, and attracts the cost consequences 
    of rule 49.10.</p>

    </span>The question the trial judge had to answer was whether Rooneys judgment 
    against Hnatiuk was as favourable as or more favourable than her offer to 
    settle. The trial judge concluded that the judgment was more favourable by 
    comparing, at the date of trial, the amount of damages Rooney received from 
    Hnatiuk ($1,035,182.60) with the amount of damages, including prejudgment 
    interest, demanded in the offer ($821,945.21). As the former amount exceeded 
    the latter, the trial judge concluded that Rooney was entitled to solicitor-and-client 
    costs from the date of the offer. Although I agree with the trial judges 
    conclusion, I do not agree with her analysis. In comparing the plaintiffs 
    offer with her judgment, the trial judge failed to take into account the cost 
    provisions of each.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In my view, under rule 49.10, all the terms of an offer to settle, 
    including any provision for costs, must be compared with all the terms of 
    the judgment, ordinarily including the disposition of costs. When the offer 
    contains a provision for ongoing costs and ongoing prejudgment interest, the 
    proper date for comparison is the date of judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The difficult question is what cost comparison to make when the offer 
    includes, as it does here, a provision for solicitor-and-client costs from 
    the date it was made. In my view, for the period following the date of the 
    offer, the proper comparison is between solicitor-and-clients costs in the 
    offer and party-and-party costs in the judgment (other than the rare case 
    in which the losing partys conduct would justify an award of solicitor-and-client 
    costs). In other words, for the purpose of comparing the offer with the judgment 
    under rule 49.10, the court must compare the cost provisions in the offer 
    with the trial judges usual award of party-and-party costs to the successful 
    litigant. In practice, some trial judges do not make an order for costs until 
    they have seen the rule 49 offers. In those cases, for the purpose of comparison 
    under rule 49.10, the court has to assume party-and-party costs of the action. 
    This approach is consistent with the reasoning of Borins J. in <i>Daniels 
    v. Crosfield</i> <i>(Canada) Inc.</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 430 (Gen. Div.). 
    To assume solicitor-and-client costs from the date of the offer is to assume 
    a result that is only obtained by applying rule&nbsp;49. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I can understand why Rooney included a provision for ongoing solicitor-and-client 
    costs in her offer to settle. As I said earlier, she did so to ensure that 
    the value of her offer was not diluted over time and to encourage the defendants 
    to settle early. However, by including this provision, she ran the risk that 
    she would lose the benefit of rule 49.10 if the other terms of the offer were 
    close to, though higher than, the corresponding terms of the judgment. Apart 
    from rule 49, the defendants conduct in this case did not justify a solicitor-and-client 
    cost award. Therefore, to obtain the benefit of rule 49.10, Rooney had to 
    show that her offer to settle, including its provision for costs, was as favourable 
    as or more favourable than the judgment she obtained against Hnatiuk. For 
    the purpose of that comparison, apart from rule 49, the judgment must be assumed 
    to provide only for party-and-party costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Unfortunately, Rooney led no evidence of her solicitor-and-client costs 
    from the date of the offer, and the trial judge did not analyze Rooneys offer 
    in the way that I have suggested. Still, apart from costs, Rooneys judgment 
    against Hnatiuk exceeded her offer by nearly $200,000. Rooney made her offer 
    in October 1996 and the jury rendered its verdict in December 1997. I find 
    it inconceivable that the difference between solicitor&#8209;and-client and 
    party-and-party costs for that fourteen-month period would come close to, 
    let alone exceed, $200,000. The judgment was therefore more favourable than 
    the offer to settle. Accordingly, I would uphold the trial judges award of 
    costs to Rooney by applying rule 49.10.</p>
