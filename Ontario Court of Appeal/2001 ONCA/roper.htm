<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of a sexual assault which occurred on September 
  21, 1989. The issue at trial was identification. The trial judge&#146;s acceptance 
  of the complainant&#146;s identification evidence was based in part on her testimony 
  that she had had several encounters with the appellant on different occasions 
  prior to the date of the offence, including one on September 15, 1989. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant appeals his conviction on the basis of proposed fresh evidence 
  showing that he was in custody from September 14 to September 20, 1989 and hence 
  that he could not have been seen by the complainant on September 15 as she alleged. 
  The appellant contends that because the complainant was certain about this date 
  at trial, this evidence bears upon a potentially decisive issue in the trial 
  and that, if believed, it could reasonably be expected to have affected the 
  result. [3] We do not agree. While the complainant expressed no uncertainty 
  about the September 15 date at trial, it is clear in the context of the whole 
  trial that this date was of Page: 2 no particular significance and hence the 
  issue whether the reference to this date was correct or not was never canvassed. 
</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge carefully reviewed all of the evidence relevant to identification. 
  He
  was alive to all the difficulties in the evidence and he properly instructed 
  himself on the
  applicable principles of law. We are not satisfied that the proposed fresh evidence, 
  when
  taken with the other evidence at trial, could reasonably be expected to have 
  affected the
  result.
</p>
<p>[5] The motion to introduce fresh evidence is dismissed and the appeal is dismissed.
