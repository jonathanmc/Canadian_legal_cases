        </span> The appellant was charged with a number of property offences and 
        possession of an imitation weapon.  The facts surrounding the charges 
        were somewhat bizarre.  The appellant was tried on those offences in November 
        2000.  He contended that while he had committed the acts, he suffered 
        from a mental disorder and was not criminally responsible for his acts.  
        A psychiatrist who had assessed the appellant opined that he suffered 
        from a mental disorder and was not criminally responsible on account of 
        that mental disorder.  Quite understandably, the trial judge made a finding 
        that the appellant was not criminally responsible and directed that he 
        be transferred to a hospital pending a disposition hearing before the 
        Review Board.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The Review Board held that hearing in February 2001.  At the hearing, 
        it was common ground that the appellant had feigned his mental disorder 
        at trial and in fact did not suffer from any mental disorder.  The doctor 
        who had assessed the appellant at the hospital testified that he was virtually 
        100 per cent certain that he did not suffer from any mental disorder that 
        would render him not criminally responsible for his acts.  Counsel for 
        the appellant at the Review Board did not challenge this evidence.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The proceedings before the Review Board have been filed on consent 
        as fresh evidence on this appeal.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> We agree with the joint position taken by counsel for the appellant 
        and Crown.  The fresh evidence necessitates the quashing of the finding 
        of not criminally responsible and the ordering of a new trial.  This order 
        applies to all counts in all informations for which a finding of not criminally 
        responsible was made.</p>
