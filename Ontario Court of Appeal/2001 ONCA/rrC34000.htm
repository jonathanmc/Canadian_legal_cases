<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice Robert M. Thompson dated December 9, 1999

  </span> In the early evening of August 23, 1997, the appellant went to the neighbouring 
  house of the complainant, a young developmentally disabled woman, and asked 
  her if she wanted to pick vegetables from his garden with him. This was the 
  origin of events that led to the appellant engaging in sexual activity with 
  the complainant that evening. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defence argued that the complainant was capable of consent, did 
  in fact consent, and if she did not consent, that the appellant had an honest 
  but mistaken belief in her consent and capacity to consent.  The Crown argued 
  that the complainant was incapable of consenting to the sexual activity, but 
  that even if she could, she did not consent in these circumstances.</p>

  </span> After a six day trial, the appellant was convicted of sexual assault 
  and was sentenced to an eight month period of incarceration.  This appeal is 
  grounded on the following alleged errors by the trial judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1. He erred in permitting the testimony of the complainant to be admitted 
      into evidence by videotape; </p>
    <p> 2. He erred in rejecting the appellant’s defence of honest but mistaken 
      belief in consent; </p>
    <p> 3.         He erred in dismissing the appellant’s motion pursuant to s. 
      11(b) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> for unreasonable delay; 
      and</p>
    <p> 4. The sentence of eight months’ incarceration was excessive.</p>

<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, Robert R., was 57 years old at the time of the incident, 
  a part-time Presbyterian minister who had been a full-time minister for 23 years, 
  and a neighbour of the 21-year-old complainant and her family for over 10 years. 
  He knew that despite her chronological age and physical maturity, she was developmentally 
  disabled.  He believed her to have the mental capabilities of an 8&#8209;10 
  year old child for most purposes, but thought she was far more mature in sexual 
  matters because of her demonstrably inappropriate sexual behaviour with young 
  men, including his two sons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On August 23, 1997, the appellant came to the complainant’s house where 
  she was having dinner with her mother, and invited her to pick vegetables in 
  his garden.  She accepted the invitation.  After they picked vegetables, the 
  appellant and the complainant went into the appellant’s home to wrap them.  
  In the front hall of his home, the complainant told him he was not wearing any 
  underwear under his jogging pants.  The appellant responded that he was, but 
  said &quot;if  you don’t believe me, check it out.&quot;  The complainant put 
  her hand inside his pants and touched his penis.  The appellant testified that 
  he then put his hand inside the complainant’s pants, fondling and digitally 
  penetrating her.  The complainant’s pants and underwear were down at her feet 
  and the appellant’s pants were lowered to expose his genitals.  He kissed the 
  complainant’s vaginal area and the complainant had oral contact with his penis.

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A few days after the incident, the complainant told her mother about 
  the incident.  The appellant was questioned by the police and arrested shortly 
  thereafter.  Two weeks after the incident, the appellant provided a voluntary 
  statement to the police.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because of her severe emotional distress and consequent institutionalization, 
  the complainant did not attend at the trial, even though she was under subpoena.  
  She had not been required to testify previously since the accused had waived 
  his right to a preliminary hearing.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Two <i>voir dires</i> were conducted at trial. One resulted from a defence 
  application pursuant to s. 276 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> seeking to admit 
  four affidavits as evidence of prior sexual activity and sexually inappropriate 
  behaviour on the part of the complainant.  All four affidavits, including two 
  from the appellant’s sons, referred to incidents where the complainant is said 
  to have &quot;come on&quot; to various individuals, including the appellant’s 
  sons, who both rejected her &quot;advances.&quot;  The appellant knew of these 
  incidents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Angus McDonald, a staff psychiatrist with the Metropolitan Toronto 
  Forensic Service, testified for the defence at this <i>voir dire</i>.  He did 
  not interview the complainant, but stated that based on the facts set out in 
  the affidavit material, he was able to form an opinion as to the complainant’s 
  capacity to consent to the sexual activity with the appellant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge ruled the affidavit evidence to be admissible, not for 
  the purpose of showing that the complainant was more likely to have consented 
  to the sexual activity or to attack her credibility, but for the purpose of 
  making available to Dr. McDonald the evidentiary foundation for his opinion 
  about the complainant’s capacity and consent, thereby permitting the defence 
  to make full answer and defence to the charges.  No issue is taken with this 
  ruling.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A second <i>voir dire</i> was held to determine whether the complainant’s 
  statements to the police and to her mother were admissible because of the complainant’s 
  inability to attend court.  The trial judge’s ruling that these out-of-court 
  statements met the requirements of necessity and reliability is at the heart 
  of this appeal.</p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ANALYSIS</span></h1>
<h4><b>(i)            The &quot;Khan&quot; Voir Dire</b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A <i>voir dire</i> was held to determine the admissibility of the complainant’s 
  videotaped statements made to the police on August 30, 1997, as well as two 
  statements made to her mother, one on August 29 and one on August 30, 1997.  
  The Crown sought to introduce these statements as evidence going to the truth 
  of the contents without calling the complainant. This court has had the benefit 
  of watching the videotaped statement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The basis of the application by the Crown was that the complainant had 
  been subpoenaed, was unavailable to testify, and that her statements were sufficiently 
  necessary and reliable to meet the admissibility requirements in <i>R. v. Khan</i>, 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531.  The trial judge, ruling that both the necessity and reliability 
  tests had been met, admitted the statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown had notified defence counsel the previous Friday, when he 
  received the information, that the complainant would not be available to testify 
  at trial.  Based on the evidence the Crown had that it was unclear when or whether 
  she could ever testify, he informed the court that he was prepared to proceed 
  that day with the <i>voir dire</i>.  No resulting request for an adjournment 
  was made at any time before or during the trial by the defence.  Nor did defence 
  counsel on the appeal argue that the trial judge erred in not granting an adjournment 
  on his own motion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown called three witnesses on the <i>voir dire</i>:  the complainant’s 
  mother, a police officer, and a psychologist.  The defence called no evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The police officer, Detective Constable Woods, gave evidence of the 
  circumstances surrounding the taking of the videotaped statement from the complainant 
  on August 30, 1997.  The videotaped interview lasted around 20 minutes.  The 
  taking of the statement was his responsibility jointly with Detective Constable 
  Arden Farrow, but it was Farrow, a female officer, who was present at and conducted 
  the actual interview.  Defence counsel waived Farrow’s evidence.</p>

  </span> Detective Constable Woods also read in the following September 12, 1997 
  statement, conceded by the defence to have been voluntary:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I have considered [the complainant’s] family neighbours and friends since 
      approximately 1986.  Our boys have been and continue to be friends.  We 
      did not socialize with them a whole lot.  Each year, as the garden would 
      begin to produce, I would sometimes deliver bags or baskets of produce to 
      them, sometimes dropping them off at their door, sometimes calling and asking 
      if they wanted some, sometimes asking if they wanted to drop by and pick 
      some up.  On the date in question, I was out walking, and on my return I 
      stopped at the [complainant’s] home.  [The complainant] and her mother were 
      present having supper.  I asked if they wanted some beans, [the complainant’s 
      mother] said yes.  I asked if [the  complainant] wanted to come up and help 
      pick the beans after she was done her supper.  With that, I went home, began 
      doing some dishes.  My wife was gone to town to do some shopping.  While 
      doing the dishes, [the complainant] and my son … came in the door at the 
      same time.  My son had forgotten something and had just dropped back to 
      pick it up.  The three of us went out the door at the same time, [complainant] 
      and I heading for the garden and my son to wherever he was going.  He left.  
      [The complainant] and I picked the beans and some flowers for her mother.  
      We returned up to the house and I told her to wait outside while I put a 
      wet towel around the base of the flowers, after which I came out and sent 
      her on her way.  Then I asked the question; did you touch [the complainant] 
      in a sexual manner, and the answer was; yes I did.  <i>She came close and 
      she said, you don’t have any underwear underneath your jogging suit.  I 
      responded, yes I do, but if you don’t believe me, take a look.  Naturally 
      she wouldn’t see, so I invited her</i> ...</p>
    <p>[Crown]   Sorry, is that wouldn’t or couldn’t?</p>
    <p>[APPELLANT’S STATEMENT]  <i>Naturally she couldn’t see, sorry so I invited 
      her to physically check it out.  That happened.</i>  With my hand, I checked 
      her crotch.  After a few minutes, I started to feel quite worried and tremendous 
      pain so I told her to do her pants up and go home.  I asked her the question, 
      did you have sexual intercourse with her, and his answer was; no, I did 
      not.  I asked the question; did she say anything when you and her were touching 
      in a sexual manner?  His answer was; the only thing I recall saying was 
      &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want a baby, I want a baby.  I have heard her say 
      that a hundred times if I’ve heard her say it once.  I asked the question; 
      did you say anything to her at this time?  He answered; sure, I asked her 
      if she enjoyed it and she said yes.  I asked the question; did you have 
      your penis in her mouth?  And his reply was; just as we finished, she kissed 
      me on the penis, and I kissed her on the vagina.  I asked the question; 
      was anyone around?  His reply; no.  I asked; how long did the sexual act 
      last?  His answer; I would say no more than three or four minutes.  I asked; 
      has anything like this happened before, and his reply; no.  I asked; how 
      would you describe [the complainant]?  His answer was; moody, she’s always 
      the same, she has always in some way displayed a desire to have sexual relations 
      with men from the time she was 12 years of age, since we first moved there.  
      She was always much bigger than her age.  She was like a 16 year old.  I 
      can still hear her on the lake yelling, [his son’s name] I love you, …</p>
    <p> . . . [My son] was 13 or 14 at the time.  He is almost two years older 
      than her.  She has been attracted to every male that comes around.  She 
      has come on to [another young male].</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>He was sitting on the trailer in front of our house with some person.  
      [The complainant] was there with her brother …  [He] had to keep telling 
      her to keep her hands off of her bra.  Also, last spring my son … had a 
      broken ankle.  On at least two occasions [the complainant] came up and was 
      trying to come on to him, with which he phoned her parents on at least one 
      occasion.  I asked the question; how would you describe [the complainant’s] 
      mental capacity?  His reply was, I think she knows the difference between 
      right and wrong.  … <i>she appears mentally to be about an eight or a ten 
      year old.</i>  There is so many incidents where we had to send her home, 
      less since she hasn’t been going to school.  On another occasion my son 
      … and I were in the front of the house.  His friends took off in their car, 
      [the complainant] was with [my son] and I tried to get her to stay with 
      us.  She took off walking south from our house.  I had no idea where she 
      was going.  I tried to call her but she wouldn’t listen.  A few minutes 
      later . . . her brother, came back.  We told him what she had done and he 
      said, I know exactly where she’s gone, she has gone to [another young male’s].  
      With that, [her brother] took off to get her.  [The male friend] was a young 
      fellow that rode the school bus and she had the hots for him, another one.  
      I asked the question; did [the complainant] ever say no to this sexual incident?  
      And his reply was; no, never.  I am in tremendous pain since this has taken 
      place.  I do want to get help for this.  It won’t happen again.  And then 
      he signed it, and Constable Darmon and myself signed it. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> The complainant’s mother testified that on August 29, 1997, six days 
  after the incident, she had a conversation with her daughter about what had 
  happened with the appellant.  Her recollection was assisted by notes she made 
  that night and on the next day at the suggestion of the police.  Her evidence 
  was, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>A.  Okay.  I don’t know if I can do this.  [The complainant] said that 
      [the appellant] asked her to touch his private spot and put it . . . into 
      her mouth.</p>
    <p>. . . .</p>
    <p>A.  She said that he kissed her using his tongue.  She said that, that 
      he asked her to touch his private spot and he did the same to her, or he 
      did, no, he touched his, her private spot and he did the same to her.  And 
      he, he put his penis into her vagina and he told her that he liked her.  
      And he told her not to tell anything.  And, when I asked her why she didn’t 
      say anything sooner, she, she said that it’s because he told me not to tell.  
      And he, I had asked her then where, where it happened, if it happened in 
      the garden, and she said no, he took me to the house, it happened in the 
      house.  And I said well where was Mrs. R., and she says she was not at home.</p>
    <p>. . . .</p>
    <p>Q.  And did [the complainant] tell you what she said to Mr.&nbsp;R.?</p>
    <p>. . . .</p>
    <p>A.  Okay, . . . I said what did you say.  She said well I, I said no and 
      I’m not married yet. . . .</p>
    <p>Q.  This is what [the complainant] told you?</p>
    <p>A.  Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.  How did she appear to you when she’s telling you this?</p>
    <p>A.  Well, she was not just, just saying something.  It must have probably 
      bothered her, I don’t know, and she just said all these . . . things.  But 
      I don’t really know, I don’t know how . . . to describe it.  She, she just 
      seemed upset that, that something must have happened to her.</p>
    <p>Q.  And that’s how she appeared to you?</p>
    <p>A.  Yes, yes.</p>
    <p>Q.  And was there any more discussion between the two of you about what 
      happened then between [the appellant] and [the complainant]?</p>
    <p>A.  No, we left it at that.  I didn’t want to pry, I didn’t want to put 
      ideas into her head of any sort, so I didn’t say much.  All I said okay, 
      you – and like when we came home . . . we discussed it at home just like 
      that and, and [my son] and I, and then because [the complainant] had then 
      gone upstairs to, to her room, . . . we decided that we were going to go 
      to the police because this, this is something that is, is just not acceptable.  
      And from there like we were sent over to the O.P.P.</p>
    <p>And . . . we didn’t much talk about any of this after again, just like 
      little things [the complainant] . . . came out with like that Saturday night, 
      like this is after we’ve been to the O.P.P., … [the complainant] and I were 
      playing cards, and then she said this, just without any other conversation 
      of any sort, . . . and .<span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span> she says [the appellant’s son’s] dad had no hair on his 
      penis and it’s big.  And I just looked at her, I just didn’t know what to 
      say.  Then on the Sunday following, she didn’t get up at all, she didn’t 
      eat.</p>
    <p>Then on Monday – so like there was not much talk or not much conversation 
      on the Sunday.  And on the Monday when we went out we took our lunch, it 
      was the holiday Monday, I think, we had our lunch out on our boat, and then 
      she just says oh mom, it still hurts. And I just didn’t really know what 
      she really meant because I thought maybe it was her ankle cause she had 
      her ankle, she had twisted her ankle or hurt her ankle in . . . some way 
      and I thought she meant her ankle.  And I said wow, what is wrong, is your 
      ankle still hurting, and she said no, it’s the neighbour, from the neighbour, 
      she said, from the neighbour.</p>
    <p>And then after, after that there was really never a lot of talk about it.  
      If I wanted to say something and do, she just wouldn’t, and it, from then 
      on she just got like more and more that she didn’t talk, didn’t want to 
      sleep long, didn’t want to do things, and that’s all I . . . .</p>

  </span> According to her mother, the complainant had started seeing a psychiatrist 
  within two months of the assault, as a result of which she took Prozac.  The 
  quantity of drugs increased through 1999, including sleeping pills.  Her mother 
  described her deteriorating behaviour as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . There were days where she just, wouldn’t get up, wouldn’t eat for 
      days, and finally it came up to that, you know, she had to go to Penetang

      coming, and then all of a sudden it would change again, no, I am not going 
      to be there.  She would hit, you know, start lashing out at me.  Always 
      she would break things.  It’s just been a nightmare the last two years.  
      And, so, it’s usual though, like breaking things, and hitting or kicking 
      and like, screaming, like, getting, you know, when she got upset, like,

  </span> The complainant’s mother also testified that in February 1998, when 
  the preliminary hearing was scheduled to be heard, her daughter would have been 
  available to come to court had her attendance been required.  At that time, 
  her emotional state, which had started to deteriorate shortly after the assault 
  took place, was not yet as severe as it increasingly became.  Throughout 1999, 
  the complainant’s condition had deteriorated so much that on September 3, she 
  was hospitalized.  The extent of the deterioration resulted in her being transferred 
  to Penetanguishene on September 9, where she still was when the trial started 
  on September 27, 1999. When she last saw her daughter at the end of the week 
  before the trial, she described her as being &quot;very very withdrawn&quot;, 
  &quot;very upset&quot;, &quot;crying very hard&quot; and &quot;just not herself&quot;.</p>

  </span> The third witness called by the Crown on the <i>voir dire</i> was Dr. 
  Mirek Richter, a registered psychologist who has worked at the Mental Health 
  Centre in Penetanguishene since 1985.  He is on staff in the dual diagnosis 
  programme, which specializes in individuals who suffer more than two major mental 
  disorders, one of them being &quot;mental retardation&quot;, as he called it. 
  Dr. Richter described 'mental retardation' as a medical term, the essence of 
  which is the onset, before the age of 18, of a &quot;significantly sub-average 
  level of intellectual functioning&quot; as well as a related reduced level of 
  &quot;adaptive behaviour&quot;, meaning the level on which the patient is able 
  to &quot;relate to life in general.&quot; Since she was dually diagnosed  as 
  having a combined mental disorder consisting of 'mental retardation' and attention 
  deficit hyperactivity disorder, the complainant was one of his patients.</p>

  </span> Dr. Richter was qualified as an expert to give an opinion about the 
  ability of the complainant to attend court from a psychological point of view.  
  He saw her four times since her admission, including the day she was admitted.  
  The last time he saw her was four days before the trial was scheduled to start.</p>

  </span> He described her condition when he saw her on September 10 as &quot;unstable.&quot;  
  In the three subsequent meetings, she was, Dr. Richter testified, &quot;teary&quot;, 
  &quot;distraught&quot;, &quot;emotionally unstable&quot; and &quot;basically 
  . . . resistant or unable&quot; to discuss the main reason he was meeting with 
  her, namely, her willingness or ability to appear in court.  He described her 
  reaction to the incident as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . [O]nce we would reach the topic, . . . she would get very emotional, 
      she would start crying, she would, she would keep crying for several minutes, 
      and then she would change the issue and seem to be unwilling, or reluctant 
      or unable to actually discuss that issue.</p>
    <p>And whenever . . . the court issue was introduced, she would simply start 
      crying.</p>

line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Richter concluded that because of her instability, she was &quot;currently 
  unable, rather than unwilling&quot; to relate to the issue or to appear in court.  
  If the change in her medication proved to be effective, she might be able to 
  appear &quot;at some point in the future&quot;, but there was, in his view, 
  no guarantee.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On cross-examination, Dr. Richter’s response to defence counsel’s question 
  about whether the complainant would be able to answer questions with respect 
  to the matters before the court sometime in the future was as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.  I think it is possible, but I don’t see a guarantee for it.  It – but 
      it probably is possible, yes.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, in response to several resulting questions about timing from 
  the trial judge, Dr. Richter concluded his evidence with the following opinion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If . . . Dexedrine on 15 milligrams . . . shows to some stabilization, 
      but more of it doesn’t, doesn’t do any better, if we discharge her from 
      the hospital and the different environment than, than the very structured 
      hospital environment triggers the, the same old behaviours again, then we 
      kind of go back to square one and we need to change, we need to try different 
      medication again.  And that has been the story of her life.</p>
    <p>So ideally yes, she could be able to appear at the court and to perform, 
      I mean, in a productive manner here in a number of weeks, but in reality 
      it, it would be difficult, it would be difficult for me to predict because 
      I don’t know when that could happen. Simply, it remains to be seen.  It’s 
      very frustrating.</p>

  </span> Based particularly on Dr. Richter's evidence of how traumatized the 
  complainant was by the topic of the sexual incident, and on his being &quot;unable 
  to advise the court when or even whether the complainant would be capable of 
  testifying&quot;, the trial judge concluded that the complainant was unable 
  to testify and that the necessity test had therefore been &quot;clearly&quot; 
  met:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>On a &quot;<i>Khan</i>&quot; type <i>voir dire</i>, the Crown must establish, 
      on a balance of probabilities, that the out-of-court statement is necessary 
      and that the statement is reliable.  On the issue of necessity, such necessity 
      can be found if the witness is physically unavailable, is not competent 
      to testify, if the experience of testifying would prove to cause undue emotional 
      harm to a witness, or is unable to give a coherent and comprehensive account 
      of the event in court…</p>
    <p>Dr. Richter testified that the complainant, upon admission to the facility, 
      was found to be distraught and emotionally unstable.  She was admitted to 
      change her medication and to observe the effect of that change.  The desire 
      was to stabilize her condition.  Dr. Richter testified that he was unable 
      to ascertain whether the complainant was unable or unwilling to attend Court.  
      Whenever the subject of court proceedings was broached, the complainant 
      burst into tears and was incapable of discussing the matter.  The doctor 
      was unable to advise the Court when or even whether the complainant would 
      be capable of testifying.</p>
    <p>The necessity test has clearly been met.  The complainant is not available 
      to testify.  At issue, therefore, is the reliability of the complainant’s 
      out-of-court statements.</p>

  </span> Although the trial judge made no specific finding of harm, a finding 
  which is not in any event a pre-condition for compliance with the necessity 
  test, he did take into account the deteriorating, traumatized condition of this 
  developmentally disabled complainant in accepting Dr. Richter's conclusion that 
  there was no way of knowing when - or whether - she could ever testify in court.</p>

  statement as the complainant was questioned about her ability to tell the difference 
  between the truth and a lie:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>A.  It is not on it.</p>

      she has done or said anything like this.  This is why, you know I, I know 
      this is what happened because [the complainant] has never ever up to that

  and <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, permits flexibility in the application 
  of rules governing the admissibility of hearsay evidence. This approach allows 
  the court to be more responsive to situations in which the evidence emanates

  resembles the facts in <i>R. v. Parrott</i> (2001), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) 
  such that the statements should not be admitted.  The fundamental difference 
  between this case and <i>Parrott</i> is that, in <i>Parrot</i>, the issue was 
  testimonial capacity, not the capacity to consent to sexual activity. Moreover, 
  as the court in <i>Parrott</i> noted, at p. 471, &quot;the complainant was available 
  to testify and there was no suggestion by anybody that she might be harmed thereby.&quot;

  </span> In <i>Rockey</i>, necessity was established without calling the hearsay 
  declarant, by evidence that testifying would have traumatized the young witness. 
  This supports the approach taken by the trial judge in this case that evidence 
  of the complainant’s indefinite unavailability to testify in person because 
  of her intensely traumatized condition precluded her from attending at trial 
  and rendered her out-of-court statements necessary.</p>

  </span> In my view, the principles concerning a child, as set out by McLachlin 
  J. in <i>Rockey</i> at p.&nbsp;840, can also apply to an adult who has severe 
  developmental disabilities:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> This Court ruled in <i>Khan</i> that a child’s out-of-court statements 
      about events at issue in a trial such as this may be received notwithstanding 
      that it is hearsay, provided that the reception of the statement is made 
      necessary by the unavailability of the child's direct evidence on the stand 
      and provided that the out-of-court statement is reasonably reliable . . 
      . Necessity, on the <i>Khan</i> test, may be established if the child is 
      incompetent to testify, unable to testify, unavailable to testify, or if 
      the trial judge is satisfied, &quot;based on psychological assessments that 
      testimony in court might be traumatic for the child or harm the child .

  </span> In <i>Khan</i>, at p. 105, McLachlin J. dealt with reliability as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> Many considerations such as timing, demeanour, the personality of the 
      child, the intelligence and understanding of the child, and the absence 
      of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement may be relevant on 
      the issue of reliability.  I would not wish to draw up a strict list of 
      considerations for reliability, nor to suggest that certain categories of 
      evidence (for example the evidence of young children on sexual encounters) 
      should be always regarded as reliable.</p>

  </span> In his review in <i>R. v. U. (F.J.)</i> of prior Supreme Court decisions 
  injecting increased flexibility in the approach to the hearsay rule, Lamer C.J. 
  emphasized that the ultimate reliability of the statement and the weight to 
  attach to it are to be determined by the trier of fact.  As he said in <i>R. 
  v. B.&nbsp;(K.G.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 291:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…I do not wish to create technical categorical requirements duplicating 
      those of the old approach to hearsay evidence.  It follows from <i>Smith</i> 
      that there may be situations in which the trial judge concludes that an 
      appropriate substitute for the oath is established and that notwithstanding 
      the absence of an oath the statement is reliable.  Other circumstances may 
      serve to impress upon the witness the importance of telling the truth, and 
      in so doing provide a high degree of reliability to the statement.  While 
      these occasions may not be frequent, I do not foreclose the possibility 
      that they might arise under the principled approach to hearsay evidence.</p>

  the videotaped statement was made shortly after the incident, and there was 
  an absence of evidence of any reason to expect fabrication from her.</p>

  </span> Defence counsel at trial took the position that there were essentially 
  two issues for determination:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1. Whether or not the complainant had the capacity to consent; and</p>
    <p> 2. Even if the complainant did not have this capacity, whether or not 
      the appellant had an honest but mistaken belief that she had the capacity 
      to consent and had in fact consented.</p>

  </span> The trial judge concluded that on the facts before him, the defence 
  of consent did not arise, and that there was virtually no evidence raising any 
  reasonable doubt on a defence of honest but mistaken belief, or as to whether 
  the appellant failed to appreciate the complainant’s incapacity. On the contrary, 
  the trial judge observed that the evidence indicated that the appellant was 
  &quot;fully aware&quot; of the complainant’s mental disability, but &quot;gave 
  no thought to her capability to consent or otherwise to sexual activity.&quot; 
  He found the appellant not to be a credible witness and rejected his evidence, 
  except for his doubt about whether intercourse had taken place, a doubt based 
  on the complainant’s sexual inexperience and developmental disabilities. I see 
  no basis for interfering with those conclusions.</p>

  </span> It is useful to set out some of his reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>On the facts before me there is no defence of consent.  Defence counsel 
      has submitted that [the appellant] had the mistaken but honest belief that 
      [the complainant] consented to the sexual activity with the belief that 
      she had the ability to give such consent.  I will refer to that later.</p>
    <p>Section 273.1 of the Criminal Code defines consent to mean the voluntary 
      agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.  
      That section goes on to state that no consent is obtained where the complainant 
      is incapable of consenting to the activity.</p>
    <p>The issue of whether a person did or did not consent to a particular action 
      or event is a question of fact to be determined in each individual case.  
      It is not sufficient to simply determine whether an individual said yes 
      when asked if they would submit to or engage in a particular activity.  
      It must be determined whether that individual made such a decision of their 
      own free will, fully aware of or apprised of the proposed activity and its 
      consequences.</p>
    <p>No one could argue that an unconscious individual is capable of giving 
      consent.  Quite simply such an individual has been deprived of the ability 
      to make an informed decision.  If this is the case, what then should be 
      the determination for those who may not, for other reasons, possess the 
      cognitive abilities to make such an informed decision?  Surely that decision 
      must be a question of fact to be determined by the trier of each case, having 
      regard to the circumstances.</p>
    <p>In this case, evidence has been called by the Crown to the effect that 
      [the complainant’s] mental disabilities are such that she was incapable 
      of giving consent.  The defence on the other hand has presented evidence 
      that [the complainant] was indeed capable of consenting to the sexual intercourse.</p>

  </span> The Crown led evidence that the complainant was incapable of consenting 
  to sexual activity with the appellant and that even if she were capable, she 
  did not consent to it.  The expert called by the Crown, Dr. Laurence Cousins, 
  was a psychologist who had been involved with the complainant for over 12 years.  
  By consent of both parties, he was qualified as an expert in developmental psychology 
  and &quot;mental retardation&quot; and in the area of the capacity of persons 
  with &quot;mental retardation&quot; to engage in certain behaviour.  Based on 
  a number of psychological and cognitive assessments undertaken between 1984 
  and 1996, Dr. Cousins concluded that the complainant was functioning cognitively 
  at a mental age of 5 years, 5 months.  His report showed the following:</p>

  </span> To Dr. Cousins’ knowledge, there is no specific test for determining 
  capacity to consent to sexual activity, but based on the interview he conducted 
  with the complainant and the tests he did administer to determine her abilities 
  and mental age, he formed the opinion that she lacked the capacity to consent 
  to the sexual activity with the appellant.  Her sexually inappropriate behaviour 
  was, in his opinion, &quot;hormonally driven&quot; rather than a reflection

  as to the complainant’s capacity both on the s. 276 <i>voir dire</i> and at 
  the trial itself, was of the view that the complainant was capable of consenting 
  to the sexual activity.  Although he never met her, he based his opinion on 
  the complainant’s videotaped statement, the four affidavits describing her sexually 
  inappropriate behaviour, and Dr. Cousins’ reports.  In his view, the purpose 
  of the complainant’s sexually inappropriate behaviour was to initiate sexual 
  relationships and she demonstrated a sufficient degree of knowledge and understanding

    <p>Well, I’m not suggesting that she would make as informed decision as a 
      person of average or above-average intellect, but it seems to me going rather 
      far to suggest that she can’t be capable of appreciating that she may have 
      sexual feelings which, after all, are pretty basic to human nature and that 
      simply by reason of not being too smart doesn’t mean that you don’t know 
      you have sexual feelings and you want to do something to satisfy those feelings; 
      therefore, you behave in a way that documentably she has toward males in 
      an attempt to achieve gratification … But does she understand that she has 
      sexual feelings and would like to do something about them in terms of gratification; 
      it seems pretty clear that she does … if the issue is is she capable of 
      understanding that she has these feelings and wants to act on them, and 
      that she’s capable of giving voluntary agreement to participate in them, 
      I don’t see any persuasive evidence that that’s not the case.</p>

  </span> The trial judge reviewed the expert evidence and concluded, as he was 
  entitled on the evidence to do, that he preferred the evidence of Dr. Cousins:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I accept the evidence of Dr. Cousins that [the complainant] did not have 
      the ability to consent to sexual activity.  Dr.&nbsp;Cousins testified that 
      &quot;consent . . . requires some knowledge of what the act will lead to, 
      both in the short and the long term and I don’t believe she has the cognitive 
      abilities to fully comprehend the consequences of the outcome of sexual 
      liaison.&quot;</p>
    <p>I reject the evidence of Dr. Angus McDonald, that [the complainant] did 
      possess ability to consent.  Dr. McDonald’s evidence did not raise a reasonable 
      doubt in my mind on this issue.  While Dr. Cousins focused on the cognitive 
      abilities of [the complainant] and considered them vis-à-vis &quot;informed&quot; 
      consent, Dr. McDonald focused more on the physical responses of [the complainant] 
      as opposed to her ability to give an informed consent.</p>
    <p>I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [the complainant] was incapable 
      of giving her consent to sexual activity between she and [the appellant].

  </span> The trial judge defined consent as &quot;the voluntary agreement to 
  participate in an act, having full appreciation and knowledge of the consequences.&quot;  
  Based on this definition of consent and on the evidence, the trial judge concluded 
  that the complainant’s cognitive limitations would &quot;most certainly … negate 
  the possibility that she had either the requisite knowledge or appreciation.&quot;  
  In his words:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [the complainant] was incapable 
      of giving her consent to sexual activity between she and Mr. R.  I am of 
      the view that consent means the voluntary agreement to participate in an 
      act having full appreciation and knowledge of the consequences.  Accepting 
      this as the meaning of consent, then most certainly [the complainant’s] 
      cognitive abilities will negate the possibility that she had either the 
      requisite knowledge or appreciation.</p>
    <p>The defence advanced the position that even if [the complainant] did not 
      have the capacity to consent to the sexual activity, the defence of honest 
      but mistaken belief is available to [the appellant].  It is their position 
      that if a reasonable doubt is raised that [the appellant] did not appreciate 
      that [the complainant] was incapable of consent and believed that she had 
      consented, there should be an acquittal.</p>

  </span> Capacity is integral to consent.  The extent of that capacity depends 
  on the circumstances of each case.  Section 273.1(2)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  states that no consent is obtained where the complainant is incapable of consenting 
  to the activity.  In this case, the trial judge had the benefit of extensive 
  expert evidence, and was entitled to accept Dr. Cousins’ evidence that the complainant 
  functioned cognitively at the level of a 4 to 6 year old and lacked the capacity 
  to consent to the sexual activity between herself and the appellant, particularly 
  given Dr. Cousins’ familiarity with the complainant’s development over a 12-year

  the sexual activity between herself and the appellant, the trial judge analyzed 
  whether there was any foundation for the defence of honest but mistaken belief. 
  He concluded that there was &quot;no foundation whatsoever in the evidence that 
  raises any reasonable doubt on a defence of honest but mistaken belief.&quot; 
  I agree that the evidence on this issue is clear and compelling.  The trial 
  judge’s reasons for rejecting this defence were, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the 
      accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms 
      the subject matter of the charge if:</p>
    <p>(a)(ii) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s recklessness or wilful 
      blindness; or,</p>
    <p>(b)  The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known 
      to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.</p>

      defence<b>:</b></p>
    <p> 1.<span

      complainant] was consenting to the sexual activity because she grabbed his 
      penis, because at no time did she say no or stop and because of his previous 
      knowledge of how she acted around males.  The latter two reasons advanced 
      by Mr. [R.] afford no foundation at all.  The first reason given must be 
      examined in the context of the events as they were unfolding.</p>

      retarded individual with a mental age of between 8 and 10 years.  He testified 
      he had known as much for 10 years prior to the incident.</p>

      until she touched his penis and that then in a moment of weakness touched 
      her sexually.</p>
    <p> 5.<span

      it while he was sexually touching her (to which she did not reply), because 
      he was trying to discover consent … continuing consent.&quot; </p>

      as to capacity or capability of [the complainant] to engage in sexual activity.</p>

    <p>I find that there is no foundation whatsoever in the evidence that raises 
      any reasonable doubt on a defence of honest but mistaken belief.  I have 
      no reasonable doubt as to whether [the appellant] failed to appreciate the 
      incapacity of [the complainant].  The evidence indicates that [the appellant]

  in-chief:</p>
<blockquote>

    <p>A.  … She said to – when we finished [picking vegetables] that she asked 
      if she could have some flowers for her mother, and I said by all means.  
      Picked the flowers, went up to the, to the house and wrapped them in a, 
      in a wet towel, which I did.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  And then I brought them over to her at the door.  She said to me, <i>she 
      said you don’t have any underwear under your jogging pants</i>. </p>
    <p>.…</p>
    <p>Q.  So who else was at the house?</p>
    <p>A.  No one else.</p>
    <p>Q.  All right.  So what happened then?</p>
    <p>A.  As I said, [the complainant] said to me at the door you don’t have 
      any underwear under those jogging pants, and I said yes I do, if you don’t 
      believe me check it out.</p>
    <p>Q.  Okay.  What happened then?</p>
    <p>A.  <i>She put her hand inside my pants.  She began to fondle my penis.</i></p>
    <p>Q.  <i>And what did you take that to mean</i>?</p>
    <p>A.  <i>I believed that she was consenting to, to going further</i>.</p>

    <p>A.  I put my hand inside her pants.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  I began to fondle her.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  I asked her if she was enjoying it.  I don’t remember whether she responded 
      verbally but certainly physically she did.</p>
    <p>Q.  When you say &quot;physically she did&quot;, what do you mean?</p>
    <p>A.  Kissing very passionately.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.  Then what happened?</p>
    <p>A.  Her pants …</p>

    <p>A.  Her pants came down.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  And I …</p>
    <p>Q.  When you say &quot;her pants came down&quot;, how did her pants come 
      down?</p>
    <p>A.  Well, when I put my hand inside hers, the button came open at the top, 
      zipper down …</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A. … and I asked her if she’d take her pants down, and she did.  Her underwear, 
      that is.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  I continued to fondle her with my hand and just basically rub up against 
      her.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  At this point I was getting very, very nervous.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.  Why?</p>
    <p>A.  Because I wasn’t happy with what I was doing and I was concerned about 
      my wife.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.  Then what happened?</p>
    <p>A.  I bent down to help get her pants up.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  And I kissed her on the pubic hair.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  I stood up.  I asked her if she wanted to kiss my penis.</p>
    <p>Q.  Yes.</p>
    <p>A.  And I told her that was it, we were going – she was going home.</p>
    <p>Q.  Did she kiss your penis?</p>
    <p>A.  I presume so.</p>
    <p>Q.  But you don’t know?</p>
    <p>A.  I really don’t know for sure.  It was not – she was not down very long, 
      a second or two seconds.</p>
    <p>.…</p>
    <p>Q.  All right.  Mr. R., tell me, tell me what was said by [the complainant] 
      at any time during this encounter?</p>
    <p>A.  She was constantly saying I want a baby, I want a baby, particularly 
      when pants came down.</p>

    <p>A.  Not that I can recall.</p>
    <p>Q.  What happened then?</p>
    <p>A.  She went home.</p>
    <p>.…</p>
    <p>Q.  Now, you – could you tell us why you came to the belief that you testified 
      earlier that she was consenting to this sexual encounter?</p>
    <p>A.  What makes me believe …</p>
    <p>Q.  What made you believe that she was consenting?</p>
    <p>A.  She grabbed my penis.</p>

    <p>A.  That at no time did she ever say no or stop.</p>

    <p>A.  My previous knowledge, I guess, of how she acted around other males.</p>
    <p>Q.  How did you come by that knowledge?</p>
    <p>A.  Well, I have two sons who have been good friends with [the complainant’s 
      family] almost as long as we have been there, and they, on several occasions, 
      told me and my wife about things that had happened sexually, or should I 
      say [the complainant’s] overt sexual behaviour towards them.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Q.  How long did this encounter encompass?</p>
    <p>A.  Three or four minutes maybe. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> In chief, the appellant explained that the bases for his belief that 
  the complainant was consenting to the sexual activity were that she grabbed 
  his penis, that at no time did she say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;, and 
  that he knew how she acted around males. Yet in cross-examination, he acknowledged 
  that mentally challenged individuals function at different cognitive levels 
  from those who are not so challenged.  He also acknowledged that for 10 years 
  he not only knew that the complainant was mentally challenged, but thought she 
  had a mental age of between 8 to 10 years.  It is instructive to relate his 
  evidence on cross-examination about his knowledge of her intellectual limitations 
  and prior behaviour, as well as his evidence about consent.</p>

    <p>A.  Yes, I knew that.</p>

  </span> As this exchange shows, the appellant acknowledged that he gave no thought 
  to whether the complainant had the capacity to engage in sexual activity. His 
  effort at determining whether she was consenting consisted of asking her &quot;if 
  she was enjoying it&quot; while he was engaged in the sexual activity.</p>

  </span> The appellant argued that before guilt is found based on an incapacity 
  to consent, there should be some evidence to show with certainty that a person 
  who is severely or moderately mentally disabled does not understand the sex 
  act.  This distorts how the issue of consent is to be approached.  Under any 
  circumstances, there is a responsibility, prior to engaging in sexual activity, 
  to take reasonable steps to ascertain consent: <i>Criminal Code</i> s. 273.2(b).  
  But in circumstances such as these, where one of the participants has demonstrable 
  mental limitations, the threshold of responsibility escalates exponentially.  
  This is not to suggest that persons who are developmentally disabled cannot 
  consent;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a> rather, it requires that prior caution be exercised 
  to avoid the exploitation of an exceptionally vulnerable individual. The issue 
  in any event was not the capacity of persons with developmental disabilities 
  to consent to sexual activity; rather, the issue was the capacity of this particular 
  complainant to consent to sexual activity with the appellant and whether he 
  had an honest but mistaken belief in that capacity.</p>

line-height:normal'> [58]<span

  </span> The appellant had known the complainant for 10 years.  He was her neighbour, 
  was fully aware that she had cognitive disabilities, acknowledged that she functioned 
  at the same mental level as an 8 to 10 year old, and admitted that he gave no 
  thought to her capacity to engage in sexual activity.  Notwithstanding his unfettered 
  knowledge of her disabilities, he based his assumption about the complainant’s 
  consent on a palpably inappropriate question about whether he was wearing underwear, 
  and reinforced it by her touching his penis when he invited her to &quot;check 
  it out&quot; and then by her silence. It is difficult to see how these facts, 
  in the context of what the appellant knew about the complainant, could create 
  an entitlement on his part to ignore his responsibility to consider her capacity.

  </span> It is utterly unrealistic for the appellant to argue that he had an 
  honest but mistaken belief in the complainant’s consent, when he acknowledged 
  that he gave no thought whatever to her <i>capacity</i> to consent. The appellant's 
  willingness to suspend all knowledge of her profoundly reduced mental abilities 
  and assume her capacity to consent in these circumstances, defies reality. (see 
  <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330; <i>R. v. Davis</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R.

  </span> The following words of then Justice McLachin in <i>Esau</i> at p. 808 
  are, it seems to me, directly applicable to the facts in this case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The term wilful blindness connotes a deliberate avoidance of the facts 
      and circumstances.  It is the legal equivalent of turning a blind eye, of 
      not seeing or hearing what is there to hear or see.  It is the making of 
      an <i>assumption</i> that the complainant consents without determining whether, 
      <i>as a matter of fact</i>, the complainant consents.  Blindness as to the 
      need to obtain consent can never be raised by an accused as a defence …

line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the trial judge that the appellant’s defence of honest 
  but mistaken belief had no air of reality, given the appellant’s knowledge of 
  the complainant’s disabilities and his failure to take reasonable steps to ascertain 
  her capacity.</p>
<h4><b>(iii)  Remaining Grounds of Appeal</b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The two remaining grounds of appeal can be dealt with briefly.  The 
  first is the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred in dismissing 
  his motion under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  I can 
  see no such error.  The trial judge, in concluding that the delay was not unreasonable 
  in the circumstances, properly took into account all the relevant factors, including 
  the number of consent adjournments, the exigencies of the case, the institutional 
  realities of the region in which the trial was scheduled, and the absence of 
  undue prejudice to the appellant, who had been released on a recognizance after 
  his arrest.  There is no basis for interfering with his conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also delivered careful reasons for sentence.  Although 
  the appellant had no criminal record, the trial judge deemed a conditional sentence 
  to be inappropriate in the circumstances.  The offence was a serious one and, 
  as the trial judge noted, involved the sexual exploitation of a young woman 
  he knew had profound mental limitations.  The eight month period of incarceration 
  in these exploitative circumstances, far from representing an error in principle, 
  represents a generous acknowledgment of the appellant’s personal circumstances 
  and background.</p>

  </span> I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons for judgment of 
  my colleague. I am unable to concur in upholding the conviction. In my view, 
  the trial judge erred in law on the issue of necessity in his decision following 
  the <i>Khan</i> <i>voir dire </i>to allow into evidence the videotaped statement 
  of the complainant to the police and the statements she made to her mother. 
  Although the complainant was unavailable to attend on the trial date, the evidence 
  was that she may have been able to attend within a few weeks. In finding necessity 
  in those circumstances, the trial judge failed to have regard to the need to 
  safeguard the interests of the accused. The effect of the error was to allow 
  the trial to proceed without the complainant. Because the main defence in this 
  case was consent on the basis that the complainant had the capacity to consent, 
  that error compromised the appellant's ability to make full answer and defence 
  in respect of the defence of consent, the complainant's capacity to consent, 
  and his alternative defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.</p>

  </span> The trial of this matter commenced on a Monday. On the Friday before,

  </span> The first procedural issue for the defence was the motion to have the 
  charges stayed because of unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the <i>Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. There was a nineteen and one half month 
  delay from the date of committal for trial until the trial commenced in the 
  Superior Court. The appellant argued that eleven and one half months of the 
  delay was attributable to the Crown. The trial judge held that the overall lapse

  </span> The Crown then brought the <i>Khan</i> motion for the admission of the 
  complainant's videotaped statement given to the police and of the statements 
  she made to her mother after the event. On the Friday before the trial was to 
  begin,   Crown counsel had advised defence counsel that the complainant was 
  hospitalized in a mental institution and was not available to attend the trial 
  and testify. At the trial, Crown counsel therefore took the position that he 
  needed the previous statements in substitution for the evidence of the complainant; 
  otherwise the trial would not proceed at all. Crown counsel stated to the court:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Let me just say this: I have no complainant. The complainant is not available 
      to me. So that in order to put this allegation before the court, I am left 
      only with a <i>Khan</i> or <i>K.G.B.</i>-style <i>voir dire</i>, I mean 
      to come right to the point. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And in his submissions on the <i>voir dire</i> he told the court:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This is not a case, Your Honour, in spite of the evidence of the psychologist 
      to the effect that at some point in time this young lady will be able to 
      testify, where I am seeking that the case be adjourned to permit her to 
      get well. That, that is not the position I'm taking. This case will either 
      succeed because I am able to persuade you that the various statements that 
      are the subject of this <i>voir dire</i> are admitted or it will not. I 
      think for a number of reasons, even on the prosecution side, let alone the 
      trial within reasonable time considerations, that this matter should not 
      be adjourned beyond, beyond where we now are. So I am not, in spite of what 
      the psychologist says, asking you to defer the decision about whether this 
      young lady could ever be available. I'm taking the position that she will 
      not [be] available for purposes of this trial, and as I said to you, I'll 
      either succeed in this case because, or the prosecution will have a <i>prima 
      facie</i> case because you permit me to admit the evidence of the various 
      statements or not. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>In other words, Crown counsel recognized that because of the lapse of time before 
  the case reached trial, he could not reasonably ask for an adjournment even 
  though the evidence he presented only showed that the complainant was not able 
  to attend the trial at that time, but not that she would be unable to attend 
  in the future. My colleague refers to the fact that the appellant failed to 
  ask for an adjournment. However, in the circumstances, it was not for the defence 
  to seek an adjournment. The defence had already taken the position that the 
  delay to that point, September 27, 1999, was unreasonable. The Crown in effect 
  conceded that any further delay could well be considered unreasonable and therefore 
  presented the issue on a &quot;now or never&quot; basis to the court.</p>

  Centre on September 10, 1999. She was unstable at the time and was admitted 
  so that her condition could be evaluated and her medication reviewed. The Crown's 
  psychologist, Dr. Richter, was asked in cross-examination whether it was possible

    <p>THE COURT: But right now all you've got is a young lady who becomes distraught 
      as soon as the idea of court comes up?</p>
    <p>DR. RICHTER: Yeah. But she's generally distraught, she's generally unstable, 
      quite emotional right now. It's not just about this issue.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
    <p>DR. RICHTER: But this issue seems to push her over the edge. So the way 
      I read her behaviour right now is that there, her thresholds are generally 
      very low right now due to several, several factors; one being changing the 
      medication; one being changing environment; another, another being environmental 
      factors immediately preceding the admission, meaning her previous admission 
      to Owen Sound, which was quite stressful too; the, the events which took 
      place in family during the summer. My understanding is the combination of 
      all, all of these things, with the medical illness being supple mentally 
      [sic] treated, being the hallmark of it, but the combination of these causes 
      her to be extremely unstable right now.</p>
    <p>            And while she can discuss certain issues, there are many issues 
      given -- I mean if I catch her on, on her good day, or a good time, or if 
      she's being questioned by a right person, this particular issue seems to 
      be out of her capacity right now, and that's, that's, that's all I can see, 
      all I can say based on those three sessions with her and the information 
      I got from Dr. Fleming. We got this response, consistently response. She's 
      very emotional, unable to discuss that issue, and that is probably because 
      that is way over beyond and above her, her current stress management capacity, 
      I guess.</p>
    <p>            So once again if I, if I were pressed to decide between unwillingness 
      and lack of ability, I would tend to, to, I would tend to name lack of ability 
      because it seems to be truly out of her, out of the scope of her stress 
      management, stress management capacity right now. We've seen her four times. 
      I've seen her four times; Dr. Fleming saw her two.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Is there any way of telling what amount of time is required 
      to allow her to stabilize her position?</p>
    <p>DR. RICHTER: Usually, the rule of thumb is that people usually need at 
      least several weeks, let's say around four weeks, to respond to a change 
      of medication and to allow, to allow us to evaluate whether or not it's 
      working. And when it is working, then she, she could be better following 
      that time.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: But we don't know?</p>
    <p>DR. RICHTER: But we don't know. That, that still remains to be seen. I 
      mean I could have talked about this in a, in a similar way a year ago, but 
      the, the real circumstances of her life have not really allowed us to pursue 
      the medication treatment the way we planned. It's, it's often time that 
      case.</p>
    <p>            So once again under ideal conditions, when we have the environment 
      which allows us to explore different medications, when we have valued reliable 
      feedback about the behavioural changes, when we have patient who is sufficiently 
      compliant, and so on and so on, in that case you usually need several weeks 
      to explore the medication or to conclude whether this is right medication.</p>
    <p>            Then you need a few weeks to explore the optimal dose, all 
      right, because if one, if the medication works on helping me and doesn't 
      do anything bad to me, it makes sense to explore it more of it wouldn't 
      be even better. So usually need a number of weeks for each of those steps.</p>
    <p>            If, if Dexedrine on 15 milligrams show, I mean show to some 
      stabilization, but more of it doesn't, doesn't do any better, if we discharge 
      her from the hospital and the different environment than, than the very 
      structured hospital environment triggers the, the same old behaviours again, 
      then we kind of go back to square one and we need to change, we need to 
      try different medication again. And that has been story of her life.</p>
    <p>            So ideally yes, she could be able to appear at the court and 
      to perform, I mean, in a productive manner here in a number of weeks, but 
      in reality it, it would be difficult, it would be difficult for me to predict 
      because I don't know when that could happen. Simply, it remains to be seen. 
      It's very frustrating.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his ruling, the trial judge dealt with the issue of necessity in 
  the following way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>            On a &quot;Khan&quot; type <i>voir dire</i>, the Crown must 
      establish, on a balance of probability, that the out-of-court statement 
      is necessary and that the statement is reliable. On the issue of necessity, 
      such necessity can be found if the witness is physically unavailable, is 
      not competent to testify, if the experience of testifying would prove to 
      cause undue emotional harm to the witness, or is unable to give a coherent 
      and comprehensive account of the event in court. Concerning the issue of 
      reliability, the Court must determine whether the out-of-court statement 
      exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability to afford the Court a satisfactory 
      basis for evaluating the truth of the statement. It is to be noted that 
      this latter requirement of reliability is not a final resolution of the 
      issue but rather a determination as to whether the threshold has been achieved.</p>
    <p>            At the time of the incident giving rise to the charge before 
      the Court, the complainant was 21 years of age. She is now 23 years of age. 
      She is under subpoena to testify at this trial. She was not required to 
      testify at the preliminary hearing as the accused waived his right to a 
      preliminary hearing.</p>
    <p>            Dr. Mirek Richter, a psychologist, testified that the complainant 
      was admitted as an inpatient in a mental health care facility on September 
      10, 1999. She continues to be a patient at this time. Dr. Richter testified 
      that the complainant is a dually diagnosed individual. In other words, she 
      is medically mentally retarded (medical terminology) and suffers from another 
      form of mental illness (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder).</p>
    <p>            Dr. Richter testified that the complainant, upon admission 
      to the facility, was found to be distraught and emotionally unstable. She 
      was admitted to change her medication and to observe the effect of that 
      change. The desire was to stabilize her condition. Dr.&nbsp;Richter testified 
      that he was unable to ascertain whether the complainant was unable or unwilling 
      to attend court. Whenever the subject of court proceedings was broached, 
      the complainant burst into tears and was incapable of discussing the matter. 
      The doctor was unable to advise the Court when or even whether the complainant 
      would be capable of testifying.</p>
    <p>            <i>The necessity test has clearly been met. The complainant 
      is not available to testify</i>.  (Emphasis added)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>The trial judge then addressed the issue of threshold reliability:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>            At issue, therefore, is the reliability of the complainant's 
      out-of-court statements.</p>
    <p>            In the course of the <i>voir dire</i>, the accused's cautioned 
      statement was presented as evidence. The statement was admitted to have 
      been voluntarily given. In that statement, the accused admits acts which, 
      absent the issue of consent or honest belief in same, would clearly constitute 
      a sexual assault. The accused's statement corroborates the complainant's 
      statement that a sexual activity took place, although the degree of the 
      sexual activity differs (i.e. whether intercourse took place).</p>
    <p>            It should be noted that, in the course of determining the admissibility 
      of out-of-court statements, a distinction must be made as to whether the 
      threshold of reliability has been met as opposed to the issue of ultimate 
      reliability. Two very different criteria must be applied to these issues. 
      In determining admissibility the test is one of a balance of probabilities. 
      On the ultimate test of reliability a far more stringent test must be applied.</p>
    <p>            I am of the opinion that the out-of-court statements of the 
      complainant that the Crown seeks to have declared admissible exhibit sufficient 
      indicia of reliability to afford me a satisfactory basis for evaluating 
      the truth of those statements. Accordingly, those statements are ruled admissible.</p>

line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the trial judge erred in his finding that the necessity 
  test had clearly been met on the basis that the complainant was hospitalized 
  at the time of the trial and was unable to attend court at that time. Although 
  she was unavailable to attend the trial on the scheduled date, her unavailability 
  may well have been temporary. Had there been no trial delay issue, there would 
  have been no reason not to adjourn the case for a few weeks in order to ascertain 
  the status of the complainant’s health and whether she was sufficiently stable 
  on her new medication to attend and testify.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, this was not a case where necessity was determined on the 
  basis that testifying would cause harm to the complainant. The psychologist, 
  Dr. Richter, was neither asked for that opinion nor was that his evidence. Defence 
  counsel pointed out in his submissions to the trial judge, that Dr. Richter 
  did not say that testifying would harm the complainant. In his reasons for finding 
  necessity, the trial judge also did not say that testifying would harm the complainant, 
  but only noted that when the subject of the court proceedings was broached with 
  her, she cried and could not discuss the matter. The fact that the complainant 
  cried when the subject of the court proceedings was raised with her was the 
  basis for the doctor's conclusion that she was either unable or unwilling to 
  attend court. He was not postulating a situation where the complainant would 
  or could be forced to attend.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the appellant had made a voluntary statement wherein he admitted 
  the facts and circumstances of the offence (except for  sexual intercourse, 
  which the trial judge did not accept occurred),  the issue in this case was 
  the defence of consent, the availability of which depended on the complainant's 
  capacity to consent. No questions were posed to the complainant on the videotaped 
  statement on the issue of consent. There was one reference to it in the complainant’s 
  conversation with her mother. Therefore, in order to present his defence, the 
  appellant required an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant, in particular 
  on the issue of whether she had consented to the sexual activity, and to try 
  to demonstrate that she had the capacity to consent, or to show why he had an 
  honest but mistaken belief in her consent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The necessity issue in this case is similar to that in <i>R. v. Wyatt</i> 
  (1997), 115 C.C.C. 288 (B.C.C.A.). There, the complainant gave her evidence 
  in chief and underwent part of her cross-examination, but was unable to complete 
  the cross-examination as she was affected by brain damage. The defence in that 
  case was consent. The Crown sought to save the case by seeking a <i>Khan voir 
  dire </i>to admit into evidence prior statements and preliminary inquiry transcripts. 
  The case was adjourned when the cross-examination broke down, to allow the Crown 
  to obtain professional reports regarding the ability of the complainant to continue 
  and to consider how to proceed in light of those reports. It was only after 
  receiving those reports that the court could rule on the <i>Khan </i>motion. 
  The court denied the <i>Khan</i> motion and stayed the sexual assault charge. 
  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge that the accused 
  could not receive a fair trial without the opportunity of full cross-examination 
  of the complainant, and that the previous statements would not assist the court 
  on the issue of consent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As would have been the case in <i>Wyatt</i>, the critical effect of 
  the <i>Khan</i> ruling here allowing the admission of the out-of-court statements, 
  was that it allowed the case to proceed without the complainant. This was not 
  a case such as where there is a child complainant and the Crown takes the position 
  that the complainant is not competent to testify under s. 16 of the <i>Canada 
  Evidence Act</i>, and where the defence of consent is not available. Had the 
  complainant not been hospitalized and unstable at the time of trial, it appears 
  that she would have been competent to testify and to be cross-examined.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, the Supreme Court addressed 
  the accused's interest in cross-examining the child in order to challenge the 
  credibility of the statement itself and whether the assault occurred. Here, 
  sexual contact was admitted. The appellant needed the opportunity to cross-examine 
  the complainant on the issue of consent, her capacity to consent, and to demonstrate 
  to the court why he would have had an honest belief that she had the capacity 
  to consent. The trial judge understood that the purpose and effect of his ruling 
  was to allow the trial to proceed in the absence of the complainant, depriving 
  the appellant of the right to cross-examine the complainant on those critical 
  issues.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his submissions on the <i>Khan voir dire</i>, defence counsel emphasized 
  the fact that the appellant was being deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine 
  the complainant in circumstances where the Crown had not shown that her unavailability 
  was not temporary. That concern goes to the issues of prejudice to the accused 
  and trial fairness.</p>

  </span> <i>Khan </i>was the seminal case where the principles of admissibility 
  of hearsay statements of children based on the criteria of necessity and reliability 
  were first comprehensively articulated. McLachlin J. cautioned at p. 547:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            In determining the admissibility of the evidence, the judge 
      must have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. 
      …[I]n most cases the concerns of the accused as to credibility will remain 
      to be addressed by submissions as the weight to be accorded to the evidence, 
      and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The need to safeguard the interests of the accused and of the trial 
  process is always a factor to be weighed when considering the admissibility 
  of any piece of evidence, particularly evidence which is otherwise inadmissible: 
  <i>R. v. Harrer</i> (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 205-6 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. 
  Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 at 1089.</p>

line-height:normal'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the circumstances of this case, where the prejudice to the accused 
  was potentially so significant, it was incumbent on the trial judge, when deciding 
  the issue of necessity, to give effect to the evidence that the complainant's 
  unavailability may have been temporary, and that within a few weeks, after a 
  change in her medication, she may have been available. The necessity was created 
  by the Crown’s position putting the matter on a “now or never” basis. The fact 
  that the elapsed time to trial is on the cusp of becoming a constitutionally 
  unreasonable delay, should not become a factor used against an accused person 
  in deciding whether hearsay evidence is to be admitted on the basis of  temporal 
  necessity. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The basis for the necessity ruling in this case can be usefully compared 
  with the case of <i>R. v. Menard</i>  (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 424 (Ont. C.A.), 
  where this court held that a doctor’s note that a witness,  Mr. Graves, was 
  too ill to travel to be at the trial, was sufficient to satisfy the necessity 
  criterion. In that case, Mr. Graves had been fully examined and cross-examined 
  as part of the preliminary inquiry process. In upholding the decision of the 
  trial judge on the issue, this court concluded at p. 435:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Graves was an expert witness whose credibility was not contested. No 
      prejudice resulted to the appellant from the admissibility of Graves’ evidence 
      in that fashion.</p>

line-height:normal'> [83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case the only basis for establishing the criterion of necessity 
  was the complainant's current unavailability to testify. Where the defence was 
  consent and capacity to consent, and where cross-examination of the complainant 
  was essential for the accused to have an opportunity to make full answer and 
  defence, in my view it was incumbent on the trial judge to deny the <i>Khan</i> 
  motion. Had the Crown been prepared  to adjourn the trial, the trial judge could 
  have considered that alternative, as was done in <i>Wyatt</i>, in order to determine 
  whether the change in the complainant's medication would allow her to become 
  able (or willing) to testify. Any delay issues could be addressed on the return 
  date if necessary. </p>

  </span> Because of the <i>Khan</i> ruling, the trial judge’s opportunity to 
  make his own assessment of the complainant's capacity or understanding of sexual 
  matters was limited, and he relied essentially on the expert evidence to make 
  that finding of fact. Had the trial proceeded with the complainant, the trial 
  judge may well have reached the same conclusion that the complainant did not 
  have the capacity to consent to sexual activity, or at least to this kind of 
  casual sexual activity.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] 
  </span></a> However, one cannot be certain that he necessarily would have done 
  so.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> It therefore 
  cannot be said that the trial judge’s error caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice. In any event, the issue would not have arisen because of the Crown's 
  position that it would not have proceeded further with the prosecution had the 
  <i>Khan</i> ruling not been made in its favour.</p>
