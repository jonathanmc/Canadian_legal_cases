<h4><b>On appeal from the order of Justice Ian V. B. Nordheimer dated May 24,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is an appeal from that portion of the order of Nordheimer J. which 
  granted a stay of proceedings against the Attorney General of Canada. The other 
  portion of that order dismissed the action against the Federal Republic of Germany 
  on the ground of immunity. The latter was a final order, was appealed directly 
  to this court, and the appeal was dismissed on February 12, 2001 with reasons 
  reported at 52 O.R. (3d) 577. The Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal 
  on September 13, 2001, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 201. The order staying the action 
  against the Attorney General was an interlocutory order, leave to appeal to 
  the Divisional Court was granted by Lang J., and the appeal was transferred 
  to this court by order of Catzman J.A. pursuant to s. 6(2) and (3) of the <i>Courts 
  of Justice Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43. By the time the two appeals had been 
  brought together the first had been listed for hearing and time was not available 
  to hear them at the same time. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The action itself arises out of the arrest and detention of the appellant 
  at the request of Germany for extradition to face “investigative proceedings” 
  concerning alleged tax evasion. Following his release on bail the appellant 
  commenced this action claiming damages for negligence and abuse of power grounded 
  on the allegation that the extradition agreement between Canada and Germany 
  does not contemplate extradition for investigative purposes, nor for income 
  tax offences. After the appellant’s arrest, the grounds for extradition were 
  broadened to include bribery and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of trust.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown moved for a stay of the action pending the extradition proceedings. 
  The grounds cited in the notice of motion were that the same facts and law would 
  be considered in each proceeding, that if there is an extradition the claim 
  for damages will have little merit, and that multiplicity of proceedings and 
  inconsistent findings can be avoided if a stay is granted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I observe at the outset that if those grounds are sufficient to stay 
  a civil proceeding then all such proceedings would be stayed wherever there 
  is an overlap with criminal proceedings. Yet the case authorities are clear 
  that the threshold test for granting a stay is a high one, requiring the demonstration 
  of extraordinary or exceptional circumstances. In <i>Nash v. Ontario </i>(1995), 
  27 O.R. (3d) 1, this court stated at p. 7:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            Several reported cases have suggested that the rationale underlying 
      a stay of civil action pending the conclusion of a related criminal prosecution 
      is the protection of the accused’s right to a fair trial: see, for example, 
      <i>Seaway Trust Co. v. Kilderkin Investments Ltd. </i>(1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 
      545, 29 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 456 (H.C.J.); <i>Belanger v. Caughell</i> 
      (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 741 (Gen. Div.). In the present case, however, the 
      party moving for the stay is the Crown, and the accused’s rights are not 
      at issue. The Crown must, then, show that other extraordinary or exceptional 
      circumstances justify a stay.</p>
    <p>            The cases are clear that the threshold test to be met before 
      a stay is granted is high. The mere fact that criminal proceedings are pending 
      at the same time as civil proceedings is not sufficient ground for a stay 
      of the latter: <i>Stickney v. Trusz, supra. </i>Even the potential disclosure 
      through the civil proceedings of the nature of the accused’s defence or 
      of self-incriminating evidence is not necessarily exceptional: see <i>Belanger 
      v. Caughell, supra;</i> <i>Stickney v. Trusz, supra; Seaway Trust Co. v. 
      Kilderkin Investments Ltd., supra</i>. This high threshold test should not 
      be relaxed merely because it is the Crown that requests the stay. An applicant, 
      whether it is the Crown or the accused, must meet the same burden of proving 
      extraordinary or exceptional circumstances. The test is not on a balance 
      of convenience for the Crown and something higher for the accused. To the 
      extent that the motions court judge held that it is, he erred.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reasons of Nordheimer J. are found at 48 O.R. (3d) 521. It appears 
  that he was strongly influenced by the words of Zuber J. in <i>Stickney v. Trusz</i>. 
  Nordheimer J. states at pp. 534-535 (emphasis is that of Nordheimer J.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>            Returning to the considerations of whether a stay should be 
      granted, I was referred to four cases in addition to <i>Nash</i>. The first 
      in time is <i>Stickney v. Trusz</i> (1973), 2 O.R. (2d) 469, 45 D.L.R. (3d) 
      275 (H.C.J.), affirmed (1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 538, 46 D.L.R. (3d) 80 (Div. 
      Ct.), affirmed (1974) 3 O.R. (2d) 539, 46 D.L.R. (3d) 82 (C.A.), leave to 
      appeal refused [1974] S.C.R. xii. This case provides the modern source of 
      the “exceptional or extraordinary” requirement for a stay although the genesis 
      of that language appears to go as far back as 1921. However, a review of 
      the decision of Zuber J. in the first instance in <i>Stickney</i> suggests 
      to me that the use of this language was not intended to set as high a barrier 
      to the granting of a stay as might initially appear from the language itself. 
      Mr. Justice Zuber referred to the argument before him as to whether the 
      use of the words “exceptional or extraordinary” created a high hurdle as 
      being “more apparent than real”. He went on to say, at p. 471:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Since there is now no general rule that civil cases must be stayed because 
        of criminal charges arising out of the same facts, and since the matter 
        is now within the discretion of the Court, it is obvious that <i>it is 
        incumbent upon the applicant to show some reason why the discretion should 
        be exercised. In that sense he must demonstrate that his case is an exception 
        or a case other than ordinary. </i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>            Mr. Justice Zuber then identified the dilemma in applying the 
      test for a stay that I must say I was left with after the first reading 
      the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Nash</i>. That dilemma is, as Zuber 
      J. said, again at p. 471:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>            Most of the cases that deal with the question of the exercise 
        of discretion in exceptional cases say little or nothing about the principles 
        upon which the discretion should be based. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> And then, after reviewing the authorities, Nordheimer J. states at p. 
  537:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            Having reviewed all of the above authorities, I do not find 
      that any solution has emerged to the dilemma, of which Zuber J. spoke more 
      than 25 years ago, regarding the principles upon which the discretion to 
      stay should be based. Adopting the words of Zuber J. from <i>Stickney, </i>and 
      turning back to the case that is before me, the question becomes:  Is there 
      some reason that this action should be stayed in the sense that it is an 
      exception or other than ordinary? </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge then sets down four reasons supporting a stay. I will 
  deal with these in order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> His first ground is that there will be no prejudice to the appellant 
  if a stay is granted. In my view this is looking through the wrong end of the 
  telescope. An applicant for a discretionary remedy must justify the request 
  and could reasonably be expected to show prejudice if the order sought is refused: 
  that is generally why the order is sought. It was the failure of the applicant 
  to show prejudice that led Zuber J. in <i>Strickney</i> to refuse a stay. Here, 
  the Crown alleges no prejudice to it if the stay is refused and the motions 
  judge relied on there being no prejudice to the appellant if one is granted. 
  It is the applicant who must show the exceptional circumstances and they cannot 
  be said to be more exceptional than other factors indicate because the respondent 
  to the motion will not be prejudiced. Moreover, there is an element of prejudice 
  in any stay order in that the plaintiff is denied early access to the civil 
  justice that is sought and, if it is later sought to remove the stay, the onus 
  will be upon the plaintiff.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Justice Nordheimer’s second ground was that the plaintiff could attain 
  the vindication he seeks as well in the extradition proceeding as in the civil 
  proceeding. This assumes that the plaintiff is only interested in vindication 
  and not interested in the damage claim of $1 million. Further, the extradition 
  hearing is now based on much broader grounds than when the appellant was arrested. 
  It is entirely possible, that those proceedings will be resolved on the basis 
  of the newer allegations and that the tax investigations that led to the warrant 
  will become redundant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third ground on which the motions judge relied was the danger of 
  inconsistent findings and the fourth was the likelihood that the determination 
  of the extradition proceedings will have a significant impact upon the civil 
  proceeding, either negating or supporting it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> My observations upon ground two apply equally to these. Whether or not 
  there is vindication or resolution of issues in the extradition proceeding and 
  whether or not inconsistent findings are avoided, these are common features 
  to some degree whenever criminal and civil proceedings overlap and proceed in 
  tandem. As pointed out in <i>Nash, supra,</i> even when the accused person seeks 
  to stay civil proceedings because of exposure to discovery on the same issues, 
  the stay may be refused. One stay was left standing in <i>Nash</i>, but that 
  concerned an action which was the complete reciprocal of the criminal prosecution 
  and was commenced with the appearance of intent to interfere with the criminal 
  process. There is no suggestion of improper motive in the present case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, I conclude that the motions judge erred in principle 
  in his application of the test for issuing a stay. There was, in my opinion 
  no basis for finding the exceptional circumstances which would justify a stay. 
  The appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellant here, on the motion 
  to transfer, on the leave motion, and on the motion itself.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The stay should be set aside and the motion for the stay dismissed.</p>

  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span> An appellant seeking to overturn a motions judge’s exercise of discretion 
  faces a very high hurdle. In <i>Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada</i>, 
  [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 76-77, LaForest J. considered the “principles governing 
  appellate review of a lower court’s exercise of discretion” and expressly adopted 
  this analysis from Viscount Simon L.C.’s speech in <i>Charles Osenton &amp; 
  Co. v. Johnston</i>, [1942] A.C. 130 at 138:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> The law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made 
      by the judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well-established, 
      and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well-settled 
      principles in an individual case. The appellate tribunal is not at liberty 
      merely to substitute its own exercise of discretion for the discretion already 
      exercised by the judge. In other words, appellate authorities ought not 
      to reverse the order merely because they would themselves have exercised 
      the original discretion, had it attached to them, in a different way. But 
      <i>if the appellate tribunal reaches the clear conclusion that there has 
      been a wrongful exercise of discretion in that no weight, or no sufficient 
      weight, has been given to relevant considerations</i> such as those urged 
      before us by the appellant, <i>then the reversal of the order on appeal 
      may be justified</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> The question in this appeal, then, is whether the motions judge, Nordheimer 
  J., gave “no weight, or no sufficient weight” to relevant considerations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge applied the test for granting a stay of proceedings 
  in the face of existing criminal proceedings enunciated by this court in <i>Nash 
  v. Ontario</i> (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 at 6 (“<i>Nash</i>”), namely that the 
  applicant must demonstrate that the case “is an extraordinary or an exceptional 
  one” justifying a stay.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that although the motions judge purported to 
  rely on <i>Nash</i>, he misapplied it in several respects. The appellant summarizes 
  his argument relating to the alleged misapplication of the <i>Nash</i> test 
  in paragraph 12 of his factum:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a)       he asked himself whether “it is just and convenient that a stay 
      should be granted” – a much lower test than “extraordinary or exceptional 
      circumstances”, as set out in <i>Nash</i>;</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p>(b)       he applied a “considerable overlap in issues” test – a much lower 
      test than the “extraordinary or exceptional circumstances” test in <i>Nash</i>;</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p>(c)       he took into account the “prospect of inconsistent findings” 
      which, again, is not part of the <i>Nash</i> test;</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p>(d)       he erred in requiring Mr. Schreiber to show that a stay of the 
      action would not prejudice him rather than requiring Canada (the party seeking 
      the stay) to show prejudice, contrary to <i>Nash</i>.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, I think that the appellant’s submission on this issue 
  confuses <i>the test</i> for granting a stay and <i>factors</i> which may be 
  relevant in applying the test. The words “extraordinary and exceptional circumstances” 
  in <i>Nash</i> are not self-defining. In every case, it will be necessary for 
  a judge seeking to apply this test, which I would describe as a highly general 
  test, to identify and consider a variety of factors. That is precisely what 
  the motions judge did in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The real question is whether the motions judge failed to consider relevant 
  factors or gave “no weight, or no sufficient weight” to relevant factors. In 
  my view, he did not.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his reasons, the motions judge identified four factors which suggested 
  to him that a stay of Mr. Schreiber’s civil proceeding should be granted: (1) 
  there would not be any serious or substantial prejudice to Mr. Schreiber if 
  a stay were granted; (2) the vindication of Mr. Schreiber’s rights could “to 
  a substantial extent” be accomplished by a finding in his favour in the extradition 
  proceeding; (3) there is a serious risk of inconsistent findings if the extradition 
  hearing and the civil action move forward concurrently; and (4) it is “almost 
  certain” that the determination of the extradition proceeding would have a significant 
  impact on the civil action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the first factor, I do not agree with the appellant’s 
  submission that the motions judge erred by focussing on the prejudice to Mr. 
  Schreiber of a potential stay of the civil proceeding. The reality is, as the 
  motions judge indicated in his reasons, that the appellant argued precisely 
  this point at the hearing of the motion. Accordingly, although it might have 
  been preferable for the motions judge to apply a prejudice analysis explicitly 
  to both parties, I do not fault him for dealing directly with an argument made 
  forcefully by the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the merits, in my view a decision by the motions judge <i>not</i> 
  to grant the stay would have prejudiced both parties and, more fundamentally, 
  would have brought the administration of justice into disrepute. I reach this 
  conclusion because it arises, in my view, from a proper understanding of the 
  special nature of proceedings under the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 
  18.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An extradition proceeding <i>is not</i> a criminal trial. Moreover, 
  an extradition hearing <i>must</i> proceed expeditiously. These two points have 
  been articulated often by the Supreme Court of Canada. For example, in <i>Re 
  McVey</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 475 at 528, LaForest J. stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 3.<span

      </span> [E]xtradition proceedings are not trials. They are intended to be 
      expeditious procedures to determine whether a trial should be held.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In a similar vein, in <i>United States of America 
  v. Dynar</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462 at 514, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. said:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> A judge hearing an extradition matter has an important role to fulfil. 
      Yet it cannot be forgotten that the hearing is intended to be an expedited 
      process, designed to keep expenses to a minimum and ensure prompt compliance 
      with Canada’s international obligations.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Germany requested the extradition of Mr. Schreiber on August 27, 1999. 
  Mr. Schreiber was arrested in Toronto on August 31. He commenced his civil action 
  on November 12. The Crown initiated its motion for a stay of the civil action 
  on December 13. The motion was scheduled to be heard on February 24, 2000, but 
  for reasons not apparent in the record it was heard by Nordheimer J. on May 
  12. By that date, more than eight months had passed since the initial extradition 
  request. In my view, the passage of this much time without resolution of the 
  extradition hearing begins to impinge on the Supreme Court of Canada’s strictures 
  regarding “expeditious procedures” and “ensur[ing] prompt compliance with Canada’s 
  international obligations”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, it is important for both parties to work diligently to comply 
  with the objectives of the <i>Extradition Act</i> as enunciated by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada. I am concerned that by May 12, 2000 the extradition hearing 
  had not advanced very far. <a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> [1] </a>  In my view, the requirement 
  of “expeditious procedures” and the objective of “ensur[ing] prompt compliance 
  with Canada’s international obligations” meant that in May 2000, eight months 
  after Germany’s initial extradition request, Mr. Schreiber should either have 
  been in Germany facing the serious charges that Germany had made against him, 
  or he should have been a free man in Canada with all the rights his Canadian 
  citizenship accords him, including the right to bring a civil action against 
  the Attorney General of Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, on May 12, 2000, when the motion for a stay of the civil 
  proceeding was heard, in my view a refusal to grant the stay would have flown 
  in the face of the purposes of the  <i>Extradition  Act</i>,  the  legitimate  
  expectations  of  foreign  governments  pursuant  to important treaties with 
  Canada, and clear and strong statements by the Supreme Court of Canada. Given 
  the demonstrated length and asserted (by the appellant) complexity of the extradition 
  proceeding, a parallel civil proceeding would inevitably have slowed down even 
  more an extradition proceeding that appeared to be advancing at only a snail’s 
  pace. In my view, this would bring the administration of justice in an important 
  and visible domain into disrepute. It would also prejudice both parties who 
  are entitled to obtain resolution of the extradition matter in an expeditious 
  fashion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the second factor, I agree with the motions judge’s 
  analysis. It is true that a victory in the extradition hearing would not provide 
  Mr. Schreiber with the financial compensation he seeks in the civil proceeding. 
  However, it is obvious that Mr.&nbsp;Schreiber’s principal concern is that he 
  not be extradited to Germany where he might face both a long criminal trial 
  and, ultimately, a long period of imprisonment. Accordingly, if, as the appellant 
  asserts, it is vindication he seeks, I think the motions judge was correct to 
  find that vindication could be accomplished “to a substantial extent” in the 
  extradition hearing. The secondary vindication of financial compensation can 
  wait.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to the third factor, I can see no reason for disputing the motions 
  judge’s identification and application of the factor of the prospect of inconsistent 
  findings. He cited Lamer J.’s observation in <i>Duhamel v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 
  2 S.C.R. 555 at 562 (“<i>Duhamel</i>”), that “having regard to the efficiency 
  and reputation of the judicial system … the scandal of conflicting decisions 
  be avoided”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It may be true, as my colleague observes, that the risk of inconsistent 
  findings is a common feature “to some degree whenever criminal and civil proceedings 
  overlap and proceed in tandem”. It may also be true that the risk might remain 
  unrealized because, as the appellant asserts, “the good sense and judgment of 
  the judges of the Superior Court of Justice involved could be, and indeed presumptively 
  must be, trusted to avoid inconsistency” (Factum, paragraph 18). However, these 
  observations are speculative. They are not sufficient, in my view, to support 
  a conclusion that the motions judge erred when, relying on <i>Duhamel</i>, he 
  identified the avoidance of inconsistent findings as a  worthy objective that 
  would be promoted by granting a stay in the civil proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fourth factor that the motions judge identified and applied was 
  that the determination of the extradition proceeding would have a significant 
  impact on the civil action. I agree with the motions judge’s analysis on this 
  point.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant is correct in saying that the extradition and civil proceedings 
  “do not stand or fall together” (Factum, paragraph 16). It is <i>possible</i> 
  that Mr. Schreiber could be extradited to Germany to face a criminal trial and 
  win his civil action for damages in Canada. This is because Mr. Schreiber’s 
  civil action is focused on the documents and events relating to his initial 
  arrest and detention in Canada. The initial extradition request from Germany 
  and the arrest of Mr. Schreiber related to suspected income tax offences. Mr. 
  Schreiber takes the position that offences in this category are not extraditable. 
  Later, Germany expanded its extradition request to cover other criminal offences, 
  including fraud, bribery and accepting a secret commission. Accordingly, if 
  Mr. Schreiber were extradited to Germany only on the basis of the new offences, 
  he might win his civil action in Ontario based on the initial arrest and detention 
  relating to the tax offences.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Conversely, it is also <i>possible</i> that Mr. Schreiber might not 
  be extradited to Germany yet might lose his civil action. This could happen 
  if the extradition judge decides that Mr. Schreiber should not be extradited, 
  either for procedural (abuse of process) or substantive grounds, but the judge 
  presiding at the civil action decides that the Crown did nothing wrong relating 
  to the initial arrest and detention of Mr. Schreiber.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, in my view, these scenarios are speculative and, frankly, somewhat 
  far-fetched. The reality is that if Mr. Schreiber is extradited to Germany to 
  face a large number of serious criminal charges, there would be little chance 
  of succeeding in a civil action in Ontario relating to the arrest and detention 
  which commenced the extradition process. Equally, if Mr. Schreiber is not extradited, 
  either because the substantive grounds for extradition are not established or 
  because of an abuse of process on the part of the Crown, his chances of success 
  in the civil action would soar. Accordingly, I think the motions judge was precisely 
  right when he stated that it was “almost certain” that the determination of 
  the extradition proceedings would have a significant impact on the civil action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before concluding, I want to mention one other factor which, in my view, 
  also supports the motions judge’s decision – namely, the qualified nature of 
  the stay order imposed by the motions judge. Nordheimer J. did not impose the 
  stay requested by the Crown, namely a stay until the final resolution of the 
  extradition proceeding. Instead, he imposed a stay “until the extradition proceeding 
  is determined in the first instance, or until further order of this court”. 
  Moreover, he also observed that if the extradition proceeding did not move forward 
  expeditiously, then “that might also provide the basis for a motion to lift 
  the stay”. It seems to me that these are carefully tailored and appropriate 
  qualifications on, and observations about, the stay the motions judge ordered. 
  They indicate that the motions judge was alive to the wording of s. 106 of the 
  <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> which permits a motions judge to stay a proceeding 
  “on such terms as are considered just”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, if the appellant wants to proceed with his civil action, 
  there are two routes open to him: (1) he can work co-operatively with the Crown 
  to move the extradition hearing forward in an expeditious fashion in the knowledge 
  that the resolution of the extradition issue will lay a good deal (perhaps all) 
  of the foundation for the success or failure of the civil action, or (2) if 
  the 27 month passage of time in the extradition process is the fault of the 
  Crown, he can apply to have the stay lifted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant chose a third route, namely seeking to have the motions 
  judge’s stay order overturned on appeal. I conclude that this third route is 
  closed. The motions judge did not err. He applied the correct legal test and 
  he identified relevant factors and did not give “no weight, or no sufficient 
  weight” to those factors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The order under appeal is, no doubt, made in the exercise of a discretion 
  but, having regard to the “exceptional or extraordinary circumstances” test 
  (about which I shall say something shortly) the scope for the exercise of the 
  discretion is narrow.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under the governing case law the parties do not start even, as they 
  do, for example, in many cases of motions for an interlocutory injunction where 
  the balance of convenience will govern the decision. The parties start with 
  a presumption against the granting of a stay. This has a direct bearing on the 
  range and nature of the considerations that may properly be taken into account 
  in the exercise of the discretion and, therefore, on the degree of deference 
  that should be shown on appellate review. I shall deal with the considerations 
  taken into account by the motions judge in this case, but shall first comment 
  on the “exceptional and extraordinary circumstances” test.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It appears that this test, as was noted indirectly by the motions judge, 
  has its roots in a dictum of Duff J. in <i>MacKenzie v. Palmer</i> (1921), 62 
  S.C.R. 517 at 520 in a discussion of the old “felonious tort rule” which Duff 
  J., referring to <i>Smith v. Selwyn</i>, [1914] 3 K.B. 98, described:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>… where the facts constituting the foundation of a cause 
      of action in themselves constitute a felony the right of action for tort 
      is suspended until the plaintiff has prosecuted the defendant if the plaintiff 
      is the person on whom the duty of prosecution falls; ...</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the reasons he gave, Duff J. expressed the view at p. 520 that “it 
  is, at least, I think, exceedingly doubtful whether in this country any action 
  ought to be stayed on such a ground”, i.e., that the plaintiff had not prosecuted 
  the defendant. On this point he concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[t]hat is a question which does not strictly arise here 
      because no application was made for a stay of the action and the rule, if 
      not entirely obsolete, ought at least to operate only within the straitest 
      limits allowed by precedent.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I shall not trace the case law which resulted in “within the straitest 
  limits allowed by precedent” becoming “in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances”. 
  I would note, however, that there appears to be no logical or practical connection 
  between the proper interpretive approach in administering a rule, now obsolete, 
  that a plaintiff first prosecute a defendant, and a rule relating to the exercise 
  of a discretion to stay civil proceedings where there are concurrent civil and 
  criminal proceedings. The policy of the first rule was to encourage prosecutions 
  and to ensure the Crown’s long obsolete right to forfeit a felon’s chattels 
  (Fleming, <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 9th ed. (1998) at p. 42). These policies 
  have nothing to do with the current stay rule.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It would appear that this point, or one like it, was raised before Zuber 
  J. in <i>Stickney v. Trusz</i> (1973), 2 O.R. (2d) 469 (H. Ct.) but without 
  effect on his decision in that case to apply the exceptional and extraordinary 
  circumstances approach.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Zuber J., however, did observe at p. 471 that “the difference in terminology 
  is more apparent than real” and that the rationale underlying the cases was 
  “that the right of the accused to a fair trial should not be prejudiced.”  This, 
  no doubt, is the true principle that governs motions for a stay in cases where 
  the moving party is the defendant/accused and it gives more concrete and logical 
  guidance than “exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Nash v. Ontario</i> (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 at 7 (C.A.) this court 
  held that in cases where the accused is the plaintiff and the party moving for 
  a stay is the Crown, the same approach should be followed. “An applicant, whether 
  it is the Crown or the accused, must meet the same burden of proving extraordinary 
  or exceptional circumstances.”  The court also stressed that it was “a high 
  threshold test”. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the Crown/defendant is the moving party the applicable principle, 
  of course, does not relate to prejudice to the fair trial of the accused/plaintiff 
  but, by analogy to this, to prejudice to the Crown or to the administration 
  of justice generally.</p>

  Hospital</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 1 at 23 (C.A.).</p>

  </span> Accordingly, when the Crown moves for a stay in a case such as the present, 
  it must satisfy the threshold test of showing, on the facts, that the prejudice 
  to it or to some aspect of the administration of justice clearly outweighs the 
  fundamental right of the plaintiff to timely access to the courts.</p>

  </span> Turning to the present case, it appears to me that the considerations 
  that the motions judge took into account did not have any significant connection 
  to “exceptional or extraordinary circumstances” as Carthy J.A. has held, or 
  to the competing prejudices I have referred to above. The motions judge, a few 
  paragraphs before he dealt with his considerations, said in paragraph 35: “In 
  the end result, [i]n my view, it is a question of whether, considering all of 
  the facts in a given case, it is just and convenient that a stay should be granted.”  
  Even though later in his reasons he used the expression “exceptional and extraordinary 
  circumstances” it seems to me that his analysis was more in accord with the 
  standard of convenience. If this were the applicable test, I would be inclined 
  to agree with him, but it is not.</p>

  </span> The motions judge addressed the possible issue of improper motivation 
  for this action and very fairly observed, in favour of the plaintiff, that “[t]here 
  is no evidence before me that raises even a hint of improper or ulterior motive 
  regarding the commencement of this action.”  Accordingly, it cannot be said 
  that the decision of this court in <i>Falloncrest Financial Corp. v. Ontario</i>, 
  one of the <i>Nash v. Ontario</i> actions, to uphold a stay of a civil action 
  commenced against the Crown is a precedent supporting the granting of a stay 
  in this case, even if it could be said that this action is the reciprocal of 
  the extradition proceedings.</p>

  </span> I do not exclude from my consideration the importance of expedition 
  in extradition proceedings and prompt compliance with Canada’s international 
  obligations. Whether the civil proceeding results in any significant prejudice 
  to Canada in connection with its extradition obligations is entirely a question 
  of fact. The motions judge did not find any prejudice in this regard and, before 
  us, it was not argued by the respondent that he erred in this regard. No submission 
  was made that the civil proceeding prejudiced the progress of the extradition 
  proceeding. It is reasonable to infer that, whatever delay there is in the extradition 
  proceeding, the civil proceeding has not been a cause of it nor that it constitutes 
  a threat to its future progress.</p>

    factum on this appeal, which was heard more than two years after Germany’s 
    initial request for extradition, the appellant states that the extradition 
    proceeding is still at “an embryonic stage” and that the proceeding “could 
    take years” (paragraphs 16 and 23).</p>
