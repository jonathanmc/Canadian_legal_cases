  </span></span> The respondents, Ralph Schroeder and his son Christopher were 
  charged with theft under $5,000.  The information alleged that they stole “Canadian 
  currency, the property of Maggie Brown”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge acquitted on the theft charge finding that the 
  Crown had failed to prove that the currency was the property of Maggie Brown.  
  The Crown accepts for the purposes of this appeal that it was required to prove 
  that the currency was the property of Maggie Brown.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The procedure followed at trial was somewhat confusing.  We are 
  satisfied, however, that the trial judge’s ruling should be read as a ruling 
  made at the end of the evidence and after an election by the defence not to 
  call any evidence. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents were hired by John Bernard to assist in a clean-up 
  of his property after a fire destroyed Mr. Bernard’s hotel.  Mr. Bernard and 
  Ms. Brown had lived in a common law relationship for a long time.  They lived 
  on the hotel property.  Ms. Brown had been very involved in the operation of 
  the hotel until a few years prior to the fire when she became ill.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the course of the clean-up of the debris, the respondent, 
  Christopher Schroeder found a wad of Canadian and American currency.  From its 
  appearance, it seemed probable that the currency was present when the fire occurred.  
  Christopher handed the wad to his father who put it in his pocket.  Several 
  days later, Ralph Schroeder used $1,300 from that money to pay down his son 
  Christopher’s tax bill.  The respondents did not tell Mr. Bernard or Ms. Brown 
  that they had found the money during the clean-up.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown’s primary theory at trial was that the found funds 
  were funds that Ms. Brown had hidden on various occasions in the hotel at some 
  time before the fire.  All of the evidence led by the Crown was directed at 
  this theory. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge was not satisfied that the Crown had proved beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the money found by Christopher Schroeder was money hidden 
  by Ms. Brown at some time before the fire.  The trial judge’s reasons for that 
  finding are not challenged on appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial, by way of an alternative argument, the Crown contended 
  that even if the money was not money “stashed” by Ms. Brown, she had a property 
  interest in that money by virtue of her position as an occupier of the property 
  and a co-operator of the hotel.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge did not address this theory in her reasons.  There 
  was little, if any, attention given to this theory in the evidence.  The evidence 
  established that Ms. Brown had lived on the property for many years with Mr. 
  Bernard, although it is unclear whether she lived in the building that burned 
  down in the fire.  The evidence also established that Ms. Brown no longer was 
  involved in the operation of the hotel and was not an owner of the land. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We think counsel for the respondents is correct when he submits 
  that the question of whether Ms. Brown was an occupier of the property on which 
  the fire occurred, and the further question of what property interest, if any, 
  her status as an occupier would give her to the money found by Christopher are 
  difficult fact-bound questions which do not admit of a simple definitive answer.  
  As counsel argued, the answer to these questions will depend on the particular 
  circumstances of the case.  Those circumstances were not developed in evidence 
  by the Crown.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It would have been better had the trial judge addressed both 
  theories advanced by the Crown.  We are satisfied, however, that had she considered 
  the argument that Ms. Brown had a property interest in the money as an occupier 
  of the property on which the money was found, she would have concluded that 
  the evidence simply did not address the issues relevant to that theory of liability.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is not appropriate for this court to allow a Crown appeal 
  based on the trial judge’s failure to consider a theory of liability which, 
  while available in law, was not developed in the evidence adduced by the Crown 
  at trial.  The Crown should not have a second opportunity to lead evidence in 
  support of that theory of liability.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>We would dismiss the appeal from the acquittal 
  on the theft charges.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown also appeals the acquittal of Ralph Schroeder on the 
  possession charge.  The Crown is correct in her contention that as the possession 
  charge did not allege ownership in any particular person, the Crown was not 
  required to prove ownership in any particular person.  We do not think, however, 
  that the ends of justice would be served by giving effect to this argument.  
  The Crown’s theory on the possession charge, like its theory on the theft charge, 
  was that Ms. Brown was the owner of the property.  The theft and possession 
  charges were, in fact, if not in law, part and parcel of the same allegation.  
  Since we are satisfied that the acquittal on the theft charge must stand, we 
  do not think that the administration of justice would be served by ordering 
  a new trial on the possession charge so the Crown could advance a new theory.
