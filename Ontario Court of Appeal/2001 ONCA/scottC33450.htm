<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Roydon Kealey, sitting 
  with a jury, dated October&nbsp;22, 1999 and from the sentences imposed by Justice 
  Kealey dated December 10, 1999.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant Martineau submitted fresh evidence to establish 
  that the knife, which at trial was said to belong to Martineau, was in fact 
  the knife of the victim and had been dropped at the scene of the shooting by 
  the victim.  The Crown does not oppose the admission of the fresh evidence and 
  acknowledges that the appeal of Martineau should be allowed and Martineau should 
  receive a new trial.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown does not, however, concede that the fresh evidence 
  is admissible vis-à-vis Scott.  The Crown submits that the evidence fails to 
  meet the <i>Palmer</i> criteria (<i>R. v. Palmer</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 
  193 (S.C.C.)) in that it does not bear on a decisive issue at trial relative 
  to Scott and that it could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  
  We do not agree.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The theory of the Crown, which was repeated by the trial judge 
  in his instructions to the jury, was that there was a joint venture between 
  Martineau and Scott from the outset.  In fact, they were originally charged 
  jointly with attempted murder but Martineau was discharged on this count after 
  the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial the Crown led evidence of prior planning between Scott 
  and Martineau:  that Martineau was present when Scott telephoned the victim 
  and arranged to meet him to do a fictitious “job”, that they armed themselves 
  and proceeded together to the place where the attempt was made on the victim’s 
  life.  They acted in concert at the attempt on the victim’s life.  The only 
  difference in their participation was, to use the words of the Crown, “their 
  weapon of choice” – Scott chose a gun and Martineau the knife which is now the 
  subject of the fresh evidence application.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Furthermore, the <i>Palmer</i> test is not to be applied separately 
  to each appellant.  The evidence of the knife was admissible at trial and was 
  a piece of evidence that affected both appellants.  The fact that the fresh 
  evidence now adduced at this level relates to the true ownership of the knife 
  does not change its status as a piece of evidence affecting both appellants, 
  albeit one more than the other.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the two appellants are sufficiently bound together 
  by the theory of the Crown that it makes no sense to distinguish between them 
  with respect to ordering a new trial.  The Crown conceded that Martineau is 
  entitled to a new trial and, in our view, Scott is as well.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Martineau’s counsel argued that Martineau should 
  not face a new trial on the weapons charges but there is evidence of weapons 
  other than the knife and it is up to the Crown to determine if it wishes to 
  proceed on these charges at the new trial.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, the convictions 
  are set aside and a new trial is ordered for both appellants.</span></p>
