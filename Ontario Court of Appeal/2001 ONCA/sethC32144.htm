<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from conviction for manslaughter by a jury before 
  Justice N. Borkovich dated April&nbsp;29, 1999 and on appeal by the Crown from 
  a directed verdict of acquittal of first degree murder on April 26, 1999.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>FELDMAN J.A.:</span></b><span>                       </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Christian Bill, age 4 months, died in his crib 
  on May 10, 1996. The cause of death was asphyxia. Mr. Seth (the appellant) lived 
  with Christian and his 17 year old mother. The appellant was convicted of manslaughter 
  of Christian. He appeals his conviction and sentence of 15 years imprisonment. 
  The chief ground of appeal against conviction is unreasonable verdict. A second 
  ground relates to the trial judge's failure to provide the jury with the assistance 
  they requested during the course of their deliberations.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant was originally charged with first 
  degree murder and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The first degree murder 
  charge was based on the theory that the appellant sexually assaulted the baby 
  by putting his penis into the baby’s mouth or ejaculating into the baby’s mouth, 
  thereby causing death by asphyxiation, or smothering the baby with a pillow 
  during or immediately after sexually assaulting him, thereby causing death by 
  asphyxiation. The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on the first degree 
  murder charge and left with the jury the offence of manslaughter during the 
  commission of a sexual assault, and the included offence of sexual assault causing 
  bodily harm. The Crown appeals the directed verdict ruling, and seeks a retrial 
  on the first degree murder charge, but only in the event that the appellant’s 
  appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered on the manslaughter charge. The 
  Crown is otherwise content with the manslaughter verdict and a dismissal of 
  the appellant’s appeal.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>The new indictment against the appellant prepared by the Crown following 
  the directed verdict on first degree murder, upon which the appellant was convicted 
  of manslaughter, reads as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Larry William Seth stands charged: (1) That he on or about 
      the 10<sup>th</sup> day of May, 1996, at the City of Hamilton, in the Regional 
      Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth unlawfully did kill Christian Bill during 
      the commission of a sexual assault and thereby did commit manslaughter contrary 
      to Section 236(b) of the <u>Criminal Code of Canada</u>.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The theory of the Crown on the manslaughter 
  trial was that the appellant caused the infant to die by asphyxiation by putting 
  his penis into the baby’s mouth. The appellant’s position on the appeal is that 
  the verdict is unreasonable primarily because the evidence does not establish 
  such a sexual assault, an essential element of the offence as charged.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The narrative of the events of the evening of 
  May 9 and the morning of May 10 was the information given at trial by Nicole 
  Bill, Christian’s mother. The appellant did not testify. However, the information 
  that he provided to the ambulance personnel and the police on the scene was 
  led in evidence as part of the Crown's case and was consistent with Ms. Bill's 
  account.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill was 16 years old when Christian was 
  born on January 10, 1996. Christian’s father was Michael Marshall, with whom 
  Ms. Bill had had a relationship that ended several months before the birth. 
  She met the appellant in December, 1995 before giving birth to Christian. Ms. 
  Bill and Christian began living with the appellant in March, 1996 in an apartment. 
  The appellant’s friend, Damien Rice, lived in the attic. Mr. Rice spent the 
  night of May 9 at his girlfriend’s residence.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On May 9 Christian woke up at around 5:00 a.m. 
  Ms. Bill changed him and gave him a bottle then laid him back down. He was up 
  for some time in the morning. Ms. Bill lay with him on the pull-out couch in 
  the living room. He went back to sleep in his crib around 11:00 a.m. and awoke 
  at 1:00 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. Both the appellant and Mr. Rice came home about that 
  time. They had an argument, then left. Neither man did anything with Christian 
  at that time. Christian was either asleep or on the couch.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A friend, Stacey Boyer, then visited the apartment 
  at around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon and stayed until 4:00 or 5:00. Ms. Bill 
  fed Christian a jar of baby food and then breast fed him because he was cranky 
  most of the day. Ms. Boyer confirmed that Christian was cranky and that he was 
  in and out of the Jolly Jumper apparatus a fair amount.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant arrived home around 6:00 p.m. 
  and began preparing dinner as he had invited a friend, Jeffrey Lyon, for dinner. 
  Mr. Lyon spent an hour with them that evening. He said everyone was cheerful. 
  During that period, Ms. Bill said that the appellant changed the baby and gave 
  him another jar of baby food. The baby was in the Jolly Jumper during that period 
  and later. The appellant also had the baby with him on the couch. At around 
  10:00 p.m. he fed Christian another jar of baby food. He then got the baby ready 
  for bed. He took a radio into Christian’s room and danced around with him. Just 
  after 10:00 p.m. Ms. Bill gave the baby a kiss and went into the shower for 
  forty-five minutes to an hour. At that time she said that Christian seemed fine.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill did not check on Christian after her 
  shower because he was quiet. Around midnight or 12:30 a.m. Ms. Bill and the 
  appellant were in the living room, which was next to the baby’s bedroom. They 
  ordered an x-rated movie. During the movie, Christian began to fuss. Ms.&nbsp;Bill 
  attempted to go in to check on him but the appellant insisted that she lie down 
  and relax because she was not feeling well that day. The appellant went and 
  checked on the baby and reported that he was just being fussy, he did not want 
  his bottle and kept spitting it out. There was no evidence of what was in this 
  bottle.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant went to check on Christian a second 
  time when he cried, again telling Ms.&nbsp;Bill to relax. He went in a third 
  time with a bottle of water or sugar-water. This was about 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. 
  after the appellant and Ms. Bill had had intercourse. Ms. Bill did not know 
  if the appellant put his clothes on before preparing and taking in the bottle. 
  She said that as far as she knew, the appellant usually rinsed off his hands 
  before preparing a bottle for the baby.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill said that Christian carried on for 
  an hour or two and that the appellant went to him about four times for about 
  five or ten minutes each time. After that the baby quieted down for a while, 
  then started up again, then quieted down for the rest of the night.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill testified that after the movie was 
  over and she and the appellant had sex, they went to sleep at about 3:00 a.m. 
  In cross-examination, she agreed that she had told an officer at the time that 
  they also had sex before her shower and around midnight. She woke up about three 
  times during the night to change position, but did not hear the baby until around 
  6:00 a.m. when she heard him laughing and playing. Ms. Bill was asked whether 
  when she woke during the night she noticed the appellant there. She answered, 
  “mostly yes”, and that he slept beside her.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After waking at 6:00 a.m., she fell back to 
  sleep until 8:00 or 8:30 when the appellant got up to go to court for 9:00. 
  She observed the appellant get ready, go to the kitchen and eat some fruit, 
  then go into Christian’s room to check on him. She did not know how long he 
  was in the room but she saw him run out with something, which appeared to be 
  the baby’s pillow, and take it into the bedroom, after which he came into the 
  living room where she was on the pull-out couch. He told her that he had found 
  the pillow they kept in Christian’s room over the baby’s face, but the baby 
  was fine and still breathing. She then dozed back to sleep.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>She woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and went into 
  the bathroom then into the baby’s room. She determined that he was sleeping 
  but appeared to be alive; he was breathing, he was warm and his eyes were moving. 
  In cross-examination, she confirmed that she thoroughly checked the baby at 
  9:00 a.m., by feeling his face, feeling him breathe, putting her hand on his 
  chest and feeling it go up and down and observing his eyes moving beneath the 
  closed lids. Her habit was to check on him thoroughly. She did not see any foam 
  at that time as she did later at noon. She did not hear any sounds from him. 
  She let him sleep and she went back to sleep. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>She awoke at 10:00 a.m. when the appellant came 
  in. He had bought a bike and she went downstairs with him for five minutes to 
  look at it. She then went back upstairs to get some tools to adjust the seat 
  on the bike and brought them down. She was uncertain whether the appellant came 
  upstairs then. While she was upstairs she did not check on the baby and did 
  not hear him. She was downstairs for about ten minutes at that time. The appellant 
  was talking about getting a bike seat for the baby so they would not have to 
  take the stroller. As she came upstairs at about 10:30 a.m., the phone rang 
  and she answered it and talked to Stacey Boyer for about 15 minutes. Stacey 
  Boyer said that Ms. Bill sounded happy and cheerful during their conversation 
  and that they talked about taking their children out together to the park that 
  afternoon.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant then came upstairs and they had 
  sex again. After she and the appellant had sex, the appellant performed oral 
  sex on her. Ms. Bill said that it was not that unusual that the baby would sleep 
  in and she therefore believed that he was still sleeping. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>When she realized that it was near noon, she 
  became scared because Christian had not yet woken up. She then went in to check 
  on him. At the same time the appellant began to disassemble the VCR to return 
  it to Stacey Boyer who had asked for it to be returned. He did not wash himself. 
  The appellant had not been in the baby’s room since Ms. Bill had checked on 
  him at 9:00 a.m.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill found the baby with white foamy material 
  coming out from his nose and mouth. He was on his back with one arm beside him 
  and one up, his hands were in fists, and he was on top of his blankets. His 
  bottle was in the crib. He did not appear to be breathing and he was cold.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> She called the appellant.  The appellant came in, wearing only 
  a t-shirt, picked up the baby with his face against his chest, then took him 
  into the living room and tried to resuscitate him by putting his mouth over 
  Christian’s mouth and nose and breathing.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant also asked Ms. Bill to get the 
  baby’s inhalers which Christian had as a result of a diagnosis by his doctor 
  of asthma at age two months. She could only find one inhaler, she panicked and 
  the appellant told her to call 911. She called 911 and the operator kept her 
  on the phone until the ambulance and police arrived. She told the 911 operator 
  that she had last seen the baby at 9:00 a.m. and that he was fine at that time. 
  While she spoke to the operator, the appellant had moved the baby into the kitchen, 
  laid him on the table and was still trying to resuscitate him by giving him 
  mouth to mouth respiration and pushing on his chest. When the emergency personnel 
  arrived, the baby was taken in the ambulance right away and the appellant and 
  Ms. Bill were told to wait at home.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill responded to Crown counsel when asked, 
  that she did not put a pillow over the baby’s head or hurt his rectum, penis 
  or scrotum.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>P.C. O’Keefe was one of the police officers 
  who arrived in response to the 911 call. He observed the appellant giving artificial 
  respiration to the baby. The officer confirmed that both the appellant and Ms. 
  Bill were upset when he arrived. After the baby was taken away in the ambulance, 
  the officer interviewed the appellant and Ms. Bill. The appellant told the officer 
  that when he checked on the baby around 8:30 a.m., the pillow was over his face, 
  he removed it and felt the baby breathing by putting his finger under his nose. 
  The appellant brought the police the pillow from another room. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> P.C. Eldridge was with P.C. O’Keefe. She also observed the appellant 
  giving artificial respiration to the baby. The appellant was wearing a black 
  t-shirt and jeans. She confirmed the same content of the conversation with the 
  appellant and Ms. Bill after the baby was taken way. She said that they answered 
  the questions directly and told what happened.  The appellant said that when 
  they found the baby he removed some mucous from the baby’s mouth and administered 
  the puffer, but nothing happened, so he told Ms. Bill to call 911. He first 
  thought that he heard the baby breathe and he saw the chest exhale, then he 
  put his cheek to the baby’s head “but there was nothing”. He also volunteered 
  that he had taken a feather pillow from over the baby’s face but that the baby 
  was still breathing then. With respect to feeding, he said that the night before, 
  the baby had had a bottle of water, a bottle of milk and some applesauce.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Lydia Amos was one of the paramedics who arrived 
  in the ambulance. Ms. Amos had 18 years experience as a paramedic as well as 
  initial training and continuing upgrade courses. She gave evidence about suctioning 
  the baby. She found foreign matter in the baby’s mouth which she assumed was 
  formula. She suctioned the baby’s mouth out and discarded all the suctioned 
  material and the tubing used to extract it. She testified that if a person does 
  CPR incorrectly, the contents of the person’s mouth can end up in the baby’s 
  stomach.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Michelle Barton was Christian’s family physician. 
  She last saw him on March 21. He had had a cough for about a week. She said 
  that at the time she felt that a future diagnosis of asthma was possible, but 
  the illness was more likely viral. She prescribed two inhaled medications or 
  puffers for the baby on March 21.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Several medical witnesses who examined the baby 
  at the hospital gave evidence. Denise Turcotte was a registered nurse who worked 
  in the emergency room on May 10 when the baby was brought in. One of the things 
  she did was take the baby’s temperature with a rectal probe. She described undoing 
  the baby’s diaper and noting some soft stool there. She gently put the probe 
  in for a few seconds then removed it. She did not have a clear view of the rectum. 
  She denied doing any injury to the rectum, but acknowledged that she did not 
  see the rectum after doing the probe.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Keith Kelder was qualified in this case to testify 
  as an expert and give opinion evidence with respect to the examination and analysis 
  of blood, other bodily fluids and tissue. He examined various items supplied 
  to him by the police in this case. He examined these items looking for spermatozoa.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>He found two sperm on the nasal swab taken from 
  the baby’s right nostril. He examined two samples of the stomach contents and 
  found one sperm that he could identify positively, three that were suggestive 
  and four possibilities, for a maximum total of eight, minimum of one. He also 
  said that sperm could be “hiding” behind food particles. He also found what 
  he described as “very, very few” sperm on the baby’s sleeper, two or three on 
  one location and three definite ones at another location. He found sperm, again 
  very few in number, three definite and as many as six, on the nipple of the 
  baby bottle found in the crib.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the pillow from the baby’s room, Mr. Kelder 
  was looking for semen and saliva mixed together, and in particular, the appellant’s 
  semen and the baby’s saliva, because of the allegations in this case. He located 
  spermatozoa in one location in larger numbers than on the previously described 
  items. He also found saliva on the pillow, but no saliva and semen together.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Kelder did not find semen on the following items from the 
  baby which were tested: the anal swab; the oral swab; oral tubing; and, the 
  left nostril tubing.  He also did not find semen on the following other items: 
  four blankets from the crib; a comforter from a mattress on the floor of the 
  baby’s room; a piece of carpet; and, a second baby bottle from the baby’s room.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Kelder also tested other items for saliva. 
  One item was the fly area of the appellant’s jeans. The test was positive for 
  saliva both on the inside and outside of the fly area. There was also a spot 
  where he found both saliva and semen. On the appellant’s t-shirt, Mr. Kelder 
  found semen and saliva spots separately and semen together with saliva.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Kelder was then asked about how sperm can 
  get to be in various places. First he was asked about stomach contents. He said 
  sperm can get there in two ways: first by sexual transfer either by ejaculation 
  in the mouth or by insertion of the penis after some prior sexual act where 
  a quantity of semen remains on the penis. The other is a secondary or intermediary 
  process, where for example, a person has liquid semen on the hand then touches 
  something like the nipple of a baby bottle.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel asked the witness hypothetically, 
  if a man has sexual intercourse with a woman then performs oral sex on her, 
  then within a few moments conducts CPR on a baby, whether there can be secondary 
  transference of spermatozoa. Mr. Kelder said it could be deposited both externally 
  and internally in the mouth area of the baby. He also said that there could 
  be a transfer of sperm from the stomach to the nostril in vomit. Also, if there 
  was a significant number of sperm on the nipple of a bottle and the nipple is 
  placed in the mouth, sperm could travel to the mouth and from there could be 
  swallowed and go into the stomach.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the stain on the baby’s sleeper, 
  Mr. Kelder gave the opinion that it appeared to have been smeared on by contact. 
  His opinion with respect to the semen stains on the appellant’s t-shirt was 
  that some appeared to be smeared on, but in the chest area by the logo there 
  were a number of circular stains that suggested that the semen was deposited 
  in a projected fashion.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Kelder was also asked to estimate the sperm 
  count of an average male per ejaculate. He answered that there are 300 million 
  spermatozoa per three millilitres ejaculate, which is the average, so that the 
  average density is one million per millilitre. This can be affected by infertility. 
  (There was evidence that the appellant has two of his own children.) The count 
  can also be depressed when there is frequent ejaculation, but that cannot be 
  determined without a measurement.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Kelder elaborated in cross-examination that 
  there are twenty drops of ejaculate in one millilitre and therefore 60 drops 
  in three millilitres. A single drop of ejaculate can contain 5 million sperm. 
  Therefore hypothetically if there was ejaculation into the baby’s mouth and 
  he swallowed five drops, there would be twenty-five million sperm. Mr. Kelder 
  concluded that based on that hypothetical and with the qualification of no significant 
  degradation of the sperm or reduction by digestion, through excrement or vomit, 
  “one would expect more” than the one to eight sperm found in the sixteen or 
  seventeen percent of Christian’s stomach contents which were examined. He agreed 
  that there would be 25 million sperm in the stomach at the outset, rather than 
  50.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the spots on the sleeper, Mr. 
  Kelder agreed that they contained a few yeast cells. He also agreed that these 
  can be found as part of a woman’s vaginal infection, or from baker’s yeast.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Because the semen on the sleeper was a smear 
  it could have got there from rubbing against wet semen on the appellant’s t-shirt. 
  In the same way, the sperm on the pillow was also a smear and could have got 
  there from rubbing against wet semen from other material or from a hand. Dry 
  sperm can also be transferred. Also, the pillow case was dirty. Mr. Kelder said 
  that one cannot tell the age of a semen stain on fabric because it does not 
  degrade on cloth.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Kelder agreed that if a man and woman had 
  intercourse, then he performed oral sex on her, that it was possible the man 
  could have some sperm in his mouth, and that some semen could be transferred 
  into the child’s mouth during artificial respiration. He stated however that 
  it was not likely that during the artificial respiration some sperm could have 
  gone from the mouth into the stomach.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Pamela Newall was qualified as an expert to give opinion evidence 
  with respect to DNA.  She was provided with blood samples from the baby, the 
  mother, the appellant and Mr. Rice.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Newall examined samples provided to her 
  from the appellant’s jeans. The first was a semen-saliva sample from the inside 
  of the fly area. She explained that they separate the two component parts of 
  the mixed sample, allowing them to purify the DNA from the sexual partner in 
  the “epithelial fraction” and the DNA from the sperm in the “sperm fraction”. 
  On the sample from the inside of the fly, labeled X1, the epithelial fraction 
  was a mixture of Ms. Bill and the appellant, while the sperm fraction matched 
  the DNA profile of the appellant.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The second stain on the jeans, X2, was a saliva 
  stain. The dominant DNA profile from that was the appellant's, while Ms. Bill 
  could not be excluded as the secondary profile for that stain. She did not identify 
  Christian’s DNA on either stain.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There was a semen-saliva stain on the t-shirt. 
  From the epithelial fraction they found a mixture of DNA. The dominant profile 
  was from Ms. Bill. Neither Christian nor the appellant could be excluded as 
  contributors to the secondary profile. The “sperm fraction” was from the appellant.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There were two semen stains on the sleeper. 
  On the epithelial fraction there was a mixture of DNA, the dominant profile 
  was from Christian, with neither the appellant nor Nicole Bill being excluded 
  as contributors to the secondary profile. The dominant DNA profile in the sperm 
  fraction was from the appellant. Christian could not be excluded as a contributor 
  to one of the sperm fractions which had mixed DNA. The other one was only the 
  appellant's.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Newall testified that there were not enough 
  sperm on the nasal swab or they were not of sufficient quality to do a profile. 
  Nor were they able to do a profile on the sperm in the stomach contents. In 
  cross-examination, Ms. Newall said that they need more than 100 good quality 
  sperm in order to generate a profile.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Newall was asked what could contribute to 
  the epithelial mixture. She mentioned it could be saliva, vaginal secretions, 
  nasal secretion and blood. Therefore dealing with the t-shirt where the dominant 
  profile in the epithelial fraction was from Ms. Bill, because the stain was 
  saliva and semen, it was a reasonable conclusion that there was DNA from saliva 
  in the epithelial fraction. The stain was not tested for vaginal secretions 
  as there is no test for that. </span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Newall agreed that it was not surprising 
  that the epithelial fraction of the stain on the sleeper was from Christian 
  since he could have dribbled on it. The reason that Christian’s DNA is in the 
  sperm fraction is because there is epithelial material in the sperm fraction.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao was qualified as a forensic pathologist. 
  She performed the post-mortem examination and autopsy on Christian Bill. She 
  gave the opinion that the cause of Christian’s death was asphyxia. The Crown 
  then proposed three hypothetical situations to address the possible manner of 
  asphyxiation. The first was whether asphyxia and death could be caused by a 
  man ejaculating into the baby’s mouth. She responded yes, as a result of ejaculation 
  the child could choke or gag and die. The second was whether death by asphyxia 
  could occur after a man inserted his penis into the baby’s mouth after sexual 
  activity where a quantity of semen remained on the penis, but without ejaculation 
  into the mouth. Dr. Rao responded yes, this could cause gagging or choking and 
  death. The third hypothetical was whether a child could die from asphyxia if 
  the baby’s pillow, which weighed over five pounds, was over the baby’s face. 
  Dr.&nbsp;Rao answered yes, because it would prevent air from entering through 
  the nose and mouth which could cause asphyxia and death. Dr. Rao also gave the 
  opinion that with a four month old baby, “once some asphyxia mode takes place, 
  normally the heart starts slowing down in thirty seconds and the electrical 
  waves passing through the brain would go flat in 90 seconds and then [the] child 
  can die by two minutes.”</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao gave evidence regarding her observations, 
  findings and opinions resulting from the autopsy she did on Christian. She said 
  that the baby appeared well-nourished and well-developed with no trauma to the 
  trunk area. She found the diaper with soft feces in it, as expected with a four-month 
  old child. On the genital area there was an abrasion on the under-surface of 
  the penis and another on the scrotal sack just below the base of the penis. 
  There were also superficial abrasions on the upper margin of the anal orifice. 
  Dr. Rao described it as “a thin sort of bruising”, and gave the opinion that 
  the injury occurred between zero to four or six hours before death.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Bill had given evidence that Christian had 
  had a hard stool with blood in it about three or four days before May 10, and 
  that she had planned to call the doctor about it. Dr. Rao was asked if the injury 
  to the anus could be caused by hard stool. She said it was a possibility that 
  is always included as part of a differential diagnosis, but that in a child 
  of four months who is on milk, one would not expect hard stool even if there 
  is constipation.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>She was asked her opinion of what might have 
  caused the internal injury to the rectum. She said it represented blunt force 
  injury, consistent with some blunt object being introduced.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the abrasions on the under side 
  of the penis and scrotum, Dr.&nbsp;Rao’s opinion was that they were also made 
  between zero and four or six hours before death. She also said as to the cause 
  that “[i]t implies that there’s been a rubbing action or fondling by hand.”</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao examined the inside of the baby’s mouth 
  and found no fresh injury. She found evidence of vomitus in the form of sticky, 
  slimy, whitish material. She saw no fresh injury to the neck, the trunk, the 
  arms or the legs. There was mild swelling of the brain in response to the asphyxia.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao measured and examined the contents of 
  the baby’s stomach. She concluded from the curdled milk in the stomach that 
  the baby died roughly within two hours after feeding. Most of the milk or water 
  taken by a baby leaves the stomach within an hour. In cross-examination, she 
  confirmed that the time estimate was approximate.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally in her examination-in-chief, after confirming 
  that she found that the baby was healthy, Dr. Rao was asked about the normal 
  reaction of a healthy baby of that age range who is choking or gagging. She 
  responded that: “One of the responses, they have due to gag reflex, they would 
  start vomiting and in the process of vomiting, they can inhale some of the vomitus 
  into the air passages.”</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In cross-examination Dr. Rao acknowledged a 
  protocol from the Deputy Chief Coroner titled “Protocol for the Investigation 
  of Sudden and Unexpected Deaths in Children Under 2 Years of Age”, which states: 
  “Unfortunately, in this day and age child abuse is a real issue and it is extremely 
  important that all members of the investigative team ‘think dirty’.” She confirmed 
  that as a member of the investigative team, she was to treat every case of a 
  death of a child under two years of age as a case of potential child abuse.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the abrasions on the penis, 
  scrotum and anus, Dr. Rao agreed that they could have been older than six hours 
  before death, but in her opinion, twelve hours was too long. She agreed that 
  the abrasions to the penis, rectum, and scrotum played no role in the baby’s 
  death, but stated that they were abnormal findings. She also agreed that the 
  abrasions could have been caused by rubbing with rough clothing if there was 
  such contact.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao took an oral swab of white slimy material 
  in the baby’s mouth and found no sperm in it, nor was there pubic hair in the 
  mouth. Dr. Rao also submitted the endotrachial tube that was down the baby’s 
  windpipe for analysis. There was no sperm on it. There was no bruising on the 
  inside of the mouth, the lips, the gums, or under the skin at the back of the 
  head. The latter spot was examined because of the possibility of smothering 
  and the theory that the baby’s head may have been held face down on the pillow, 
  although Dr. Rao stated that bruising is rarely found and is not essential where 
  the head is just held down with an open hand. There was also no bruising on 
  the “hand-hold sites”, which on a baby are places one might grab such as around 
  the chest and arms.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao was asked about the diagnosis known 
  as S.I.D.S., “sudden infant death syndrome”, which Dr. Rao said is the second 
  most common cause of death of children under one year next to natural disease. 
  She agreed that choking or smothering cannot be distinguished from S.I.D.S. 
  on a negative autopsy. She discussed some of the theories explaining S.I.D.S. 
  One is a re-inhalation of carbon dioxide during a long period of apnea. The 
  breathing cycle of the child is affected, the gas exchange does not take place 
  resulting in a form of asphyxia. A second theory of what happens in a S.I.D.S. 
  death is obligate nose breathing causing asphyxia. The child only uses the nose 
  to breathe, then gets an infection and dies. Dr. Rao agreed that common to all 
  theories is that something affects the child’s breathing and it dies.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Another label that is used when a child dies 
  is S.U.D.S. referring to “sudden unexplained death” or “sudden unexpected death”. 
  Dr. Rao agreed that a death is called S.U.D.S. when it looks like S.I.D.S. but 
  there are suspicious circumstances. In this case, S.U.D.S. was Dr.&nbsp;Rao’s 
  provisional diagnosis at the end of the autopsy. After she had all of the biology 
  reports, her report stated the cause of death as “undetermined” and raised various 
  possible mechanisms of death as follows: ejaculation into the baby’s mouth; 
  choking from a penis in the mouth; and, smothering. The injury to the penis 
  and scrotum and a positive biology report led her to exclude S.I.D.S. as a possibility. 
  However, she acknowledged that she could not rule out whatever “x” factor causes 
  S.I.D.S., as the cause of the asphyxia in this case. Dr. Rao agreed that Christian 
  was in risk of S.I.D.S. because of the following risk factors: the high risk 
  age group (3 – 6 months); parents who smoke; smoking during pregnancy; and, 
  lower socio-economic circumstances.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao also said at the preliminary hearing 
  that where there is a previous history of asthma, an individual can die suddenly 
  and post-mortem examination may not show anything. She qualified that opinion 
  at the trial by saying there should be some evidence of broncho spasm which 
  is the reason for death, and one will see mucous plugging.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Rao was asked whether it was possible that 
  a healthy child could vomit or spit up something from the stomach which then 
  goes into the lungs. She responded that “[i]t can happen, but normally a healthy 
  child do [sic] not die due to that.” She said that there would be some underlying 
  reason such as the person is under the effect of alcohol or drugs or has a degenerative 
  disease. She said that the possibility of this happening in a healthy baby is 
  unlikely but she could not absolutely rule it out. She said that of her theories 
  of how the baby died of asphyxia, S.I.D.S. was the least likely.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The last witness, who was another expert called 
  by the Crown, was Dr. Kenneth Finkel who was qualified to give expert evidence 
  as a paediatrician. He was asked about the mobility of a baby of four months. 
  He said that a baby of that age can roll over once but not across the room. 
  He can move his head from side to side. A baby of that age cannot usually deliberately 
  reach out and grasp something. He said that whether a baby could pull a five 
  pound pillow over its face would depend on the position of the pillow in relation 
  to the baby. If the pillow were over the baby’s face and arms, the baby would 
  be able to budge the pillow a bit with the arms. In cross-examination he also 
  postulated that with the pillow in a certain position, the baby could roll from 
  front to back against it and the pillow might fall.</span></p>

      transitory in the context of a dangerous act. The judge therefore concluded

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After submissions by counsel with respect to 
  the jury charge, the trial judge ruled that as the Crown was alleging manslaughter 
  caused by sexual assault by insertion of the appellant’s penis into the baby’s 
  mouth, the included offence of sexual assault had to involve that assault and 
  could not consist only of interference with the baby’s anus, penis and scrotum. 
  The evidence respecting those areas was alleged by the Crown to be part of the 
  sexual assault on the mouth, but not a cause of the death and therefore taken 
  alone, could not constitute the included offence alleged by the Crown. As a 
  result, the Crown drew a new indictment charging manslaughter by sexual assault 
  and the jury was instructed in accordance with the ruling. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At the conclusion of his charge to the jury 
  the trial judge made some comments on the evidence and on the strength of the 
  Crown’s case, a practice normally reserved for rare circumstances. He pointed 
  out to the jury that Ms. Bill was consistent in her evidence that the baby was 
  alive at 9:00 a.m. as she told the 911 operator the same thing. The audio of 
  that call, which they heard, demonstrated that she was hysterical when talking 
  to the 911 operator after finding the baby cold, pale and with white foam on 
  his nose and mouth at noon. The trial judge told the jury that if they accepted 
  her evidence that the baby was still alive at 9:00 a.m., or had a reasonable 
  doubt about it, then the Crown would have failed to establish that the death 
  occurred earlier when the appellant had the opportunity to commit the offence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also reviewed the consistent 
  evidence of numerous witnesses that the baby had white material on and in his 
  nose and mouth and that he had vomited. He stated that it appeared logical on 
  the evidence that the child’s airway was obstructed by vomit. He referred to 
  Dr. Rao’s evidence of the directive to “think dirty”, and instructed the jury 
  that it was their duty to consider the evidence objectively and to be impartial. 
  He instructed the jury to question whether a scientist could maintain impartiality 
  and objectivity if instructed by a superior to “think dirty”. Given that there 
  was evidence that death was caused by regurgitation leading to airway obstruction 
  and asphyxia, he raised the issue of whether Dr. Rao’s opinion that that was 
  unlikely was tainted by the “think dirty” admonition. Finally he stated that 
  it was his view that on the evidence there was a reasonable doubt as to whether 
  the death was a homicide.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The jury deliberated over a period of three 
  days and asked 10 questions. The first request was for the entire transcript 
  of the evidence and of the judge’s charge. In response, the trial judge explained 
  that the whole transcript was not available, but that they could ask for particular 
  portions and then he, the reporter and counsel would get together “to see if 
  we can get that evidence for you.” Shortly thereafter they came back with four 
  questions, one of which was a request for an overview of Ms. Bill’s testimony 
  of the sequence of events. Counsel agreed that the judge should not give a sequence 
  of events and that either the entirety of Ms. Bill’s evidence should be played 
  back or none of it. The trial judge told the jury that the only way to give 
  an overview of Ms. Bill’s testimony of the sequence of events was to play back 
  the total transcript of her testimony, and then he said: “but certainly that 
  is part of your function, for all of you to remember what the evidence was and 
  it’s for you to decide what the sequence of events were.” Although the jury 
  asked further questions, they did not ask again for Ms. Bill’s evidence. The 
  second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by failing to answer this 
  question from the jury and refusing to assist them with this crucial evidence.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the morning of the third day of deliberations 
  the jury asked for a repetition of the judge’s charge, together with the following 
  two questions: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>“If there is a belief that the baby died by another means 
      other than 1. Penis in the mouth, 2. Penis ejaculating in the mouth (Crown),

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2><span lang=EN-US>In response the judge repeated certain 
  parts of the charge to the jury and instructed them that to convict they must 
  be satisfied that one of the two methods of sexual assault occurred and resulted

  that they could not speculate.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The test that a court on appeal is to apply 
  when considering whether a verdict of guilty </span>ought to be set aside as 
  unreasonable has been considered and explained in two decisions of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada, <i>R. v. Yebes </i>(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 and most recently 
  <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1. The test, “whether the verdict 
  is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have 
  rendered,” has both objective and subjective components which involve the appeal 
  court in a limited reweighing of the evidence.  The issue is not whether the 
  verdict was possible, but whether it was reasonably available on the evidence: 
  (<i>Yebes</i> at p. 430). In <i>Biniaris</i>, Arbour J. explained that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>. . . [A]cting judicially means not only acting dispassionately, 
      applying the law and adjudicating on the basis of the record and nothing 
      else. It means, in addition, arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict 
      with the bulk of judicial experience. This, in my view, is the assessment 
      that must be made by the reviewing court. It requires not merely asking 
      whether twelve properly instructed jurors, acting judicially, could reasonably 
      have come to the same result, but doing so through the lens of judicial 
      experience which serves as an additional protection against an unwarranted 
      conviction. (p. 23-4)</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Arbour J. concluded with the following summary of the method 
  by which a court on appeal is to proceed when considering the issue of unreasonable 
  verdict:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span> </span>. . . [T]he test in <i>Yebes</i> continues to be the binding 
      test that appellate courts must apply in determining whether the verdict 
      of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. To the 
      extent that it has a subjective component, it is the subjective assessment 
      of an assessor with judicial training and experience that must be brought 
      to bear on the exercise of reviewing the evidence upon which an allegedly 
      unreasonable conviction rests. That, in turn, requires the reviewing judge 
      to import his or her knowledge of the law and the expertise of the courts, 
      gained through the judicial process over the years, not simply his or her 
      own personal experience and insight. It also requires that the reviewing 
      court articulate as explicitly and as precisely as possible the grounds 
      for its intervention. I wish to stress the importance of explicitness in 
      the articulation of the reasons that support a finding that a verdict is 
      unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Particularly since 
      this amounts to a question of law that may give rise to an appeal, either 
      as of right or by leave, the judicial process requires clarity and transparency 
      as well as accessibility to the legal reasoning of the court of appeal. 
      When there is a dissent in the court of appeal on the issue of the reasonableness 
      of the verdict both the spirit and the letter of s. 677 of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i> should be complied with. This Court should be supplied with the 
      grounds upon which the verdict was found to be, or not to be, unreasonable.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The basis for the Crown’s case after the directed 
  verdict of acquittal of first degree murder, and for the conclusion of Dr. Rao 
  that she believed that the cause of the asphyxiation of the baby was a sexual 
  assault, was the finding of some sperm in and around the baby, together with 
  the evidence of some injury to the anus, penis and scrotum. It was acknowledged, 
  however, that these latter injuries did not cause or contribute to the death. 
  The precise sexual assault that was alleged to be the cause of the baby’s asphyxiation 
  was either ejaculation into the baby’s mouth or placing the penis with sperm 
  on it into the baby’s mouth. The particular sexual assault alleged was one of 
  the essential elements that the Crown was required to prove beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. It is the conclusion that that sexual assault occurred which is the basis 
  of the appellant’s submission that the verdict on the manslaughter indictment 
  is an unreasonable one.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The entire case was based on circumstantial 
  evidence, including the basis of the expert opinion as to the likely cause of 
  death by asphyxiation. There was no finding of any lesions in or on the mouth 
  or face suggestive of an assault on that area, nor anything on the trunk, neck, 
  arms or legs. Neither sperm nor pubic hair were found in the baby’s mouth or 
  on his face. The only physical evidence consistent with a penis having been 
  inserted into the baby’s mouth was the limited findings of sperm in the stomach, 
  on the nipple, the sleeper and the pillow. Because Dr.&nbsp;Rao could not exclude 
  asphyxiation by regurgitation, she could not give a conclusive opinion, based 
  on her findings, as to the cause of the asphyxiation.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In a case which is based wholly on circumstantial 
  evidence, the finding of guilt must be founded on the conclusion that “there 
  was no other rational explanation for the circumstantial evidence but that the 
  defendant committed the crime.” (<i>R. v. Charemski</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679 
  at para. 13) Although a jury need not be instructed precisely in those terms, 
  the circumstantial evidence must amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  Therefore, if there is another rational explanation that accounts for the death 
  and is consistent with the evidence, then the case has not been proved beyond 
  a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s position is that there is an 
  obvious explanation, which is inconsistent with manslaughter, for the presence 
  of the very limited number of sperm found in and around the baby. The appellant 
  argues that, given that the appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse with 
  Ms. Bill more than once during the night in question, and had checked on the 
  baby several times, possibly naked, and without showering, and given that after 
  intercourse followed by oral sex on Ms. Bill, the appellant gave mouth to mouth 
  and nose artificial respiration to the baby, the presence of a small number 
  of sperm is explained. The appellant argues further that the number found is 
  not consistent with ejaculation, nor is it consistent with insertion of a penis 
  covered with sperm into the baby’s mouth. However, the number of sperm found 
  is consistent with the appellant touching and tending to the baby during the 
  night while having ongoing sexual intercourse and later oral sexual relations 
  with Ms. Bill, and later giving the baby mouth to mouth and nose artificial 
  respiration.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Based on <i>Yebes</i> and <i>Biniaris</i>, it 
  would be open for this court to consider the evidence as a whole and to some 
  extent reweigh the evidence according to accepted legal principles and based 
  on judicial experience and, if satisfied, to give effect to the appellant's 
  submission.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However, in my view, it would be an error for 
  this court to limit its analysis to the evidence which was left with the jury, 
  which excluded the evidence regarding the pillow. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In view of the trial judge’s finding on the motion for a directed 
  verdict that there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that 
  the pillow was used to smother the child and cause his death, the jury was left 
  with only the two possible means of causing the infant’s death during the course 
  of a sexual assault by the appellant: (a) ejaculation into the baby’s mouth; 
  or (b) by insertion of his penis into the baby’s mouth causing the baby to choke. 
  However, in responding to the appellant’s appeal from conviction, it is open 
  to the Crown to advance any argument that it advanced at trial to sustain the 
  verdict: see <i>Perka v. The Queen</i> (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 391 (S.C.C.). 
  Hence, it is open to the Crown to argue that the trial judge erred in directing 
  the jury to disregard the evidence of the pillow and to remove smothering by 
  the pillow as a means of causing the death in the new indictment, and that a 
  properly instructed jury could find on the evidence that a third possible means 
  by which the appellant could have caused the death was by smothering the baby 
  with a pillow during the course of committing a sexual assault on the baby’s 
  genital area.  (I note that in his submissions to the trial judge on the directed 
  verdict motion, Crown counsel at trial abandoned any argument that the appellant 
  smothered the baby with the pillow without committing a sexual assault.)</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view there was no basis to exclude the 
  evidence of the pillow and it was an error for the trial judge to do so. The 
  jury heard evidence both from Ms. Bill and from the police officers recounting 
  what the appellant had told them: that he had found a pillow over the baby’s 
  face at 8:30 a.m., he removed it and confirmed that the baby was still breathing 
  at that time. The pillow evidence was part of the sequence of events that occurred 
  that evening, and therefore formed part of the context for all the other evidence 
  that the jury heard. It was clearly relevant, particularly where the theory 
  of the Crown and of the expert evidence was that smothering by a pillow was 
  a possible cause of the asphyxiation. The smothering could have been deliberate 
  or accidental, based on the evidence of Dr. Finkel. Hence this evidence should 
  have been left for the jury to consider as a basis for conviction or possible 
  acquittal.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It follows that any consideration of whether 
  the verdict was an unreasonable one can only be undertaken on the basis of all 
  the evidence and on the basis of an indictment and instructions thereon which 
  left open for the jury the three methods or means of causing the death and not 
  just the sexual assault. On that basis, in my view, it cannot be said that the 
  verdict was unreasonable. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The jury’s question focused on the sequence 
  of events which was provided solely by Ms.&nbsp;Bill in her testimony. The trial 
  judge had just finished instructing the jury that he believed the evidence raised 
  a reasonable doubt and focused on the time of death based on the evidence of 
  Ms. Bill that the baby was alive at 9:00 a.m.. The sequence of events was critical 
  in terms not only of the appellant’s opportunity to commit the offence, but 
  in order to assess that opportunity within the context of the expert evidence 
  of the cause of death.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits that the trial judge erred 
  by directing a verdict of acquittal on the charge of first degree murder. The 
  Crown submits that the trial judge erred in holding that there was no evidence 
  of intent for murder, and submits that there was some evidence on each element 
  of the offence to be proven. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown also submits that the trial judge 
  erred in law by applying the wrong test on a directed verdict by weighing the 
  evidence, a function reserved for the jury. The trial judge instructed himself 
  in the following way as to the legal test to apply on a directed verdict:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>On a motion for directed verdict of acquittal, the issue 
      to be determined is whether the case should go to the jury or should verdicts 
      of acquittal be directed. The test to be applied is that set out in <i>U.S.A. 
      v. Shephard</i>, that is, whether or not there is any evidence before me 
      that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a verdict of guilty.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Crown's case is based on circumstantial evidence.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In the case of <i>Monteleone v. The Queen</i>, 35 C.C.C. 
      (3d) at page 198, The Supreme Court of Canada sets out the basis upon which 
      a trial judge may determine,</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Whether there is before the Court any admissible 
      evidence, whether direct or circumstantial which, if believed, by a properly 
      charged jury acting reasonably, would justify a conviction, the trial judge 
      is not justified in directing a verdict of acquittal. It is not the function 
      of the trial judge to weigh the evidence, to test its quality or reliability 
      once a determination of its admissibility has been made. It is not for the 
      trial judge to draw inferences of fact from the evidence before him. These 
      functions are for the triers of fact, the jury.&quot;</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In the case of <i>Charemski v. The Queen</i>, 123 C.C.C. 
      (3d) 229, Bastarache J. states as follows:</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>&quot;For there to be 'evidence upon which a reasonable 
      jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty' in accordance 
      with the <i>Shephard</i> test, the Crown must adduce some evidence of culpability 
      for each essential element of the crime for which the Crown has the evidential 
      burden. Thus, in a murder prosecution, the Crown must adduce evidence on 
      issues of identity, causation, the death of the victim and a requisite mental 
      state. If the Crown fails to adduce any evidence to discharge the evidential 
      burden on any of these issues, the trial judge should direct a verdict of 
      acquittal.&quot;</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Further on page 236, McLachlin, J. elucidates further 
      as follows:</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>&quot;A properly instructed jury acting reasonably, is 
      a jury that will convict only if it finds that the evidence establishes 
      guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To determine whether this could occur, 
      a judge on the motion for a directed verdict must ask whether some or all 
      of the admissible evidence is legally sufficient to permit the jury to find 
      guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In so doing, the trial judge is determining 
      the sufficiency of the evidence. The question is whether the evidence is 
      capable of supporting a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If it 
      is not, the trial judge must direct an acquittal, since it would be impossible 
      for a reasonable jury to convict legally on the evidence.&quot;</span></p>

<p> <span lang=EN-US>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge quoted the correct test from 
  <i>R. v. Monteleone</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 154, and from the reasons of Bastarache 
  J. in <i>R. v. Charemski</i>. He went on to quote from the dissenting reasons 
  of McLachlin J. in that case. He made no error in doing so. In that portion 
  of the reasons, McLachlin J. was referring not to a process of weighing the 
  evidence, such as considering its credibility or reliability or the drawing 
  of inferences, but of testing its legal sufficiency to permit a jury to be satisfied 
  of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In any event, in making his findings, the trial 
  judge found there was “no evidence” upon which a jury could reasonably find 
  the pillow was used to smother the child and cause his death, and that there 
  was “no evidence” upon which a jury could reasonably find that the appellant 
  meant to cause the death of the baby or to cause him bodily harm that he knew 
  was likely to cause death and reckless whether death ensued or not. In other 
  words, in respect of the findings he made which underpinned the directed verdict 
  on first degree murder, the trial judge demonstrated that he was applying the 
  correct test.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Consequently, the issue before this court is 
  not the articulation of the test but its application. Did the trial judge err 
  in his conclusions with respect to the existence or sufficiency of the evidence, 
  first on the smothering issue, and second on the issue of intent?</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The original charge in the indictment against 
  the appellant was first degree murder. The Crown argued as its primary basis 
  that there was some evidence of sexual assault by the appellant putting his 
  penis into the baby's mouth or ejaculating into his mouth, and that there was 
  sufficient evidence of the required intent to kill for the charge of first degree 
  murder on that theory to go to the jury. The trial judge accepted, based on 
  the legal test as he set it out, that there was sufficient evidence of the sexual 
  assault by the penis to leave that issue for the jury, but that there was no 
  evidence that the appellant intended to kill the baby.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The Crown's second theory was that the appellant 
  smothered the baby with the pillow. It was not the Crown’s position for first 
  degree murder that there was evidence of planning and deliberation. Rather, 
  the position of the Crown was that the appellant smothered the baby during or 
  after sexually assaulting him (s. 231(5)(b)). Crown counsel made this position 
  clear in his submissions to the trial judge on the directed verdict motion.</p>

      assault on the baby's anus, scrotum and penis. Dr. Rao first said that the 
      freshness of the injuries suggested that they occurred within zero to 4 
      or 6 hours of the baby’s death. In cross-examination she agreed that they 
      could have been several hours older.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant attended to the baby several

      baby was crying and fussing.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Based on the stomach contents, the baby 
      would have died within 2 hours of his last feeding of milk, which would 
      put the death sometime during the night as the last feeding of milk was 
      either the night before or on one of the occasions when the appellant went 
      in before the baby finally did not cry anymore after about 3:00&nbsp;a.m.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At 8:30 a.m., the appellant emerged from 
      the baby’s room with the baby’s large pillow that weighed more than five 
      pounds and said that he had found it over the baby’s face but that the baby 
      was still breathing.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At four months old the baby could not have 
      grabbed the pillow, although he might have been able to pull it over him 
      depending on its position or fall against it and knock it over if it had 
      been leaning upright.</span></p>

<p> <span lang=EN-US>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It would also be open to the jury to consider 
  the appellant’s conduct with the pillow at 8:30 a.m. as incriminating after 
  the fact conduct, if they accepted that the baby was already dead at that time. 
  If the baby was dead and the appellant knew it, then his statement to Ms. Bill 
  that he found the pillow on the baby’s face and that the baby was still breathing 
  could be viewed as an attempt to set up an innocent explanation for when the 
  baby was later found dead by asphyxiation.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>In my view, taking the listed points together, it cannot be said that 
  there is no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that the appellant 
  used the pillow to smother the child and did so with the necessary intent to 
  kill or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless 
  whether death ensued or not.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>In the same way, if the appellant committed a sexual assault on the 
  baby by inserting his penis in the baby's mouth, it cannot be said that there 
  is no evidence that he did so with the necessary intent to kill or cause bodily 
  harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued 
  or not. It was open to the jury to conclude on the evidence that the natural 
  consequence of that act was that the baby may not be able to breath or may choke. 
  The jury was entitled to infer that the appellant intended that consequence.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  Further, if the jury did not accept that before or while the appellant smothered 
  the baby with the pillow, he sexually assaulted him, but did find that the appellant 
  placed the pillow over the baby’s face to stop him from crying, it would be 
  open to them to find that he meant to cause death or that he meant to cause 
  the baby bodily harm and was reckless whether death ensued and therefore to 
  convict the appellant of second degree murder. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>

  <span
lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that this court is in as good position as a future 
  jury to assess the reasonableness of a verdict on a charge of first degree murder 
  based on the record before it. All of the evidence that would be before that 
  jury has been led and the appellant was put to his election. The appellant submits 
  both that the directed verdict did not amount to a substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice and that a verdict on first degree murder would be an unreasonable 
  one. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[105]<span

  <span
lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Collins and Pelfrey</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 204, this 
  court suggested that in a very rare case, such as <i>R. v</i>. <i>Greenwood</i> 
  (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 435 (Ont. C.A.), a court on appeal from a directed verdict 
  of acquittal may be in a position to decline to order a new trial on one of 
  the above two bases. In <i>Greenwood</i>, the trial judge erred in directing 
  a verdict of acquittal. However, following the directed verdict, the appellant 
  testified at the trial of his co-accused and gave evidence which was accepted 
  by the trial judge. In those circumstances the court held that the Crown could 
  not demonstrate that the verdict would have been any different had the trial 
  judge not erred in his ruling.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>I agree that the evidence against the appellant is weak and equivocal. 
  The trial judge was satisfied that the evidence raised a reasonable doubt of 
  the appellant’s guilt. The pathologist could not rule out death by S.I.D.S. 
  or just accidental asphyxiation on vomit. The time of death is problematic. 
  In order to convict the appellant, a jury must reject the evidence of Ms. Bill 
  (as they did) that the baby was alive at 9:00 a.m. Having rejected her evidence 
  on that crucial issue, the jury would be obliged to consider whether they could 
  be satisfied, based on the evidence they did accept, including any of the evidence 
  of Ms. Bill, that the appellant in fact committed the offence.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>However, having found that there is some evidence for a jury to consider 
  on all the elements of the offence of first degree murder either by sexual assault 
  or by smothering with the pillow while committing a sexual assault, this court 
  is not in a position to make findings of credibility and reliability of, for 
  example, Ms. Bill, or to draw the inferences which a jury may draw based on 
  an assessment of the evidence. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>In my view, this is not the rare case referred to in <i>Collins and 
  Pelfrey</i>, where a new trial should not be ordered because a verdict of guilty 
  of first degree murder would necessarily be an unreasonable one. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US>The Crown took the position in writing and in oral submissions before 
  this court that it “requires an Order for a new trial on first degree murder 
  only in the event that a new trial on the offence of manslaughter is ultimately 
  ordered, either by this Honourable Court or by the Supreme Court of Canada.” 
  The Crown’s position is that it is content with the verdict of manslaughter, 
  so that if the appeal on manslaughter is dismissed, it would not seek a new 
  trial on first degree murder. However, in that case the Crown wishes to keep 
  its appeal alive in the event of a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

  <span
lang=EN-US>In <i>Guillemette v. The Queen</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada held that where an accused is convicted of an included offence, 
  and therefore in accordance with s.&nbsp;605(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, 
  the accused has been acquitted of the greater offence originally charged, and 
  the accused appeals the conviction, the court on appeal may only deal with a 
  disposition of the lesser charge under appeal unless the Crown has appealed 
  the acquittal on the original charge. Crown counsel advised that it was because 
  of the ruling in <i>Guillemette</i>, that the Crown brought its appeal in this 
  case. Its position before this court is consistent with that approach.<u></u></span></p>

  manslaughter verdict were upheld, the court should consider the Crown's appeal 
  and if it succeeds, there ought to be a new trial on the first degree murder 
  charge. There is no need to deal with that submission as the manslaughter conviction 
  is set aside. <u></u></span></p>
