  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals against his conviction 
  for second degree murder, and raises four grounds of appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> First, he submits that the trial judge erred in failing to leave 
  the included offence of manslaughter with the jury.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>     </span>This submission has two components.  The first 
  component is that the trial judge erred in refusing to leave the defence of 
  provocation when there was evidence capable of sustaining that defence.  We 
  agree with the trial judge that, viewed in its most charitable light, there 
  was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer, let alone conclude, 
  that the appellant acted on the sudden before there was time for his passion 
  to cool.  The trial judge did not err in failing to leave provocation with the 
  jury.  The second component relates to the trial judge’s charge on the issue 
  of intent.  We agree that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that 
  if the appellant did not have the intent for murder, he must be acquitted, but 
  we are satisfied that the error did not occasion any substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice.  The essential issue in this case was whether the deceased was killed 
  by the appellant or by his wife, and the evidence was overwhelming that whoever 
  killed the deceased did so at least with the requisite intent for murder under 
  s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the appellant submits that the procedure followed by 
  the Crown in eliciting prior out-of-court statements of the witness Ms. Kaur 
  was improper.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant concedes that an allegation of recent fabrication 
  was made by the defence but submits that the allegation, as it related to the 
  statements to the police, was limited in scope and related to certain details 
  of the manner in which the offence was committed by the appellant.  Assuming 
  that to be the case, there was no prejudice to the appellant from the manner 
  in which the out-of-court statement evidence was adduced.  The appellant’s chief 
  complaint was that the Crown abandoned Ms. Kaur as a witness in favour of adducing 
  the prior statements from the more credible police officers.  However, it is 
  apparent that the defence not only anticipated that these statements would be 
  put before the jury through the police officers, but wanted this to occur.  
  Further, it was open to the Crown to show that, contrary to the allegation by 
  the defence, Ms. Kaur had related these details in her conversations with the 
  police.  Having regard to the manner in which Ms. Kaur’s cross-examination was 
  conducted – and, specifically, defence counsel’s comment that the jury would 
  hear from the police officers – it was not necessary for the Crown to also attempt 
  to elicit those same statements from the witness in re-examination. While the 
  Crown might have sought to refresh her memory in re-examination, we are satisfied 
  that, had this been done, she would either have adopted the prior statements 
  or maintained her position that she could not recollect them.  In either case, 
  it would have been open to the Crown to lead the statements through the officers 
  to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As to the 1990 statement to Dhandwar, we are satisfied that it 
  was open to the trial judge to find that the statement rebutted an allegation 
  that Ms. Kaur made up her story upon her arrest.  We do not agree that the statement 
  was inadmissible because Ms. Kaur testified that she did not discuss the murder 
  with Dhandwar.  In our view, a statement is admissible to rebut an allegation 
  of recent fabrication even if the witness testifies that she did not make the 
  prior statement on the occasion in question.  To the extent that the parts of 
  the brief prior statement were inconsistent with Ms. Kaur’s trial evidence, 
  no prejudice was occasioned to the appellant, since this was simply further 
  evidence undermining Ms.&nbsp;Kaur’s credibility.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, we are satisfied that the mid-trial 
  instructions and the charge to the jury were sufficient in the circumstances 
  in alerting the jury to the limited use to be made of these prior statements.<b></b></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>  </span>Third, the appellant submitted that the Crown 
  improperly cross-examined the appellant about his counsel’s failure to confront 
  Crown witnesses with certain evidence in accordance with the rule in <i>Browne 
  v. Dunn </i>and that the Crown infringed the privilege attaching to solicitor-client 
  communications.  Assuming that <i>Browne v. Dunn </i>did not apply in the circumstances 
  of this case, we are satisfied that the trial judge’s instructions removed any 
  prejudice that might have been occasioned to the appellant.  On the question 
  of solicitor-client privilege, we note that the trial judge interrupted the 
  Crown and precluded any questions that would have violated the privilege.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Fourth, the appellant sought to adduce fresh evidence 
  to suggest that the warrant for Dhandwar’s arrest in India, on which (in part) 
  he based his fear of returning to that country, was to his knowledge a forgery.  
  In our view, this evidence is not admissible because whether the warrant was 
  a forgery was a collateral issue.  We do not agree with counsel’s submission 
  that the forgery issue was not collateral because it demonstrated Dhandwar’s 
  motive to testify falsely against the appellant.  The evidence was overwhelming 
  that Dhandwar wanted to stay in Canada.  If the appellant could show that Dhandwar 
  knew that the warrant was a forgery, it would, if anything, weaken his motive 
  to testify falsely.  In short, the only value of this evidence was to demonstrate 
  a contradiction in Dhandwar’s testimony.  In any event, even if the evidence 
  were admissible, it could not affected the result in view of the abundance of 
  evidence already in the trial record impugning Dhandwar’s credibility.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Accordingly, the application to adduce fresh evidence 
  is dismissed and the appeal is dismissed.  <span> </span></p>
