<p align="center"><span><b> </b></span><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'></span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [1]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s claim was dismissed at trial by Archibald J. who gave 
  detailed written reasons for judgment on July 28, 1999.  The appellant appealed 
  that decision to this court.  She ordered transcripts of the trial in September 
  1999, but still has not paid the required deposit to the court reporter.  Without 
  a deposit, the court reporter will not prepare the transcripts.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [2]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Faced with the Registrar’s Notice of Intention to Dismiss the Appeal 
  for Delay, the appellant moved for an order extending the time to perfect the 
  appeal.  That motion was heard by Finlayson J.A. on October 4, 2000.  He noted 
  that the appellant was seeking legal aid.  He gave the appellant an additional 
  30 days to obtain a legal aid certificate, retain a lawyer and move for a further 
  extension.  Otherwise, the appeal was to be dismissed.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [3]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant did not comply with that order, but brought a further 
  motion for an order extending the time to file a notice of motion for a review 
  by a panel of Finlayson J.A.’s order.  Laskin J.A. heard that motion.  In his 
  endorsement dated November 21, 2000, he noted that the appellant had failed 
  to put forward any evidence that she could pay for or otherwise obtain the transcripts. 
  Laskin J.A. also concluded as follows: “Moreover, the trial judge made findings 
  of fact against [the appellant] on every disputed issue and the appellant has 
  not put forward any arguable of appeal.”  As a result, Laskin J.A. ordered that 
  the appeal be dismissed in accordance with the order of Finlayson J.A.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [4]     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant now moves before 
  us for an order extending the time to review the order of Laskin J.A.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [5]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In these circumstances, the motion must be dismissed.  There is still 
  no evidence to indicate that there is any reasonable prospect that the appellant 
  will be able to obtain legal aid or otherwise be in a position to pay for the 
  transcripts required for the appeal to proceed.  The appeal was dismissed only 
  after the appellant was given an extension of time in order to make the necessary 
  arrangements so that she could proceed with her appeal.  Almost a year has gone 
  by and she still has not provided the court with any indication of how or when 
  she could pay for the transcripts and proceed with the appeal in a reasonable 
  fashion.</p>
[6]     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the motion is dismissed with costs 
to be assessed.
