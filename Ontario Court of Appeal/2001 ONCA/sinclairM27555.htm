        </span> The moving party, Todd Bargman (Bargman) is the father of Sierra 
        Bargman-Sinclair (Sierra) who was born on October 6, 1995.  The respondent, 
        Jennifer Sinclair (Sinclair) is Sierra’s mother.  On March 24, 1997, Nevins 
        J. ordered that Sinclair have custody of Sierra.  He granted access to 
        Bargman at times that need not be detailed.  On June 18, 2001, on Bargman’s 
        motion for custody Marshman J. dismissed Bargman’s motion.  Thus, the 
        custody order of Nevins J. remained intact.  Under that order, Sinclair 
        had custody of Sierra.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> After the custody trial before Marshman J., concerns arose with 
        respect to child abuse.  In due course, Sinclair was charged with assault 
        and released on a promise to appear.  She was prohibited from having contact 
        with Sierra as a condition of her release.  Because of these developments, 
        Sierra’s paternal grandparents have assumed day-to-day custody and control 
        of Sierra.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Bargman has appealed Marshman J.’s June 18, 2001 order dismissing 
        his claim for custody.  He asks that the judgment be set aside and that 
        a new trial be ordered or that he simply be granted custody of Sierra.  
        He also seeks to adduce fresh evidence, the details of which I have not 
        reviewed.  It will be sufficient to say that at least for the most part 
        the fresh evidence concerns the particulars of the police investigation 
        leading to the charges against Sinclair.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In Marshman J.’s reasons for judgment, she made it clear that, 
        in her view, Bargman was not a fit parent.  In reference to Bargman she 
        said “He is not an appropriate caregiver for a young child”.  Against 
        that background, I am not persuaded that it would make any sense to remove 
        Sierra from her grandparents’ custody and place her with Bargman who the 
        trial judge manifestly felt was not a fit parent.   In my view, Bargman’s 
        motion for interim custody pending hearing of the appeal must be dismissed.  
      </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Bargman has access during the last half of August 2001, but no 
        access before then.  He has complained about that access being at the 
        end of August.  I hope the parties can work something out with respect 
        to summer access, however, if they cannot, it seems to me that the trial 
        access order should simply be observed.  In the short term, I would hope 
        that arrangements can be worked out so that Sierra’s paternal grandparents 
        will have some access to her.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> There are some miscellaneous problems such as obtaining proper 
        dental care for Sierra.  She apparently has a number of cavities which 
        as a matter of common sense should be dealt with in short order.  As the 
        grandparents have care, custody and control of Sierra, they should determine 
        what dentist should treat her.  I emphasize that this should be done quickly.  
      </p>

        </span> It is important that this appeal be heard quickly.  I am told 
        that there is some problem with the preparation of transcripts in the 
        sense that transcripts of this trial will not be ready for three months.  
        The preparation of the trial transcripts should be expedited.  A copy 
        of these reasons should be given to the court reporter or court reporters 
        involved.  To properly organize the appeal, the police evidence which 
        was brought to court on the hearing of this motion by Constable Adlee 
        should be copied and given to the court in the usual fresh evidence envelopes 
        so that the panel hearing the appeal can consider any application for 
        the admission of fresh evidence.  </p>

        </span> In my view, the Children’s Lawyer should be involved to represent 
        Sierra’s interests.  Since the parental situation is so volatile and fluid 
        at the moment, I think an order should issue in the usual form requesting 
        the Children’s Lawyer to provide services as the Children’s Lawyer deems 
        appropriate in the circumstances.  Both Sinclair, Bargman and Sierra’s 
        grandparents should co-operate fully with the Children’s Lawyer.</p>

        of the panel hearing the appeal.  </p>
