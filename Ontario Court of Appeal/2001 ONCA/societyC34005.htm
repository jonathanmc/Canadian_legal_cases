  </span></span> This case represents the second Ontario installment of the story 
  of a worldwide investment disaster. It is the final chapter of the quest by 
  The Society of Lloyds to enforce judgments granted in England against certain 
  Ontario investors who became members of Lloyd's in the 1980's (&quot;Names&quot;) 
  without fully appreciating the potential magnitude of the risks associated with 
  becoming a Lloyd's Name. The legal history of the appellants fight to avoid 
  liability to Lloyd's mirrors similar battles waged around the world by other 
  domestic and international Names.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The judgment appealed 
  from granted Lloyd's registration for enforcement in Ontario of judgments obtained 
  in the United Kingdom against certain Canadian Names. Lloyd's commenced five 
  &quot;test case&quot; applications involving five Names, but it was agreed that 
  all 88 respondent Names would be bound by the result. Since the judgment, but 
  before the appeal was argued, several of the affected Names entered into settlements 
  with Lloyd's, while a number of others commenced proceedings under the <i>Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, thus staying these proceedings 
  against them. The appeal proceeded on behalf of the remaining appellants within 
  the &quot;test case&quot; context.</span></p>

  </span></span> The <i>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (U.K.) Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. R-6,  defines an Ontario court's jurisdiction to grant or deny registration. 
  The Act incorporates the <i>Convention Between Canada and the United Kingdom

  would be contrary to the public policy of Ontario on two bases: (1) There was 
  a denial of natural justice because the appellants were denied the opportunity 
  to litigate their allegations of fraud against Lloyd's; and, (2) Because Lloyd's 
  contravened the Ontario <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;S-5, by 
  trading in securities without filing a prospectus, it would be against the public 
  policy of Ontario to enforce judgments at the behest of Lloyd's based on agreements 
  entered into in breach of the <i>Securities Act</i>. Relying on Article IV(l)(a) 
  and Article IV(3), the appellants also submitted that certain of the judgments

  an efficient and effective process without the need for extensive cross-examination 
  on the affidavits filed, the parties and the application judge agreed to proceed

<p><span

<p><b>FACTS</b></p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The factual background 
  of the Lloyds saga has been repeated in numerous judgments in England, the 
  United States, Canada and other jurisdictions which have dealt with the various 
  aspects of the Lloyd's litigation. Swinton J. clearly and comprehensively set 
  out in her Reasons the factual background of the structure of Lloyd's and the 
  history of the appellants legal struggle with it. As the factual background 
  is not in dispute, I adopt her recital of the facts and background as set out 
  at paras. 8 - 28 of her decision:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Factual Background</span></b></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Lloyd's does not carry on an insurance business. Instead, 
      the function of Lloyd's is to regulate and provide services to the Lloyd's 
      insurance market. Underwriting is carried out by &quot;Names&quot; - individuals 
      who underwrite insurance through Lloyd's syndicates. All of the respondents 
      here have been Names.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Affidavits filed by the respondents indicate the way in 
      which some of the Names were recruited by Lloyd's. For example, Jacqueline 
      Levin indicates that she was recruited by Lloyd's agents in Ontario. She 
      stated that an application for membership must be made through a Members' 
      Agent, authorized by Lloyd's to recruit members. She also had to attend 
      a Rota Committee interview in London, England, where she was questioned 
      about becoming a member of Lloyd's by a member of the Council of Lloyd's, 
      the Society's governing body. After being accepted, she then signed the 
      necessary documents in England, and she was given copies. The affidavit 
      of Paul F. Saunders outlines in more detail the written information he received 
      prior to becoming a member.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>To be accepted for membership, the Names were required 
      to enter into a series of agreements with the Members' Agent and Lloyd's 
      itself, including the General Undertaking, the Agency Agreement and the 
      Lloyd's Underwriting Members' Security Agreement. The General Undertaking 
      bound the Names to comply with directions imposed by Lloyd's Council. Like 
      the other documents signed, it mandated that disputes with Lloyd's must 
      be heard in the English Courts and be governed by the laws of England. For 
      example, Clause 2.1 reads:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The rights and obligations of the parties 
      arising out of or relating to the member's membership of, and/or underwriting 
      of insurance business at, Lloyd's and any other matter referred to in this 
      Undertaking shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws 
      of England.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Each Name must lodge a deposit with Lloyd's equal to a 
      certain percentage of the premium income, normally in the form of a letter 
      of credit. As well, Names must appoint a registered Members' Agent to act 
      on their behalf, to whom they delegate the complete control of their affairs 
      at Lloyd's.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Names group together in syndicates, which are managed 
      by a Managing Agent, whose name is often associated with the syndicate. 
      A syndicate is not a legal entity nor a partnership; rather, it is simply 
      a group of Names who join a particular syndicate for a particular underwriting 
      year. Each policy of insurance issued at Lloyd's consists of individual 
      contracts made on behalf of the individual Names participating in the syndicate. 
      Each Name is only liable for his share of the risk, but not for the share 
      of any other Name. However, the Name has unlimited liability to the extent 
      of all his assets in respect of his insurance obligations at Lloyd's.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>All premiums received for insurance policies are credited 
      to a Premiums Trust Fund, which is governed by a Premiums Trust Deed. Its 
      prime purpose is for the protection of policy holders. Each member is also 
      required to make annual mandatory contributions to the Central Fund, which 
      exists primarily to protect policy holders. It is used if claims cannot 
      be satisfied through the Names' Lloyd's funds and personal assets.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The respondents allege that Lloyd's acted fraudulently 
      in concealing the magnitude of risks associated with asbestos exposure claims 
      arising in the United States from about mid-1980. Normally, the accounts 
      of a syndicate are left open for three years in order to defer the distribution 
      of the profit until the pattern of claims' settlement for the syndicate 
      year in question can be determined with reasonable certainty. Reinsurance 
      to close is obtained, usually by paying a premium to the following underwriting 
      year of the same syndicate. This premium is intended to cover the total 
      outstanding claims, including those not yet reported in respect of risks 
      signed in the year of account and those still outstanding from all previous 
      years. However, if the closing reserve cannot be calculated with sufficient 
      certainty, and there are insufficient funds to purchase reinsurance to close, 
      the syndicate is left open.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The respondents allege that despite the impossibility 
      of determining the liability in respect of asbestosis, virtually every syndicate 
      closed its 1979 year of account at December 31, 1981, taking reserves over 
      a series of years in an attempt to spread the losses over the Names who 
      underwrote the syndicates throughout the 1980's. Apparently during the 1980's, 
      Lloyd's recruited a considerable number of new Names. The respondents state 
      that they were generally recruited in 1986 and after, becoming Names in 
      1987 and subsequent years, although the affidavit of Eric Mellish Lane indicates 
      that he became a Name in 1979. They believe that Lloyd's misrepresented 
      to them the risks to which they were exposed from asbestos and other long 
      tail risks. Specifically, Lloyd's knowledge of future enormous and unquantifiable 
      losses and its failure to disclose this information are alleged to be fraudulent 
      conduct. So, too, was the publication of Lloyd's Global Accounts, which 
      are alleged to have contained misleading information about the financial 
      health of the syndicates.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>By 1991 or 1992, the insurance 
      market was in crisis. Lloyd's made cash calls on the Names and threatened 
      to draw upon their letters of credit. In 1991, a group of Canadian Names 
      issued a Statement of Claim in Ontario against Lloyd's and a number of banks, 
      seeking an injunction to prevent the banks from paying out on the letters 
      of credit, and preventing Lloyd's from trying to draw down on the letters 
      of credit. They argued that their contracts with Lloyd's were void <i>ab 
      initio</i> as having been induced by fraud and made in contravention of 
      the <i>Securities Act</i>. Lloyd's brought a motion to stay the action on 
      the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, and was successful. McKeown J. 
      determined that the proper forum for the determination of the issues was 
      the United Kingdom because of the choice of law clause in Lloyd's General 
      Undertaking. In addition, he determined that the English courts should take 
      jurisdiction because the proceeding had a more substantial connection to 
      England (<i>Ash v. Lloyd's Corp.</i> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 235 (Gen. Div.) 
      at 248). That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal ((1992), 9 O.R. 
      (3d) 755 (C.A.); leave to appeal refused by the Supreme Court of Canada, 
      [1992] S.C.C.A. No. 357, October 8, 1992). Writing for the Court of Appeal, 
      Carthy J.A. stated at 758:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With a starting point of treating Lloyd's 
      as the engine of the defence and treating the claims against it as the prominent 
      concern in selecting a forum, I endorse the entirety of McKeown J.'s reasons 
      for staying the action against Lloyd's. Even without the exclusive jurisdiction 
      clauses, the contracts are to be performed in England, the alleged wrongful 
      conduct was on the part of a large number of English residents who carry 
      out the day-to-day functions under Lloyd's jurisdiction, and the overall 
      picture is of an overwhelming affinity to England.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Lloyd's drew down the Names' 
      letters of credit, but also made cash calls. When the respondents did not 
      pay the cash calls, Lloyd's paid the losses from the Central Fund, and in 
      1992 brought an action in the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom 
      against many of the respondents for reimbursement of the amounts paid. One 
      of the defendants, Dr. Gian Carlo Mason from Hamilton, Ontario, filed a 
      defence and counterclaim denying that there was money owing to Lloyd's because 
      of the fraudulent conduct and misrepresentations by Lloyd's related to asbestos 
      losses. This action has never proceeded to trial as a result of an order 
      of the Commercial Court of the High Court of Justice that Lloyd's was not 
      required to proceed with the <i>Mason</i> case and could leave it in abeyance 
      while it pursued the <i>Clementson</i> case, which raised defences relating 
      to European Community law. To date, none of the Central Fund Writs cases 
      has proceeded.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>After 1993, a number of cases 
      brought by action groups of Names against Managing Agents for negligence 
      went to trial or settled. When the Names succeeded, damages were awarded 
      to them. Some of the respondents here were successful in these actions. 
      In subsequent litigation, the House of Lords determined that the litigation 
      recoveries of the Names related to negligent underwriting are part of the 
      Premiums Trust Funds. Similarly, litigation recoveries related to negligent 
      advice in portfolio selection are part of the Premiums Trust Funds to the 
      extent provided in the Premiums Trust Deeds. Lloyd's is the Regulating Trustee 
      of Names' Premiums Trust Funds. In its capacity as Trustee, Lloyd's is entitled 
      to those litigation recoveries and must deal with them in accordance with 
      the Premiums Trust Deeds (<i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Robinson</i>, [1999] 
      H.L.J. No. 17, House of Lords, reasons delivered March 25, 1999). Those 
      funds are currently held by various solicitors for the action groups in 
      escrow accounts, and there is ongoing dispute about their release.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Because of the chaos in the insurance market and in order 
      to keep Lloyd's viable, Lloyd's sought a way to settle all the litigation 
      in the market and the outstanding claims. In July, 1996, as part of its 
      Reconstruction and Renewal Plan (&quot;R &amp; R Plan&quot;), Lloyd's made 
      an offer to Names worldwide to settle claims in respect to their 1992 and 
      prior underwriting years. In order to effect the R &amp; R Plan, a contract 
      of reinsurance was entered into with a group of companies known as &quot;Equitas&quot;. 
      The Equitas reinsurance contract covered the entire non-life insurance market 
      for the 1992 and prior underwriting years. Those Names who accepted the 
      offer waived all claims against Lloyd's, Equitas, agents and auditors in 
      respect of 1992 and prior years.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>While the offer was accepted by a vast majority of Names 
      worldwide, the respondents did not do so. Nevertheless, those Names who 
      did not accept the R &amp; R Settlement Offer still had their liabilities 
      mandatorily reinsured by Equitas. Lloyd's compelled them to contract with 
      Equitas by imposing upon them a replacement managing agent called &quot;AUA9&quot;, 
      which Lloyd's then directed to execute the reinsurance contracts on behalf 
      of the Names. Lloyd's paid all Equitas premiums owing, and the rights to 
      collect the Equitas premiums were then assigned to it. Clause 5.5 of the 
      reinsurance contract provided that each Name was obliged to pay his premium 
      free and clear from any set-off, counterclaim or other deduction, including 
      in respect of claims against Lloyd's. It also provided for a waiver by the 
      Name to any claim to a stay of execution on the judgment.</span></p>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The English Court Proceedings</span></b></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Lloyd's then commenced actions to recover the Equitas 
      premiums from those Names who did not accept the R &amp; R offer, including 
      the respondents here. Various Names raised numerous defences, arguing that 
      they were not bound because of their non-acceptance of the R &amp; R settlement 
      offer; that Lloyd's had exceeded its power to amend or enact by-laws in 
      creating the R &amp; R scheme; that the assignment to Equitas from Lloyd's 
      was improper; that the fraud by Lloyd's gave rise to a right to rescind 
      the Names' contract with Lloyd's; that fraud by Lloyd's should give rise 
      to a set-off of the fraud claims against the premium claims; that a stay 
      of execution should be granted until the determination of the fraud claims; 
      and that Lloyd's had breached Canadian securities legislation. Issues of 
      quantum were also raised.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In a series of test cases managed through the Commercial 
      Court, Lloyd's moved under R.S.C. Orders 14 and 14A, which bear some similarity 
      to Ontario's Rules 20 and 21 dealing with summary judgment and determination 
      of a preliminary point of law. Under O. 14, r. 3, the English Court must 
      ask whether there is &quot;an issue or question in dispute which ought to 
      be tried.&quot;</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In a series of judgments, Justices Colman and Tuckey of 
      the Commercial Court wrote lengthy reasons in which they stated that the 
      defences raised were without merit. Their decisions were upheld by the Court 
      of Appeal. A brief summary follows.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>The Society of Lloyd's 
      v. Leighs</i> (February 20, 1997), Colman J. rejected defences based on 
      the fact that the Names had not accepted the R &amp; R plan and therefore, 
      could not be bound by it, and that Lloyd's had no title to sue in respect 
      of moneys payable under the R &amp; R plan. Canadian Names were intervenors 
      in this proceeding. In a subsequent decision released on April 23, 1997, 
      <i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Wilkinson</i>, he determined that even if Lloyd's 
      had engaged in fraudulent conduct, the law of rescission would not apply 
      in the circumstances because of the impossibility of <i>restitutio in integrum</i>. 
      He also held that Clause 5.5 of the Equitas contract prevented the defendants 
      from setting off their counterclaim for damages for fraud against Lloyd's 
      claim for the Equitas premium, and that there should be no stay of execution 
      against them with respect to the judgment for the Equitas premium.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The judgments of Colman J. were 
      upheld by the Court of Appeal in <i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Leighs, Lyon 
      and Wilkinson </i>[1997], N.L.O.R. No.&nbsp;721 (reasons dated July 31, 
      1997), and leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. Counsel appeared 
      for 215 Canadian Names, who were granted intervenor status. The Court upheld 
      the conclusions of Colman J. that the R &amp; R By-law fell within the Society's 
      powers, and the directions given to implement it were validly given; that 
      the Names had not validly rescinded their General Undertakings and thereby 
      avoided their contracts with Equitas concluded on their behalf by AUA9; 
      that the Names were bound by the &quot;no set off&quot; provision in Clause 
      5.5 of the Equitas contract, given their agreement, at the time that they 
      became Names, to be bound by the legislative and regulatory regime of the 
      Society; and that clause prevented the non-accepting Names from raising 
      claims of fraud against the Society in answer to a claim by the Society 
      as assignee for the Name's premium. Finally, the Court refused to order 
      a stay of execution.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Subsequently, Tuckey J. determined 
      that there was no defence to the claim for the premiums based on the allegation 
      that Lloyd's had failed to comply with Ontario securities law (<i>The Society 
      of Lloyd's v. Daly, </i>reasons dated January 27, 1998). In doing so, he 
      gave full effect to a legal opinion of James C. Baillie, Q.C., which had 
      concluded that the actions of Lloyd's had contravened Ontario securities 
      law because of the failure to file a prospectus, and thus, the obligations 
      to Lloyd's would be unenforceable in Ontario. Tuckey J. nevertheless held 
      that the enforcement of the contractual obligations in England was not against 
      public policy, and thus, there was no defence available based on Ontario 
      securities law. Subsequently, in March, 1998, summary judgment was awarded 
      to Lloyd's for the various Equitas premium amounts. Tuckey J. granted a 
      stay of execution until the determination of a leave to appeal application 
      before the Court of Appeal, although he refused to order a general stay 
      of execution.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Leave to appeal was then sought 
      from the Court of Appeal. In lengthy reasons in <i>Society of Lloyd's v. 
      Fraser &amp; Ors</i>, [1998] E.W.J. No.&nbsp;1045 the Court of Appeal denied 
      leave to appeal from this judgment of Tuckey J. and others (reasons released 
      July 31, 1998). The Court noted that there was no question here of enforcing 
      a contract that would involve the infringement of an Ontario law, and there 
      was no infringement of comity. The Court noted that if the Canadian Names 
      were correct and their contracts with Lloyd's were void and unenforceable, 
      then so, too, would be the insurance contracts which they had entered, because 
      their contracts' validity depended upon the validity of the underwriting 
      membership with Lloyd's (at 37). Lord Hobhouse concluded that &quot;no principle 
      of comity or public policy would suffice to justify that result&quot;. In 
      the course of these reasons, he also stated with respect to the procedure 
      that had been adopted:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Trials are necessary in order to determine 
      triable issues of fact. It is not the function of the Court on an O.14 hearing 
      to make findings of fact. It is its function to consider whether the affidavits 
      lodged by the defendants in response to the O.14 summons raise triable issues 
      of fact which are capable in law of providing the defendant with a defence 
      to the claim or part of it. (at 29)</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>As a result of these decisions, the Equitas judgments 
      are final in the United Kingdom as there is no further right to appeal. 
      Lloyd's now seeks to enforce them in Ontario.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants' first 
  ground of appeal is that Swinton J. erred by failing to apply the test used 
  on a Rule 21 motion, that is, to decide an issue of law on the basis that the 
  facts relied on by the moving parties were true, and thereby held the appellants 
  to a more onerous burden of proof of the facts. The appellants submit that the 
  application judge did not state what test she was applying, but that her reasons 
  suggest that she was not applying the Rule 21 procedure on the basis that she 
  was constrained from doing so where the procedure used was an application rather 
  than a motion within an action.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>There is no merit 
  to this ground of appeal. Swinton J. explained very clearly in her reasons that 
  although this is an application, so that technically Rule 21 is not applicable, 
  Rule 38.10 allows a judge hearing an application to grant or deny the relief 
  sought or to order an issue to proceed to trial. She noted that there were no 
  material facts in dispute with respect to the legal issues to be decided. There 
  is no suggestion in the reasons that the application judge made any finding 
  based on the appellants' failure to prove a fact. To the contrary, the agreed 
  assumptions which formed the basis of the hearing assumed the facts to be most 
  favourable to the appellants.</span></p>

  ground of appeal is that the application judge erred in failing to find that 
  there was a denial of natural justice in the procedure employed by the U.K. 
  courts. The appellants refer to the fundamental right in Canada and in Ontario 
  of a litigant before the courts to have a trial so as to have his or her case 
  adjudicated on its merits. Their position is that they were denied that right 
  in the U.K. proceedings which resulted in the judgments sought to be registered 
  on the application. There are two branches to this submission. The first is 
  that it was a denial of natural justice for the U.K. court to grant judgments 
  against the appellants based on the Equitas premiums mandated under the R&amp;R 
  plan without allowing them to have their fraud claims against Lloyd's adjudicated 
  first. The second is that on the Order 14 and 14A motions, Colman J. and Tuckey 
  J. made certain findings of fact on disputed issues without a trial, which is 
  contrary to our procedures under Rules 20 (summary judgment) and 21 (determination 
  of an issue before trial), where facts in dispute require that the case proceed 
  to trial.</span></p>

  did not receive notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable him 
  to defend the proceedings and, in either case, did not appear.&quot; This section 
  recognizes one aspect of a denial of procedural natural justice as a ground 
  which any registering courts law may view as a basis to set aside registration 
  of a foreign judgment. Section 1 lists other conditions for refusal to register, 
  such as fraud, which are also encompassed by natural justice. On the basis of 
  the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, those Articles may suggest 
  that it is only to the extent of the listed matters that a denial of procedural 
  natural justice is to be considered as a basis for non-enforcement. Because 
  the purpose and effect of the Act is the reciprocal enforcement of judgments

  ask this court to consider a broader definition of &quot;public policy&quot;

  that natural justice was denied to them in the U.K. proceedings in two ways. 
  The appellants first argument is that the denial of natural justice in this

  because it prohibited the appellants from having a hearing on the fundamental 
  issue they raised from the outset: that their entire investment was based on 
  a fraud perpetrated on them, and therefore they are entitled to rescind that 
  investment and not be bound by all of the obligations that have been imposed 
  as a result of it. They forcefully submit that when it decided <i>Ash, supra</i>, 
  had this court known that the appellants would not have their fraud claim heard 
  before judgment enforcing their obligations was imposed, it would never have 
  stayed the action in Ontario by holding that the United Kingdom and not Ontario

  imposed on the Lloyd's Names by the Equitas arrangements and their enforcement

  that the denial of the opportunity to present their defence is not just a denial 
  of ordinary procedural fairness in both England and Ontario, but that such a 
  procedure offends our notions of substantive justice and, they say, is therefore 
  contrary to our public policy. The appellants rely on the decision of the English 
  Court of Appeal in <i>Adams v. Cape Industries plc</i>, [1991] 1 All E.R. 929 
  (C.A.), where the court refused to enforce judgments of the Texas District Court 
  awarding damages to plaintiffs for injury caused by asbestos dust. The defendant 
  was the supplier of the asbestos. The basis for the English courts ruling was 
  that the Texas court had awarded a global sum for damages for all plaintiffs 
  based on a proposal by plaintiffs counsel, while the amount to go to each plaintiff 
  was to be determined by the plaintiffs attorneys. The Court of Appeal held 
  that the natural justice required for England to enforce foreign judgments was 
  not limited to due notice and the opportunity to be heard, but included the 
  English courts view of substantial justice. In that case, substantial justice 
  required the Texas District Court judge to determine the quantum of damages 
  for each plaintiff and not to delegate that assessment to the attorneys.</span></p>

  the factors which led her to the conclusion that there was no denial of natural 
  justice that would justify refusal to enforce the U.K. judgments. I agree with 
  her conclusion. She based her conclusion on several factors. However, in my 
  view, the factor which meets the major concern of the appellants, is that the 
  U.K. courts gave full consideration to the fraud defence by assuming that the 
  appellants would be able to prove the frauds they alleged. In other words, they 
  took the defence at its highest, but still held that it would not amount to 
  a defence in law to prevent judgment going on Lloyd's Equitas premium claims. 
  The appellants were not denied the opportunity to prove their case. It was taken 
  as a given.</span></p>

  of Lloyd's v. Leighs, Lyon and Wilkinson, supra</i> the Court of Appeal, in 
  upholding the judgments of Colman J., reached the legal conclusion that there 
  could be no rescission by the Names of their contracts with Lloyd's for fraudulent 
  misrepresentation for two reasons. First, rescission would adversely affect 
  third parties. In theory, this includes the policyholders whose policies are 
  with those Names, although in practice, the Equitas fund would cover them. Recission 
  would also adversely affect the Names who agreed to pay Equitas premiums, because 
  they would have to cover the liabilities of the rescinding Names. Second, because 
  as a matter of law in England, membership in Lloyd's is essential for Names 
  to conduct the insurance business, &quot;[i]t is fundamentally incompatible 
  with the business that has been carried on for Names to withdraw, retroactively, 
  from membership of Lloyd's.&quot; (para. 38) The court concluded therefore, 
  that <i>restitutio in integrum</i> was impossible. As a result, the remedy of 
  recission would not be available for the frauds alleged by the plaintiffs, assuming 
  they were proved. The plaintiffs remedy could only be in damages.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Court of Appeal 
  also held that Clause 5.5 of the Equitas contract, which is the clause that 
  prevents any set-off against the amount owing for premiums to Equitas as part 
  of the R &amp; R settlement, includes any set-off for the fraud claims made 
  against Lloyd's. Again, accepting the fraud allegations as proved, the court 
  proceeded to hold that the premiums were still owing because Clause 5.5 was 
  not affected nor was its effect lessened. </span></p>
<p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The court also refused 
  to exercise its discretion in the face of Clause 5.5, to issue a stay of execution 
  pending determination of the counterclaim for fraud. This was an exercise of 
  discretion which is similar to the discretion of our courts under Rule 27.09. 
  This was the only issue where the court did not assume that the fraud had or 
  could be proved. Under our rule, the merits of the counterclaim are a consideration 
  which a court takes into account in the exercise of its discretion whether to 
  grant a stay. However, the fact that the court did not appear to consider the 
  merits of the fraud allegations in the course of exercising its discretion does 
  not speak to a denial of natural justice. To grant a stay after deciding to 
  give effect to the no set-off or &quot;pay now, sue later&quot; clause would 
  have been anomalous and contradictory. Having decided, in effect, that the merits 
  of the fraud claim would not affect the enforceability of the clause, it was 
  open to the court not to reintroduce the merits of the fraud claim as a factor 
  in the exercise of the courts discretion regarding a stay. If a meritorious 
  fraud claim could not provide a defence to the enforceability of the clause, 
  it could not provide a set-off to the claim based on that clause.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants would 
  have been satisfied had they been successful on any one of the three bases: 
  by raising a viable defence to the summary judgment itself, by obtaining the 
  right to set-off the amount of the fraud claim against the amount of the judgments, 
  or by achieving a stay of the judgments pending determination of the fraud claim. 
  However, the second two results flowed from the first. On the summary judgment 
  issue itself, although the appellants did not have the opportunity to present 
  their fraud defence and therefore their claim for rescission, the appellants 
  were not deprived of the legal effect of a full hearing on the merits because 
  the fraud was assumed to be proven. It cannot be said that they were deprived 
  of natural justice in the circumstances.</span></p>

  the basis that the fraud claims, if proved, would not have provided a defence

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Swinton J. refers 
  to two cases in the United States where similar arguments were made to the Illinois

  not be enforced against Names living in those States: <i>Society of Lloyd's 
  v. Ashenden</i>, unreported, Case No. 98C5335, U.S. Dist. Ct. (Ill.) (April

  (N.Y.S.C.) (November 12, 1999), aff'd [2000] NY-QL 10604 (S.C. App. Div.). The 
  courts in those cases allowed Lloyd's judgments to be enforced by entering summary 
  judgment on them. They held that any deficiency in the English procedures was 
  not fatal because other remedies were available to the Names in England. I agree 
  that the availability of other remedies is one factor which the court can weigh 
  in deciding whether any procedural irregularity in obtaining the judgments is 
  a basis for non enforcement. However in my view, in this case, it is the fact 
  that in the Order 14 and 14A motions the fraud claim was assumed to be proved 
  that allows the court to view the procedure in the English court as according 
  sufficient basic natural justice to allow the judgments to be considered for 
  registration and enforcement in Ontario. </span></p>

  about the judgment of Colman J. In <i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Wilkinson, supra</i> 
  at pp. 21 - 35 where he discusses <i>restitutio in integrum</i>. Colman&nbsp;J. 
  concluded that the appellants could never get rescission of their contracts 
  with Lloyd's because <i>restitutio in integrum </i>was at that point impossible. 
  The basis of this conclusion was his finding that as members of Lloyd's, the 
  appellants had &quot;. . . enjoyed the benefits of Lloyd's administrative facilities 
  . . .&quot; including the ability to conduct the business of insurance. He went 
  on to delineate what those administrative facilities were. They included Lloyds 
  Policy Signing Office, Lloyds central accounting system, Lloyds Underwriters 
  Claims and Recoveries Office, Lloyd's Central Fund and the Lloyds administrative 
  control or supervision including underwriting and managing agents, syndicate 
  auditors and brokers. The court concluded that the benefit of these facilities 
  could not be returned to Lloyds by the Names in order to effect <i>restitutio 
  in integrum</i>, as it had been &quot;irretrievably consumed&quot; in the course 
  of conducting the underwriting business.</span></p>

  to analyze whether the membership fees paid over the years could be said to 
  compensate for the benefits received such that by keeping the fees, Lloyds 
  would be compensated, so that <i>restitutio</i> would not be necessary. He considered 
  the effect of rescission on the operation of the Equitas regime going forward, 
  and concluded that there would be major problems.</span></p>

  that the court determined either without evidence or on contested evidence, 
  the facts which underpinned its conclusions about the unavailability of rescission, 
  the intent and meaning of the General Undertaking, the history and evolution 
  of the R &amp; R Plan, the authority to enter into the Equitas contract, and 
  the waiver of a stay. The appellants say that these findings were made either 
  without any evidence or by choosing from conflicting evidence and that to do 
  so without a trial is a denial of natural justice. They submit that &quot;[o]n

  record to demonstrate which facts were contested in the record before the English 
  court. Nor did they refer to the record to demonstrate a lack of evidence. The 
  specifics of which purely factual findings may have been in dispute is unclear. 
  Second, there is clearly an overlap between the courts findings of fact and 
  conclusions of law in the judgments. The appellants contest the conclusions 
  of law rather than any particular factual finding. </span></p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

      of debts accruing due under the contract while cross-claims are investigated 
      and determined. The insulation of the set-off or counterclaim does not have 
      the purpose of achieving severance for its own sake, but merely as a means 
      of achieving the speedy discharge of indebtedness. If that effect could 
      be avoided by applying for a stay of execution in the face of such a clause

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The final reason to 
  confirm the judgment below is that even if a trial on the fraud issue was ordered, 
  the remedy of rescission was essentially unavailable. This was demonstrated 
  in the argument in the English courts on the <i>Security Act</i>/public policy 
  issue. Counsel for the Names asked for rescission from the English courts, but 
  in argument counsel acknowledged that the Names were liable for their insurance 
  underwriting. That concession speaks against rescission. In <i>The Society of 
  Lloyd's v. Daly</i>, <i>supra</i> Tuckey J. labeled the Names' position as &quot;an 
  anomalous proposition contrary to comity and common sense&quot;. The Court of 
  Appeal in <i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Fraser, supra,</i> made the same observation:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>. . . the acceptance of this argument would 
      mean that the insurance contracts entered into by Mr. Daly would likewise 
      be void and unenforceable, a consequence which for obvious reasons Mr. Daly 
      disclaimed, because their validity under English law depended upon the validity 
      of Mr. Daly's underwriting membership of Lloyd's. If he was not an underwriting 
      member of Lloyd's he could not lawfully enter into any insurance contract, 
      as an insurer, in England. No principle of comity or public policy would 
      suffice to justify that result and, as we have said, it was one which Mr. 
      Daly has implicitly recognised to be unacceptable.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The third ground on 
  which the appellants attack the registration of the U.K. judgments for enforcement 
  in Ontario is that enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of Ontario. 
  The appellants say that the underlying agreements which formed the basis of 
  these judgments were illegal and unenforceable at the behest of Lloyd's because 
  Lloyd's did not file a prospectus as required by s. 53(1) of the Ontario <i>Securities

  the <i>Securities Act</i> by not filing a prospectus before trading in securities 
  with Ontario Names is an assumed fact for the purpose of the application and 
  the appeal. Article IV(1)(e) of the <i>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (U.K.)

<p><span

  the respondent traded in securities in Ontario in breach of statutory requirements,

  </span></span> Counsel for the appellants acknowledges the development of the 
  jurisprudence in this area which provides in various formulations, that the 
  basis of the judgment sought to be enforced must be contrary to essential justice 
  or morality, or the most basic and fundamental values of the registering jurisdiction. 
  Examples cited are fraud, bribery or other coercion, prostitution, and at one 
  time (before this court's decision in <i>Boardwalk Regency Corp. v. Maalouf</i>  
  (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.)) gambling. Counsels argument is that the concept 
  of what is contrary to our public policy must be viewed more broadly than on 
  the narrow basis of purely moral issues, and that something as fundamental as 
  the legislative policy behind the conditions imposed by the <i>Securities Act</i> 
  for trading in securities to and by the public is a most important reflection 
  of the public policy of this province. </p>

  </span></span> The general approach of Canadian courts to the definition and 
  application of public policy is discussed by Castel in <i>Canadian Conflict 
  of Laws, supra</i>:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is almost impossible to give a precise 
      definition of public policy; nor can a general statement be made about its 
      scope. Evidence of public policy can be found in the total body of the constitutional 
      and statute law as well as the case law of the forum, since it will reflect 
      the local sense of justice and public welfare. The fact that the <i>lex 
      fori</i> on the same point differs from the foreign law is not a sufficient 
      ground for denying recognition to the foreign claim. Fundamental values 
      must be at stake.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the conflict of laws, public policy must 
      connote more than local policy as regards internal affairs. It is true that 
      internal and external public policies stem from the national policy of the 
      forum but they differ in many material respects. Rules affecting public 
      policy and public morals in the internal legal sphere need not always have 
      the same character in the external sphere. Also, there should be a difference 
      of intensity in the application of the notion of public policy depending 
      on whether the court is asked to recognize a foreign right or legal relationship, 
      or to create or enforce one based on some foreign law. Public policy is 
      relative and in conflict of laws cases it represents a national policy operating 
      on the international level.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>If foreign law is to be refused any effect 
      on public policy grounds, it must violate some fundamental principle of 
      justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, or some deep-rooted tradition 
      of the forum. </span></p>
    <p align="center"> . . . .</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the common law provinces of Canada very 
      seldom has public policy been invoked in the courts with success, as this 
      exception has been construed narrowly.  [Footnotes omitted.] (pp. 171-172)</span><span>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The leading case in 
  Ontario on the meaning of public policy in this context is the decision of 
  this court in <i>Boardwalk Regency v. Maalouf, supra</i>. In that case, the 
  defendant had gambled on credit at the plaintiff's casino in New Jersey and 
  had written and dishonoured a cheque for $43,000 in payment of the debt. He 
  then allowed default judgment to go against him in New Jersey. When the casino 
  sought to enforce the judgment in Ontario, the defendant argued that it would 
  be contrary to the public policy reflected in the <i>Gaming Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1980, c. 183, which made wagering contracts void, consideration for gaming illegal 
  and contracts unenforceable. Carthy J.A. for the majority framed the issue as 
  follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>. . . The legal issue to be addressed is 
      whether the language of the <i>Gaming Act</i>, apart from its direct impact 
      on domestic contracts, is to be taken as an expression by the legislature 
      which bears the mantle of public policy to the point of making it offensive 
      to participate in enforcement of the foreign judgment. It cannot be every 
      statutory statement or prohibition which raises this defence or little would 
      be left of the principle of comity underlying conflict of laws jurisprudence. 
      (p. 742)</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In considering this issue, Carthy J.A. preferred 
  the narrow construction of public policy, quoting with approval the speech of 
  Lord Atkin in <i>Fender v. St John-Mildmay</i>, [1938] A.C. 1 (H.L.) at pp. 
  11-12, where he said that  the doctrine [of public policy] should only be 
  invoked in clear cases in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable, 
  and does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Carthy J.A. concluded 
  that gambling under license could be legal in Ontario and was not the type of 
  morally repugnant activity such as corruption of children that is tainted by 
  immorality in a way which mandated refusal of enforcement. Lacourcière J.A. 
  concurred with Carthy J.A., but added that because gambling was legal and regulated 
  in New Jersey, it would not offend the Canadian general public to enforce a 
  debt legally incurred in such a jurisdiction. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Arbour J. A. dissented. 
  She expressed the view that public policy should not be viewed solely in moral 
  terms. However, she was not prepared to resolve the morality debate concerning 
  gambling because in her view, the case turned on the fact that the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, prohibits keeping a common gaming house and 
  the commercial gambling activities of the casino could not have been licensed 
  and carried on legally in Ontario. She concluded: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>. . . It would not be sound public policy, 
      in my opinion, to permit recovery of a debt incurred outside Ontario under 
      circumstances that would be criminal under the same circumstances in Ontario, 
      and yet to deny recovery for gambling debts legally incurred here. To decide 
      otherwise, in my opinion, is to force Ontario public policy, as expressed 
      in part in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, to yield to foreign law. (p. 758)</span></p>

  </span></span> The issue of  public policy tends to arise in two conflicts

  the application of foreign law in an action tried in a Canadian court where 
  the foreign law may be contrary to the public policy of the Canadian forum.</p>

  other cases where either the foreign law or the judgment to be enforced has 
  conflicted with a statute of the forum, have come to the same conclusion and 
  result as did the majority in <i>Boardwalk Regency Corp. v. Maalouf, supra</i>. 
  In <i>Sigurdson v. Farrow </i>(1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 183 (Alta. Q.B.) an Alberta 
  statute prohibited actions on the covenant of a mortgage. The mortgaged land 
  was in British Columbia and the mortgage was made in Ontario. After default, 
  an action on the covenant was brought in Alberta. The court considered that 
  both the land and the mortgage were outside the province and concluded that 
  the policy of the Alberta statute did not engage &quot;. . . a principle of 
  morality or justice which commands almost universal recognition . . ., citing 
  from Dicey and Morris, <i>The Conflict of Laws</i>, 9<sup>th</sup> ed. (1973).</span></p>

  Acceptance Corporation Ltd. v. Matte</i> (1957), 9 D.L.R. (2d) 304 (Sask. C.A.) 
  where Saskatchewan law prohibited action on a conditional sale deficiency while 
  the Manitoba law (where the contract was made) did not, and <i>Nat'l Surety 
  Co. v. Larsen</i>, [1929] 4 D.L.R. 918 (B.C.C.A.) where the B.C. court was prepared 
  to apply the law of the State of Washington, which allowed indemnification of 
  loss on bail bond, while British Columbia law prohibited it. Both the offence 
  and the bail proceedings had taken place in Washington. The court concluded 
  again that there was no violation of an essential principle of justice nor would 
  permitting the appellant to prosecute the action be  . . . inherently repugnant 
  to moral and public interests . . . . (p.&nbsp;943)</p>

  (1981), 122 D.L.R. (3d) 323 (B.C.C.A.) was another action in British Columbia 
  to enforce a contract made and performed in another jurisdiction, in that case, 
  Alberta. The contract was for real estate commission, however, the land that 
  was sold was in British Columbia. British Columbia law required that real estate 
  agents be licenced in British Columbia as a precondition to an action to recover 
  commission. After concluding that Alberta rather than British Columbia substantive 
  law applied, the court considered whether recognizing the contract would be 
  contrary to the public policy of British Columbia in light of the statutory 
  prohibition. Again, the court concluded that this was not an issue which engaged 
  an essential public or moral interest. In other words, this particular public 
  policy of the province, as declared in the statute, reflected a legislative 
  choice for the ordering of affairs involving real estate transactions and agents, 
  but did not engage the fundamental values of British Columbia society.</span></p>

  </span></span> A somewhat more tentative approach was taken by Brennan J. in 
  <i>Kidron v. Grean </i>(1996), 48 O.R. 775 (Gen. Div.), where the plaintiff 
  was seeking enforcement of a California judgment which included an award of 
  $15 million for emotional distress. The issue was whether such an award was 
  contrary to the public policy of Ontario, on the basis that it conflicted with 
  the Supreme Court of Canada trilogy of decisions which placed a cap on awards 
  for pain and suffering and loss of amenities in certain circumstances.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> Brennan J. refused to grant summary 
  judgment on the California judgment, but instead ordered a trial on the public 
  policy issue. Brennan J.s concern was similar to that of the English Court 
  of Appeal in <i>Adams v. Cape Industries plc, supra</i> referred to earlier, 
  where the court refused to give effect to the Texas courts damages award on 
  the basis that it conflicted with both procedural and substantive justice under 
  English law. Whether the approach taken in these cases, based as it appears 
  to be on a conflict with the local substantive law <i>per se</i>, is consistent 
  with the weight of authority on the proper approach to public policy, need not 
  be decided in this case. </p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Kidron v. Grean, supra</span></i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'> can be usefully contrasted with the decision 
  of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Old North State Brewing Co. v. 
  Newlands Services Inc.</i> (1998), 23 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 217 (B.C.C.A.) 
  where the plaintiff was seeking enforcement of a North Carolina judgment. The 
  contract provided that the governing law was British Columbia and that the parties 
  would attorn to the British Columbia courts. However, the plaintiff brought 
  the action in North Carolina where the defendant did not attorn and the North 
  Carolina court applied its own law including an award of treble damages. The 
  British Columbia court granted the enforcement proceedings, holding that the 
  jurisdiction clause was not exclusive, that the North Carolina court could apply 
  its own law where it had no evidence that British Columbia law was different, 
  and that an award of treble damages was not contrary to . . . the essential 
  or moral interests of British Columbia . . . The latter conclusion was based 
  on the analysis that because a federal statute gave the Attorney General of 
  Canada the power to declare treble damage awards unenforceable in certain anti-trust 
  cases, it follows that in other circumstances, such awards are enforceable.</span></p>
<p style='

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The public policy 
  exemption was also denied in the enforcement action of <i>United States of America 
  v. Ivey, supra. </i>The plaintiffs sought summary judgment in their action in 
  Ontario to enforce two Michigan judgments obtained under the United States CERCLA 
  environmental protection regime. In granting the enforcement judgment in Ontario, 
  the court rejected the submission that enforcement would be contrary to our 
  public policy just because the provisions of the CERCLA regime were more onerous 
  than under the Ontario <i>Environmental Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  C-43.</span></p>

  </span></span> The review of the case law confirms that the public policy exemption 
  is narrow, when considered both in the context of applying foreign law in actions 
  brought in Canadian jurisdictions, as well as in enforcing foreign judgments 
  in Canadian provinces, and therefore, it has rarely been applied. This is consistent 
  with the trend expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in both <i>Morguard 
  Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>, [1990]<i> </i>3 S.C.R. 1077 and in <i>Tolofson 
  v. Jensen</i>, [1994] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 1022; the two cases which have set the modern 
  rule for both interprovincial recognition of judgments of other provinces, and 
  for the choice of law of the <i>lex loci delicti </i>for automobile accidents 
  which have multi-provincial connections. That trend is to emphasize the concept 
  of comity among nations and particularly among provinces of this country when 
  addressing the issue of enforcement of judgments and choice of law. In both 
  cases, the role of the public policy concept was left, in effect, as a safety 
  valve to prevent anomalies. In <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, supra</i>, 
  La Forest J. said that to alleviate possible unfairness to a defendant sued 
  out of his or her home province, the enforcing court has the discretion not 
  to recognize a judgment in conflict with the public policy of that province<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a>. In <i>Tolofson v. Jensen, supra</i> 
  he noted that if a wrong would not be actionable in the forum had it been committed 
  there, that may be a factor to be weighed both when determining <i>forum non 
  conveniens </i>and when deciding whether entertaining the action would be contrary 
  to the public policy of the forum.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Having confirmed that 
  the trend of the jurisprudence is that the public policy exemption is to be 
  narrowly construed and rarely applied, the issue in this case is whether to 
  enforce judgments when the party seeking enforcement acknowledged breaching 
  the Ontario <i>Securities Act</i> prospectus requirement. Does this breach have 
  the necessary moral opprobrium traditionally required for the application of 
  the public policy exemption? Or, as counsel submitted, should the concept of 
  our public policy be broadened to encompass a breach of this nature?</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The legislative objective 
  of the <i>Securities Act</i> has recently been reiterated by this court in <i>Québec 
  (Sa Majestié du Chef) v. Ontario Securities Commission</i> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 
  577 at 590 (C.A.) where the court stated: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span> </span>the simple legislative objective involved in this appeal 
      is regulation of the operation of capital markets in Ontario for the protection 
      <i>of all who use them</i>. This includes the protection of persons and 
      corporations dealing in Ontario markets whether or not they are resident 
      in Ontario. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The fundamental importance 
  of the prospectus in our jurisdiction for the orderly, fair and reliable operation 
  of our financial markets can be safely said to be undisputed. As Henry J. stated 
  in <i>Jones v. F. H. Deacon Hodgson Inc.</i> (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 540 at 546 
  (H.C.): </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>There can be no question but that the filing 
      of a prospectus and its acceptance by the commission is fundamental to the 
      protection of the investing public who are contemplating purchase of the 
      shares. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Furthermore, the same can be said of similar securities legislation 
  in other jurisdictions. This has been amply demonstrated by the judicial struggle 
  in the numerous actions in the United States (and elsewhere) involving Lloyd's 
  and the Names of the particular jurisdictions to reconcile the importance of 
  securities regulation laws to the operation of local financial markets, with 
  the international aspect of the Lloyd's contractual arrangements with its Names 
  from jurisdictions around the world<a href="#_ftn5"

  </span></span> Because the primacy of the protection of our capital markets 
  and the role that the full, true and plain disclosure obligations and the anti-fraud 
  measures contained in securities regulation legislation plays in the scheme 
  for that protection is basic to the  well-being of our economy and our society, 
  it is, in my view, beyond dispute that taken on its own and in isolation from 
  other factors, to condone a breach of those obligations would be contrary to 
  the public policy of Ontario. However, to view the disclosure obligation provisions 
  of the <i>Securities Act</i>, such as the prospectus requirement, as akin to 
  a moral imperative may be to stretch the concepts unnecessarily. Public policy 
  has been universally described as &quot;fundamental values&quot; and &quot;essential 
  principles of justice&quot;. In my view, it is appropriate at this stage in 
  the development of our society, to characterize the protection of our capital 
  markets and of the public who invest in and depend on the confident and consistent 
  operation of those markets as such a fundamental value.</p>

  </span></span> <span> </span>That does not mean, however, that in this case 
  enforcement of the U.K. judgment must be denied as contrary to public policy. 
  The issue of whether enforcement of a U.K. judgment must be refused as contrary 
  to public policy in Ontario does not merely involve a definitional approach 
  to the meaning of public policy but requires a consideration of all the dimensions 
  of the case which carry implications for public policy. To determine whether 
  enforcement of  the  particular  judgment  would  be  contrary to the public 
  policy of Ontario, the court must consider the historical and factual context 
  of the proceedings which led to the granting of the judgment, and where there 
  are competing public policy imperatives, whether overall, registration would 
  be contrary to public policy.</p>
<p style='
'> <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The major aspect of the factual context of these judgments is 
  readily distinguishable from most of the recent cases. The distinction in this 
  case is the agreement of the parties before Swinton J. to assume the fact that 
  had Lloyd's sought to enforce the obligations incurred by the Names in their 
  investments with Lloyd's in Ontario, because no prospectus was delivered or 
  filed, such an action would not have been entertained by an Ontario court: <i>Jones 
  v. F. H. Deacon</i> <i>Hodgson Inc., supra.</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In many of the cases 
  where courts have declined to apply public policy, the obligation arose outside 
  the jurisdiction and in conformity with local law, such as in <i>Boardwalk Regency 
  Corp. v. Maalouf, supra</i>, <i>Sigurdson v. Farrow, supra</i>, and <i>Nat'l 
  Surety Co. v. Larsen, supra</i>. As Carthy J. A. stated in <i>Boardwalk Regency 
  Corp. v. Maalouf, supra</i>, if we were to treat every Ontario statutory enactment 
  as an expression of our public policy for this purpose, little would be left 
  of the principle of judicial comity. However, in this case, it is agreed or 
  assumed that the basis for the judgment is an illegal trade in securities which 
  actually did occur in Ontario.</span></p>
<p style='

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[69]<span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Therefore, the public 
  policy may not turn exclusively on repugnance for the fundamental values represented 
  by the underlying legal basis for the judgment, but on whether our courts are 
  prepared to enforce a foreign judgment when an action on the same cause, had 
  it been litigated in Ontario, would not have been entertained.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my view, both on 
  the basis of the assumed fact that there was a breach of the <i>Securities Act</i> 
  making the underlying transaction <i>prima facie</i> unenforceable in an action 
  brought in Ontario at the suit of Lloyd's, and because I am satisfied that such 
  non-compliance with our <i>Securities Act</i> does involve what in todays society 
  are viewed as fundamental and essential values, the enforcement of such a judgment 
  in many circumstances would be prohibited under the <i>Reciprocal Enforcement 
  of Judgments (U.K.) Act</i> as contrary to the public policy of Ontario.</span></p>

  there are two factors which, when weighed against the breach of the <i>Securities

  public policy to register and enforce these judgments in Ontario:</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The plaintiffs had 
  brought an action for a declaration that their agreements with Lloyd's were 
  void <i>ab initio</i> on two grounds. One, that they were induced by fraud, 
  and two, that the agreements were made in contravention of the <i>Securities 
  Act</i>. They also sought rescission of the agreements on those bases. The defendant 
  sought a stay on the basis of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the plaintiffs 
  agreements with Lloyd's, and alternatively pleaded <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>McKeown J. first determined 
  that even if fraud was proven, the agreements containing the forum selection 
  clause would not be abrogated to the extent of the choice of forum clause. In 
  the face of the plaintiffs agreement that the English courts would have exclusive 
  jurisdiction over any disputes they might have with Lloyd's, the plaintiffs 
  had the onus of showing strong cause why Ontario would be a more appropriate 
  forum than England. McKeown J. found three factors which favoured Ontario: (a) 
  the plaintiffs were only 70 out of 35,000 Names, 81% of whom were located in 
  England; (b) the plaintiffs cause of action was under an Ontario statute, the 
  <i>Securities Act</i>; and (c) the law of Ontario was possibly more favourable 
  than that of England in respect of fraud. However, he identified 20 points of 
  contact with England including the fact that the documentation for all of the 
  Names was the same and included both the exclusive jurisdiction and choice of 
  law clauses and the relief sought would necessarily impact the others; the experts, 
  documents, witnesses, the Central Fund which is for the protection of all policyholders, 
  the Names Association and other persons and entities associated with the issues 
  were all in England; and the plaintiffs filed no evidence that they would be 
  disadvantaged by proceeding in England. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the latter regard, 
  McKeown J. proceeded on the basis that the English courts would apply Ontario 
  law if it were determined to be applicable. He also noted that the plaintiffs 
  faced a number of problems with their <i>Securities Act</i> claim, including 
  the fact that they had benefited from their Lloyd's membership over many years, 
  so that there was an issue as to whether the contracts could be voided in those 
  circumstances. (This was of course, ultimately the basis for the plaintiffs 
  failure to obtain rescission, even for fraud.) McKeown J. also commented at 
  p. 252 that: There is no reason to believe that the English courts would not 
  apply the <i>Securities Act</i>. In light of his earlier reference to English 
  courts applying Ontario law only if it were determined to be applicable, I read 
  this statement as subject to the same qualification.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>McKeown J. concluded 
  that a permanent stay of the Ontario action was appropriate. His reasons were 
  fully endorsed by the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is clear from the 
  detailed reasons of McKeown J., adopted by the Court of Appeal, that both he 
  and this court were well aware of the nature of the plaintiffs claims of both 
  fraud and breach of the <i>Securities Act</i>, and of the potential consequences 
  of staying the Ontario actions in favour of litigation of all issues in England. 
  They also adverted specifically to the possibility that the English courts would 
  not find Ontario law to be the proper law of the contracts. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In other words, the 
  outcome that eventually resulted was contemplated as a possible outcome when 
  the Ontario courts effectively sent the case to proceed in England. The decision 
  of this court that the Lloyd's cases were to be heard in England and not in 
  Ontario was effectively a decision that if the English courts determined that 
  Ontario law was not the proper law of the contracts, the judgments that flowed 
  from that decision would not be contrary to our public policy. Had this court 
  been of the view that compliance with the <i>Securities Act</i> was so basic 
  to the public policy of Ontario that a judgment which did not give effect to 
  the Act could never be registered and enforced, no matter what the circumstances, 
  then it would have treated that as a factor which, in effect, trumped all other 
  factors, including the exclusive jurisdiction clause and the connections to 
  England, and it would not have stayed the action. To now conclude that the English 
  judgments are unenforceable in Ontario as contrary to the public policy of this 
  jurisdiction, would undermine the credibility of the earlier decisions of our 
  courts and of our judicial system.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The issue of the breach 
  of the Ontario <i>Securities Act</i> was one of the two central issues brought 
  before McKeown J. in <i>Ash v. Lloyd's Corp., supra</i> in 1991. This court 
  was prepared to have that issue addressed by the English courts and to accept 
  the result. In effect, the Ontario courts determined that <i>in this case</i>, 
  it would not be contrary to the public policy of Ontario to enforce a judgment 
  which may have condoned a breach of the <i>Securities Act</i>.<u></u></span></p>

  also the conclusion reached by the U.S. District Court in <i>Lloyds v. Ashenden, 
  supra</i> a similar enforcement action in respect of the Equitas premium judgments 
  obtained by Lloyds. In that case, as in this one, the Illinois Names first 
  sought to have their claims for rescission of the Lloyds agreements tried in 
  Illinois, but their actions were stayed on the basis of the choice of forum 
  clause. One of the issues which the court had considered but rejected in the 
  earlier case, was that granting the stay and upholding the choice of forum clause 
  was contrary to Illinois public policy because it would offend the Illinois 
  Securities Act. When the Names sought to raise the same public policy argument 
  again in the enforcement context, the court held that that argument was foreclosed.</span></p>

  are international contracts, involving an English insurance/investment system 
  where the participant members or Names are located world-wide. All Names entered 
  into the same agreements wherein they agreed to litigate their disputes in England 
  under English law. Names are solicited in their home jurisdictions, many of 
  which have securities legislation with provisions similar in purpose to the 
  Ontario <i>Securities Act</i> in terms of providing full and honest disclosure 
  of all material information which investors need in order to make informed investment 
  decisions, and thereby to protect the investing public.</span><span>

  have faced the same public policy argument made by the appellants have almost 
  uniformly rejected it on the basis of international comity principles. For example, 
  in <i>Richards v. Lloyds of London</i>, 135 F.3d 1289 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 
  1998) the Names sought an order invalidating the choice of forum clause in their 
  agreements with Lloyds. The majority of the court rejected the Names' public 
  policy argument on the basis that the contracts with Lloyd's were international, 
  the forum selection clause in international contracts is very important and 
  should be applied even if that means that foreign law will be applied, and English 
  law and English courts would provide the Names with sufficient protection. A 
  similar result was reached in <i>Bonny v. Society of Lloyds</i>, 3&nbsp;F.3d 
  156 (7<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1993); <i>Riley v. Kingsley Underwriting Agencies</i>,<i> 
  </i>969 F.2d 953 (10<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1992); and<i> Lipcon v. Lloyds</i>,

  of upholding forum selection clauses, even if to do so may result in conflict

      be to conclude that the reach of the United States securities laws [is] 
      unbounded <i>Richards</i>, and to ignore the Supreme Courts caveat that 
      [w]e cannot have trade and commerce in world markets and international

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Supreme Court 
  of Canada has recently expressed a similar sentiment with respect to the reach 
  of provincial securities legislation. In <i>Committee for Equal Treatment of 
  Asbestos Minority Shareholders v. Ontario (Securities Commission), </i>2001 
  S.C.C. 37, the issue was the Commissions discretion to exercise its authority 
  to sanction under s.&nbsp;127(1) of the <i>Securities Act</i>. In its conclusion 
  that the decision of the Commission not to do so be upheld, the court stated:<i></i></span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is true that the OSC placed significant 
      emphasis on the transactional connection factor. However, it was entitled 
      to do so in order to avoid using the open-ended nature of s. 127 powers 
      as a means to police too broadly out of province transactions. Capital markets 
      and securities transactions are becoming increasingly international: see 
      <i>Global Securities Corp. v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 
      </i>[2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, 2000 SCC 21, at paras. 27-28. There are a myriad 
      of overlapping, regulatory jurisdictions governing securities transactions. 
      Under s. 2.1, para. 5 of the Act, one of the fundamental principles that 
      the OSC has to consider is that [t]he integration of capital markets is 
      supported and promoted by the sound and responsible harmonization and co-ordination 
      of securities regulation regimes. A transaction that is contrary to the 
      policy of the Ontario <i>Securities Act </i>may be acceptable under another 
      regulatory regime. Thus, the OSCs insistence on a more clear and direct 
      connection with Ontario in this case reflects a sound and responsible approach 
      to long-arm regulation and the potential for conflict amongst the different 
      regulatory regimes that govern the capital markets in the global economy.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This observation by 
  the Supreme Court is consistent with the direction taken by the U.S. courts 
  and other Canadian courts on this same issue and with the principles of international 
  comity which now play an increasingly important role in the approach of the 
  courts to issues involving international commerce. For example, in <i>Hunt v. 
  T &amp; N plc, </i>[1993] 4 S.C.R. 289 at p. 321 La Forest J. reiterated the 
  modern approach:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>A central idea in that judgment [<i>Morguard 
      Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>] was comity. But as I stated, at p. 1098, 
      I do not think it much matters whether one calls these rules of comity 
      or simply relies directly on the reasons of justice, necessity and convenience 
      that underlie them. In my view, the old common law rules relating to recognition 
      and enforcement were rooted in an outmoded conception of the world that 
      emphasized sovereignty and independence, often at the cost of unfairness. 
      Greater comity is required in our modern era when international transactions 
      involve a constant flow of products, wealth and people across the globe.</span></p>

  that have recognized the authority of the English courts to hear and decide 
  all of the Lloyds litigation and have decided to enforce the resulting judgments, 
  have been satisfied that to grant rescission to some Names, when the insurance 
  policies which they have underwritten remain outstanding, would create a situation 
  of economic chaos as well as unfairness. Tuckey J. in <i>The Society of Lloyd's 
  v. Daly, supra</i> referred to such an outcome as an anomoly, which it clearly 
  would be. Furthermore, because the Names would retain their obligations under 
  those policies, they would benefit from the Equitas scheme. Therefore, the result 
  reached by the English courts, that the Names must pursue their damages remedy 
  for fraud after paying their premiums and participating in the scheme necessary 
  to retain the viability of this very important worldwide insurance market, is 
  a sensible one. In that context, our public policy of enforcing the rules of 
  comity where justice, necessity and convenience all favour enforcement, outweighs 
  the concerns we might otherwise have where there has been a breach of the prospectus 
  requirement of our <i>Securities Act</i>.</span></p>

  was reached by many of the U.S. courts which considered the same issues between 
  Lloyd's and the Names. For example, in<i> Allen v. Lloyds of London</i>, 94 
  F.3d 923 (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1996), a case which upheld the choice of forum 
  clause, the court noted: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Finally, significant United States and foreign 
      interests would be adversely affected if we were to insist that Lloyds 
      insurance underwriting syndicates comply with United States disclosure requirements. 
      Such a ruling would place at risk billions of dollars of insurance coverage 
      for United States citizens because American Names could demand rescission 
      on the ground that their syndicates, even though they include citizens of 
      various countries, did not comply with United States securities registration 
      and disclosure requirements. Insurance commissioners from several states 
      have described the potential mass confusion and damage to the domestic insurance 
      market that such a ruling would cause. (para. 30)</span></p>

  be enforced in Ontario because they had been satisfied in whole or in part. 
  That argument was dismissed. Although it is listed as a ground of appeal in

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The issue arose originally 
  as a result of the successful actions for negligence by some of the Names against 
  their Managing and Member Agents. The right to the proceeds of the judgments 
  in those actions was claimed by Lloyd's in its capacity as trustee of the Lloyds 
  Premium Trust Fund. The House of Lords eventually determined that Lloyds was 
  entitled to the proceeds on that basis. Once Lloyds had obtained judgment against 
  the Names for the Equitas premiums, the Names who had monies from judgments 
  against the agents sought to have those monies applied against the Equitas premium 
  judgments rather than against the Premium Trust Fund or Central Fund. At the 
  time of the application before and the decision of Swinton J., the funds were 
  still being held in solicitors accounts and had not yet been turned over to 
  Lloyds, although they were transferred shortly thereafter. Lloyds then continued 
  to hold the funds without applying them either to the Central Fund or the Equitas 
  judgments until November 10, 2000, after receipt of the decision in <i>The Society 
  of Lloyd's v. Jaffray</i>, [2000] E.W.J. No. 5731 (Q.B.D.), the Threshold Fraud 
  test case. At that time, Lloyd's elected to apply the funds to the Equitas judgments. 
  As a result, seven of the appellants have now had their judgments satisfied 
  in full, while 19 others have had the amounts of the judgments against them 
  reduced.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On November 3, 2000, 
  Cresswell J. delivered a lengthy and detailed judgment in <i>The Society of 
  Lloyd's v. Jaffray, supra, </i>on the Threshold Fraud Point. Cresswell J. was 
  sympathetic to the plight of the Names and noted in his conclusion that: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>External Names (whether they accepted R &amp; 
      R or not) were the innocent victims of the failings and incompetence [of 
      underwriters, managing agents, members' agents, and others]. Many Names 
      have suffered enormously in financial and personal terms. (para. 1452)</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=DefinitionTerm><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>However, he found in favour of Lloyds and 
  against the Names on the Threshold Fraud Point which he described as follows: 
  </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'> [w]]hether Lloyds made misrepresentations 
      which it knew to be untrue and/or as to which it was reckless whether they 
      were true or false, and whether such misrepresentations were communicated 
      to the Names and if so, when? (para.&nbsp;22).</span></p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=DefinitionList> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>These allegations 
  of fraud, which have now been dismissed, formed the basis of all the litigation 
  between the Names and Lloyd's. In particular, the claim for rescission and the 
  resultant position taken in this proceeding that the judgments obtained by Lloyd's 
  should not be enforced, was based on the appellants' claim that they did not 
  have the opportunity to litigate the allegations of fraud.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Subject to any appeals from this judgment, 
  the result in <i>The Society of Lloyd's v. Jaffray, supra</i>, unacceptable 
  though it may be to the Names, brings to a close the basis of their dispute 
  with Lloyd's over their original dealings with Lloyd's through which they became 
  Members and Names.</span></p>
<p class=DefinitionList> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Cresswell J. concludes with a recommendation 
  for an independent review panel to consider individually the cases of those 
  Names who did not accept the R &amp; R Plan to try to reach a fair settlement 
  with each of them.</span></p>
<p class=DefinitionList><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;

  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the result I would dismiss the appeal. 
  Costs will follow the event unless counsel wish to bring to the attention of 
  the court any basis for a different disposition.</span></p>

    puts the appellants case at its highest. It is not certain what the result 
    would be have been, had Lloyd's sued  to enforce the Equitas premium obligation 
    in Ontario, in light of the passage of time since the original contracts were 
    made and the issues relied on by the English courts in their findings that 
    <i>restitutio in integrum</i> was not possible, so that the remedy of rescission 
    was not available, as well as the fact that many third parties including policyholders 
    and other Names would be adversely affected by such a result: <i>Sidmay Ltd. 
    v. Wehttam Investments Ltd.</i> (1967), 61 D.L.R. (2d) 358 (O.C.A.); <i>Royal
