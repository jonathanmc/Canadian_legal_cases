<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul H. Megginson dated December 20, 
  1999.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant, a young person, was found guilty of uttering a 
  threat to cause death or bodily harm to the complainant with respect to an October 
  1998 incident.  He was acquitted of uttering a threat to cause death to the 
  same complainant relating to a subsequent incident on February 2, 1999.  The 
  disposition imposed on the appellant in relation to the October 1998 incident 
  was 18 months’ probation to be interrupted by a secure custody disposition of 
  45 days commencing July 4, 2000, when the appellant would have finished school.  
  The appellant appeals his conviction on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence and failed to apply the test in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 
  C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C).  In addition, the appellant appeals his disposition.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>Issue</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown conceded that the disposition is illegal because the 
  period of probation starts before the custodial portion.  The Crown asks that 
  the custodial disposition be maintained.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>Facts</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The October incident is alleged to have taken place while the 
  complainant, standing in a school parking lot, was conversing with the appellant 
  as he sat in the rear of his friend’s car.  The complainant testified that she 
  made a remark to the appellant that prompted the appellant to call her a “smart 
  ass”, and then to point a firearm or imitation firearm at her, saying that he 
  would “put a bullet” in her.  The complainant’s friend, M.&nbsp;McC., testified 
  that, after the incident, the complainant looked “really scared.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant denied that he had a weapon or that he had threatened 
  the complainant. The driver of the car, C.H., testified that he had no recollection 
  of any such incident but that, if the incident had taken place, he would have 
  recalled it.  In addition, R.S., a friend of the appellant, testified that the 
  complainant later told her she had made up the story.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In acquitting the appellant of the February incident, the trial 
  judge found that the complainant had deliberately lied about her participation 
  in that altercation and that this was “a negative factor concerning [her] credibility.”  
  Nevertheless, he found that the fact that the complainant had deliberately lied 
  at the same trial in respect of allegations against the same accused (and where, 
  therefore, the animus to lie would be the same), “simply does not logically 
  ‘carry over’ to assessment of [her] credibility (nor M. McC.’s) concerning these 
  counts” (the October 1998 counts).  Instead, he commented favourably on the 
  complainant’s testimonial demeanour with respect to this incident, although 
  he noted that demeanour cannot be determinative.  He also accepted the evidence 
  of the complainant’s friend, M.&nbsp;McC., who said that the complainant told 
  her what had happened shortly after the alleged incident.  M. McC. had also 
  given evidence for the Crown with respect to the February event, and in that 
  case her evidence did not satisfy the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge also discounted all the defence evidence on the 
  basis that it was at variance and therefore unreliable.  It is not surprising 
  that descriptions may not coincide where the witnesses say that to their recollection 
  that date was uneventful.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Also, that characterization cannot apply to the evidence of R.S. 
  who testified that the complainant had told her that her story about the appellant 
  was untrue.  The trial judge’s only comment about this evidence was: “In fairness, 
  I also observe that R.S., in terms of testimonial demeanour, presented (as did 
  J.&nbsp;McA. [the complainant]) as a cogent, coherent, intelligent and articulate 
  witness.”  In other words, the trial judge commented favourably on the evidence 
  of this witness, yet gave it no effect in coming to his conclusion that the 
  evidence as a whole satisfied him of the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Similarly, the trial judge did not refer in his review of “all 
  the evidence” relating to the October incident to the evidence of C.H., the 
  boy who was alleged to be driving the car on the date of the incident.  He had 
  no memory of the incident and denied ever seeing a gun.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown relies on <i>R. v. Burns</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 
  193 (S.C.C.)<i>, </i>as well as <i>R. v. Barrett</i> (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 
  319 (S.C.C.) for the proposition that a trial judge’s reasons need not reflect 
  the full extent of his or her analysis of the facts or of the law, and that 
  trial judges are presumed to know and apply the law.  However, these cases do 
  not apply where, as here, the reasons of the trial judge suggest that he misapprehended 
  some of the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his reasons, the trial judge did not make reference to any 
  instruction to himself on the application of the test in <i>W.(D.). </i> Although 
  reference to the case by name is not necessary, the application of the test 
  in weighing and assessing the evidence as a whole is mandatory.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It appears from the reasons of the trial judge in this case that 
  he did not apply <i>W.(D.)</i>.  It appears that because the trial judge accepted 
  the complainant’s evidence respecting the October 1998 incident, he rejected 
  the defence evidence without considering whether it gave rise to a reasonable 
  doubt.  The evidence of R.S. alone, if not rejected, could raise a reasonable 
  doubt.  Taken together with the impaired credibility of the complainant based 
  on her deliberate lie regarding the February occurrence, the verdict of guilty 
  is unsafe and cannot stand.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These flaws in the trial judge’s analysis render the verdict 
  unreasonable within the parameters articulated in <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> (2000), 
  143 C.C.C. 1 at 21 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Burke </i>(1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 205 
  (S.C.C.), and require this court to set aside the verdict of guilty.  In discussing 
  the test for an appellate court to apply in determining whether the judgment 
  of a trial judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, the 
  Court in <i>Biniaris</i> (at 22) stated that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he court of appeal often can and should identify the defects in the 
      analysis that led the trier of fact to an unreasonable conclusion.  The 
      court of appeal will therefore be justified to intervene and set aside a 
      verdict as unreasonable when the reasons of the trial judge reveal that 
      he or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict 
      inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Section 686(2) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>allows 
  a Court of Appeal which quashes a conviction on the basis that the verdict is 
  an unreasonable one, to order a new trial or enter an acquittal.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It would be unfair to the appellant to face a new trial relating 
  to the October 1998 incident alone before a trier of fact who would not hear 
  all of the evidence of the complainant relating to both incidents, including 
  what the trial judge considered to be deliberate lies in connection with the 
  February 1999 incident.  Accordingly, this court must substitute a verdict of 
  not guilty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal is therefore allowed, the conviction 
  is set aside and a verdict of acquittal entered.</span></p>
