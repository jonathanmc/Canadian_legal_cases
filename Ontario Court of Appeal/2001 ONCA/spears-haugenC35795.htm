      <p style='text-align:justify' align="left">On appeal from the judgment of 
        Justice Susanne R. Goodman dated January 8, 2001 in Newmarket.</p>
      <h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant is the mother of two daughters, 
        ages 15 and 13 years old. She appeals from the judgment of Goodman J. 
        which awarded custody of her two daughters to her sister, their aunt, 
        Lorrie Spears. The appellant represented herself on the appeal as she 
        did at the trial. No one appeared for the father of the children or for 
        the aunt. Counsel for the childrens’ lawyer opposed the appeal, representing 
        the interests of the children.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant has many concerns and disputes 
        arising out of her problems with her husband and her subsequent loss of 
        all of her property, for which she blames many people and government agencies. 
        From the reasons of the trial judge, it appears that the appellant’s constant 
        focus on her grievances was one of the reasons for the conclusion that 
        it would not be in the best interests of the children to be in the permanent 
        custody of their mother.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>To her credit, the appellant was able 
        to limit her submissions to the grounds of appeal on the issue of custody 
        alone. The appellant raised concerns regarding her sister’s care of the 
        children and their failure to thrive. Her position is that it is in their 
        best interests to be in the custody and care of their mother. She said 
        that they are failing in school, and are unsupervised. </span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> She also raised issues regarding the proceedings below 
        including the propriety of the social worker’s assessment of  the situation; 
        she advised the court that he did not come into her home. However, from 
        the reasons, it appears that his role was to determine the wishes of the 
        children and not to conduct a custody assessment, which may explain why 
        he did not attend at the appellant’s home. She also complained that she 
        had approached legal aid several times but did not have a lawyer. On this 
        point, the children’s lawyer advised the court that it was her understanding 
        that when the appellant applied for legal aid, she did not qualify because 
        of her assets. The appellant also objected to the fact that the trial 
        judge was prepared to accept the lower expectations of the aunt for the 
        children as more realistic than those of the mother regarding their education.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We do not minimize the concerns expressed 
        by the appellant about her children. They demonstrate how much she cares 
        about her children as their mother. However, the reasons of the trial 
        judge reveal that she gained a very complete understanding of the situation. 
        In our view, the reasons of the trial judge are both thorough and even-handed 
        in their approach. The trial judge weighed and considered all of the evidence 
        carefully and applied the correct legal principles in concluding that 
        in all of the circumstances, it was in the best interests of the children 
        that they be in the custody of their aunt.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge specifically found that: 
        “I have no hesitation in finding, based on the evidence of Mr. Jenkinson 
        [the social worker] and that of the aunt, that the children have been 
        living in and will continue to live in a stable home environment while 
        at their aunt’s home.” (par. 38) She also took into account the distance 
        to Elliott Lake where the aunt lives, which makes it very difficult for 
        the appellant to have access to the children. On that point she concluded 
        that any access difficulties are outweighed by the benefits of the “stable, 
        loving environment” the children have with their aunt.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We have no basis to interfere with these 
        findings and conclusions based on the record before us. If there is new 
        information which changes the circumstances in a way which warrants a 
        variation of the custody arrangements, the appellant may consider seeking 
        a variation of the custody order. If she does so, it would be most helpful 
        for her to seek the assistance of counsel.</span></p>

        without costs.</span></p></td>
