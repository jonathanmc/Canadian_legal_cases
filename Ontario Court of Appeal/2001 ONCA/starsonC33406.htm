<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-weight:normal'>On appeal from the judgment 
  of Madam Justice Molloy dated November 26, 1999</span></h1>
<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:200%;'><b> BY THE COURT:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Professor Starson is an exceptionally intelligent man.  His field of 
  expertise is physics.  Although he has no formal qualifications in that field, 
  he is in regular contact with some of the leading physicists in the world.  
  In 1991 he co-authored an article entitled “Discrete Anti-Gravity” with Professor 
  H. Pierre Noyes, who teaches physics at Stanford University and is the Director 
  of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  Professor Noyes has described Professor 
  Starson’s thinking in the field of physics as being ten years ahead of its time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Unfortunately, Professor Starson has a history of mental illness, dating 
  back to 1985.  He has been diagnosed as suffering from a bipolar affective disorder.  
  On several occasions during the last 15 years he has spent time in mental institutions.  
  In November 1998 Professor Starson was found not criminally responsible on account 
  of mental disorder on two counts of uttering death threats.  In January 1999 
  the Ontario Review Board ordered that he be detained at the Centre of Addiction 
  and Mental Health (the Centre). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants Dr. Ian Swayze and Dr. Paul Posner are psychiatrists 
  at the Centre.  They proposed to treat Professor Starson with mood stabilizers 
  and with anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety and anti-parkinsonian medication.  Professor 
  Starson refused treatment.  On January 20, 1999, the Consent and Capacity Board 
  (the Board) found that Professor Starson was not capable of making his own decisions 
  about treatment.  Professor Starson appealed the Board’s finding.  In a thorough 
  and well-reasoned decision dated November 26, 1998, Molloy J. concluded that 
  the Board’s finding was unreasonable and she set it aside.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Swayze and Dr. Posner appeal Molloy J.'s decision to this court.  
  After much deliberation, we have decided to dismiss the appeal.  Because Molloy 
  J.’s decision is so comprehensive, and because we substantially agree with it, 
  we will not trammel on her work.  Instead, we will restrict our observations 
  to the essence of our own reasoning.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The legal test for determining whether a person is capable of making 
  his or her own treatment decisions is found in s. 4(1) of the <i>Health Care 
  Consent Act</i>,<i> 1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c.2 (the Act).  It is a two-part test.  
  A person is “capable with respect to treatment” only if the person is both “able 
  to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision about the 
  treatment” and “able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of 
  a decision or lack of decision”:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>4. (1) A person is capable with respect to treatment, admission to a care 
      facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to understand 
      the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, 
      admission or personal assistance service, as the case may be, and able to 
      appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack 
      of decision.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under s. 4(2) of the Act, a person is “presumed to be capable with respect 
  to treatment...”.  The onus therefore rested on the appellants to show, on a 
  balance of probabilities, that Professor Starson was incapable of making his 
  own treatment decisions because he did not meet either or both parts of the 
  test in s. 4(1).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants contend that Molloy J. misapplied both the standard of 
  review and the statutory test in s.4(1).  We disagree.  The body charged with 
  deciding whether a person is capable with respect to treatment is the Board.  
  It is a specialized tribunal and its findings are therefore entitled to deference 
  from a reviewing court.  As this court said in <i>I.T. v. L.L. and T.C.</i> 
  (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 284, the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.  
  This is the standard Molloy J. applied.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further, Molloy J.'s reasons show that she properly applied the two-part 
  test in s. 4(1).  Her conclusion that the Board’s finding of incapacity was 
  unreasonable is not only amply supported by the evidence and her analysis of 
  it, it is also, in our view, correct.  Like Molloy J., we are satisfied that 
  Professor Starson was both able to understand the information relevant to making 
  a decision about his treatment and able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable 
  consequences of his decision to refuse treatment.  Our conclusion that Professor 
  is capable with respect to treatment is supported by three important considerations 
  in the record.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, Professor Starson recognizes that he has mental problems.  Unquestionably, 
  he has a deep distrust of psychiatry, which he likens to a religion.  His reply 
  to the question whether he recognizes he is mentally ill was unresponsive but 
  logical: He answered that the question left him in a “catch 22” situation.  
  If he said “yes”, the authorities would say he must be treated for it; if he 
  said “no”, the authorities would say he must be treated because he lacks insight 
  into his illness.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Despite his distrust of psychiatry and his logical refusal to concede 
  that he has a mental illness, Professor Starson acknowledged in his evidence 
  that he has mental problems.  He stated that when these problems first surfaced 
  in the mid-1980s they were “almost impossible” to handle.  When asked whether 
  these problems have been resolved since that time, he replied: &quot;No&quot;.  
  At the very least, Professor Starson acknowledged exhibiting the symptoms of 
  the “labels” Dr. Swayze puts on him, suggesting an ability to understand the 
  nature of his condition and its manifestations.  In his own words, “I certainly 
  have exhibited the symptoms of these labels that you give ... and certainly 
  I have exhibited things that would be considered manic”.   This is not the testimony 
  of a man who, as the appellants contend, is in &quot;total denial&quot; of his 
  illness.  In fact, Professor Starson understands the benefit of some treatment 
  in his life.  He simply prefers to work on his problems in a therapeutic relationship 
  with Dr. Posner, without taking psychiatric medications.  Any discussion about 
  whether Professor Starson refers to himself as suffering from a 'mental illness' 
  is therefore simply a debate over semantics.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second important consideration is that the appellants led no evidence 
  that any of the many psychiatric medications forced on Professor Starson in 
  the past had ever actually helped him.  While Professor Starson agreed that 
  a person should be on medication if that person thinks the medication is helping, 
  he did not think that the medications he had taken had helped him: “I’ve been 
  through all the treatment.  It hasn’t worked”.  The appellants did not suggest 
  otherwise.  Indeed, Dr. Swayze admitted that none of the drugs Professor Starson 
  had received permitted him to function even “adequately”, and that it was &quot;unclear&quot; 
  whether they ever would.  Moreover, according to Professor Starson, the side 
  effects of the treatments “have always been the most horrible experiences of 
  my life”.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third and by far the most important consideration, the consideration 
  that lies at the root of Professor Starson’s refusal to accept treatment, is 
  his evaluation of the consequences of treatment on his scientific work.  The 
  intended effect of the psychiatric medications is to slow down Professor Starson's 
  thinking to more “normal” levels.  The medication would slow his brain to the 
  point where he cannot pursue the one thing that gives his life meaning: his 
  scientific research.  In his own words, eloquently expressed to the Board:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Well, like all psychiatrists that I’ve met before them, they all think 
      the same way, that the only thing they can do is to give you these chemicals 
      – and I’ve been through these chemicals that they propose before – and I 
      know the effects and what they want to achieve is slow down my brain, basically, 
      and to slow down my brain which means I can’t do what I’ve been trying to 
      do – or what I have been doing for 30 years and will be successful at doing.  
      And that would just be like worse than death.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In its reasons, the Board observed that &quot;despite the patient's 
  claim that he is generally happy, his life has been devastated by his mental 
  disorder&quot;.  We agree with Molloy J. that what the Board thinks would be 
  best for Professor Starson is irrelevant under the statute.  Moreover, the Board's 
  conclusion is inconsistent with Professor Starson's own views.  He claims: &quot;...I 
  certainly have no regrets and I certainly consider myself to have had a wonderful 
  life and I'm still having a wonderful life and will go back to my life even 
  better than it was before&quot;.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Putting aside any paternalistic instincts – and we think that neither 
  the Board nor the appellants have done so – we conclude that Professor Starson 
  understood, through the screen of his mental illness, all aspects of the decision 
  whether to be treated.  He understands the information relevant to that decision 
  and its reasonably foreseeable consequences.  He has made a decision that may 
  cost him his freedom and accelerate his illness.  Many would agree with the 
  Board that it is a decision that is against his best interests.  But for Professor 
  Starson, it is a rational decision, and not one that reflects a lack of capacity.  
  And therefore it is a decision that the statute and s. 7 of the <i>Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> permit him to make.</p>
