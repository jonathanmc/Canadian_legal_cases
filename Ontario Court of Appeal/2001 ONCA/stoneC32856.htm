<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:200%;'><b>FELDMAN J.A.:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The issue in this 
  case is whether a husband who learns that he is terminally ill, is entitled 
  to dispose of his property by <i>inter vivos</i> gifts to his grown children 
  in order to frustrate the equalization of his net family property by his wife 
  upon his death. The trial judge held that he could not, and set aside the <i>inter 
  vivos</i> conveyances to the children. They appealed. For the reasons which 
  follow, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>FACTS</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The marriage of 
  Mr. and Mrs. Stone was the second for each of them following the deaths of their 
  respective spouses, and they each had children from their first marriages. They 
  lived a very comfortable life together over 24 years of marriage, which included 
  a nice home, a condominium in Florida, and travel, until Mr. Stone’s death in 
  1995.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Mr. Stone had 
  a business and several real estate investment holdings. His son, Ian Stone, 
  managed all of the businesses. Mr. Stone had an estate plan, the purpose and 
  goal of which were that ultimately all of his assets would belong to his two 
  children, Ian Stone and Maxine Ordower. Although during his marriage to Mrs. 
  Stone, Mr. Stone had transferred some properties and shares to his children, 
  he maintained control over the assets through a voting trust and through the 
  retention of the last $1.9 million. He did not want any of his assets to go 
  to Mrs. Stone’s children, and to that end, nothing was held by Mrs.&nbsp;Stone 
  in her own name. Mr. Stone was aware that Mrs. Stone’s assets would consist 
  of approximately $116,000 in cash at the date of his death. The matrimonial 
  home was held in Mr. Stone’s name. The condominium in Florida had been once 
  in both names, but when Mrs. Stone was diagnosed with breast cancer, she agreed 
  to transfer her interest to him in April 1994, although once her health improved, 
  the deed was not registered. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       In March 1995, 
  Mr. and Mrs. Stone returned to London early from Florida as Mr.&nbsp;Stone was 
  quite ill. He went straight to hospital where he was diagnosed with lung cancer 
  and told that he only had weeks or months to live and that he should get his 
  affairs in order. Mr. Stone then told his doctor that his children would be 
  receiving everything from him before his will, and that is exactly the plan 
  that he proceeded to implement. In that conversation Mr. Stone also told the 
  doctor that he expected that some day there would be litigation over what he 
  did.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Before this time, 
  Mr. Stone had made a will dated June 18, 1991 wherein he left life estates in 
  the matrimonial home and the Florida condominium to Mrs. Stone, a specific gift 
  of $25,000 to a stepson and the residue to be split between Mrs. Stone and his 
  two children, Ian Stone and Maxine Ordower. The children were named executors 
  and were given the specific power to settle any dispute with Mrs. Stone in the 
  event that she elected to take an equalization payment under the <i>Family Law 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,&nbsp; c.&nbsp;F-3 rather than her legacy under the will.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Through his grandson, 
  an articling student, Mr. Stone retained a new lawyer, Mr.&nbsp;Fischer,  who 
  did not have any conflict with Mrs. Stone, to assist him in carrying out his 
  intentions with respect to his property.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Mr. Fischer attended 
  on Mr. Stone in the hospital on March 30, 1995. At that time, Mr. Stone indicated 
  that he was unsure whether he or Mrs. Stone would die first. On this issue, 
  the trial judge found that by this time Mrs. Stone’s condition had improved 
  after a mastectomy and therapy, that her death was not imminent, and that to 
  everyone’s knowledge, she was almost certainly going to survive Mr. Stone. However, 
  Mr. Stone's suggestion to Mr. Fischer was to leave his wife a life estate in 
  the matrimonial home, along with a life interest in the income on $125,000 from 
  which, together with her own funds, she would support herself and keep up the 
  home. Mr. Fischer advised that the figure was too low and suggested $175,000. 
  He also explained that under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, Mrs. Stone could elect 
  an equalization payment rather than take under the will<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span> [1] </span></a>. Mr. Stone responded that “I'm going to do what 
  I'm going to do”. They also discussed the concept of using the Florida condominium 
  as a &quot;bargaining chip&quot;.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Mr. Stone was 
  discharged from hospital by the end of March, and on April 3 he attended on 
  Mr. Fischer at his office.  A will was prepared and signed leaving Mrs. Stone 
  $250,000 together with a life tenancy in the matrimonial home “if it was owned 
  by me at my death.” Mrs. Stone was to pay all taxes, insurance and maintenance 
  on the home. After the will was signed, Ian Stone and Maxine Ordower joined 
  their father in the lawyer’s office where they discussed the immediate transfer 
  of all of Mr. Stone’s business assets to them. The paperwork for the transfers 
  was completed on April 10. On the same date, Mr. Stone signed a deed conveying 
  the Florida condominium to his two children. On April 26, Ian Stone instructed 
  Mr. Fischer to prepare a transfer of the matrimonial home from Mr. Stone to 
  Ian Stone and Maxine Ordower. This was executed by Mr. Stone on May 4, 1995 
  and registered on May 15, 1995 without compliance with s. 21 of the <i>Family 
  Law Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span> [2] </span></a>   
  The registration was noted as “subject to spousal”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Over this time, 
  there was some discussion with Mrs. Stone about what was going to be left to 
  her. First Mr. Stone told her he would leave her $100,000 plus a one-quarter 
  interest in his antique shop, and a life interest in the matrimonial home. Mrs. 
  Stone told him that was inadequate. He later told her she would receive $250,000. 
  He was told that this was also inadequate. Mrs. Stone was never told that the 
  matrimonial home or the  Florida condominium would be conveyed to Ian Stone 
  and Maxine Ordower, nor that the business assets had been conveyed to them by 
  <i>inter vivos</i> transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Stone died on July 21, 1995, leaving virtually nothing in his estate. 
  Mrs. Stone elected under s. 6 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> not to take her legacy 
  under Mr. Stone’s will but instead to take her entitlement to equalization under 
  s. 5 of the Act. She also proceeded with a successful motion for an order setting 
  aside the transfer of the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The action for equalization was brought under s. 7 of the <i>Family 
  Law Act</i>. [3]  For the 
  purpose of determining the value of Mr. Stone’s net family property at the day 
  before his death and Mrs. Stone's entitlement to an effective order for the 
  amount she was entitled to receive, Mrs. Stone claimed that the <i>inter vivos</i> 
  transfers to Ian Stone and Maxine Ordower since March, 1995 were made with intent 
  to defeat her entitlement to the equalization payment and were therefore void 
  as against her under s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. F-29.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge held that the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> could 
  be applied in conjunction with the <i>Family Law Act</i> and that the <i>inter 
  vivos</i> transfers by Mr. Stone to his children were void as against Mrs. Stone. 
  He ordered that those assets therefore be returned to the estate, and that an 
  equalization payment of $851,937.74 be made to Mrs.&nbsp;Stone. He also ordered 
  costs in her favour on a solicitor and client basis. He reduced the prejudgment 
  interest rate to 2.5%, instead of 5%, in light of the fact that Mrs. Stone was 
  being paid support to the time of trial and she occupied the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants appeal from the judgment and award of costs. The respondent 
  cross-appeals on <i>inter alia</i>,<i> </i>the prejudgment interest rate and 
  the failure of the trial judge to award punitive damages. </p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ISSUES</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the main appeal, Mr. Strosberg posed three issues for the court:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> Did the trial judge err in concluding that the <i>Family Law Act</i> 
      creates a debtor/creditor relationship between spouses as a running account 
      which becomes settled on the date of separation or the date before death?</p>
    <p> (2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> Did the trial judge err in failing to apply ss. 5(6) of the <i>Family 
      Law Act</i>? (an unequal division based on unconscionability)</p>
    <p> (3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> Does the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> apply in the context 
      of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, and if so, in what way?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his argument, Mr. Strosberg made the following submission with respect 
  to the issues and the operation of the two Acts:  Spouses do not have a debtor/creditor 
  relationship on an ongoing basis during co-habitation based on a running account 
  between them. If they did, no spouse would be able to transfer his or her own 
  property during co-habitation free of the claims of the other. During co-habitation, 
  unless an order has been made under s. 5(3), one spouse is not the creditor 
  of the other. Until there is a debtor/creditor relationship, there can be no 
  order under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> to set aside any conveyance 
  as void against a spouse. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants submit that improvident or fraudulent transfers are intended 
  to be taken into account under ss. 5(6)(d) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>. Under 
  that section, the court may order an “unequal” equalization amount if it would 
  be unconscionable to merely equalize, having regard to a spouse’s intentional 
  or reckless depletion of his or her net family property. The court must weigh 
  all of the circumstances surrounding the transfers in order to determine whether 
  it would be unconscionable to make an equal division between Mr. and Mrs. Stone. 
  In this case, one such factor is the legitimate objective of Mr. Stone to see 
  his children and not Mrs. Stone’s children end up with his assets and businesses. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If the trial judge concluded that an unequal division was appropriate 
  and ordered an equalization amount that was more than the estate had available 
  to pay, based on the fact that Mrs. Stone would then have become a judgment 
  creditor of the estate, she could at that time seek to set aside the conveyances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The essence of the appellants' submission is that the <i>Family Law 
  Act</i> is a self-contained code intended to regulate financial relations between 
  spouses and that there is no room for the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> 
  to operate on the rights of the spouses in respect of each other’s property, 
  i.e., the right to a one-half interest in the difference between their net family 
  property amounts that arises on separation.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span> 
  [4] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants therefore say that the trial judge erred in applying 
  the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> to bring back into his net family property 
  calculation, the assets Mr. Stone transferred to his children; and the trial 
  judge further erred in failing to deal with the issue of those transfers under 
  s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> as a factor in determining whether there 
  should be an unequal division of the difference between the net family property 
  amounts of the two spouses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In spite of the able argument of Mr. Strosberg, I am unable to accept 
  this analysis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The relevant section of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act </i>is s. 
  2, which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 2.  Every conveyance of real property or personal property and every 
      bond, suit, judgment and execution heretofore or hereafter made with intent 
      to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or others of their just and 
      lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties or forfeitures 
      are void as against such persons and their assigns.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5 is the relevant section of the <i>Family Law Act</i>. It provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>5. (1) When a divorce is granted or a marriage is declared a nullity, or 
      when the spouses are separated and there is no reasonable prospect that 
      they will resume cohabitation, the spouse whose net family property is the 
      lesser of the two net family properties is entitled to one-half the difference 
      between them.</p>
    <p>(2) When a spouse dies, if the net family property of the deceased spouse 
      exceeds the net family property of the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse 
      is entitled to one-half the difference between them.</p>
    <p>(3) When spouses are cohabiting, if there is a serious danger that one 
      spouse may improvidently deplete his or her net family property, the other 
      spouse may on an application under section 7 have the difference between 
      the net family properties divided as if the spouses were separated and there 
      were no reasonable prospect that they would resume cohabitation.</p>
    <p align="center">. . . .</p>
    <p>(6) The court may award a spouse an amount that is more or less than half 
      the difference between the net family properties if the court is of the

  </span> The first issue to be determined is whether, and if so, when is a spouse 
  a &quot;creditor or other&quot; of the other spouse in respect of the right 
  to an interest in the net family property of the other spouse, within the meaning 
  of s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Longstanding case law decided under the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> 
  has addressed the issue of who is a “creditor or other” for the purpose of s. 
  2.  In <i>Hopkinson v. Westerman</i> (1919), 45 O.L.R. 208 (C.A.) at 211, the 
  court held that &quot;others&quot; extended to persons who, though not judgment 
  creditors, had pending actions in which they were sure to recover damages. In 
  that case, the person who transferred the land was a defendant in a tort action. 
  In <i>Bell v. Williamson and Moulton</i>, [1945] O.R. 844 (C.A.) the court similarly 
  held that the claimant need not be a judgment creditor at the time of the conveyance, 
  but a person may fall within the words &quot;or others&quot; even if the person 
  has, at the time of the impugned transaction, only a claim for unliquidated 
  damages in contract or in tort.  Robertson C.J.O. stated at p. 848:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I do not doubt for a moment that a transaction may be null and void within 
      s. 2 of <i>The Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, although the plaintiff who 
      brings the action attacking it may, at the time of the transaction, and 
      even when action is brought attacking it, have had nothing more than a claim 
      for unliquidated damages in contract or in tort.  The effect of the words 
      “or others” following the word “creditors” is to give to such persons a 
      right of action to have a transaction set aside as null and void as against 
      them, if made with the required intent. . . .</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This interpretation of the phrase &quot;creditors or others&quot; has 
  been applied many times including in the family law context: See for example: 
  <i>Shephard v. Shephard</i> (1925), 56 O.L.R. 556 (C.A.); <i>Ferguson v. Lastewka</i>, 
  [1946] O.R. 577 (H.C.J.); <i>Oliver v. McLaughlin</i> (1893), 24 O.R. 41 (Q.B.); 
  <i>Murdoch v. Murdoch</i> (1976), 26 R.F.L. 1 (Alta. S.C.); <i>Chan v. Chan</i>,<i> 
  </i>[1993] B.C.J. No. 442 (B.C.S.C.); and <i>Lepore v. Lepore, </i>[1998] O.J. 
  No. 733 (Dist. Ct.), aff'd by Ontario Court of Appeal (October 22, 1990).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Therefore, in order for a spouse to qualify as a person who is intended 
  to be protected from conveyances of property made with intent to defeat her 
  interest, she must have had an existing claim against her husband at the time 
  of the impugned conveyances, that is a right which she could have asserted in 
  an action.</p>
<h4><b><i>The Family Law Act</i></b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The nature of the property regime established as between spouses under 
  the <i>Family Law Act</i> was clearly described by Cory J. in <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk</i>, 
  [1990] 1 S.C.R. 70 and by Galligan J.A. in <i>Berdette v. Berdette </i>(1991), 
  3 O.R. (3d) 513 (C.A.). Spouses each own their separate property throughout 
  the marriage. However, upon the happening of one of the five triggering events, 
  there is a valuation date. If at that date the net family property of one spouse 
  is less than that of the other, then the spouse with the lesser net family property 
  is “entitled to one-half the difference between them”: (s. 5(1)). The five events 
  are outlined in s. 4(1): (1) the date of separation with no reasonable prospect 
  of resuming co-habitation; (2) the date of divorce; (3) the date of declaration 
  of nullity; (4) the date one of the spouses commences an application under s.&nbsp;5(3) 
  for improvident depletion of net family property, if the application is granted; 
  and (5) the date before the death of the spouse with the greater net family 
  property. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Stone were not separated at the time Mr. 
  Stone transferred his assets to his children. However, Mr. Stone knew his death 
  was imminent. He also knew that the value of his wife’s assets was significantly 
  less than the value of his. He had been specifically advised that on his death 
  his wife could elect not to take under his will but instead, to take an equalization 
  payment based on the difference between their respective net family properties. 
  Furthermore, Mr. Stone anticipated litigation over his will and transfers and 
  Mrs. Stone specifically told him that she would contest a legacy that was not 
  sufficient for her, such as the amount he told her he was leaving her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mrs. Stone did not initiate an application under s. 5(3) of the Act 
  which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>5. (3) When spouses are cohabiting, if there is a serious danger that one 
      spouse may improvidently deplete his or her net family property, the other 
      spouse may on an application under section 7 have the difference between 
      the net family properties divided as if the spouses were separated and there 
      was no reasonable prospect that they would resume cohabitation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mrs. Stone did not have an opportunity to initiate an application because 
  the transfers were kept secret from her. She had no knowledge of the transfer 
  of any of the assets including the business assets, the matrimonial home and 
  the Florida condominium. The secret was such that she was permitted to believe 
  she still had an ownership interest in the Florida condominium.  She even continued 
  to pay the associated expenses until she learned some months later that the 
  property had been transferred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because Mr. Stone’s death was known by all to be imminent, Mrs. Stone’s 
  claim to a right to equalization was also imminent and would have been triggered 
  by his death. One of the effects of s. 5(3) of the Act is to provide a remedy 
  to a spouse in those circumstances where the other spouse seeks to divest himself 
  or herself of his or her property in anticipation of death and in order to defeat 
  the spouse’s claim to equalization. Had Mrs. Stone exercised that remedy by 
  commencing an application, she would have been a “creditor or other” of Mr. 
  Stone within the meaning of  s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act </i>on 
  the date she commenced the application. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge made the following finding on the issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . It is clear to me that Mrs. Stone may well have resorted to this 
      provision and was at least entitled to the chance but of course Mr. Stone 
      kept the full extent and nature of his dealings a secret from her.  . . 
      .(<i>Stone v. Stone</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 31 at 59 (S.C.J.))</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That finding is fully supported by the evidence including Mrs. Stone’s 
  stated intention to contest the will and, of course, by this litigation. I agree 
  with the trial judge that Mr. Stone and his children could not, by deliberate 
  non-disclosure, deprive Mrs.&nbsp;Stone of her ability to establish the legal 
  status of “creditor or other”. Because she had the right to apply for equalization 
  at the time of the transfers, but was deprived of her ability to exercise that 
  right by the actions of Mr. Stone and his children, the parties to the transfers, 
  she was a “creditor or other” within the meaning of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances 
  Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also based his conclusion that Mrs. Stone was a &quot;creditor&quot; 
  of Mr.&nbsp;Stone at the time of the transfers on the following statement of 
  law: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…the [Family Law] Act creates a creditor-debtor relationship which takes 
      the form of an open or running account which becomes a settled account on 
      separation or death.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>With respect to the trial judge, 
  I do not agree that that statement is an accurate reflection of the law. To 
  characterize spouses as being in a constant debtor-creditor relationship would 
  require clear legislative expression. There is nothing in the Act which suggests 
  such a relationship. To the contrary, the provision of the five alternative 
  triggering events for the valuation date and the right to equalization only 
  on one of those dates indicates that the debtor-creditor relationship arises 
  only on the valuation date.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having said that, it is unnecessary in this case to decide how far the 
  concept of “creditor or other” may extend in the family law context, apart from 
  s. 5(3) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  In this case, for the reasons set out, I find that Mrs. Stone was a 
  “creditor or other” of Mr. Stone at the time of his <i>inter vivos</i> transfers 
  and therefore entitled to set those transfers aside under s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act</i>.</p>
<h4><b><i>Section 5(6) of the Family Law Act</i></b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second branch of the appellants' argument is that the trial judge 
  erred by applying the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> in conjunction with 
  the equalization procedure under the <i>Family Law Act</i>. The appellant submits 
  that the <i>Family Law Act</i> is a code unto itself and to the extent that 
  it contains anti-avoidance provisions,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span> 
  [5] </span></a> the legislature intended only those provisions to apply to the 
  family law context. Therefore, the trial judge should have first determined 
  the equalization amount based on the net family property of each spouse on the 
  day before Mr. Stone’s death (i.e. without setting aside the <i>inter vivos</i> 
  transfers) and then considered whether Mr. Stone’s conduct in transferring his 
  assets to his children to avoid the equalization process was unconscionable 
  and warranted an unequal division. In that regard, ss. 5(6)(d) and (h) are set 
  out again:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>5.  (6) The court may award a spouse an amount that is more or less than 
      half the difference between the net family properties if the court is of 
      the opinion that equalizing the net family properties would be unconscionable, 
      having regard to,</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants submit further that in assessing the issue of unconscionability, 
  the court would also consider the long-standing estate plan of Mr. Stone and 
  the legitimacy of wanting to see his assets end up in the hands of his children, 
  as well as all of the other circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel suggested that only after judgment was awarded, could the<i> 
  Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> be used to set aside any transfer, if necessary 
  to give effect to the judgment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot accept this argument for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, this court in <i>Berdette, supra,</i> clearly set out the correct method 
  for determining net family property and the application of s. 5(6). The first 
  step is to establish the net family property of each spouse under s. 4 of the 
  Act by determining and valuing the property each owned on the valuation date. 
  The next step is to apply s. 5(1) and determine whether one spouse’s net family 
  property is greater than the other's, and what the equalization payment would 
  be. Then the court decides whether it would be unconscionable to equalize the 
  net family property. If so, the court will order a payment of more or less than 
  one half the difference. Otherwise the court will order equalization by payment 
  of one half. Galligan J. A. clearly rejected the approach suggested by counsel 
  in the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the above-quoted extract from <i>Rawluk</i>, Cory J. held that the third 
      step [application of s. 5(6)] is to be kept distinct from the determination 
      of ownership of property.  Ownership of property is determined in the first 
      step.  It is therefore my opinion that the considerations set out in subparagraphs 
      (a) through (h) of s. 5(6) are irrelevant to determining the net family 
      properties of each spouse. This opinion, I think, is additionally supported 
      by reference to the structure of Part I.  The provisions of s. 5 are all 
      founded upon the concept of net family property, and assume that net family 
      property has been established.  There is nothing in s. 4 which incorporates 
      consideration of elements of s. 5(6) into the determination of which spouse 
      owned what property on valuation day.  Moreover, my reading of the judgments 
      in <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk</i> at trial ((1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 704, 3 R.F.L. 
      (3d) 113 (H.C.J.)) and in this court ((1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 637, 10 R.F.L. 
      (3d) 113)) is that it was assumed that the provisions of s. 5(6) had no 
      bearing upon the ownership issues essential to the determination of the 
      net family properties under s. 4(1).  (p.&nbsp;526)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, in this case, had the fraudulent conveyances not been set aside 
  as of the valuation date in order to calculate the net family property of Mr. 
  Stone, then without those assets Mrs. Stone’s net family property would have 
  been greater than Mr. Stone’s. There would therefore have been no basis for 
  Mrs. Stone to claim entitlement to equalization under s. 5(1), and therefore 
  no opportunity for the court to consider the unconscionability provisions. The 
  same conclusion was reached by Galligan J.A. in <i>Berdette, supra</i> where, 
  without the finding sought by the wife of a constructive trust of gifts made 
  by her to her husband during the marriage, the wife could not have applied for 
  equalization, as her net family property was equal to his.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, as discussed above, it is not necessary to be a judgment creditor 
  in order to qualify as a “creditor or other” under s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act.</i> Therefore there is no need to wait until an equalization 
  payment has been ordered before applying the Act. In any event, the timing of 
  such an order, being well after the date of the impugned transfers, would not 
  relate back to the date of the transfers and therefore would not provide a basis 
  for setting them aside.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fourth, section 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act </i>only empowers the 
  court to order an unequal division of the difference in value of net family 
  property. It is not a provision which can be used to set aside previous dispositions 
  of property to third parties. Consequently, any order must be based on the net 
  family property amounts of the spouses as determined under s. 4. The order cannot 
  reflect the value of any property which is not part of that net family property 
  value. As a result, although the reckless depletion of assets by one spouse 
  can be used by the court as a factor in assessing unconscionable conduct and 
  making an unequal distribution, the section will only be useful if the spouse 
  who made the transfers of property has sufficient property left on the valuation 
  date to make an order for an unequal sharing an effective remedy for the wronged 
  spouse.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, In <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 70, Cory J. made 
  the following statement regarding how ownership of property is to be determined 
  under the <i>Family Law Act</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <i>Family Law Act, 1986</i> does not constitute an exclusive code for 
      determining the ownership of matrimonial property.  The legislators must 
      have been aware of the existence and effect of the constructive trust remedy 
      in matrimonial cases when the Act was proposed.  Yet neither by direct reference 
      nor by necessary implication does the Act prohibit the use of the constructive 
      trust remedy. . . . (p. 97)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am satisfied that as with the constructive trust, the <i>Family Law 
  Act</i> does not exclude other applicable statutory or common law remedies which 
  deal with the ownership of property at law and in equity, including the <i>Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act</i>. It is true that the legislature has not proceeded, as suggested 
  by the 1993 Ontario Law Reform Commission Report on Family Law<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span> 
  [6] </span></a>, to extend and codify within the <i>Family Law Act</i> itself, 
  what will constitute a fraudulent disposal of property by a spouse during cohabitation, 
  made in order to defeat the potential interests of the other spouse, and which 
  can therefore be set aside. However, where on the facts, the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances 
  Act</i> can apply, there is nothing in the <i>Family Law Act</i> which ousts 
  the operation of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> as part of the process 
  to determine the net family property of each spouse as of the applicable valuation 
  date.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the above reasons, the trial judge did not err by applying the <i>Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act</i> or in his conclusion that s.5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> 
  had no application in this case as a remedy for Mrs. Stone.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>OTHER ISSUES</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants raised three other issues on appeal. First, the appellants 
  challenged the trial judge's ruling regarding the late introduction of new appraisal 
  evidence of the value of certain lands. I agree with the respondent that there 
  is no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in respect 
  of this ruling. The new appraisal was obtained by the appellants after the respondent 
  had closed her case and committed to values for all of the properties. It was 
  sought to be introduced by Canada Trust on behalf of the estate and not by the 
  appellants, and after Canada Trust had also closed its case. The trial judge 
  was entitled to find that admitting the new appraisal at that point in the trial 
  and thereby allowing Canada Trust to re-open its case with a different position 
  would have created prejudice and unfairness to the respondent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the appellants say that the trial judge erred by failing to 
  have Mrs. Stone properly account for monies she received as interim support 
  and for the benefit she received by occupying the matrimonial home pending trial. 
  I see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s treatment of these amounts. 
  These matters were reflected in a reduced rate for prejudgment interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the appellants also appeal from the award of solicitor and 
  client costs. Again, I would not interfere with the view of the trial judge 
  that because of the fraudulent conveyances and the intention of the appellants 
  to defeat Mrs. Stone’s legitimate interests, the costs award on that scale was 
  justified.</p>
<h4>THE CROSS-APPEAL</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The cross-appeal involves queries with respect to the valuation treatment 
  of certain assets, an appeal from the denial of a punitive damages award and 
  an appeal from the rate of prejudgment interest. These matters were not pursued 
  in oral argument but left with the court on the basis of the factum alone.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am not satisfied that the trial judge made a reversible error on any 
  of the issues raised on the cross-appeal. The valuation findings were made by 
  the trial judge based on hearing and weighing all of the relevant evidence. 
  The cross-appellant has not pointed to any misapprehension of the evidence which 
  would warrant the interference of this court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge declined to award punitive damages. This was within 
  his prerogative. He expressed his opprobrium of the appellants’ conduct by the 
  award of solicitor and client costs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is also no basis to interfere with the award of prejudgment interest. 
  The trial judge exercised his discretion and as noted, did take into account 
  other benefits received by Mrs. Stone pending trial as an off-set for some of 
  the prejudgment interest.</p>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  costs.</p>
