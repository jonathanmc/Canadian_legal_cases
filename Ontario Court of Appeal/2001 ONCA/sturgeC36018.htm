<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice William J. Babe on February 
  22, 2001.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent pled guilty to 7 counts of robbery, 1 count of dangerous 
  driving, 1 count of failing to stop his vehicle while being pursued by the police 
  and 1 count of possession of a stolen vehicle.  The trial judge imposed a sentence 
  of 4 years on each of the robberies and 6 months on each of the other three 
  charges.  All sentences were made concurrent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The totality of the sentences imposed by the trial judge was manifestly 
  inadequate given the number of offences, their seriousness, the respondent’s 
  extensive criminal record and the fact that he was on parole at the time he 
  committed these offences.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also erred in principle in failing to make the sentences 
  imposed on the offences committed while the respondent was in flight from two 
  of the robberies consecutive to the sentences imposed on the robbery charges.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The robberies were unsophisticated, no weapon was involved, relatively 
  little money was unrecovered and they were all part of one spree.  The respondent 
  has an extensive criminal record, but little by way of violence.  He is unfortunately 
  addicted to cocaine.  He pled guilty at the first opportunity and readily acknowledged 
  his responsibility for the robberies when arrested.  Bearing these factors in 
  mind and also taking into consideration the totality of the sentences to be 
  imposed for all of the offences, we would not interfere with the 4-year sentence 
  imposed on the robbery charges.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The dangerous driving offence occurred immediately after the sixth robbery.  
  The respondent fled the scene in a stolen car striking a police officer and 
  causing him some injury.  He drove at a high speed through red lights and stop 
  signs evading capture.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The sentence imposed for this offence must reflect the need to deter 
  and denounce both conduct which endangers the police and the extremely dangerous 
  nature of the respondent’s driving.  Police officers and other members of the 
  public were put in immediate and real danger by the respondent’s conduct.  We 
  are also satisfied that the sentence imposed on the dangerous driving charge 
  should have been consecutive to the sentences imposed on the robbery charges.  
  A concurrent sentence suggests that flight from the scene of a crime might well 
  be worth the risk.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Considered in isolation, this offence would have merited a significant 
  sentence.  Bearing in mind the totality of the sentences to be imposed on this 
  respondent, we would impose a sentence of 6 months on the dangerous driving 
  offence.  That sentence should be consecutive to the sentences imposed on the 
  robbery charges.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The charge of refusing to stop a vehicle when ordered to do so by the 
  police occurred when the respondent fled the scene of the last robbery.  After 
  he refused to stop, the respondent drove away in a very dangerous manner for 
  a considerable distance. He eventually rolled the vehicle.  When approached 
  by the police, he resisted arrest, striking and injuring one of the police officers.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As with the dangerous driving conviction, general deterrence and denunciation 
  had to be given paramount consideration.  Police officers who are required to 
  put themselves at risk to make arrests must be assured that those who physically 
  resist arrest will be dealt with sternly by the courts.  A consecutive sentence 
  was essential.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A very significant sentence would have been entirely appropriate for 
  this offence alone.  Moreover, this was the appellant’s second in flight offence 
  in the space of less than two days.  Once again, however, totality concerns 
  must be borne in mind.  We would impose a sentence of 18 months consecutive 
  to the dangerous driving sentence and consecutive to the robbery sentences.  
  The respondent’s total sentence will be 6 years. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We would not interfere with the sentence imposed on the charge of possession 
  of stolen vehicle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We would impose a s. 109 order for 10 years.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed 
  and the sentences are varied to accord with these reasons.  </p>
