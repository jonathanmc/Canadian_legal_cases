  </span> The appellant Union Gas (“Union”) Limited is the successor company to 
  Northern and Central Natural Gas Corporation Limited. It provides natural gas 
  distribution service to more than 400 municipalities throughout Ontario.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For some 40 years, Union and its predecessor company have owned and 
  operated the natural gas distribution system in the City of Sudbury (“Sudbury”) 
  pursuant to two successive franchise agreements with Sudbury and under the regulatory 
  authority of the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”), the statutory body assigned by 
  provincial law to regulate the natural gas industry in Ontario. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The most recent franchise agreement was made on December 11, 1979. Its 
  20-year-term expired on December 11, 1999. Just prior to that date, in October 
  1999, Union applied to the OEB to extend its right to operate the natural gas 
  system in Sudbury pursuant to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. M.55. Sudbury then sought a declaration that its right to purchase 
  the gas distribution system from Union, provided for in paragraph 22 of the 
  franchise agreement, arose on the expiry of the term of that agreement. Union 
  brought a cross-application for a declaration that this right does not arise 
  until the end of any extension ordered by the OEB.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On April 10, 2000, Molloy J. issued reasons for judgment in favour of 
  Sudbury, which are reported at 47 O.R. (3d) 654. With respect, for the reasons 
  that follow, I have come to the opposite conclusion. I would therefore allow 
  the appeal, dismiss Sudbury’s application and allow Union’s cross-application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>STATUTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span

  </span> Before turning to an analysis of the central issue in this appeal, namely 
  the proper meaning of paragraph 22 of the franchise agreement, it is helpful 
  to highlight both the agreement’s legislative context and the history leading 
  up to it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As Molloy J. said, it is clear that the natural gas industry is a closely 
  regulated one. The <i>Municipal Franchises Act</i> and the <i>Ontario Energy 
  Board Act</i>,<i> 1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 15 make clear that the Legislature 
  has accorded to the OEB the widest powers to regulate the supply and distribution 
  of natural gas in the public interest. See <i>Union Gas Limited v. the Township 
  of Dawn</i> (1977), 76 D.L.R. (3d) 613 (Ont. Div. Ct.) at 625.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> More particularly, s. 9 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act </i>requires 
  that any franchise agreement between a natural gas distribution company and 
  a municipality must be approved by the OEB. Subsections 10(1) and (2) of this 
  Act provide that where such a franchise agreement is about to expire, either 
  the gas distribution company or the municipality may apply to the OEB to extend 
  the right to operate the gas distribution system and the OEB may do so on such 
  terms and conditions as public convenience and necessity appear to require.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Subsections 10(1) and (2) read as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>10.(1)  Where the term of a right referred to in clause 6(1)(a), (b) or 
      (c) that is related to gas or of a right to operate works for the distribution 
      of gas has expired or will expire within one year, either the municipality 
      or the party having the right may apply to the Ontario Energy Board for 
      an order for a renewal of or an extension of the term of the right.</p>
    <p>(2) The Ontario Energy Board has and may exercise jurisdiction and power 
      necessary for the purposes of this section and, if public convenience and 
      necessity appear to require it, may make an order renewing or extending 
      the term of the right for such period of time and upon such terms and conditions 
      as may be prescribed by the Board, or if public convenience and necessity 
      do not appear to require a renewal or extension of the term of the right, 
      may make an order refusing a renewal or extension of the right.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The final legislative provision of relevance to this matter is s. 62 
  of the <i>Public Utilities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.52. It empowered a municipality 
  to acquire at any time a privately owned gas distribution system serving its 
  residents at a price calculated according to a legislated formula. This provision 
  was in effect in 1979 when the franchise agreement was made but was repealed 
  effective January 1, 1999.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The 1979 franchise agreement sets out the following grant to Union in 
  paragraph 2:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>2.         Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the 
      Corporation hereby grants to the Gas Company the franchise, right and privilege 
      to construct and operate a gas distribution system within the Municipality 
      and to supply gas to the Corporation and to the inhabitants of the Municipality, 
      and to enter upon any public property for the purpose of the construction, 
      operation, maintenance and repair of the gas distribution system and for 
      the transmission of gas in and through the Municipality and to perform any 
      other services that may be necessary in connection with the transmission 
      and supply of gas in the Municipality.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paragraph 3 of the franchise agreement provides that the franchise granted 
  shall be for a term of 20 years. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paragraph 20 gives Union the right, prior to the end of the 20-year-term, 
  to give notice requesting the grant of a new franchise on terms to be agreed. 
  It then requires Sudbury to advise whether it is willing to do so. It reads 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>20.       At any time within the twelve-month period commencing twenty-four 
      months and ending twelve months prior to the termination of the term of 
      the franchise hereby granted, the Gas Company may by notice given to the 
      Corporation request the Corporation to grant to the Gas Company a new franchise 
      upon such terms as may be agreed upon and subject to the approval of the 
      Board. The Corporation shall, by notice in writing given to the Gas Company 
      within three months of the date of the request for a new franchise, advise 
      the Gas Company as to whether or not it is willing to grant a new franchise 
      to permit the Gas Company to carry on its business in the Municipality.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paragraphs 21 and 22 then address possible outcomes where there is no 
  agreement on a new franchise. These paragraphs are in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>21.       If the Corporation fails to grant a new franchise on terms agreeable 
      to both parties hereto and the Ontario Energy Board has not made an order 
      for a renewal of or an extension of the term of the right, then the Gas 
      Company may, subject to the provisions of paragraph 22 and to section 10 
      of The Municipal Franchises Act, at its option, either:</p>
    <p>(a)       sell or dispose of the gas distribution system forthwith to any 
      person, firm or corporation and at such price and on such conditions as 
      the Gas Company may deem advisable; or </p>
    <p>(b)       within twelve months following such termination of the term of 
      this franchise remove the gas distribution system or any portion or portions 
      thereof from the public property, provided that failure to effect such removal 
      shall not deprive the Gas Company of title to the gas distribution system 
      or any portion or portions thereof.</p>
    <p>            Should the Municipality, at any time after a lapse of one year 
      from termination, require the removal of all or any of the Gas Company’s 
      said facilities for the purpose of altering or improving public property 
      or in order to facilitate the construction of utility or other works in 
      the highway, the Municipality may remove or dispose of so much of the Gas 
      Company’s said facilities as the Municipality may require for such purposes, 
      and neither party shall have recourse against the other for any loss or 
      expense occasioned thereby.</p>
    <p>22.       At any time following the termination of the franchise, the Corporation 
      may, by notice given to the Gas Company, require the Gas Company to sell 
      the Gas Distribution System, or such portion or portions thereof as shall 
      not have been removed as provided in paragraph 21, to the Corporation or 
      to any person, firm or corporation designated in such notice by the Corporation; 
      and with all reasonable dispatch after the giving of such notice, but subject 
      to section 10 of The Municipal Franchises Act, the Gas Company shall sell 
      such system or such portion thereof accordingly, at such price as may be 
      agreed between the parties hereto or, if the parties hereto shall be unable 
      to agree upon such price and one of them shall refer the determination thereof 
      to arbitration under the provisions of paragraph 19 hereof, at such price 
      as the arbitrator or arbitrators appointed under the said paragraph 19 shall 
      fix as fairly representing the value of such gas distribution system or 
      such portion thereof, as a going concern and as though the Gas Company were 
      still entitled to use the public property for the operation of such system 
      or portion.</p>

  </span> The language in these two paragraphs was first approved by the OEB in 
  1978 in a test case involving a franchise agreement for the City of Timmins 
  brought by a group of northern Ontario municipalities including Sudbury. The 
  phrase in paragraph 22 “… but subject to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises 
  Act</i>…” was not in the draft agreement submitted by the parties, but was added 
  without explanation by the OEB when it rendered its decision approving the agreement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have indicated, the 20-year-term of Sudbury’s franchise agreement 
  was due to expire on December 11, 1999. Prior to that date, Sudbury gave Union 
  notice that it intended to exercise its contractual right to acquire the gas 
  distribution system pursuant to paragraph 22. However, Union had launched an 
  application before the OEB to extend the term of its franchise. Union asserted 
  that Sudbury’s right of acquisition under paragraph 22 did not arise until the 
  end of any extension ordered by the OEB or until such an extension had been 
  refused. On October 28, 1999, the OEB issued an interim order extending Union’s 
  franchise to June 30, 2000 to permit these court proceedings. That interim order 
  was further extended on consent pending this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In deciding in favour of Sudbury, Molloy J. found the surrounding factual 
  circumstances and statutory provisions of little or no assistance. She focussed 
  on the language of the franchise agreement itself and determined that the most 
  reasonable construction of paragraph 22 is that it provides to Sudbury the right 
  to purchase the gas distribution system upon the expiry of the term of the agreement 
  irrespective of any order that may be made by the OEB under s. 10 of the <i>Municipal 
  Franchises Act</i>. The essence of her conclusion is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[47]     Paragraph 22, as currently drafted, does not clearly reflect the 
      position of either of the parties. However, if paragraph 22 had been drafted 
      to provide a right to purchase the system upon the “termination of the franchise 
      <u>hereby granted</u>”, I would have little hesitation in interpreting the 
      provision as providing to Sudbury a right to purchase the gas distribution 
      system at the expiry of the rights granted under the agreement, whether 
      by the expiry of the 20-year term or otherwise. The addition of the words 
      “hereby granted” is, in my view, a minor amendment. On the other hand, in 
      order to amend paragraph 22 so as to clearly reflect the meaning advocated 
      by Union Gas, one would have to say that Sudbury’s right to purchase arises 
      upon the “termination of the franchise <u>hereby granted if the OEB has 
      not made an order for a renewal or extension under s.10 of the <i>Municipal 
      Franchises Act</i>, or, if such an order has been made by the OEB, upon 
      the expiry of the term of such order”</u>. In my view, this would constitute 
      a much more significant amendment than merely adding the words “hereby granted”. 
      Further, the rights granted under paragraph 21 are expressly stipulated 
      to arise only if “the OEB has not made an order for a renewal of or an extension 
      of the term of the right”. If the drafters had intended that the very next 
      paragraph be subject to the same restriction, one would expect them to have 
      said so expressly.</p>
    <p>[48]     In my opinion, adding the gloss suggested by Union Gas strains 
      the ordinary meaning of the words used beyond what is reasonable in the 
      overall context of the agreement. On the other hand, the interpretation 
      advanced by Sudbury is more consistent with the dealings between the parties, 
      the terms of their earlier contract and the language of the 1979 agreement 
      itself. While in hindsight one can suggest language that would have conveyed 
      this meaning more clearly, I find that the most reasonable construction 
      of paragraph 22 of the agreement is that it provides to Sudbury the right 
      to purchase the gas distribution system upon the expiry of the rights granted 
      under the agreement, irrespective of any order that may be made by the OEB 
      under s.10 of the Act. [emphasis in the original]</p>

  </span> In this court the basic positions of the parties were as they have been 
  throughout these proceedings. Union argued that Sudbury’s right to purchase 
  its gas distribution system under paragraph 22 only arises following the termination 
  of its franchise and that the franchise will not terminate if the OEB orders 
  an extension pursuant to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act. </i>On the 
  other hand, Sudbury argued that the franchise is for a 20-year-term expiring 
  on December 11, 1999 at which point it terminates and Sudbury’s right to purchase 
  arises, subject to s. 10 of the Act. Thus, if the OEB orders that Union’s right 
  to operate the system is extended, Sudbury argued that it will nonetheless have 
  the contractual right to acquire ownership of the system, subject only to Union’s 
  right to remain in possession of the system as operator.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view an examination of the language of the franchise agreement, 
  in particular paragraph 22 in the context of the role played by s. 10 of the 
  <i>Municipal Franchises Act</i>, demonstrates that the appellant’s position 
  is correct. It is useful to set out paragraph 22 again, adding emphasis to those 
  parts of it that assist in compelling this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>22.       <u>At any time following the termination of the franchise</u>, 
      the Corporation may, by notice given to the Gas Company, require the Gas 
      Company to sell the Gas Distribution System, or such portion or portions 
      thereof as shall not have been removed as provided in paragraph 21, to the 
      Corporation or to any person, firm or corporation designated in such notice 
      by the Corporation; and with all reasonable dispatch after the giving of 
      such notice, but <u>subject to section 10 of The Municipal Franchises Act,</u> 
      <u>the Gas Company shal</u>l<u> sell such system</u> or such portion thereof 
      accordingly, at such price as may be agreed between the parties hereto or, 
      if the parties hereto shall be unable to agree upon such price and one of 
      them shall refer the determination thereof to arbitration under the provisions 
      of paragraph 19 hereof, at such price as the arbitrator or arbitrators appointed 
      under the said paragraph 19 shall fix as fairly representing the value of 
      such gas distribution system or such portion thereof, <u>as a going concern 
      and as though the Gas Company were still entitled to use the public property 
      for the operation of such system or portion</u><i>. </i>[emphasis added]</p>

  </span> It is clear that the driving force behind this legal dispute is Sudbury’s 
  desire to exercise its right to require Union to sell its system for the distribution 
  of gas to the residents of Sudbury. That right, found in paragraph 22, arises 
  “[a]t any time following the termination of the franchise…”  The precondition 
  for Sudbury’s right is the termination of the franchise. It is the meaning of 
  that phrase that is at the heart of this case. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with Molloy J. that the interpretative task derives no assistance 
  from the factual context giving rise to the franchise agreement. The only fact 
  of possible relevance is that Union appears to have represented to Sudbury in 
  1978 that Sudbury would have the right under s. 62 of the <i>Public Utilities 
  Act</i> to purchase the gas distribution system at any time. However, that section 
  was repealed effective January 1, 1999. While the representation was true when 
  it was made, it is of no assistance in giving meaning to the phrase “the termination 
  of the franchise” in paragraph 22. For that task it is necessary to examine 
  the franchise agreement itself.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paragraph 2 makes clear that the franchise conferred by the agreement 
  is the bundle of rights and privileges granted to Union to construct and operate 
  the gas distribution system in the City of Sudbury. Paragraph 3 fixes the term 
  of that franchise at 20 years. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Union’s obligation to sell its gas distribution system, which is provided 
  for in paragraph 22, is explicitly subject to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises 
  Act. </i>Under that section, the OEB has the power to order the renewal or extension 
  of the bundle of rights granted to Union by the franchise agreement. In my view, 
  the meaning of paragraph 22 is clear:  if the OEB makes an order pursuant to 
  s. 10, the franchise is not terminated and the precondition for Sudbury’s right 
  to compel a sale has not been met.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act </i>clearly gives the 
  OEB the power, if public convenience and necessity require it, to renew or extend 
  the right of Union to operate the gas distribution system in Sudbury. The section 
  operates where a franchise agreement reaches the end of its term and the parties 
  have been unable to agree on the conditions for extending it. It protects the 
  interests of those who depend on the gas distribution system by allowing either 
  the municipality or the gas utility company to seek a renewal or extension of 
  the bundle of rights that is the franchise. The OEB may make the order on the 
  terms it determines necessary to protect the public interest. In my view a purposive 
  reading of the section gives to the OEB a broad power to impose the terms of 
  renewal or extension of the franchise so that service to the public will not 
  be interrupted simply because the municipality and the utility have been unable 
  to agree on the terms for carrying on the service. If the OEB makes such an 
  order in this case, Union’s franchise will not have terminated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In her reasons for judgment, Molloy J. finds that at the end of the 
  20-year-term Sudbury has the right to require Union to sell the gas distribution 
  system but that under s. 10, the OEB could grant Union the right to operate 
  Sudbury’s system thereafter. With respect, I do not agree. The right of Union 
  to operate a gas distribution system owned by Sudbury is not a right which Union 
  had under the franchise agreement and therefore not one which can be renewed 
  or extended pursuant to s. 10. However, it is not necessary to come to a conclusion 
  on this issue. What is clear is that s. 10 does give the OEB the power to renew 
  or extend Union’s franchise and if it were to do so, the franchise would not 
  be terminated, and Sudbury’s right to require Union to sell would not arise.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view there are three other aspects of the franchise agreement 
  that support this interpretation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, under paragraph 22, if Union and Sudbury cannot agree on a sale 
  price for the gas distribution system, the price is to be fixed by an arbitration 
  valuing the system “as a going concern and as though the gas company were still 
  entitled to use the public property for the operation of such system …”  The 
  clear implication is that Sudbury would be acquiring both the gas distribution 
  system and the right to operate it. It would not make commercial sense for Sudbury 
  to agree to buy the system without the right to operate it, but to have to pay 
  for it as a going concern. Thus I think the payment formula provided in paragraph 
  22 confirms the parties’ agreement that Sudbury’s right to require Union to 
  sell the gas distribution system arises only when Union’s right to operate the 
  system terminates and not simply at the end of the 20-year-term.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, paragraph 22 has paragraph 21 as its companion piece. Both set 
  out what happens when Union’s franchise terminates.  Paragraph 21 gives Union 
  certain rights at that point to sell or remove the gas distribution system failing 
  which Sudbury may remove it. Paragraph 22 gives Sudbury the right to require 
  Union to sell the system. Paragraph 21 is express in stating that the rights 
  it grants do not arise if the OEB has made an order of renewal or extension 
  under s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act</i>. While paragraph 22 is more 
  succinct, making Union’s obligation to sell “subject to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal 
  Franchises Act</i>”, I think the meaning is the same. If an order is made under 
  s. 10, the franchise does not terminate, and neither the rights accorded to 
  Union by paragraph 21 nor the right accorded to Sudbury by paragraph 22 arises.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the language of paragraph 20 of the franchise agreement provides 
  a revealing contrast to the language of paragraph 22. Paragraph 20 demonstrates 
  that when the parties wished to precondition a right simply on the expiry of 
  the 20-year-term of the agreement they did not speak of “the termination of 
  the franchise” but, rather, of “the termination of the term of the franchise 
  hereby granted.”  Indeed, I agree with Molloy J. that Sudbury’s position effectively 
  requires that this wording from paragraph 20 be read into paragraph 22. On the 
  other hand, for the reasons I have given, I find that paragraph 22 as written 
  does not give Sudbury the right it seeks if Union’s franchise is renewed or 
  extended pursuant to s. 10 of the <i>Municipal Franchises Act. </i>Unlike Molloy 
  J., I think the language of paragraph 22 is clear and requires no words to be 
  read in in order to convey this meaning as contended for by the appellant. This 
  meaning must prevail over one that requires words to be read into the text.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, I conclude that Sudbury’s right to require Union to sell 
  its gas distribution system arises only on the termination of Union’s franchise 
  and if the OEB issues an order of renewal or extension at the end of the 20-year-term 
  of the franchise agreement that precondition is simply not met.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order below and order 
  that Sudbury’s application be dismissed and Union’s cross-application be allowed. 
  Union is entitled to its costs here and below.</p>
