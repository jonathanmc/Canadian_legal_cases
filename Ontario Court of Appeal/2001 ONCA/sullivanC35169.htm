<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Norman D. Dyson dated November 7, 2000.</p>
<p><b>MOLDAVER J.A.:</b></p>
<p> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Papaevangelou Holdings Ltd. and Aristocrat Restaurants Limited, carrying 
  on business respectively as The Birchmount Restaurant &amp; Tavern (&quot;Birchmount&quot;) 
  and Tony's East (&quot;Tony's&quot;), are defendants in three related actions 
  arising out of a motor vehicle accident that took place in March 1997. By order 
  dated November 7, 2000, Dyson&nbsp;J. held that if Birchmount and Tony's are 
  found liable to the plaintiffs in those actions, then, in their capacity as 
  unprotected joint and several tortfeasors, they are responsible to the plaintiffs 
  for one hundred per cent of the deductibles set out in s.&nbsp;267.5(7) of the 
  <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;). 
</p>
<p> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Birchmount and Tony's appeal from that order on the ground that it is 
  based on an erroneous interpretation of s. 267.7(1) of the Act. In particular, 
  they submit that Dyson J. misconstrued subsection (1)(a) of that provision, 
  which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>267.7</b>  (1)  If, in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury 
      or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an 
      automobile, one or more protected defendants and one or more other persons 
      are found to be liable for damages,</p>
    <p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> the other persons,</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> (i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are jointly and severally liable with the protected defendants 
        for the damages for which the protected defendants are liable, having 
        regard to section 267.5, and</p>
      <p> (ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are solely liable for any amount by which the amount mentioned 
        in subclause (i) is less than the amount that the other persons would 
        have been liable to make contribution and indemnify the protected defendants 
        in respect of damages in the absence of section 267.5;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the appellants, had Dyson J. construed that provision correctly, 
  he would have held that in the event that Birchmount and Tony's are found liable 
  to the plaintiffs, their liability would be no more than the greater of either 
  the protected defendants' joint and several liability to the plaintiffs or the 
  unprotected defendants' found liability without regard to the deductibles in 
  s. 267.5(7). </p>
<p><b>Background Facts</b></p>
<p> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The background facts are straightforward. Three actions have been commenced 
  as a result of a single car accident on March 29, 1997 in which Glen Sullivan, 
  a passenger, was killed and two other passengers, David Hayward and Ryan Duffield, 
  sustained injuries. The family of the late Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Hayward and his 
  family and Mr.&nbsp;Duffield claim damages from the defendants Douglas Bond 
  (the driver), AT&amp;T Capital Canada Inc., (the owner of the vehicle), Carol 
  Bond (the lessee of the vehicle) and Birchmount and Tony's, two taverns in which 
  Sullivan, Hayward, Duffield and Douglas Bond had been drinking prior to the 
  accident. All three actions have been ordered to be tried together.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> </p>
<p> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the context of these actions, Birchmount brought a motion under Rule 
  21.01(1)(a)  of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 seeking 
  the Court's opinion as to the proper interpretation and application of s. 267.7 
  of the Act. To appreciate the issue which Birchmount sought to have determined, 
  it is necessary to elaborate briefly on two other provisions in the Act, namely, 
  s. 267.5(5) and s. 267.5(7). </p>
<p> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under s. 267.5(5) of the Act, owners and occupants of automobiles and 
  persons present at an incident involving a motor vehicle are provided with limited 
  protection from liability for damages for non-pecuniary loss from bodily injury 
  or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile. 
  Such persons, defined in s.&nbsp;267.3 of the Act as &quot;protected defendants&quot;, 
  lose their protection when, as a result of the use or operation of an automobile, 
  the injured person has died or sustained certain permanent serious injuries.</p>
<p> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 267.5(7) of the Act prescribes certain rules that a court must 
  follow in determining an award for non-pecuniary loss against protected defendants 
  in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death where such defendants 
  have lost their protection from suit. Rule 3 of those rules creates statutory 
  deductibles that apply in such cases. In essence, it provides that an award 
  for non-pecuniary loss against a protected defendant shall be reduced by at 
  least $7,500 in the case of claims brought under clause 61(2)(e) of the <i>Family 
  Law Act</i> and at least $15,000 in the case of  other claims. </p>
<p> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As indicated, the rules prescribed in s. 267.5(7) apply only to awards 
  for non-pecuniary loss against protected defendants. They do not apply to awards 
  for non-pecuniary loss against other tortfeasors, commonly referred to as &quot;unprotected 
  defendants&quot;.</p>
<p> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is against this backdrop that Birchmount, in its capacity as an unprotected 
  defendant, brought the motion under Rule 21.01 seeking the court's opinion as 
  to the proper interpretation and application of s. 267.7 of the Act. In particular, 
  Birchmount wanted to know whether, as an unprotected defendant, it was liable 
  to the plaintiffs for the whole amount of the s. 267.5(7) deductibles by which 
  an award for non-pecuniary loss against protected defendants are reduced or 
  something less.</p>
<p> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The resolution of that issue, it is agreed, hinges on the construction 
  of s.&nbsp;267.7(1)(a) of the Act. That provision, reproduced above, addresses 
  the extent to which plaintiffs can recover damages from unprotected defendants 
  when one or more protected defendants and one or more unprotected defendants 
  are found liable for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly 
  or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile. For convenience, it 
  is repeated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>267.7</b>  (1)  If, in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury 
      or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an 
      automobile, one or more protected defendants and one or more other persons 
      are found to be liable for damages,</p>
    <p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> the other persons,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> (i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are jointly and severally liable with the protected defendants 
        for the damages for which the protected defendants are liable, having 
        regard to section 267.5, and</p>
      <p> (ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are solely liable for any amount by which the amount mentioned 
        in subclause (i) is less than the amount that the other persons would 
        have been liable to make contribution and indemnify the protected defendants 
        in respect of damages in the absence of section 267.5;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Dyson J.'s Ruling </b></p>
<p> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion was heard by Dyson J. on September 15, 2000. In his reasons, 
  delivered orally that day, he correctly framed the issue as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The tavern [Birchmount] is an unprotected defendant and, in particular, 
      seeks the Court's determination as to whether s.&nbsp;267.7 entitles the 
      plaintiff to recover the whole of the statutory deductible or only the portion 
      of the deductible in proportion to the unprotected defendants' found accountability.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dyson J. then provided what he described as a short answer to the issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The short answer is that  there is nothing in the <i>Automobile Insurance 
      Rate Stability Act</i>, S.O. 1996, C. 21 (Bill 59), which in any way restricts 
      or limits the liability of unprotected tortfeasors to victims of motor vehicle 
      accidents, and therefore an unprotected tortfeasor would be responsible 
      to a motor vehicle accident victim on a joint and several basis, pursuant 
      to s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, to pay any shortfall occasioned by 
      the application of the limiting provisions of the Act as they apply to protected 
      defendants.</p>
    <p>Bill 59 sets out the limits and restrictions on the liability and responsibility 
      of protected defendants, and hence their insurers, to compensate motor vehicle 
      accident victims after November 1, 1996.</p>
    <p>It follows that if the tavern in this case is fixed with any finding of 
      negligence, it would be responsible to the plaintiffs for 100 percent of 
      the deductibles as an unprotected joint and several tortfeasor.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having stated his conclusion and the primary reason for it, Dyson J. 
  went on to consider three additional factors that lent support to his conclusion.</p>
<p> [13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, he found that s. 267.5(10) of the Act provided an important clue 
  to the meaning of s. 267.7(1)(a). That provision reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 267.5(10)  Subsections (1), (3) and (5) do not relieve any person from 
      liability other than a protected defendant.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In Dyson J.'s view, s. 267.5(10) represents a clear and unambiguous statement 
  by the legislature that the limited protection from liability afforded by subsections 
  (1), (3) and (5) of s.&nbsp;267.5 applies only to protected defendants and that 
  these provisions do not relieve unprotected defendants from liability. </p>
<p> [14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, Dyson J. considered the wording in s. 267.7(1)(a)(ii) and found 
  it to be ambiguous and lacking in clarity. Accordingly, as a matter of statutory 
  interpretation, he held that it should not be construed in a manner that would 
  extinguish &quot;the common law right [of plaintiffs] to be compensated for 
  the full amount of their loss&quot;. This could only be done by clear and unambiguous 
  language. </p>
<p> [15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, Dyson J. found support for his conclusion in what he described 
  as the &quot;clear and obvious purpose of Bill 59&quot;.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>  That purpose, he found, was the stabilization of automobile 
  insurance rates, not the reduction of &quot;the statutory or common law rights 
  of an injured motor vehicle accident victim in respect of unprotected defendants 
  or to stabilize the rates of insurance for the insurers of such parties.&quot;</p>
<p> [16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Taking these factors together, Dyson J. concluded that s. 267.7(1) &quot;cannot 
  be interpreted or applied in any manner that would reduce the common law rights 
  or rights pursuant to the <i>Negligence Act</i> of an injured motor vehicle 
  accident victim vis-à-vis an unprotected defendant.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Relevant Statutory Provisions</b></p>
<p> [17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The relevant provisions of the <i>Insurance Act</i> are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      loss and loss of earning capacity from bodily injury or death arising directly 
      or indirectly from the use or operation of the automobile:</p>

        </span> Damages for income loss suffered more than seven days after the

<p><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p> [19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, I am unable to accept Dyson J.'s interpretation of s. 
  267.7(1) of the Act. In particular, I disagree with his conclusion that under 
  that provision, unprotected defendants are required to pay one hundred per cent 
  of the amount deducted from awards against protected defendants for non-pecuniary 
  loss pursuant to s. 267.5(7). To the contrary, I agree with the appellants that, 
  insofar as the s.&nbsp;267.5(7) deductibles are concerned, unprotected defendants 
  are solely liable for the amount, if any, by which the amount they would have 
  had to pay to the protected defendants by way of contribution and indemnity 
  under s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> (i.e., the total amount awarded for 
  non-pecuniary loss multiplied by the unprotected defendants' found degree of 
  fault) exceeds the damages for non-pecuniary loss for which they and the protected 
  defendants are made jointly and severally liable by s. 267.7(1)(a)(i) of the 
  Act (i.e., the total amount awarded for non-pecuniary loss less the s. 267.5(7) 
  deductibles). I have arrived at this conclusion for several reasons.</p>
<p> [20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, unlike Dyson J., I am of the view that s. 267.7(1)(a) does restrict 
  the application of s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> insofar as unprotected 
  defendants are concerned. In particular, I am satisfied that in enacting s. 
  267.7(1)(a), the legislature had s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> in mind and 
  when it wanted that provision to apply, it did so by using the words &quot;in 
  the absence of s. 267.5&quot; or &quot;as if s. 267.5 did not apply&quot;. To 
  the extent however, that it did not want s. 1 to apply, it did so by using the 
  words &quot;having regard to s. 267.5&quot;. Thus, in subsection (a)(i) of s. 
  267.7(1), the use of the words &quot;having regard to s. 267.5&quot; is a clear 
  indication that s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act </i>is not to be applied in determining 
  the amount for which protected and unprotected defendants are to be held jointly 
  and severally liable to plaintiffs. By contrast, the use of the words &quot;in 
  the absence of s. 267.5&quot; in subsection (a)(ii) of s. 267.7(1) is a clear 
  indication that s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> is to be applied in calculating 
  the amount that the unprotected defendants &quot;would have been liable to make 
  contribution and indemnify the protected defendants in respect of damages&nbsp; 
   .&quot;</p>
<p> [21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this regard, I agree with the observations of S. G. McKee and L. 
  Chiarotto at p.&nbsp;5 of their paper entitled &quot;Unprotected Defendants: 
  Out of Sight, Out of Mind&quot;, <i>Practical Strategies for Advocates (VII)</i>, 
  (Advocates' Society, Toronto, January 1998):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . section 267.7 does, by necessary implication, make reference to the 
      <i>Negligence Act</i>, and indicates the relation between the section and 
      the <i>Negligence Act</i>. As previously explained, &quot;the amount that 
      the other persons (i.e. unprotected defendants) would have been liable to 
      make contribution and indemnify the protected defendants in respect of damages 
      <i>in the absence of section 267.5</i>&quot; [emphasis added] would be determined 
      in accordance with section 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>. If section 267.5 
      did not exist, protected defendants would be liable for the plaintiff's 
      entire losses, and the <i>Negligence Act</i> would govern the joint and 
      several liability of all defendants and the liability of the defendants 
      to make contribution and indemnification as amongst themselves. Thus, in 
      the absence of section 267.5, &quot;unprotected&quot; defendants would be 
      liable to make contribution and indemnify &quot;protected&quot; defendants 
      &quot;in the degree in which the unprotected defendants are found to be 
      at fault&quot;, as per section 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In other words, s. 267.7(1)(a)(i) of the Act limits the joint and several 
  liability of an unprotected defendant to a plaintiff to the same extent that 
  a protected defendant's liability is limited by virtue of s. 267.5 of the Act 
  and as such, it modifies the extent to which an unprotected defendant would 
  otherwise be liable under s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>. Accordingly, I 
  do not share Dyson J.'s view that the extent of an unprotected defendant's liability 
  is governed, without exception, by s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, such that 
  unprotected defendants remain liable on a joint and several basis &quot;to pay 
  any shortfall occasioned by the application of the limiting provisions of the 
  Act as they apply to protected defendants&quot;. </p>
<p> [23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, I am of the view that Dyson J. erred in characterizing s. 267.7(1)(a)(ii) 
  as ambiguous and lacking in clarity and that he further erred in relying upon 
  this characterization as a basis for refusing to interpret the provision in 
  a way that would extinguish the &quot;common law right [of plaintiffs] to be 
  compensated for the full amount of their loss.&quot;</p>
<p> [24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The parties agree that apart from subsection (1)(a)(ii) of s. 267.7, 
  the other sections in that provision, including (1)(a)(i) and (1)(b) and (c), 
  are clear and unambiguous. With respect to subsection (1)(a)(ii), the appellants 
  submit that although it is &quot;densely&quot; drafted, it is nonetheless clear 
  and unambiguous. The respondents do not share that view. For convenience, s. 
  267.7(1)(a) is again reproduced:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>267.7</b>  (1)  If, in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury 
      or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an 
      automobile, one or more protected defendants and one or more other persons

    <p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> the other persons,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> (i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are jointly and severally liable with the protected defendants 
        for the damages for which the protected defendants are liable, having 
        regard to section 267.5, and</p>
      <p> (ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> are solely liable for any amount by which the amount mentioned 
        in subclause (i) is less than the amount that the other persons would 
        have been liable to make contribution and indemnify the protected defendants 
        in respect of damages in the absence of section 267.5;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the appellants that subsection (1)(a)(ii) is &quot;densely&quot; 
  drafted. That said, I accept their further submission that the wording is neither 
  ambiguous nor unclear. To the contrary, when the provision is read carefully 
  as a whole, its meaning is clear and the intent of the legislature obvious.</p>
<p> [26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Manifestly, subsection (1)(a)(ii) is a legislated formula designed to 
  calculate the amount of damages, if any, for which unprotected defendants are 
  to be held solely responsible to plaintiffs over and above that for which they 
  and the protected defendants are held jointly and severally responsible under 
  subsection (1)(a)(i). To arrive at that figure, one must determine under (1)(a)(ii) 
  the amount that the unprotected defendants &quot;would have been liable to make 
  contribution and indemnify the <i>protected defendants</i> in respect of damages 
  <i>in the absence of s. 267.5</i>&quot; [Emphasis added.]. </p>
<p> [27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In other words, in the case of damages for non-pecuniary loss, the question 
  is: what would the unprotected defendants have had to pay to the protected defendants 
  by way of contribution and indemnity in the absence of s. 267.5(7) deductibles? 
  The answer, of course, is found in s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, namely, 
  &quot;in the absence of any contract express or implied, each is liable to make 
  contribution and indemnify each <i>other in the degree in which they are respectively 
  found to be at fault or negligence</i>&quot;. Carrying on with the calculation, 
  to the extent, if any, that this figure is greater than the amount for which 
  the protected and unprotected defendants are jointly and severally liable to 
  the plaintiff under subsection (1)(a)(i), then that is the amount for which 
  the unprotected defendant will be solely responsible to the plaintiff under 
  subsection (1)(a)(ii). If, on the other hand, that figure is equal to or less 
  than the amount for which the protected and unprotected defendants are jointly 
  and severally liable to the plaintiff under subsection (1)(a)(i), then the unprotected 
  defendants are not liable to pay anything above and beyond the subsection (1)(a)(i) 
  amount.</p>
<p> [28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, I fail to see how subsection (1)(a)(ii) can be construed 
  differently, especially when one gives effect to the words &quot;protected defendants&quot;. 
  Surely, if it were the intention of the legislature that in the case of damages 
  for non-pecuniary loss, the unprotected defendants should bear one hundred per 
  cent of the s. 267.5(7) deductibles, then the word &quot;plaintiffs&quot; as 
  opposed to &quot;protected defendants&quot; would have been used in subsection 
  (1)(a)(ii). More to the point, if the interpretation suggested by the respondents 
  and endorsed by Dyson J. is correct, there would have been no need to create 
  the formula in subsection (1)(a)(ii) in the first place. Rather, a simple statement 
  to the effect that the nature and extent of an unprotected defendant's liability 
  shall be governed by s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> would have sufficed. 
</p>
<p> [29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As indicated, that is precisely how Dyson J. construed s. 267.7(1)(a). 
  In doing so, he relied on s. 267.5(10) which, it will be recalled, reads as 
  follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(10)  Subsections (1), (3) and (5) do not relieve any person from liability 
      other than a protected defendant.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, I believe that Dyson J.'s construction of s. 267.5(10) 
  constituted a further error in his analysis. That provision makes it clear that 
  the legislated bars to suit referred to in subsections (1), (3) and (5) of s. 
  267.5 apply only to protected defendants, not unprotected defendants. That, 
  in my view, is its sole purpose. It has nothing to do with the extent of an 
  unprotected defendant's liability. That issue is addressed in s.&nbsp;267.7(1). 
  It follows, in my view, that s. 267.5(10) is irrelevant to the issue at hand 
  and it should have formed no part of Dyson J.'s analysis.</p>
<p> [31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, I believe that Dyson J. erred in construing s. 267.7(1) from 
  the perspective that the legislature did not intend to benefit unprotected defendants 
  or their insurer's at the expense of plaintiffs. In this regard, I note that 
  Bill 59 is the third in a series of tort restrictive regimes enacted by various 
  governments with a view to stabilizing automobile insurance rates. An excellent 
  discussion of the predecessor regimes and the degree of liability ascribed in 
  each to unprotected defendants can be found at pp. 2 and 3 of the McKee and 
  Chiarotto article referred to above. As the learned authors point out, in each 
  of the former regimes, the legislature enacted provisions to ensure that unprotected 
  defendants and their insurers would not be saddled with the entire burden of 
  the benefits afforded to protected defendants and their insurers: see s. 266(5) 
  of the <i>Ontario Motorists Protection Plan</i> or Bill 68 (applicable to accidents 
  occurring between June 22, 1990 and December 31, 1993) and ss. 267.1(7) and 
  (10) of Bill 164 (applicable to accidents occurring between January 1, 1994 
  and October 31, 1996). From this, it is apparent that the purpose of the legislation 
  was not to benefit protected defendants or their insurers at the expense of 
  unprotected defendants and their insurers. Rather, in an effort to stabilize 
  automobile insurance rates, the former regimes provided for an exchange of rights 
  wherein accident victims would, in certain instances, lose the right to sue 
  but receive, in return, more generous first-party benefits, regardless of fault, 
  from their insurers: see <i>Meyer v. Bright</i> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 at 
  134 (C.A.).</p>
<p> [32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I read Bill 59, there is nothing in it which causes me to believe 
  that the legislature intended to alter its pre-existing policy towards unprotected 
  defendants, such that they should now be required to bear the full burden of 
  the benefits afforded to protected defendants and their insurers. The legislative 
  intent is still that persons injured in motor vehicle accidents give up certain 
  rights in tort in exchange for enhanced first party benefits from their insurer: 
  see <i>Henderson v. Parker</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 462 at 470-3 (Ont.Ct.(Gen.Div.)). 
  Indeed, as the appellants point out, s. 267.7(1) of the Act is virtually identical 
  to s. 267.1(10) of the predecessor legislation. In <i>Derksen v. 539938 Ontario 
  Ltd</i>. (1998), 37 M.V.R. (3d) 59 (Ont.Ct.(Gen.Div.)); aff'd (1999), 123 O.A.C. 
  232; aff'd [2001] S.C.J. No. 27, Stach J. observed that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Subsection 267.1(10) deals with the liability of unprotected defendants 
      for non-pecuniary losses. Its effect is to limit the liability of the contractor 
      as an unprotected defendant only to the extent that the contractor or its 
      employee is at fault or negligent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Stach J.'s interpretation of s. 267.1(10) and I am satisfied that 
  it continues to apply in respect of s. 267.7(1). </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p> [33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 267.7(1)(a) of the Act should be interpreted to mean that if 
  one or more protected defendants and one or more unprotected defendants are 
  found to be liable for damages for non-pecuniary loss, the unprotected defendants 
  liability is to be determined as follows:</p>
<p> (a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> the unprotected defendants are jointly and severally liable with the 
  protected defendants for the damages for non-pecuniary loss for which the protected 
  defendants are liable under the Act; and</p>
<p> (b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> using the gross figure for non-pecuniary loss, the unprotected defendants 
  are solely liable to the plaintiff for the amount, if any, by which the amount 
  that they would have been liable to make contribution and indemnify the protected 
  defendants under the <i>Negligence Act</i>, exceeds the figure calculated in 
  (a) above.</p>
<p> [34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the result, I would allow the appeal and vary the order of Dyson 
  J. in accordance with these reasons. The appellants are entitled to their costs 
  of the appeal and the motion.<b></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Moldaver J.A. 
  and I respectfully disagree with his conclusion.  Instead, I am of the opinion 
  that the trial judge was correct in holding that unprotected defendants are 
  liable for excluded damages.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moldaver J.A. is of the opinion that the trial judge erred in 
  saying that an unprotected defendant would be responsible to pay any shortfall 
  occasioned by the application of the provisions of the <i>Negligence Act</i>,<span
style='color:black'> R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, </span>as they apply to protected defendants 
  pursuant to s.&nbsp;1 of that<i> </i>Act<i>.  </i>Even if this is so, I find 
  the additional three factors the trial judge articulated in his reasons support 
  the interpretation he gave to s.&nbsp;267.7(1)(a) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended (the <i>Act</i>).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the trial judge found that s.&nbsp;267.5(10) of the <i>Act</i> 
  provided an important clue to the meaning of s.&nbsp;267.7(1)(a).  That provision 
  reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 267.5(10) Subsections (1),<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> (3)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
      [4] </span></a> and (5)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> 
      [5] </span></a> do not relieve any person from liability other than a protected 
      defendant.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moldaver J.A. is of the opinion that the sole purpose of this 
  provision is to make it clear that the legislated bars to suit referred to in 
  subsections (1), (3) and (5) of s.&nbsp;267.5 apply only to protected defendants, 
  not unprotected defendants.  In other words, the provision has nothing to do 
  with the extent of an unprotected defendants liability.  The section contains 
  no wording limiting its application in the manner suggested by Moldaver J.A. 
  and I would not limit its application.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the trial judge found the wording in s.&nbsp;267.7(1)(a)(ii) 
  to be ambiguous and lacking in clarity and that any restriction on the common 
  law right of plaintiffs to be compensated for the full amount of their loss 
  required clear and unambiguous language.  Certainly, it cannot be said that 
  the section clearly restricts the right at common law of plaintiffs to compensation.  
  In his article, Unprotected Defendants:  An update on Practical Strategies 
  in Suing or Defending Claims against Unprotected Clients and Addendum: The 
  Apportionment Question (Advocate Society Practical Strategies VIII) delivered 
  February 19, 1999, Stephen R. Moore interpreted s. 267.7 in the manner adopted 
  by the trial judge.  Inasmuch as reasonable people may differ as to the interpretation 
  of the section, I find it difficult to see how the section can be said to be 
  clear and unambiguous.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, the trial judge observed that the purpose of the legislation 
  was the stabilization of car insurance rates.  This court in <i>Meyer v. Bright</i> 
  (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 at 134 (C.A.) stated that: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he Ontario legislature enacted s. 266 and other related amendments to 
      the Act for the purpose of significantly limiting the right of the victim 
      of a motor vehicle accident to maintain a tort action against the tortfeasor.  
      The scheme of compensation provides for <i>an exchange of rights </i>wherein 
      the accident victim loses the right to sue unless coming within the statutory 
      exemptions, but receives more generous first-party benefits, regardless 
      of fault, from his or her own insurer.  The legislation appears designed 
      to control the cost of automobile insurance premiums to the consumer by 
      eliminating some tort claims.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The exchange of rights referenced by the Court of Appeal relates 
  solely to the rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the victim and the protected defendants 
  referenced in s. 266 of the<i> Insurance Act. </i> A tortfeasor who is an unprotected 
  defendant will not impact on the cost of car insurance.  An unprotected defendant 
  has no rights to exchange with a plaintiff and is therefore unable to obtain 
  the benefit of the legislative compromise.</p>

lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
