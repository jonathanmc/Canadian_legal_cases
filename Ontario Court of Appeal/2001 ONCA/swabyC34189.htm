<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-weight:normal'>On appeal from the conviction 
  imposed by Justice Hugh R. Locke, sitting with a jury, dated March 17, 2000, 
  and from the sentence imposed by Justice Hugh R. Locke dated May, 2000.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>SHARPE J.A.:</p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Acting on a confidential tip, police officers followed a car 
  driven by the appellant in which William Johnson was a passenger.  The car stopped 
  and Johnson ran into a nearby backyard.  The appellant drove off.  Both men 
  were arrested shortly thereafter.  The police found a loaded, unregistered, 
  restricted handgun in the backyard. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Johnson, the main Crown witness at the appellant’s trial, pleaded 
  guilty to possession of the handgun and received a sentence of time served (42 
  days).  Johnson had a significant criminal record and was the subject of immigration 
  proceedings. The appellant was tried before a judge and jury on an indictment 
  containing eight counts.  He was convicted of being an occupant in a vehicle 
  knowing there was present an unlicensed restricted weapon, but acquitted on 
  all other counts. </p>
<span style='font-weight:
normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> <span style='font-weight:normal'>The central issues on this appeal 
are whether the trial judge properly answered the jury’s question regarding the 
time at which the appellant knew of the gun, and whether the trial judge should 
have instructed the jury on the use it could make of Johnson’s criminal record 
in assessing his credibility.</span>
<p class=MsoBodyText><u>Facts </u></p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant faced two sets of charges.  He was charged with 
  possession of an unregistered restricted weapon, possession of prohibited ammunition, 
  possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, being an 
  occupant of a motor vehicle knowing there was present a restricted weapon for 
  which no occupant held a permit permitting possession, and possession of a firearm 
  with serial number defaced.  The second set of charges involved an allegation 
  that on the day after his arrest, the appellant threatened Johnson.  He was 
  charged with attempt to obstruct justice, threatening death, and threatening 
  bodily harm.  </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown’s case largely rested on the evidence of Johnson.  
  He testified that the gun belonged to the appellant.  Johnson denied any knowledge 
  of its existence until the two were in the appellant’s car.  He swore that as 
  they were driving, the appellant became alarmed by the attention of the police.  
  The appellant told Johnson that he had a gun.  The appellant stopped the vehicle, 
  handed Johnson the gun, and instructed him to dispose of it in a backyard. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant testified that he had no knowledge of the gun.  
  It was his evidence that Johnson was the one who became concerned by the attention 
  the police were paying to the vehicle.  The appellant thought Johnson might 
  have had illegal drugs.  He followed Johnson’s instructions where to drive and 
  stopped the vehicle at Johnson’s request.  When Johnson bolted from the vehicle, 
  the appellant drove off.  It was his evidence that he only learned of the gun 
  after his arrest.</p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was acquitted of all charges, with the exception 
  of the charge of being an occupant of a motor vehicle knowing there was present 
  a restricted weapon for which no occupant held a permit permitting possession.  
  On that count, he was convicted and given a six-month sentence.  He appeals 
  both conviction and sentence. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><u>Issues</u></p>
<p>The appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal.  I find it necessary only 
  to deal with two of those grounds: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)   Did the trial judge err in his answer to jury questions relating 
      to the occupant of motor vehicle charge? </p>
    <p>(2)   Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury that Johnson’s 
      criminal record could be used to impugn his credibility? </p>

</span></span> <span style='font-weight:normal'>The charging provision under which 
the appellant was convicted was s. 91(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, 
c. C-46:</span> 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-weight:normal'>91 (3) Every one who is an occupant of

</span></span> This provision was repealed shortly after the incident giving rise 
to these charges and replaced by what is now section 94 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
(S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139).  The new provision removes the reverse onus feature 
of section 91(3) and adds a further defence in the following terms. 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-weight:normal'>94(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to 
      an occupant of a motor vehicle who, on becoming aware of the presence of 
      the firearm, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device or 
      prohibited ammunition in the motor vehicle, attempted to leave the motor 
      vehicle, to the extent that it was feasible to do so, or actually left the 
      motor vehicle.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his charge to the jury, the trial judge dealt very briefly 
  with this count.  He read the jury the terms of section 91(3) and instructed 
  them that the count “alleges that Mr. Swaby was in possession of the same weapon 
  while he was an occupant of a motor vehicle”.  It is common ground that this 
  instruction was incorrect and, indeed, that it favoured the appellant, as possession 
  was not a necessary element of the section 91(3) offence. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the jury had been deliberating for several hours, it asked 
  the following question: “Please explain the charge, number 3, [the section 91(3) 
  offence] with regard to the time frame of being aware of the weapon”.  When 
  the trial judge read the question in the presence of the jury, the foreperson 
  explained as follows: “Yes, it is awkwardly worded but basically it is questioning 
  the amount of time that someone would have to have anything to be considered 
  in possession or to be aware of its existence”. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge answered the question by reading the count from 
  the indictment and then again reading s. 91(3) to the jury.  He offered the 
  following instruction: “You must be satisfied on the evidence according to the 
  standard that I mentioned to you that Mr. Swaby must be proven to have been 
  aware of the existence of the weapon while both he and Mr. Johnson were in that 
  vehicle”. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The foreperson pursued the matter, saying: “Anything further 
  that you can explain would be useful.”  The trial judge said that he could think 
  of nothing further to add but indicated that if further clarification was required, 
  the jury could pose another question after it retired. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Again the foreperson pursued the matter asking: “So then the 
  time is not necessarily that critical?”  The trial judge’s answer was as follows 
  “He must know of the existence of the weapon.  You must be satisfied on the 
  evidence you have heard in total throughout the trial but with respect to this 
  particular question that you have asked, it must be proven by the Crown to have 
  known of the existence of that weapon in that vehicle while both he and Mr. 
  Johnson were in it.” </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The jury retired and the appellant’s trial counsel objected to 
  the trial judge’s answer, submitting that the jury “should also be told that 
  if Mr. Swaby became aware of the existence after he got into the vehicle with 
  Mr. Johnson that they can only find him to be in possession of it if he allowed 
  or if he consented to it being in the car”.  The trial judge stated that he 
  did not disagree with that proposition but that it was his habit “to answer 
  juror’s questions and not to implant other matters that they haven’t asked about 
  into their minds”.  He refused to give any further instructions.  The jury returned 
  with its verdict shortly thereafter. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the trial judge erred in failing to give the jury 
  a more complete answer to the questions it posed.  The questions indicated that 
  the jury was concerned about when the appellant had learned of the existence 
  of the gun.  Although the appellant testified that he did not know of the gun’s 
  existence until after he was arrested, it certainly was open on the evidence 
  for the jury to conclude that the appellant learnt of its existence sometime 
  after he and Johnson had embarked on their journey in the appellant’s vehicle. 
</p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To establish guilt on this count, the Crown had to prove the 
  coincidence of the two essential elements of the offence as defined by s. 91(3), 
  namely occupancy of the vehicle and the appellant’s knowledge of the weapon.  
  In my view, it is implicit as well that the Crown had to prove that the coincidence 
  of occupancy and knowledge was attributable to something amounting to voluntary 
  conduct on the part of the appellant.  Although the section under which the 
  appellant was charged contained no explicit defence in the terms of the present 
  s. 94(3), it must be interpreted so as to exclude the possibility of conviction 
  for what would amount to an involuntary act. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Voluntary conduct is a necessary element for criminal liability: 
  see A.W. Mewett &amp; M. Manning, <i>Mewett &amp; Manning on Criminal Law,</i> 
  3rd ed. (Butterworths: Toronto, 1994) at pp. 129-32; Glanville Williams, <i>Textbook 
  on Criminal Law,</i> 2nd ed. (Stevens &amp; Sons: London, 1983) at pp. 146-54.  
  The requirement for voluntary conduct applies even if the provision creating 
  the offence does not expressly require one: see Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal 
  Law: A Treatise</i>, 3rd ed (Carswell: Toronto, 1995) at p. 94: “There is no 
  general Code stipulation that the guilty act be voluntary.  The requirement 
  exists by virtue of judicial reasoning…”  As explained by McLachlin J. in <i>R. 
  v. Théroux </i>(1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at p. 458, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5: &quot;…the 
  act must be the voluntary act of the accused for the <i>actus reus</i> to exist.&quot; 
</p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If one acquires knowledge of an illegal weapon while travelling 
  in a moving vehicle, it surely cannot be the law that criminal liability instantly 
  attaches.  There must be some period of time, however short, afforded to the 
  person who has acquired that knowledge to deal with the situation.  If a passenger 
  tells the driver that the passenger has a gun, it cannot be the case that the 
  driver is immediately guilty.  Should the driver immediately stop the vehicle 
  and tell the passenger to leave, the driver would have known of the gun while 
  he was an occupant of the vehicle, but he would have done all the law could 
  expect.  The driver’s occupancy of the vehicle would have coincided with his 
  knowledge of the gun, but it could not be said that the coincidence of knowledge 
  and occupancy amounted to voluntary conduct on the part of the driver.  It is 
  the conduct of the driver following the coincidence of occupancy and knowledge 
  that counts, and if the driver acts with appropriate dispatch to get either 
  the gun or himself out of the vehicle, there is no voluntary act for the criminal 
  law to punish. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, it is my view that if the appellant acquired knowledge 
  of the weapon while the vehicle was in motion, he would have to be given a reasonable 
  opportunity to either remove himself or to see that the weapon was removed from 
  the vehicle.  If the appellant only acquired knowledge of the weapon at the 
  point when Johnson was leaving the vehicle, he would be entitled to an acquittal. 
</p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not accept the Crown's argument that there was no “air of 
  reality” to a defence on this point.  Nor do I agree that because the appellant 
  denied all knowledge of the weapon, he was not entitled to insist that the jury 
  be given a complete answer to its questions.  The appellant did put his knowledge 
  of the gun in issue.  It was certainly open to the jury to reject the appellant’s 
  evidence that he knew nothing of the weapon, yet find that he did not learn 
  of its presence in the vehicle until sometime after he embarked on his drive 
  with Johnson.  The jury’s verdict on the other counts demonstrates that the 
  jury rejected Johnson's evidence that the gun belonged to the appellant.  If 
  the jury could only acquit on the precise basis of the appellant's evidence, 
  surely the same principle would mean they could only convict on the precise 
  basis of Johnson's evidence, yet that is plainly not the case.  The jury, as 
  it was entitled to do, disbelieved both Johnson and the appellant.  Even though 
  he was disbelieved, the appellant was entitled to a full answer to the jury's 
  very specific questions regarding the timing of his knowledge of the gun.  After 
  being told that &quot;…Mr. Swaby must be proven to have been aware of the existence 
  of the weapon while both he and Mr. Johnson were in that vehicle,&quot; the 
  foreperson persisted, asking for further help.  The jury's specific and persistent 
  questions regarding the timing of the appellant’s knowledge of the gun indicate 
  that they were asking for guidance on the legal principles they should apply 
  if they found that appellant acquired knowledge of the weapon after he had got 
  into the car with Johnson.  The jury’s questions also suggest an instinctive 
  awareness, albeit in lay terms, of the voluntariness point I have just discussed.  
  They needed and asked for help on the point, but their questions were not fully 
  answered by the trial judge. </p>

</span></span> In these circumstances, it is my view that the appellant was entitled 
to a fuller explanation from the trial judge of the necessary elements of this 
offence dealing more thoroughly with the circumstances in which guilt would follow 
if knowledge of the weapon were acquired after the vehicle was set in motion.  
I respectfully disagree with the trial judge that this would amount to embarking 
upon something the jury had not asked about.  To the contrary, the terms of the 
question posed by the jury and the persistent attempts of the foreperson to get 
further clarification indicate that that the jury needed help on the point.  The 
importance that should be attached to jury questions and the need for correct 
and comprehensive answers is well-established.  The following passage from the 
judgment of Cory J. in <i>R. v. S (W.D.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p. 8, 
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 521 is applicable here: 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There can be no doubt about the significance which must be attached to 
      questions from the jury and the fundamental importance of giving correct 
      and comprehensive responses to those questions. With the question the jury 
      has identified the issues upon which it requires direction.  It is this 
      issue upon which the jury has focused.  No matter how exemplary the original 
      charge may have been, it is essential that the recharge on the issue presented 
      by the question be correct and comprehensive. No less will suffice.  The 
      jury has said in effect, on this issue there is confusion; please help us. 
      That help must be provided.</p>

  </span></span> Johnson’s prior criminal record included convictions for failing 
  to comply with a recognizance, obstruction of justice, and assault.  Johnson’s 
  criminal record was introduced by Crown counsel in examination-in-chief.  When 
  he was cross-examined, Johnson offered excuses for each conviction. </p>

  </span></span> Other factors relevant to Johnson’s credibility were the suggestions 
  that his irregular immigration status would be further threatened by his involvement 
  with illegal weapons, and that he was shifting blame for the gun to the appellant 
  having received an unusually lenient sentence on his plea of guilty.  In charging 
  the jury, the trial judge did not give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, nor did he 
  make any references to the use the jury could make of Johnson’s criminal record.  
  The appellant’s trial counsel objected to the trial judge's failure to explain 
  the use that could be made of Johnson's criminal record, and the trial judge 
  indicated both that he had intentionally not given the instruction and that 
  he would not give any further direction on the point. </p>

  </span></span> It has been held that trial judges have considerable discretion 
  in determining whether and how to instruct juries in this area.  However, the 
  discretion is not completely unfettered and, in appropriate cases, it is subject 
  to appellate review: <i>R. v. Bevan</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310, [1993] 2 
  S.C.R. 599; <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 321, [2000] 1 S.C.R.

<p><span style='font-weight:

  </span></span> In my view, the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the 
  jury on the use it could make of Johnson’s criminal record.  Johnson was a crucial 
  witness for the Crown. The appellant denied Johnson’s version of the incident 
  and Johnson’s credibility was not only very much under attack but also weakened 
  by the factors I have mentioned.  It is difficult to conceive of a reason for 
  not giving the usual instruction on this point. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:
normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent sought to justify the refusal to give the usual 
  instruction on the ground that that Johnson had effectively explained away the 
  significance of the convictions under cross-examination. I do not accept this 
  submission.  It is far from clear to me that the jury would have been persuaded 
  by his explanations.  Indeed, there is a good chance the jury would be even 
  more dubious as to his veracity because of what he said about his criminal record.  
  The jury was entitled to the usual instruction that Johnson’s convictions could 
  be taken into account in assessing his credibility. </p>
<p><span style='font-weight:

</span></span> The appellant raises a number of other grounds of appeal.  In view 
of the conclusion I have already reached, it is unnecessary to deal with these 
grounds.  I note, however, that one point raised by the appellant is that the 
section under which he was charged had been found contrary to the <i>Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms</i> several months before his trial in <i>R. v. Phillips and 
Williams</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 514, 138 D.L.R. (4th) 121 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  
The appellant did not raise this issue at trial.  I express no view, one way or 
the other, as to the constitutionality of the former s. 91(3).  As I would order 
a new trial, it would be open to the appellant to raise the issue at that new 
trial if so advised.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I have had the benefit of reading the draft 
  reasons prepared by my colleague Sharpe J.A., who would allow the appeal and 
  order a new trial on two grounds: (1) the trial judge erred in his answer to 
  the jury questions relating to the only offence in the eight count indictment 
  on which he was convicted; and (2) the trial judge erred by failing to instruct 
  the jury that the criminal record of the Crown’s main witness could be used 
  to impugn his credibility.</span> </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, I do not agree that the trial judge erred on either 
  of these two matters.  Because my colleague has fully and accurately described 
  the relevant facts, I can state the reasons for my disagreement in brief fashion. 
</p>
<p class=heading3subtitle> <b><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The chief Crown witness, Johnson, testified that the gun belonged 
  to the appellant.  The jury obviously disbelieved Johnson or had a reasonable 
  doubt about his testimony because they acquitted the appellant of the several 
  charges relating to possession of the gun and ammunition. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant testified that <i>at no time</i> until after charges 
  were laid did he know that there was a gun in his car.  In spite of this testimony, 
  the appellant now contends that, in response to the jury’s questions, the trial 
  judge should have given a broad answer that would have included an instruction 
  on a scenario on which there was no evidence – namely, that the appellant became 
  aware that Johnson had a gun at some point during their ride together in the 
  car.  In such a circumstance, I do not think that the trial judge erred by answering 
  the jury’s questions within the context of the evidence they had heard: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>He must know of the existence of the weapon.  You must be satisfied on 
      the evidence you have heard in total throughout the trial  but with respect 
      to this particular question that you have asked, it must be proven by the 
      Crown to have known of the existence of that weapon in that vehicle while 
      both he and Mr. Johnson were in it.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
In my view, this was a precise and, in light of the evidence (especially the appellant’s 
position at trial), appropriate response to the jury’s questions.
<p class=heading3subtitle> <b><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span lang=EN-GB>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge provided no instruction on the use  the jury 
  could make of Johnson’s prior criminal record.  When defence counsel objected, 
  the trial judge replied that his omission was intentional.  As my colleague 
  notes, appellate courts have held that trial judges have considerable discretion 
  in determining whether and how to instruct juries in this area. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I am not inclined to interfere with the trial judge’s exercise 
  of discretion in this case.  My principal reason for non-interference is the 
  actual verdicts reached by the jury.  They acquitted the accused of seven serious 
  offences relating to possession of restricted weapons and death threats against 
  Johnson.  These acquittals must have flowed from either outright rejection of 
  Johnson’s testimony or a reasonable doubt about it.  In short, the seven acquittals 
  indicate that the jury did not find Johnson to be a credible witness. Accordingly, 
  the absence of an instruction about how Johnson’s criminal record could be used 
  by the jury in assessing his credibility did not prejudice the appellant.  His 
  conviction on the eighth, and most minor, count in the indictment was probably 
  based on the jury’s rejection of the appellant’s testimony (no knowledge of 
  the gun in the car) and acceptance of Crown evidence other than Johnson’s testimony.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span> For the sake of completeness, I would indicate that I see no merit 
in the other six grounds of appeal raised by the appellant on his conviction appeal.  
I would also not give effect to the appeal against sentence.  Accordingly, I would 
dismiss the appeal.
