lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On the informant issue at trial, the defence 
    submitted that the Crown was obliged to inform them of the identity of Constable 
    Duval’s informant because the innocence at stake exception for the informant 
    privilege was relevant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The defence asserted that the informant was 
    Conrad Doucet although they submitted before us that they were not certain 
    of this.  They testified that Doucet was involved in the drug transaction 
    on September 21, 1999.  Constable Duval testified that he did not see Doucet 
    during the transaction.  It was open to the defence to call Doucet as a witness 
    or ask the court to call him.  They did not follow either course.  On this 
    record we do not think that there is any substance to the complaint of non-disclosure 
    of the informant’s identity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>We accept the respondent’s submission respecting 
    the effect of the appellants’ evidence at trial – at least to the extent that 
    it afforded the basis of a finding of guilt against each of them – against 
    Rozon, of being guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking and against 
    Tanguay, of aiding and abetting in the trafficking of the marijuana in question.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Although the trial judge should not have placed 
    any reliance on the “credibility” of counsel for the Crown, we do not think 
    that this error had any material effect in light of the appellants’ decision 
    not to call Doucet to give evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Respecting the submission of non-disclosure, 
    on the record, including the effect of the appellant’s evidence to which we 
    have referred, we do not think it occasioned any prejudice to the appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In our view, the police, on the basis of what 
    was observed during the transactions in the parking lot in the shopping mall, 
    had reasonable and probable grounds to effect the arrests and the searches.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On the subject of sentence, having regard to 
    the nature of the drug (marijuana) and the quantity (2.575 kilograms), we 
    think that the sentences were excessive in the sense that they fell outside 
    the acceptable range.  The appellants, particularly Tanguay, had serious criminal 
    records and, accordingly, were not entitled to leniency.  In all of the circumstances, 
    we think that a fit sentence for each appellant would be twenty-seven months.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, the appeals from conviction are 
    dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentences is granted and each sentence is varied 
    to twenty-seven months.</span></p>
