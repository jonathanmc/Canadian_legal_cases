  </span></span> The respondents operate a Tim Hortons franchise on the south 
  side of Fourth Avenue in St. Catharines.  There is significant commercial development 
  in the area, including a “Power Center” that will consist of a number of large 
  retail operations on the property adjacent to that of the respondents. The appellant 
  Municipality decided that it was necessary for operational and safety reasons 
  to widen Fourth Avenue from a two-lane rural cross-section to a four, and in 
  some locations five-lane urban cross-section.  The plan includes a continuous 
  centre median running along the widened segment of the road.  The median would 
  prevent motorists heading west along Fourth Avenue from making a left turn directly 
  into the respondents’ Tim Hortons shop.  Instead, westbound patrons would have 
  to take a circuitous route, partially on private lands, to access the shop.  
  The centre median would also prevent patrons leaving the respondents’ premises 
  from turning left onto Fourth Avenue.  </p>

  </span></span> The respondents challenged the right of the appellant to enact 
  a bylaw imposing the continuous centre median.  The respondents rely on the 
  <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 298, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>s. 298(1) A by-law shall not be passed for stopping up, 
      altering or diverting any highway or part of a highway if the effect of 
      the by-law will be to deprive any person of the means of ingress and egress 
      to and from the person’s land or place of residence over such highway or 
      part of it unless such person consents to the passing of the by-law or unless 
      in addition to making compensation to such person, as provided by this Act, 
      another convenient road or way of access to the land or place of residence 
      is provided.</span></p>

      not take effect until the sufficiency of such road or way of access has 
      been agreed upon or until, if not agreed upon, its sufficiency has been

      of it shall be determined by arbitration under this Act and, if the amount 
      of compensation is also not agreed upon, both matters shall be determined 
      by one and the same arbitration.</span></p>

      determines that the road or way of access provided is insufficient, he or 
      she may in the award determine what road or way of access should be provided

      the by-law is void and the corporation shall pay the costs of the arbitration

  </span></span> The respondents say that a continuous centre median preventing 
  westbound motorists from turning directly into their shop would significantly 
  affect their business. They insist that there be a cut in the median to allow 
  unimpeded access for west-bound traffic.  They moved, <i>inter alia</i>, for 
  a declaration that the by-law in question deprives them of access to part of 
  Fourth Avenue and that they are entitled to arbitration pursuant to s. 298 for 
  determination of another convenient means of access to that part of the roadway 
  and of the compensation to which they are entitled.  In a separate proceeding, 
  the respondents gave notice of their claim for compensation for injurious affection 
  pursuant to the <i>Expropriations Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In concluding that 
  the respondents were entitled to the declaratory relief they sought, the motions 
  court judge found as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The restriction of left turn movements created by the continuous median 
      adjacent to the Tim Hortons effectively divests it of all westbound traffic 
      flow and removes any means of access over the eastbound part of the highway.  
      The use of the words “the means of ingress and egress to and from the person’s 
      land” and “over such highway <u>or part of it</u>” (emphasis added) in s. 
      298 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> qualifies the concept of “deprivation” and 
      does not, in my view, require that a landowner be totally or wholly deprived 
      of all access to and from the land.  The purpose of s. 298 seems to be to 
      provide a balance between the preservation of common law rights of access 
      and the public interest in road improvements.  I find that where there has 
      been a substantial impairment of access beyond the de minimis range such 
      as exists here, the element of “deprivation” in s. 298 has been satisfied.</p>

  </span></span> In my respectful view, the motions court judge erred in her interpretation 
  of s. 298(1).  While the decided cases are not on all fours with the facts of 
  the present case, there is a consistent line of authority that s. 298(1) only 
  applies where the effect of the by-law is to deprive the landowner of his or 
  her only means of access to the highway.  The statutory remedy does not apply 
  where some means of access remains and the by-law merely limits the landowner's 
  access.  Interruption of a preferred or alternate means of access may well give 
  rise to a remedy for compensation for injurious affection.  However, the property 
  owner who is left with some means of access cannot insist upon the more substantial 
  remedy offered by s. 298(1), requiring the municipality not only to pay compensation 
  but also to provide an alternate means of access.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien v. Swansea</i> [1940] 1 
  D.L.R. 446 (Ont. C.A.) the municipality enacted a by-law which had the effect 
  of depriving the property owner of access to his garage which led to the street.  
  The owner retained access from another point on his property to another street.  
  This court held that the owner had no right to insist that the municipality 
  provide alternative access pursuant to what was then s. 496(1) of the <i>Municipal 
  Act</i>.  Writing for the court, Robertson C.J.O. stated at p. 450:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is only when the “effect of the by-law will be to deprive any person 
      of the means of ingress and egress” that the subsection applies.  It seems 
      to me that it is plain when the statute speaks of <i>the</i> means of ingress 
      and egress what is contemplated is a property having only one means of ingress 
      and egress, and of that one means the land owner will be deprived by the 
      by-law.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>The statute plainly contemplates compensation being made under s. 347 
      of the <i>Municipal Act</i> to owners who are injuriously affected by closing 
      a street, and so long as the owner is not wholly excluded from access to 
      his land by a public highway there is no reason why the closing of any additional 
      means of access he may have, cannot be the subject of compensation.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This reasoning was followed in <i>The Trusts and Guarantee Co. 
  Ltd. v. The Municipal Corporation of the Township of Toronto</i>, [1942] O.R. 
  68 where the property owner had two means of access to the same highway.  The 
  effect of the by-law was to close off one of those means of access.  Chevrier 
  J. followed the dictum just quoted from the <i>Credit Foncier</i> case.  In 
  an early Ontario case, <i>Re McArthur and</i> <i>the Corporation of the Township 
  of Southwold</i> (1878), 3 O.A.R. 295, the court arrived at a similar interpretation 
  of an earlier version of s. 298(1).  At that time the statute required that 
  the claimant be “excluded from ingress and egress to and from his lands or place 
  of residence”.  The by-law at issue closed the road to which the owner had access 
  but the owner retained access to another road.  Patterson J.A. wrote at p. 305 
  that the owner had no claim under the statute &quot;because there was already 
  another mode of ingress and egress to and from the land in question…&quot;</p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents rely on the common law principle stated in <i>Toronto 
  Transit Commission v. Swansea</i>, [1935] S.C.R. 455 at p. 457, that a property 
  owner is entitled to access to a highway &quot;at any point at which his land 
  actually touches [the] highway for any kind of traffic which is necessary for 
  the reasonable enjoyment of his premises.&quot;  I do not accept the proposition 
  that the remedy conferred by s. 298(1) may be invoked in every case where a 
  by-law infringes a property owner's common law right of access to the highway.  
  In my view, there is a clear distinction to be drawn between an interference 
  with a common law right of access, which will lead to a remedy for compensation 
  for injurious affection, and a denial of access, which will trigger the remedy 
  conferred by s. 298(1).  The statutory remedy under s. 298(1) consists not only 
  of compensation but also of a right to an alternative means of access and can 
  be invoked only where the owner is deprived of access, not where access is merely 
  limited.  </p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nor do I accept the contention that in s. 298 the words “or part 
  of it” qualify the concept of “deprivation” with the result that something less 
  than total deprivation of all access will trigger the remedy conferred by the 
  section.  The reference to deprivation of access “over such highway or part 
  of it” refers back to the earlier language relating to the by-law providing 
  for “stopping up, altering or diverting any highway or part of a highway”.  
  In my view, the words “part of a highway” refer simply to the portion of the 
  highway that is subject to the alteration or diversion.  They do not imply a 
  right to the statutory remedy where the owner's access is limited but not denied.  
  If the words “part of a highway” were to be given the meaning contended for 
  by the respondents, a property owner could insist upon access to every part 
  of the highway that suits the property owner's convenience.  </p>
<p style='
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, accepting the respondents' contention would seriously 
  and unduly impair the capacity of municipalities to make decisions necessary 
  in the public interest for the efficient and safe operation of highways.  To 
  take the facts of the present case, it seems to me that if these respondents 
  are entitled to insist upon a centre cut in the median to permit traffic to 
  turn left into their premises, every other business establishment along the 
  same road soliciting business from patrons travelling in both directions could 
  make the same demand.  If the respondents and all others similarly situated 
  could insist upon a centre cut in the median to afford access to their premises, 
  the municipality would, in effect, be powerless to create a centre median to 
  control the flow of traffic.</p>

  </span></span> As I have already noted, the respondents are not without a remedy. 
  They have filed for compensation for injurious affection.  In my view, they 
  are limited to that remedy and have no rights pursuant to s. 298(1).</p>
