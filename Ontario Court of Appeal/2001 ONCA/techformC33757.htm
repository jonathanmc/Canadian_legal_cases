  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice 
  Harriet E. Sachs dated January 31, 2000 and addendum dated February 17, 2000.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This appeal concerns ownership of an invention.  The respondent, 
  an employee of and then independent consultant to the appellant company, invented 
  a valuable type of trunk hinge.  The appellant claims that it is the owner of 
  this hinge, which the respondent worked on while being paid by the appellant.  
  Its claim is based principally on a written agreement.  Sachs&nbsp;J. concluded 
  that the appellant cannot rely on the agreement because there was no consideration 
  and, in any event, it was signed under duress.  I have concluded that the trial 
  judge erred in law in both respects and that the appeal must be allowed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent cross-appeals with respect to another invention 
  that the trial judge held was owned by the appellant.  I have concluded that 
  the trial judge’s finding in respect of the invention in question is correct 
  and I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge gave comprehensive reasons and this summary of 
  the facts is taken from her findings.  The respondent Tiete Wolda began employment 
  with the appellant Techform in 1981.  Although the respondent was employed as 
  a mechanical engineer, he does not have formal engineering qualifications in 
  Ontario.  Techform manufactures automotive parts and it hired the respondent 
  to help redesign the equipment or processes used to manufacture its main product, 
  door-locking rods.  While the respondent had created patentable products for 
  a previous employer, he was not called upon to do any inventing for Techform 
  until 1987.  In that year, Techform assigned to the respondent and two other 
  employees the task of inventing a hinge that would be suitable for the trunk 
  of a particular make of automobile.  They completed the project the following 
  year by inventing the “Dual Motion Deck Lid Hinge”.  Techform filed a patent 
  application for this invention although no patent was ever issued.  There is 
  no suggestion that Techform does not own this invention. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1989, the respondent’s relationship with Techform changed.  
  Techform is based in Penetanguishine.  The respondent decided to marry a woman 
  who lived and worked in Toronto.  He therefore submitted his resignation to 
  Techform.  The resignation was accepted and the respondent’s immediate superior, 
  Mr.&nbsp;VandenHeuvel, assumed that the respondent would obtain similar work 
  with a parts manufacturer in Toronto.  However, more senior executives of the 
  company were anxious to retain the respondent’s services and in September 1989, 
  Techform and the respondent signed a consultancy agreement.  The company retained 
  the respondent as a consultant on “special projects”.  The agreement was for 
  one year and could be terminated by either party on sixty days’ written notice.  
  Under the agreement, the respondent was to work a minimum of two days per week 
  at a defined hourly rate.  The agreement said nothing about the ownership of 
  inventions.  The trial judge found that as a result of this agreement, the respondent 
  was an independent contractor/consultant, not an employee.  This finding is 
  fully supported by the evidence.  The agreement was renewed each year until 
  it was terminated by Techform in 1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Towards the end of 1992, the respondent and a Techform employee 
  invented a hinge called the “Boxless Hinge”.  They had worked on this invention 
  on their own time and without Techform’s knowledge.  Instead of revealing this 
  product to their superiors in Penetanguishine, they made a direct presentation 
  in Michigan to Techform’s president, Ed Connelly.  Mr. Connelly was concerned 
  that the respondent and the employee had come to him without the knowledge of 
  the Penetanguishine management and that they might seek some royalty payment 
  for the invention.  He wrote to the Penetanguishine management expressing his 
  concerns and stated that he had told the respondent and the employee that Techform 
  did not pay royalties and that any patents would be applied for and owned by 
  the company.  Mr. Connelly died prior to the trial.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As a result of Mr. Connelly’s letter, Techform’s lawyers prepared 
  the Employee Technology Agreement. Mr. VandenHeuvel met with the respondent 
  to have him sign the ETA.  According to Mr. VandenHeuvel, the Boxless Spring 
  incident led Techform to put “a more formal method in place to safeguard the 
  confidentiality of new projects for Techform”.  As Mr. VendenHeuvel had little 
  memory of these events, the trial judge accepted the respondent’s version.  
  The respondent testified that when he reviewed the ETA he did not agree with 
  it and did not want to sign it.  He put it aside for a few days and then called 
  Mr. VandenHeuvel and asked him whether he wanted him to sign it.  The reply 
  was “Yes”.  He then knew that he had to sign or he would be let go.  At that 
  time, the respondent was in his middle fifties and was supporting two children.  
  As he put it, he “saw no way out”.  The respondent signed the ETA on February&nbsp;3, 
  1993.  He then took it to Mr. VandenHeuvel and told him that it was a “useless 
  piece of paper”, first, because he did not agree with it and second, because 
  he was not an employee.  At the top of the ETA the words “Employee’s Name” appeared 
  in typed form.  To indicate his protest, the respondent inserted a question 
  mark beside the word, “Employee”.  The respondent assumed by Mr. VandenHeuvel’s 
  silence that he agreed with him that the ETA did not apply to him and that he 
  accepted the question mark.  Mr. VandenHeuvel testified that if the respondent 
  had refused to sign the ETA, the company would have given him sixty days’ notice 
  of termination.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The ETA begins with the following clause:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      paid for my services during my employment</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The agreement then sets out a number of terms that may be summarized 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)            the respondent agreed to promptly inform the company of 
      the full details of all inventions that he conceived, completed or reduced 
      to practice while employed by the company and that related to the work of 
      the company, that result from work using any equipment, facilities, materials, 
      or personnel of the company, or that result from or are suggested by any 
      work which he may do for the company;</p>
    <p>(ii)            the respondent agreed “to assign and I do assign” to the 
      company “my entire right title and interest” in any such inventions and 
      all patent applications filed and patents granted, “which I conceive or 
      make (whether alone or with others) while employed by the Company or within 
      one year of the end of my employment (if conceived as a result of my employment)”; 
      and</p>
    <p>(iii)            the respondent agreed “while employed by the Company and 
      afterwards” to execute any papers that the company may consider necessary 
      or helpful to obtain or maintain patents.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>The ETA also included confidentiality 
  and non-competition terms.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1996, the company assigned to the respondent the task of designing 
  a tailgate hinge mechanism.  The respondent did so and at the request of the 
  company, the respondent executed a Declaration for Patent Application in July 
  1997.  The respondent was not asked to assign his patent rights.  This invention 
  is the subject of the cross-appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Also in 1996, the respondent invented the “3D Hinge”.  It is 
  this invention that is at the core of the litigation.  Over the ensuing months, 
  the respondent raised with the company the question of what compensation he 
  could expect in return for assigning to the company or a related Michigan company, 
  M &amp; C Corporation, rights to this invention.  He wanted an increase in his 
  hourly rate and an agreement that for every hinge sold, two cents would be paid 
  to a particular charity.  The company was outraged by these demands, which they 
  regarded as a betrayal of their relationship, and would not agree. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent billed Techform for approximately 1,000 hours 
  of work related to the 3D Hinge.  He also received the assistance of Techform 
  employees in refining the design.  The respondent worked with Techform’s United 
  States patent attorneys on the patent application and was paid for this work 
  by Techform.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On November 7, 1997, Techform’s solicitor wrote to the respondent’s 
  solicitor stating that the respondent’s employment was terminated because of 
  his breach of his obligations to Techform.  Litigation started soon thereafter.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In its statement of claim Techform asked for a declaration that 
  it was the owner of the 3D Hinge and of U.S. and Canadian patent applications 
  filed by it and the respondent.  It also sought an order vesting in it all right, 
  title and interest in the hinge.  Techform also sought a declaration that it 
  was the owner of the Tailgate Hinge Mechanism and an order vesting in it all 
  of the right title and interest in the Tailgate Hinge Mechanism.  The appellant 
  also applied for an injunction and made a claim for damages.</p>

  </span></span> At this point, I will very briefly summarize the significant 
  legal and factual holdings by the trial judge.  I will more fully set out her 
  findings as I deal with the specific issues.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)            At common law, the mere existence of an employment relationship 
      does not disqualify employees from patenting inventions made during the 
      course of their employment.</p>
    <p>(ii)            There are two exceptions to the presumption that employees 
      own their inventions:</p>
    <p>(a)            an express contract to the contrary; or</p>
    <p>(b)            where the person was expressly employed for the purpose 
      of inventing or innovating.</p>
    <p>(iii)            An independent contractor who makes an invention owns 
      the invention unless there is an agreement, express or implied, to the contrary.  
      Whether a term transferring ownership of an invention to the client is to 
      be implied depends upon whether such a term is necessary having regard to 
      the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>(iv)            After 1989, the respondent was an independent contractor/consultant, 
      not an employee.</p>
    <p>(v)            Inventing was not within the normal scope of the respondent’s 
      duties, but prior to 1989 Techform did on one occasion assign a specific 
      project to him (and others) to invent a new product, the “Dual Motion Deck 
      Lid Hinge”.  Techform was entitled to assert that it owned this invention.</p>
    <p>(vi)            The only term that could be implied in the 1989 consultancy 
      agreement was that when Techform specifically assigned to the respondent 
      the task of inventing a product, it was entitled to claim ownership of that 
      product.</p>
    <p>(vii)            The Tailgate Hinge Mechanism having been specifically 
      assigned to the respondent fell within the implied term.  The 3D Hinge did 
      not, since its invention was not assigned to the respondent by the company.  
      Rather, it was a product of his own initiative.</p>
    <p>(viii)            The ETA is not binding on the respondent because:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>(a)            there was no consideration; and in any event</p>
        <p>(b)            it was entered into as a result of duress.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(ix)            The respondent is not estopped from denying his obligations 
      under the ETA because estoppel can only be used as a shield not a sword 
      and therefore cannot be relied upon by Techform to assert its claim of ownership.</p>
    <p>(x)            Accordingly, Techform’s claim for ownership of the Tailgate 
      Hinge Mechanism succeeds.  Its claim for ownership of the 3D Hinge fails.</p>
    <p>(xi)            The trial judge allowed the respondent’s counterclaim for 
      breach of contract and assessed damages in the amount of $5,100.  These 
      damages were awarded because Techform did not give the respondent 60 days 
      notice of termination as required by the 1989 agreement.</p>

  argues that in the result he had no obligation to perform any of the terms of

  </span></span> The consideration set out in the ETA was “continuing employment” 
  with Techform.  The trial judge noted that in <i>Francis v. Canadian Imperial 
  Bank of Commerce</i> (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 75, this court held that generally 
  a modification of a pre-existing contract will not be enforced unless there 
  is a further benefit to both parties.  Relying upon two cases, <i>Watson v. 
  Moore Corp.</i> (1996), 134 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 252 (B.C.C.A.) and <i>Kadis 
  v. Britt</i>, 29 S.E. 2d 543 (1944, N.C.S.C.), the trial judge held that continued 
  employment could not amount to consideration.  With respect to the former case 
  the trial judge said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

    <p>In paragraph 43 of that decision, Chief Justice McEachern, writing for 
      the majority, made it clear that to constitute consideration there must 
      be evidence that the employer intended to dismiss the employee <u>before</u> 
      he or she signed and returned the agreement.  It is not enough to say that 
      the employer had the right all along to give notice of termination and that 
      not having done so provided consideration for an agreement containing a 
      modification that only benefited the employer.  [Emphasis in original]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As to the <i>Kadis</i> decision from the North 
  Carolina Supreme Court, the trial judge said she agreed with the following comments 
  from that court:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a)            For the most part cases that feature employment as constituting 
      consideration will be found to deal with initial employment, i.e., “where 
      the employee is for the first time inducted into the service”.</p>
    <p>(b)            The principle has no reasonable application to a situation 
      where the contract containing the negative covenant is exacted from the 
      employee after he or she has been there for some time and where “his position 
      and duties are left unchanged, and the nature of the business remains the 
      same, and where, in the nature of things, he must already have acquired 
      such knowledge of the business as his position afforded”.</p>
    <p>(c)            “Continued Employment” must be understood to mean “further 
      <i>continuance in employment</i>”, which implies more than the threat of 
      immediate discharge.  “A consideration cannot be constituted out of something 
      that is given and taken in the same breath — of an employment which need 
      not last longer than the ink is dry upon the signature of the employee, 
      and where the performance of the promise is under the definite threat of 
      discharge” [emphasis in original].</p>

  </span></span> In my view, the trial judge erred in law in holding that there 
  was no consideration for the ETA.  In <i>Maguire v. Northland Drug Company Limited</i>, 
  [1935] S.C.R. 412 the court held that continued employment and implied forebearance 
  from dismissal for a reasonable period is adequate consideration.  In <i>Maguire</i>, 
  about eleven months after he began employment as a store manager, the defendant 
  was asked to sign a non-competition covenant in the form of a bond under seal.  
  The defendant was told that all branch managers were required to sign.  Speaking 
  for four members of the Court at pp.&nbsp;415-416, Dysart J. <i>ad hoc</i> stated 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>There was ample consideration for the bond.</span></u> Although the 
      necessity of proving consideration for the covenant is not dispensed with 
      by the presence of a seal in a case of this kind, sufficient appears from 
      the evidence adduced at the trial to establish, that <u>the employee was 
      given to understand, and did understand, that his refusal to execute the 
      covenant would lead to an early termination of his employment, and that 
      the employer tacitly promised that if the bond were signed, the employment 
      would not soon be terminated. </u>On this mutual understanding the covenant 
      was entered into, and thereafter the employer refrained indefinitely from 
      exercising its legal right to issue the notice which, at the expiration 
      of one month, would terminate the employment. <u>This continuance of employment 
      constitutes legal consideration, the adequacy of which will not be inquired 
      into by Courts</u>: <i>Gravely v. Barnard</i> (1874), L.R. 18 Eq. 518; <i>Skeans 
      v. Hampton</i> (1914), 31 O.L.R. 424.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> In his concurring opinion, Davis J. stated at p. 419 that “the 
  continuance of the appellant in the service of the respondent was in itself 
  sufficient consideration for an agreement imposing a reasonable restraint”.  
  We were not referred to any decision of the Supreme Court of Canada reversing 
  the <i>Maguire</i> decision.</p>

  </span></span> In the majority judgment in <i>Watson v. Moore Corp.</i>, McEachern 
  C.J.B.C. held that, generally, continued employment alone cannot be consideration, 
  that it must be combined with either forebearance or some other incentive.  
  He interpreted the majority judgment in <i>Maguire</i> as based on a finding 
  “without question that the employee would be terminated if he or she did not 
  sign the employment agreement in question”.  In <i>Watson</i>, after many years 
  of employment, the plaintiff was required to sign an Employment Agreement limiting 
  the amount of pay in lieu of notice upon dismissal without cause.  McEachern 
  C.J.B.C. noted that the case was therefore unlike <i>Maguire</i>, where the 
  covenant was unrelated to the right of the employer to terminate the employment.  
  As he said at pp. 259-60:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>There are difficulties with finding that continued employment alone 
      constituted consideration in this case. The plaintiff was already employed 
      and remained employed throughout the relevant period. Unless it can be said 
      that the defendant forbeared discharging her, nothing of value flowed from 
      the defendant to the plaintiff. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Even if continued employment alone could constitute consideration in 
      some circumstances, it must still be determined whether continued employment 
      constituted consideration in this case. The cases where continued employment 
      was found to be consideration all dealt with covenants unrelated to the 
      right of the employer to terminate the employee's employment: in <i>Maguire 
      </i>… it was non-competition ... </span></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>In this case, the provision in issue relates directly to the company's 
      ability to terminate the employee's employment without cause. It cannot 
      be seriously contended that continuation of the plaintiff's existing employment, 
      without more, was consideration for her agreement that she could be discharged 
      without cause with less notice or pay in lieu thereof than she was already 
      entitled to receive. </span></u></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>It follows, in my view, that consideration for the plaintiff's employment 
      contracts cannot be found just in the normal continuation of her existing 
      employment.</span></u><span>  </span>[Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would point out that this case is like <i>Maguire</i>, and 
  unlike <i>Watson</i>, in that the covenant is unrelated to the right of the 
  employer to terminate the employee’s employment.  In that context, it would 
  seem to me that this court is bound by <i>Maguire</i> if there is any distinction 
  to be drawn between the holdings in the two cases.  In my view, however, the 
  two cases of <i>Maguire</i> and <i>Watson</i> can sit together.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Watson</i>, McEachern&nbsp;C.J.B.C. said that continued 
  employment without more could not serve as consideration for an amendment to 
  the employment contract that was adverse to the employee.  That is consistent 
  with the majority judgment in <i>Maguire</i> where central to the finding of 
  consideration was not just the continued employment but the continued forbearing 
  of the employer from exercising its contractual right to dismiss on one month’s 
  notice.  It is also consistent with the principle fundamental to consideration 
  in the context of an employment contract amendment – that in return for the 
  new promise received by the employer something must pass to the employee, beyond 
  that to which the employee is entitled under the original contract.  Continued 
  employment represents nothing more of value flowing to the employee than under 
  the original contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Watson</i>, in a passage relied upon by the trial judge 
  in this case, McEachern C.J.B.C. also addressed the possibility of consideration 
  arising from the employer forbearing to dismiss the employee as the employer 
  otherwise could, under the original contract.  He found that where the employer 
  has no clear intention of dismissing the employee prior to the employee signing 
  and returning the contract amendment, the mere refraining at that point from 
  discharging the employee does not furnish consideration for the amendment.  
  This too, is consistent with <i>Maguire</i> where the promised forbearance was 
  found to be not so time limited.  Rather, the employer in <i>Maguire</i> implicitly 
  promised that if the amendment were signed the employee “would not soon be terminated”.  
  This forbearance for a reasonable period of time was what constituted the consideration 
  in that case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, this analysis is also consistent 
  with principle. Where there is no clear prior intention to terminate that the 
  employer sets aside, and no promise to refrain from discharging for any period 
  after signing the amendment, it is very difficult to see anything of value flowing 
  to the employee in return for his signature. The employer cannot, out of the 
  blue, simply present the employee with an amendment to the employment contract 
  say, “sign or you’ll be fired” and expect a binding contractual amendment to 
  result without at least an implicit promise of reasonable forbearance for some 
  period of time thereafter. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Maguire</span></i> is consistent with this 
  analysis.  There, on facts very similar to the facts in this case, the majority 
  relied on what they found to be the employer’s implicit promise to forbear for 
  a reasonable period of time from exercising its contractual right to dismiss 
  the employee on one month’s notice.  The continuation of employment on this 
  understanding constituted consideration for the employee’s signature. This reasonable 
  forbearance did pass something of value to the employee beyond that which he 
  had under the original contract.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, we are obliged to apply the same reasoning to this 
  case.  In portions of her reasons not dealing with consideration, the trial 
  judge accepted evidence from the appellant that if the respondent did not sign 
  the ETA his services would be terminated on sixty days’ notice.  In presenting 
  the ETA to the respondent in the circumstances of this case, the employer must 
  be taken to have tacitly  promised to forbear from dismissing the employee for 
  a reasonable period of time thereafter. That promise was in fact fulfilled.  
  The appellant retained the respondent’s services for a further four years and 
  terminated those services only when he breached the ETA.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, therefore, there was consideration

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Since I have found there was consideration, it is unnecessary 
  to consider the appellant’s alternative argument and decide whether consideration 
  was required in the circumstances because of reliance by Techform on the agreement.  
  I would simply note, as did Weiler J.A. in <i>Francis </i>at pp.&nbsp;84–5, 
  that there is a growing trend in Canada towards adopting the United States position 
  of “protecting promises which modify an existing duty to the extent that there 
  has been subsequent reliance on them by the person in receipt of the promise”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>  The trial judge in her discussion of estoppel, clearly found 
  that there was such reliance by Techform.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although she found there was no consideration, the trial judge 
  went on to consider whether, in any event, the ETA was unenforceable because 
  of duress.  She found that it was and the appellant recognized that to succeed 
  on this appeal, it must show that she erred.  In her reasons, the trial judge 
  referred to this court’s decision in <i>Stott v. Merit Investment Corp.</i> 
  (1988), 63 O.R. (2d) 545, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1988), 63 O.R. 
  (2d) x where it was held that not all economic pressure will constitute economic 
  duress.  As she said, “[i]t must be pressure that the law does not accept as 
  legitimate and it must be applied to such an extent that the person to whom 
  the pressure is directed has no choice but to submit”.  She also recognized 
  that in determining the legitimacy of the pressure, “one must consider the nature 
  of the pressure and the nature of the demand the pressure is applied to support”.   
  Unfortunately, although the trial judge then gave extensive attention to whether 
  the respondent was deprived of choice, she never returned to the question of 
  whether the pressure was illegitimate.  In my view, in failing to do so she 
  erred in law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In considering whether the respondent was deprived 
  of choice, the trial judge reviewed the application of the four factors from 
  <i>Pao On v. Lau Yiu</i>, [1979] 3 All E.R. 65, namely:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a)            Did the party protest at the time the contract was entered 
      into?</p>
    <p>(b)            Was there an effective alternative course open to the party 
      alleging coercion?</p>
    <p>(c)            Did the party receive independent legal advice?</p>
    <p>(d)            After entering into the contract did the party take steps 
      to avoid it?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found in favour of the respondent on all four 
  factors.  These were principally findings of fact and, while I have some misgivings 
  about the trial judge’s findings, especially in relation to the fourth factor, 
  I am not persuaded that they are unreasonable.  However, as McKinlay J.A. said 
  in <i>Gordon v. Roebuck</i> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) at 6, that does not 
  end the matter; in addition, “one must determine whether the coercion exerted 
  on the [party] was legitimate”.  Since the trial judge did not consider this 
  aspect of the case it falls to this court to do so.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Stott</i> at p. 564, Finlayson J.A. referred with approval 
  to <i>Universe Tankships Inc. of Monrovia v. Int’l Transport Workers’ Federation</i>, 
  [1982] 2 All E.R. 67 (H.L.) where it was held that in determining what is legitimate 
  two matters may have to be considered.  The first is the nature of the pressure 
  and the second is the nature of the demand that the pressure is applied to support.  
  There are a number of characteristics of this case that, in my view, require 
  a finding that the pressure was not illegitimate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the respondent was an independent contractor, not an employee.  
  Admittedly, Techform was the respondent’s only client, but it seems to me that 
  the company could have insisted on something like the ETA as a condition for 
  renewing the consultancy agreement for the following year.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, it seems apparent that the company genuinely believed 
  that it was entitled to ownership of inventions by its employees and consultants.  
  This was the position taken by Mr. Connelly with the respondent.  The trial 
  judge did not seem to disbelieve Mr.&nbsp;VandenHeuvel’s evidence that the ETA 
  was an attempt to put in place a more formal method of safeguarding the confidentiality 
  of new projects for Techform.  In fact, the trial judge found that when Techform 
  specifically assigned to the respondent the task of inventing a new product, 
  Techform was entitled to claim ownership of that product.  The trial judge found 
  that this was an implied term when the respondent was an employee and was implied 
  in the 1989 consultancy agreement.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As the trial judge noted, the law would appear to be that absent 
  an express or implied agreement to the contrary, an employee or independent 
  contractor owns inventions.  In my view, that does not mean that Techform’s 
  request or demand that the respondent execute such an agreement was illegitimate.  
  Techform was paying the respondent for his work on the various inventions.  
  While the trial judge held that Techform did not expressly assign the concept 
  of the 3D Hinge to the respondent, he was generally assigned to work on hinges.  
  In my view, Techform’s <i>bona fide</i> belief that it was the owner of the 
  inventions tells strongly in favour of finding that the pressure was not illegitimate:  
  <i>CTN Cash and Carry Ltd v. Gallaher Ltd</i>, [1994] 4 All E.R. 714 (C.A.) 
  at 718.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, in looking at the nature of the pressure, it is important 
  that the respondent was not forced to sign the ETA on the spot.  He took it 
  away with him and had ample opportunity to obtain independent advice.  Thereafter, 
  he had many years to reconsider, obtain the benefit of legal advice, seek a 
  revised agreement or repudiate the agreement.  He did not do so since as he 
  put it, “Why would I [shackle] myself”.  This lengthy passage of time tells 
  strongly against there being illegitimate pressure:  <i>Stott</i> at p. 565.</p>

  on the basis of economic duress.</span></p>

  I did not understand the respondent to argue that on this basis it did not apply 
  to him.  However, in oral submissions counsel for the respondent argued that 
  the invention of the 3D Hinge did not fall within the terms of the ETA since 
  it only covered inventions “which I conceive or make (whether alone or with 
  others) while employed by the Company”.  As I understand counsel’s argument 
  this part of the ETA should be interpreted in the same manner as the implied 
  term of the consultancy agreement.  As indicated, the trial judge had found 
  that it was an implied term that when Techform specifically assigned to the 
  respondent the task of inventing a new product, Techform was entitled to claim 
  ownership of that product.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This argument was not made before the trial judge and, in any 
  event, it cannot succeed.  The broad language of the ETA simply does not support 
  the limitation sought by the respondent.  The respondent testified that he conceived 
  of the 3D Hinge in November 1996.  At the time, he was employed as a consultant 
  to Techform and Techform was his only client.  Thereafter, he billed Techform 
  for almost 1,000 hours of work related to the 3D Hinge.  In my view, it fell 
  within the terms of the ETA.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent argued before the trial judge, as he did before 
  this court, that all of his obligations under the consultancy agreement ended 
  with its termination.  Therefore, he is not required to assign his interests 
  in any of the inventions. It is implicit in the trial judge’s order that she 
  rejected the respondent’s position.  Otherwise, she would not have made a declaration 
  that Techform was the owner of the Tailgate Hinge Mechanism.  I agree with the 
  trial judge.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, in my view, this case is covered by the 
  <i>dicta</i> in <i>Holy Rosary Parish (Thorold) Credit Union Limited v. Robitaille</i>, 
  [1965] S.C.R. 503 at 506 where it was held that “an assignment for valuable 
  consideration of property to be obtained in the future is a valid equitable 
  assignment and one which is enforceable in equity so soon as the property comes 
  into possession of the assignor”.</span></p>

  </span></span> Second, the appellant is seeking a declaration of its rights, 
  not specific performance.  Under the implied term of the consultancy agreement 
  and express terms of the ETA the respondent assigned his rights in his inventions 
  to the company.  They owned the inventions and were entitled to have the court 
  protect their rights:  <i>Tailby v. Official Receiver</i> (1888), 13 H.L. 523 
  at 547.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, this was not a case of rescission where the rescinding 
  party is entitled to treat the contract as if it were void <i>ab initio</i>.  
  Even if the proper characterization of what occurred in this case is that Techform 
  repudiated the consultancy agreement and the respondent accepted the repudiation, 
  the rights and obligations that had already matured prior to the repudiation 
  were not extinguished: <i>Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp. 
  </i>(1999), 178 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) at 40.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, there is nothing to indicate that the appellant repudiated 
  the ETA.  To the contrary, it insisted throughout that the respondent continue 
  to honour his obligations under that agreement.  In the November 7, 1997 letter 
  terminating the respondent’s employment, counsel for the appellant stated that 
  the respondent’s obligations under the ETA “survive the termination of his employment 
  with Techform”. In my view, it is open to a court to make a declaration concerning 
  those rights and obligations:  <i>Hurst v. Bryk</i>, [1997] 2 All E.R. 283 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For these reasons, the appellant is entitled to the declarations 
  sought and is not limited to damages for breach of contract.  In the circumstances 
  of this case, damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In light of my conclusion concerning the ETA 
  it is unnecessary to consider the alternative grounds of appeal put forward 
  by the appellant based upon an implied term of the consultancy agreement and 
  estoppel.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In view of the appellant’s success on the main issue, the appeal 
  must also be allowed with respect to the counterclaim for damages for breach 
  of contract.  The appellant was justified in terminating the consultancy agreement 
  because of the respondent’s wrongful refusal to assign the 3D Hinge</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and declare that the appellant 
  is the owner of all right, title and interest in the 3D Hinge, including all 
  patents and patent applications for such invention.  I would also allow the 
  appeal with respect to the counterclaim and dismiss the counterclaim.  I would 
  dismiss the cross-appeal.  The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal 
  and the cross-appeal.  In her reasons on costs, the trial judge referred to 
  an offer to settle by Mr. Wolda.  It is unclear whether there were any offers 
  to settle from the appellant prior to trial.  I would invite counsel to make 
  written submissions within fourteen days of release of the judgment concerning 
  disposition of costs of the trial in light of my disposition of the appeal.</p>

    view of my conclusion on consideration, I also need not decide what the remedy 
    would be if the court were to enforce the agreement without consideration.  
    The Ontario Law Reform Commission in its “Report on Amendment of the Law of 
    Contract” (Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney General, 1987) at 31, recommended 
    that a promise that the promisor would reasonably expect to induce forbearance 
    should be binding “if injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise”.  
    However, it also recommended that the remedy should “be limited as justice 
    requires”.  Thus, there might not be full enforcement of reliance-based promises.</p>

    indicated, the trial judge held that Techform could not found its claim for 
    ownership of the 3D Hinge on estoppel because of the maxim that estoppel can 
    never be used as a sword but only as a shield.</p>
