<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant appeals from the majority decision of the Divisional 
  Court which dismissed her application for judicial review of decisions of the 
  Human Rights Commission (“Commission”) under ss. 34(1)(a) and 37 of the <i>Human 
  Rights Code, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 <i>(“Code”)</i>.  The Commission decided 
  under s. 34(1)(a) that the appellant’s complaints of discrimination and harassment 
  under the <i>Code</i> were more appropriately dealt with as part of her grievance 
  related to her dismissal from employment with the respondent, Midas Canada Inc. 
  (“Midas”).  The grievance of the appellant’s dismissal was filed pursuant to 
  her union’s collective agreement and was dealt with through the arbitration 
  process provided by the <i>Labour Relations Act, 1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c.1, Sch. 
  A.<i> (“LRA”)</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The majority of the Divisional Court also dismissed 
  the appellant’s application for judicial review of the Commission’s decision 
  under s. 37 of the <i>Code</i> whereby the<span style='background:yellow;'> 
  </span>Commission dismissed her request to reconsider its decision not to deal 
  with her complaint.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was employed by the respondent Midas from November 
  13, 1974 until April 25, 1995 and worked variously as a machine operator, a 
  stock controller and a forklift operator in a male-dominated workplace (there 
  were 3 women out of a workforce of about 175).  Midas terminated the appellant’s 
  employment effective April 26, 1995, following a workplace incident where the 
  appellant was alleged to have verbally harassed and threatened a co-worker, 
  Basil Brown, who was also a union steward.  There had been long-standing bad 
  feelings between the appellant and Brown and she had made many complaints to 
  her employer and to her union that he was harassing her, although the complaints 
  did not originally allege harassment of a sexual nature.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was a member of the United Steelworkers of America 
  (“USWA”) which had a collective agreement with Midas.  The collective agreement 
  contained a provision, Article III, that incorporated the terms of the <i>Human 
  Rights Code</i> and that gave bargaining unit members the right to file grievances 
  related to alleged breaches of the <i>Code</i>.  Before filing her complaint 
  to the Commission, the appellant had filed various grievances pursuant to the 
  collective agreement.  Only her grievance with respect to her termination with 
  Midas proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Prior to the arbitration hearing in 1995, the appellant had complained 
  in late 1994 that the union was not properly representing her interests.  She 
  complained specifically that her co-worker, Basil Brown, who was a union steward, 
  was in a conflict of interest.  Michael Lewis, the Ontario Staff Representative 
  of the appellant’s union (USWA) in charge of human rights and women’s issues, 
  investigated the appellant’s complaints and concluded that the appellant had 
  been harassed, but not sexually.  Lewis also concluded that the appellant’s 
  workplace was not a comfortable, friendly environment for women and that Midas 
  was not willing to put on workplace training and education.  He said the appellant 
  was not easy to get along with, was “blunt and spunky” and that there were very 
  bad feelings between the appellant and Basil Brown.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following a five-day arbitration hearing which commenced on June 
  19, 1995, the arbitrator dismissed the termination grievance, concluding that 
  Midas had just cause for dismissal.  The decision of the arbitrator, which was 
  released on November 17, 1995,  made very brief references to the appellant’s 
  complaints of harassment and discrimination, including a reference to the fact 
  that the appellant had filed a complaint against her employer to the Human Rights 
  Commission.  He also referred to the report of Michael Lewis to the effect that 
  there was no evidence of any sexual or racial harassment by Brown.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On June 21, 1995, after the arbitration hearing 
  had begun, the appellant filed a complaint with the Commission against Midas 
  claiming that she was denied the right to equal treatment in employment because 
  of her sex and that she was the victim of harassment because of sex, contrary 
  to ss. 5(1) and 9 of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A Case Analysis dated January 8, 1996 and prepared by an officer 
  of the Commission states that “the evidence indicates that the provisions of 
  the <i>LRA</i> could appropriately deal with the issues raised in the complaint.”  
  The Case Analysis also stated that the appellant had filed two grievances in 
  1993 with respect to harassment and discrimination, which were later withdrawn.  
  This analysis formed the basis for the Commission’s decision not to deal with 
  the appellant’s complaint under s. 34(1)(a).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In a letter to the Commission dated March 1, 1996, the appellant 
  indicated that the grievances referred to in the Case Analysis did not relate 
  to harassment and discrimination.  She maintained that her grievances against 
  Midas and Brown concerning harassment and discrimination had not been dealt 
  with by arbitration under the provisions of the <i>LRA</i>.  She also noted 
  that she was not currently a union member or employee because she had been terminated.  
  She stated that while she would have liked her complaints to have been dealt 
  with through the grievance procedure, they had not been and the only route left 
  was the Commission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On July 4, 1996, the Commission gave its decision under s. 34(1) 
  of the <i>Code</i> to not deal with the complaint on the basis that it could 
  more appropriately be dealt with under the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> and 
  the collective agreement.  The appellant then applied for a reconsideration 
  of the Commission’s decision pursuant to s. 37 of the <i>Code</i>.  She was 
  now represented by legal counsel and her materials filed in support of the reconsideration 
  gave a much more lengthy account of incidents of harassment and discrimination 
  at Midas than did her original complaint.  She also included a copy of the arbitrator’s 
  decision, her grievance reports and Lewis’s report.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Reconsideration Report of the Ontario Human 
  Rights Commission contains the following statement:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The authority to change the original decision does not arise simply because 
      an application for reconsideration has been filed. … It [the application] 
      must set out material facts; i.e. facts which are relevant to the issue 
      <i>and which are in addition to </i>the facts upon which the original decision 
      was based.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In its reconsideration decision dated December 12, 1996, the 
  Commission upheld its original decision not to deal with the complaint, again 
  maintaining that the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> could more appropriately deal 
  with the issues raised in the complaint.  The Commission stated that “it is 
  the Act and <i>not its application in a particular case</i> which the Commission 
  looked to in making its original decision.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant then filed an application for judicial review of 
  the Commission’s decisions.  This application was withdrawn, however, when counsel 
  for the Commission advised that the Commission had decided to reverse its December 
  12, 1996 decision in the light of an incomplete record.  In a decision dated 
  December 8, 1997, the Commission gave the following reasons for reversing its 
  decision not to deal with the complaint:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>1.</span> <span>  </span>The application for reconsideration raises, 
      among others, the material fact that the arbitrator of the proceeding initiated 
      by the complainant under the <i>LRA</i> did not address whether the complainant 
      has been sexually harassed or discriminated against on the basis of sex, 
      contrary to the <i>Code</i>.</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>2.</span> <span>   </span>While the Commission is aware that the courts 
      have set out the limited circumstances within which it may reconsider a 
      previous decision, it considers that the material facts set out above properly 
      raise the issue of the integrity of the Commission’s process.</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>3.</span> <span>   </span>The Commission considers that, in the particular 
      circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the <i>LRA</i> could 
      “more appropriately” deal with the issues of discrimination because of sex 
      raised in the complaint, when the arbitrator failed to address those very 
      issues in this decision.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Commission remitted the complaint for mediation and investigation.  
  On April 24, 1998 the appellant filed an amended and much more detailed complaint 
  relating to incidents going back to 1974.  However, in February 1999, the Commission 
  reversed itself once again and stated that the December 12, 1996 decision should 
  not have been declared a nullity and reaffirmed its earlier decision not to 
  deal with the appellant’s complaint.  The appellant again launched an application 
  for judicial review of the Commission’s decisions under ss. 34 and 37.</p>

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>MAJORITY DECISION OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The majority of the Divisional Court held that the standard of 
  review with respect to decisions under ss. 34(1) and 37 of the <i>Code </i>is 
  patent unreasonableness.  Writing for the majority, O’Driscoll J. concluded 
  that the appellant’s complaint was a recycling of her grievance of termination.  
  He stated in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>In my view, it cannot be said that the OHRC’s 
      s. 34 decision of July 4, 1996 was patently unreasonable.  Nor can it be 
      said that the OHRC’s s. 37 decision of December 12, 1996 was patently unreasonable.  
      Indeed, I would go further and say that the two impugned decisions of the 
      OHRC prevented the continuance of an abuse of process.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>The OHRC is not a forum to be used for recycled 
      wrongful dismissal claims that have been disallowed in another forum.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>Under the provisions of s. 2(1) of the <i>Judicial 
      Review Procedure Act</i> … judicial  review is a discretionary remedy.  
      In this case, the OHRC has made one s. 34 decision and two decisions under 
      s. 37, the second admittedly without jurisdiction.  Having regard to the 
      passage of time, the fact that the Applicant had her five days “in court” 
      before the Arbitrator in 1995, it would not be in the interests of justice 
      to breathe life into these proceedings and further prolong them.  For that 
      reason alone, I would refuse a discretionary order of judicial review.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In her dissent, Aitken J. determined that it 
  was not necessary for her to resolve the issue of which standard of review was 
  appropriate as she considered both the s. 34(1)(a) decision and the s. 37 decision 
  patently unreasonable.</span></p>

  </span></span> Aitkin J. concluded that the Commission’s decision under s. 34(1)(a) 
  could not stand because it relied on the <i>mere</i> existence of ss. 48(1) 
  and (12) of the <i>LRA</i> and Article III of the collective agreement to conclude 
  that the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> could appropriately deal with the issues 
  raised in the complaint.  Furthermore, Aitken J. concluded that the Commission 
  failed to consider all the relevant facts of the complainant’s case before it 
  concluded whether s. 34(1)(a) applied.  She also decided that the Commission’s 
  decision ignored the words “more appropriately” in s. 34(1)(a) and it failed 
  to categorize the true nature of the complaint before considering which forum 
  was more appropriate. </p>

  </span></span> In relation to the Commission’s reconsideration decision, Aitken 
  J. concluded that the Commission applied an overly narrow view of its jurisdiction.  
  She held that the Commission erred when it required new facts before it would 
  reverse a s. 34 decision since the Commission has an unfettered power under 
  s. 37 to reverse such a decision.  (See: <i>Commercial Union Assurance et al 
  v. OHRC, </i>discussed <i>infra</i>).</p>

  </span></span> In conclusion, Aitken J. stated:  [t]he “Commission failed to 
  consider that at the heart of it, the complaint was a human rights complaint…” 
  and that the appellant’s complaints “…regarding gender-based harassment and 
  discrimination were in substance not labour relations issues capable of being 
  adequately addressed through the mechanism of the collective agreement.”</p>

  </span></span> The majority of the Divisional Court, relying on a long line 
  of previous decisions in that Court, held that the standard of review of a decision 
  of the Commission under s. 34(1)(a) is patently unreasonable.  The dissenting 
  Justice did not disagree with this conclusion.  I am inclined to agree with 
  the majority of the Divisional Court on this preliminary issue. </p>

lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the Commission’s 
  decision under s. 34(1)(a) was patently unreasonable. The Commission’s decision, 
  dated July 4, 1996, makes no reference to the appellant’s letter of March 1, 
  1996 which stated that her harassment and discrimination complaints had not 
  been dealt with in the arbitration of her termination grievance.  The reasons 
  given by the Commission include the following statements:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>1.         The evidence indicates that the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> 
      and the affiliated collective Agreement could more appropriately deal with 
      the issues raised in the complaints.</p>
    <p>2.         The evidence also indicates that the complainant has availed 
      herself of the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> and the collective agreement 
      in question.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>For the above reasons, the Commission considers that this complaint 
      could more appropriately be dealt with under the provisions of another Act 
      and thus falls within the provisions of section 34(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, these reasons are simply unsupportable.  The decision 
  of the arbitrator under the <i>LRA</i> had been given before the decision of 
  the Commission.  A review of the decision of the arbitrator reveals that he 
  did not deal with the complaints of harassment and discrimination by the appellant 
  in any significant fashion;  he merely acknowledged that the appellant had made 
  such complaints to various parties, including to the Commission.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>In its reconsideration decision of December 12, 
  1996 under s. 37 of the <i>Code</i>, the Commission upheld its original decision 
  under s. 34(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i> not to deal with the complaint, stating 
  in part that “<i>it is the Act and not its application</i> in a particular case 
  which the Commission looked to in making its original decision.”  These reasons 
  confirm that in its s. 34(1)(a) decision, the Commission failed to take into 
  account the statutorily-prescribed consideration of whether the appellant’s 
  particular complaint could or should be more appropriately dealt with under 
  the <i>LRA</i>.  I agree with the appellant’s submission that it is not enough 
  that the grievance process simply be available.  Section 34(1)(a) requires that 
  the grievance arbitration <i>be more appropriate</i> to deal with the particular 
  complaint than the process under the <i>Code</i>.  The issue of appropriateness 
  can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.  The Commission’s decision to 
  treat the mere existence of the <i>LRA</i> as determinative of the issue whether 
  to exercise its discretion to not deal with the complaint under s. 34(1)(a), 
  was patently unreasonable. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While it is important that the Commission have the discretion 
  to determine that another forum is more appropriate, including a labour arbitration, 
  in the circumstances of this case the Commission’s decision cannot stand.  No 
  allegation of sexual harassment was made before the Arbitrator.  Rather, the 
  complainant alleged in her grievance that the steward of the trade union harassed 
  her in an inappropriate, but not a discriminatory way.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While it is true that s. 48(12) of the <i>LRA</i> permits an 
  arbitrator to apply human rights statutes, by the time the Commission made its 
  decision not to investigate in this case, the arbitrator had already concluded 
  his hearing and no issue of discrimination had been squarely before him.   The 
  Commission therefore made its decision knowing that the complainant did not, 
  and could not, have raised the issue of discrimination before the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Turning to the Commission’s decision under s. 37 of the <i>Code</i>, 
  in my view the Commission misunderstood the scope of its reconsideration power.  
  As stated in <i>Re Commercial Union Assurance et al and Ontario Human Rights 
  Commission et al</i> (1988), 47 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 477, this court at p. 
  479 rejected the proposition that the power of reconsideration by the Commission 
  requires new facts:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>We do not agree with counsel for the appellants 
      that the broad power of reconsideration which results in a final decision 
      requires that new facts be established:  <i>see Re Merrens and Municipality 
      of Metropolitan Toronto, </i>[1973] 2 O.R. 265, 33 D.L.R. (3d) 513 (Div. 
      Ct.).  The power is important and may be the only way to correct errors 
      where no right of appeal is provided, or to allow for adjustments even if 
      circumstances remain unchanged.  That is the meaning to be given to the 
      maintenance of the integrity of the administrative process.</p>
