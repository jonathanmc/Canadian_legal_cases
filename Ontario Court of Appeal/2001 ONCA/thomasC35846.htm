  </span> The Crown sought a sentence of two years less a day but the trial judge 
  imposed a sentence of three years on top of three months pre-trial custody.  
  Although it would have been preferable had the trial judge referred in his reasons 
  to the Crown’s position, even giving that position serious consideration, we 
  are not persuaded that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This court’s decision in <i>Bates</i> emphasizes the need to denounce 
  and deter criminal harassment in the strongest terms.  Applying the principles 
  in <i>Bates</i> to this case, in our view, the many aggravating circumstances 
  outlined by the Crown justified a significant sentence.  This appellant has 
  a lengthy criminal record.  He has been convicted of assaulting the victim twice 
  before.  He has shown no regard for court orders in the past and, indeed, was 
  on three probation orders at the time he committed this offence.  The victim’s 
  fear of the appellant has led her to change both her job and her residence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the light of these considerations the sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge was not unfit though it was at the upper end of the range.  The Crown 
  concedes that the trial judge’s parole ineligibility order cannot stand because 
  counsel were given no opportunity to address it and no reasons were given for 
  why it was required. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the parole ineligibility order 
  is deleted.  Otherwise the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
