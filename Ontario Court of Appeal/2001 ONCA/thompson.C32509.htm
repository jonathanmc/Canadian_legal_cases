</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>P.C. Shields on November 18, 1997 was operating a Mobile RIDE
Spotcheck in a fully marked police cruiser on northbound Arrow Road near Finch
Avenue in Metropolitan Toronto when she spotted the appellants vehicle
proceeding northbound directly ahead of her. 
His vehicle was hugging the white dotted line in between the
lanes.  She activated the cruisers
emergency lights and directed the appellant to pull over to the side of the
road.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]   <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>P. C. Shields engaged the appellant in a conversation concerning his
licence and registration.  She asked him
if he had consumed any alcohol earlier that evening.   He responded that he had consumed one or two beers.  She noted that there was an odour of
alcoholic beverage on his breath and that his eyes were red and bloodshot.  In light of her observations and his
response, she made a s.254(2) roadside breath sample demand.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]   <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant made three apparent attempts to blow into the roadside
screening device.  On the first
occasion, P.C. Shields did not hear the tone that the device was supposed to
make nor could she hear any air passing through the mouthpiece.  On the second and third occasion, air did
enter the machine but, according to the code that came up on the screen in the
device, without sufficient pressure to activate the device.  She then arrested the appellant for failure
to provide a proper sample.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The particular issue which is raised under this ground of appeal is
that the trial judge erred in finding that P.C. Shields had checked for obstructions
in the mouthpiece before the appellants apparent attempts to blow into
it.  Her evidence was that, although she
had no specific memory of doing so, she did check for obstructions because this
was her standard practice.</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Counsel for the accused argues that one of the necessary elements of
the charge is that the machine be in good working order, free from obstruction
and that the Crown has failed to satisfy that beyond a reasonable doubt.  He points out that the police officer could
not be sure  in fact had no memory at all of having done that but was relying
on her ordinary practice.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>My view of her evidence is that matters transpired as she related them,
that she simply followed her usual practice in connection with unwrapping and
certification of the mouthpieces and that there was no need to make a note to
that effect.  Notes are only made to
assist the recollection.  I find that on
this occasion she did not depart from her usual practice, indeed there is
nothing to suggest otherwise.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence.  If he accepted P.C. Shields evidence that
it was her standard practice to check the mouthpiece and that she must have
done so on the occasion in question, it was reasonably open to him to find, as
he did, that she had checked it on the occasion in question.  I would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</span></p>

at (1988 ), 10 M.V.R. (2d) 63 (Ont. Dist. Ct.) setting aside an acquittal on a
charge of refusing to provide a breath sample and entering a conviction.  The reasons of this court on the s.254(5)

foreclosed by the judgment in <i>R. v. Seo</i>
(1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 293, 38 M.V.R. 161, 51 C.R. (3d) 1, 27 D.L.R. (4th) 296,

think the criminalization of refusal is a reasonable limit under s. 1 of <i>the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>,

submit that there has been no change in the law that casts doubt on the
correctness of <i>Bhagwandat</i>.  I accept that if there has been a change in

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It was not until after <i>Bhagwandat
</i>and the decisions referred to in it that the Supreme Court of Canada
recognized, for the first time, that the scope of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> includes a general right against
self-incrimination: <i>R. v. Hebert</i>

between the right to silence protected by s. 7 and the right to counsel

there is a more profound infringement than existed at the time of <i>Bhagwandat </i>that can no longer be
justified under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He concedes that it could be justified if s.
254(5) were replaced by a provision that would make the failing or refusing to
comply with a s. 254(2) demand a basis for making a s. 254(3) breathalyzer
demand.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judges succinct reasons on these issues
are as follows:</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:67.7pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect to section 10(b), I am bound by the decision of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>R. v.
Bhagwandat</i> (1989), 22 M.V.R. 329, the effect of which I do not consider to
have in any way been diluted by anything said by the same court in <i>R. v. Milne</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 118,
or in its recent unreported decision in <i>R.
v. Coutts</i> [1997] O.J. 2013.  There
are no reported decisions which consider whether subsection 5 is in violation
of an accuseds right to silence under section 7, since that right was
determined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990) 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1, to be a free standing
component principle of the rights enumerated in section 7.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:67.7pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I am however greatly assisted by the Supreme Court of Canada decision
in <i>R. v. Higgins</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C.
(3d) 57, which dealt with fingerprinting and that of Hill J., of this court in <i>R. v. F. (S) and A.G. For  Canada et al</i> 120 C.C.C. (3d) 260 which
dealt with DNA evidence.  In both cases
the police action was found to be such an unobtrusive infringement of section 7
requirements as to fall squarely within the exception set out in the section,
namely; except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  In both cases the police action was
authorized by statute; so it was here. 
In the result, as it is here, there is no Charter violation under either
section.  The application should
therefore be dismissed.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>R. v. Hebert, supra,</i> McLachlin J. for
the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada recognized a pre-trial
constitutionally protected right to remain silent within the principles of
fundamental justice in s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  This right has been elaborated upon in
subsequent decisions which I shall consider later in these reasons.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The scheme under the Charter to protect the accuseds pretrial right to
silence may be described as follows. 
Section 7 confers on the detained person the right to choose whether to
speak to the authorities or to remain silent. 
Section 10 (b) requires that he be advised of his right to consult
counsel and permitted to do so without delay.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The most important function of legal advice upon detention is to ensure
that the accused understands his rights, chief among which is his right to
silence.  The detained suspect,
potentially at a disadvantage in relation to the informed and sophisticated
powers at the disposal of the state, is entitled to rectify the disadvantage by
speaking to legal counsel at the outset, so that he is aware of his right not
to speak to the police and obtains appropriate advice with respect to the
choice he faces.  Read together, ss. 7
and 10(b) confirm the right to silence in s. 7 and shed light on its nature.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Turning to s.
10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, the appellant
relies upon <i>R. v. Bartle, supra</i>, for
the proposition that a person who is detained within the meaning of s. 10 is
in immediate need of legal advice in order to protect his or her right
against self-incrimination (p. 300) and for its repetition of the important
link between the right to remain silent under s. 7 and the right to counsel
under s. 10(b).</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:left;

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In<i> R. v. Milne, supra</i>, this
court held that there was nothing constitutionally impermissible in compelling
detained motorists to participate in a roadside sobriety test under s. 48 of
the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> without first
according them the opportunity to exercise their s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights  so long as the evidence was not used to prove the
Crowns case against the accused motorist at trial.  The appellant relies upon the following passage in the reasons of
Moldaver J.A. for the court at pages 130 and 131:</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The fact that the evidence provided by the roadside A.L.E.R.T. device
cannot be introduced against the motorist is, in  my opinion, a critical factor in the s. 1 analysis.  But for this limitation, I doubt that
roadside A.L.E.R.T. testing would have passed any of the three branches of the
proportionality test provided by <i>Oakes,
supra</i>.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Accordingly, I have no trouble finding proportionality in so far as the
liberty interest component of s. 10(b) is concerned.  However, the same cannot be said about the risk of
incrimination component if, in fact, the motorist can be compelled to create
self-incriminating evidence that can later be used at trial.  If roadside test results could be used in
this manner, this would overshoot their limited objective.  That objective, it will be recalled, is to
provide the police with the tools needed to remove impaired drivers from the highway
immediately and thereby avoid the calamitous results likely to occur if they
are allowed to proceed.  The objective
is not to convict impaired drivers at any cost.  If it were, there would be no reason for insisting that the
motorist be given his or her Charter rights when the investigation moves to the
arrest stage for impaired driving or to a request for a breathalyzer demand
pursuant to s. 254 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  And yet, the law is clear that, at this
juncture, the motorist is entitled to full protection of the rights accorded by
the Charter<i>: R. v. Therens</i> (1985), 18
C.C.C. (3d) 481, 18 D.L.R. (4th) 655, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613.  That protection, I suggest, would be hollow
indeed if the state could simply turn around and use the results of the
roadside A.L.E.R.T. test to convict the motorist of over 80, or, as in this
case, use the inability of the appellant to adequately perform the physical
co-ordination tests to convict the appellant of impaired driving.</span></p>

was reiterated by Moldaver J.A. in <i>R. v.

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[19]   <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant
submits that the decisions in <i>Milne and
Coutts</i> make clear that the authorities relied upon by this court in <i>Bhagwandat </i>do<i> not </i>stand for the proposition that denying a detained motorist of
his or her s. 10(b) right can be justified for any and all evidence-gathering
purposes.  He accordingly submits that,
in addition to the significant changes to the scope of ss. 7 and 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights reflected in <i>Hebert</i> and <i>Bartle</i>, this courts decisions in <i>Milne</i> and <i>Coutts</i> require
that <i>Bhagwandat</i> be reconsidered. </span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[20]   <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The responses of
the respondent and the intervenor to the appellants submissions on s. 7 of the
<i>Charter</i> are as follows.  First, the penalization of a refusal to
comply with a demand for roadside breath sample, by s. 254(5) of the <i>Code</i>, does not give rise to a
prosecution based on compelled self-incriminatory evidence because the state
does not compel the motorist to refuse to comply.  In the context of a charge under s. 254(5), the evidence of the
refusal is not evidence that the state attempted to compel from the individual.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect to
s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, they submit
that because the roadside breath sample demand does not infringe the right
against self-incrimination there is no infringement of s. 10(b) beyond what the
Supreme Court of Canada found in <i>R. v.
Thomsen</i> (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 411.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[24]   <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my respectful
view, although there is internal logic in the submission that the demand for
roadside breath sample does not give rise to a prosecution based on compelled
self-incriminatory evidence because the state does not compel the motorist to
refuse to comply, I do not think that this is responsive to the appellants
submission.  His submission is that the
criminalization of a refusal by s. 254(5) is, in itself, an infringement of the
right against self-incrimination and the right to counsel.  The appellant does not challenge the demand
part of the statutory scheme (s. 254(2)) but submits that the penalization part
of it (s. 254(5)) is unconstitutional and not justifiable under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He submits that s. 254(5) would be justifiable if it provided
that the legal consequence of failure or refusal to comply with a s. 254(2)
demand were that the motorist be required to submit a s. 254(3) (breathalyzer)
demand.  Put differently, I do not
understand the appellant to be challenging his conviction because it is based
on compelled self-incriminatory evidence but, rather, because the
offence-creation provision, s. 254(5), is an unjustifiable part of a scheme
that does infringe on the appellants s. 7 and 10 (b) <i>Charter</i> rights.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>At the outset, I
think that it would be helpful to review, briefly, what was decided by the
Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Thomsen,
supra</i>, which was the major underpinning of <i>Bhagwandat</i>.  The charge in
that case was the same as that in <i>Bhagwandat</i>
and in this one  refusing to comply with a roadside breath demand.  The two questions raised on the appeal in <i>Thomsen</i> were (1) whether the roadside
breath demand resulted in a detention within the meaning of s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and (2) if so, whether the right
to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right
was subject, in the case of a roadside breath test demand, to a reasonable
limitation under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:left;

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On the subject of detention under s. 10 of the <i>Charter</i> Le Dain J. said for the court at p. 418:</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my opinion, the s. 234.1(1) demand [now s. 254(2), in altered form]
by the police officer to the appellant to accompany him to his car and to
provide a sample of breath into a roadside screening device fell within the
above criteria [set out in <i>R. v. Therens</i>
(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.)]. The demand by which the officer assumed
control over the movement of the appellant was one which might have significant
legal consequence because, although the evidence provided by the roadside
screening device could not be introduced against the appellant, it might
provide the basis for a s. 235(1) breathalyzer demand.  For this reason, and given the criminal
liability under s. 234.1(2) [now s. 254(5) in altered form] for refusal,
without reasonable excuse, to comply with the demand, the situation was one in
which a person might reasonably require the assistance of counsel.  The criminal liability for refusal also
constituted the necessary compulsion or coercion to make the restraint of
liberty a detention.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Le Dain J.s
recognition of the potential legal consequence flowing from the demand and
the resulting significance of the role of counsel were an important functional
consideration in his determination that there was a detention in the
situation before the court.  In
reviewing the history of the case Le Dain J. noted at p. 415 that the trial
judge, in acquitting the appellant, had held that counsel might have advised
the appellant to comply with the demand.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I would also note
that in <i>Thomsen</i> the constitutionality
of s. 234.1 of the <i>Code</i> was an
issue.  This included both subsection
(1), the demand provision (now, in altered form, s. 254(2)) and subsection (2),
the offence-creation provision (now, s. 254(5)). Since these provisions are
essential parts of one legislative scheme, it is difficult to see how the
constitutionality of subsection (1) could be considered apart from that of
subsection (2).</span></p>

of the <i>Code</i> and the necessary
relationship to it of roadside breath testing under circumstances which do not
permit an opportunity for contact with counsel are disclosed by the s.1
material that was placed before the court by the respondent in the appeal in <i>R. v. Hufsky, ante,</i> p. 398 [of 40 C.C.C.

Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Seo</i> [<i>R. v. Seo</i> (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 385],
although apparently grouped together somewhat differently in the first seven volumes.  The material, consisting of statistics,
reports, studies, articles, Canadian legislative history and foreign

increase the detection of impaired driving, but to increase the perceived risk
of its detection, which is essential to its effective deterrence.  In my opinion the importance of this role
makes the necessary limitation on the right to retain and instruct counsel at
the roadside testing stage a reasonable one that is demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society, having regard to the fact that the right to
counsel will be available, if necessary, at the more serious breathalyzer
stage.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I shall at this
point address the appellants case based on s. 7.  If a motorist were to fail the roadside screen test he or she
would be obliged to submit to a breathalyzer test, the result of which could be
the basis of a conviction for impaired driving or driving over 80 and a
sentence of imprisonment.  The threat of
imprisonment engages s. 7: <i>Reference re:
s. 94(2) of the</i> <i>Motor Vehicle Act</i>
(1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). 
There would, however, be no ultimate infringement of s. 7 if the
deprivation of liberty were in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.  As mentioned earlier, <i>R. v. Hebert</i> held that the right to
remain silent is a principle of fundamental justice.  A deprivation of liberty resulting from an infringement of this
right would not be in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The right to
remain silent has evolved in subsequent cases into a general principle against
self-incrimination.  With respect to this
development, I think it is sufficient to refer to what Iacobucci J. said for
the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. White</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 274-75:</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is now well-established that there exists, in Canadian law, a
principle against self-incrimination that is a principle of fundamental justice
under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The meaning of the principle, its underlying
rationale, and its current status within Canadian law have been discussed in a
series of decisions of this Court, notably <i>Thomson
Newspapers, supra</i>; <i>R. v. Hebert</i>,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1; <i>R.

principle against self-incrimination was defined as an assertion of the

principle against self-incrimination.

consent.</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:67.5pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The definition of the principle against self-incrimination as an
assertion of human freedom is intimately connected to the principles
underlying rationale.  As explained by
the Chief Justice in <i>Jones, supra</i>, at
pp. 250-51, the principle has at least two key purposes, namely to protect
against unreliable confessions, and to protect against abuses of power by the
state.  There is both an individual and
a societal interest in achieving both of these protections.  Both protections are linked to the value
placed by Canadian society upon individual privacy, personal autonomy and
dignity: see, e.g., <i>Thomson Newspapers,
supra</i>, at p. 480, per Wilson J.; <i>Jones,
supra</i>, at pp. 250-51, per Lamer C.J., and <i>Fitzpatrick, supra</i>, at paras. 51-52, per La Forest J.  A state which arbitrarily intrudes upon its
citizens personal sphere will inevitably cause more injustice than it cures.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Following this, at pages 275-77, Iacobucci J. stressed the importance
of context in determining the applicability of the principle in a given case:</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>That the principle against self-incrimination does have the status as
an overarching principle does not imply that the principle provides absolute
protection for an accused against all uses of information that has been
compelled by statute or otherwise.  The
residual protections provided by the principle against self-incrimination as
contained in s. 7 are specific, and contextually sensitive.The principle
against self-incrimination demands different things at different times, with
the task in every case being to determine exactly what the principle demands,
if anything, within the particular context at issue.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;

that lends significance to a given factual context in determining whether the
principle against self-incrimination has been violated.  In some contexts, the factors that favour
the importance of the search for truth will outweigh the factors that favour
protecting the individual against undue compulsion by the state.In every case,
the facts must be closely examined to determine whether the principle against
self-incrimination has truly been brought into play by the production or use of

that the principles of fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7 protect more than
the rights of the accused.  As McLachlin
J. wrote in <i>Seaboyer, supra</i>, at p.
603:</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;'>The principles of
fundamental justice reflect a spectrum of interests, from the rights of the
accused to broader societal concerns  The ultimate question is whether the
legislation, viewed in a purposive way, conforms to the fundamental precepts
which underlie our system of justice.</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>One of the implications of this analysis is that while the right to
make full answer and defence and the principle against self-incrimination are
certainly core principles of fundamental justice, they can be respected without
the accused being entitled to the most favourable procedures that could
possibly be imagined (<i>R. v. Lyons</i>,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309 at p. 362, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 44 D.L.R. (4th) 193; cited in <i>Mills, supra</i>, at para. 72).  Nor is the accused entitled to have
procedures crafted that take only his interests into account.  Still less is he entitled to procedures that
would distort the truth-seeking function of a trial by permitting irrelevant
and prejudicial material at trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It may be asked
whether self-incrimination is involved in this case.  Does the use of the s. 254(2) test result involve
self-incrimination?  It is clear that
the results of a failed test cannot be admitted at a trial of the
motorist.  The motorist cannot be convicted
based on these results.  The results,
however, can lead to evidence (that provided on a breathalyzer test) upon which
the motorist could be convicted.  This
potential effect is sufficient, in my view, to require that ss. 254(2) and (5)
be subjected to an analysis to determine whether the principle against
self-incrimination has truly been brought into play (<i>R. v. White</i> at p. 277) by the use of the roadside screening test
result.  The inadmissibility of the
results at a trial is a factor to be taken into account in this analysis.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is important to recognize that the basic purpose of s. 254(2) is
more preventive than it is prosecutorial. 
The importance of the search for truth (<i>R. v. White</i> at p. 277), which is to be weighed in the balance, does
not relate primarily to the conviction of the motorist but, rather, in the case
of a failed result, to getting the motorist then and there off the road.  The point is clearly made in<i> R. v. Smith</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 58
(Ont. C.A.), a case concerned with the validity of police questions to
motorists detained by police officers under s. 48 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> to justify making a demand under s. 254 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  At p. 81 Doherty J.A. said:</span></p>

consideration the activity in which the appellant was engaged and the nature of
the police function in issue.  Driving
is a heavily regulated activity.  <i>The police are engaged, not so much in
after-the-fact investigations of completed crimes, but in pre-emptive
investigations intended to avoid the serious harm caused by those who are
involved in dangerous ongoing criminal conduct.  The polices goal is to catch the drinking driver at the roadside
and not at the scene of the accident</i>. 
Drivers expect to be stopped and questioned by the police concerning
matters relating to the operation of their vehicles.  That expectation is part and parcel of the privilege of operating
a motor vehicle.</span></p>

licensed and controlled for the protection of society.  Section 234.1 of the <i>Code</i> strikes a very reasonable balance between the rights of an
individual and those of society.  Where
the circumstances are such that a roadside test is required it must be taken
speedily or the very purpose of the section is frustrated.  If the individual passes the test then the
inconvenience is minimal, the delay no more than that caused a driver by heavy
traffic or a red traffic signal.</span></p>

for clarification has been made runs no risk of being found guilty of any
offence by submitting to the [roadside] test. 
If he passes the test he is free to go on his way; if the fails it then,
of course, there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he may be
guilty of an offence, and, in that event, a peace officer may make a further
demand of him, namely, that he submit to a more definitive test by means of a
breathalyzer machine.  And at that stage
he has a right to consult a lawyer: <i>R. v.

implicate the principle against self-incrimination (<i>R. v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at pp. 350,
353, 355, and 357-58), it is not as serious an intrusion as a coerced
interrogation.  In <i>R. v. F.(S.)</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.)
(holding of constitutionality upheld (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.))

self-incrimination principle is implicated in testimonial compulsion and in the
conscriptive coercion to provide a biological sample for testing, there surely
persists a continuum in respect of our threshold for compulsion by the state in
criminal investigations.  Testimonial
compulsion attacks free speech and the right to remain silent.  Our traditions have a long history of
abhorrence for coerced interrogation and the systemic extraction of
self-incriminatory information prior to trial. 
Biological specimens, pre-existing seizure by the state, do not raise
the same degree of concern as conscriptive probing of the mind and the use of
the individual as a testimonial resource. The mind is the individuals most

without consent or statutory authority take or require an accused to provide
parts of their body or bodily substances in order to incriminate
themselves.  The recognition of the
right to bodily integrity and sanctity is embodied in s.7 of the <i>Charter</i> which confirms the right to
life, liberty and the security of the person and guarantees the equally
important reciprocal right not to be deprived of security of the person except
in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  This right requires that any interference
with or intrusion upon the human body can only be undertaken in accordance with
principles of fundamental justice. 
Generally that will require valid statutory authority or the consent of
the individual to the particular bodily intrusion or interference required for
the purpose of the particular procedure the police wish to undertake.  It follows that the compelled use of the
body or the compelled provision of bodily substances in breach of a Charter
right for purposes of self-incrimination will generally result in an unfair trial
just as surely as the compelled or conscripted self-incriminating statement.</span></p>

particular procedure may be so unintrusive and so routinely performed that it
is accepted without question by society. 
Such procedures may come under the rare exception for merely technical
or minimal violations referred to earlier. 
For example, assuming that finger-printing is conscriptive, it is
minimally intrusive and has been recognized by statute and practice for such an
extended period of time that this Court readily found that it was acceptable in
Canadian society.  See the carefully
crafted reasons of La Forest J. in <i>Beare,

are both minimally intrusive and essential to control the tragic chaos caused
by drinking and driving.</i></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I shall now
briefly refer to two decisions relied upon by the trial judge for his
conclusion that there was no infringement of s. 7.  In <i>R. v. Beare</i> (1988),
45 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (S.C.C.) (referred to in the trial judges reasons as <i>R. v. Higgins</i>) the Supreme Court upheld
the validity of the finger-printing provisions in the <i>Identification of Criminals Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. I  1 and the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This decision is of limited assistance because it was decided before
<i>Hebert</i> and the recognition of the
right to silence as a principle of fundamental justice.  Further, while it held that the legislation
was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, the basic s. 7
right with which it was concerned was that of security of the person in the
immediate loss of liberty associated with finger-printing.  Although the court observed at p. 67 that
one of the several purposes of taking finger-prints was linking the accused to
the crime where latent prints are found at the scene or on physical evidence
it did not discuss matters relating to the self-incrimination aspect.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[43]   <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The other
decision upon which the trial judge relied was that of Hill J. in <i>R. v. F.(S.), supra</i>.  At pp. 303-310 Hill J. gave reasons for
upholding the DNA warrant provisions of the <i>Criminal
Code</i> against the challenge that they were not in accord with the principle
against self-incrimination.  This
decision supports the view that the principle is not infringed in this case but
it should be noted that the DNA warrant section included a provision for
judicial approval  a feature, of course, not present in this case.  On appeal, this court, per Finlayson J.A.,
rejected the s. 7 challenge on the basis that the s. 8 challenge (unreasonable
search and seizure) had been rejected: (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 237.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I do not think
that <i>R. v. Milne, supra</i>, relied upon
by the appellant, supports his position. 
I note that it was decided after <i>R.
v. Hebert</i> but it did not, at least expressly, consider the principle
against self-incrimination.  It held
that s. 48 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,
which authorizes roadside sobriety tests, did not infringe s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter </i>because the evidence of the
tests could not be used at the trial to prove impairment.  Their only legal use was as an
investigative tool to allow police to remove impaired drivers from the highway
immediately (p. 127).  The
administration of these tests did not render any subsequent trial unfair
because the evidence of the test was not admissible at the trial (p. 128).  By analogy it can be said that similarly the
roadside screen tests do not result in an unfair trial.  See also <i>R.
v. Coutts, supra</i>, para. 17.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>R. v. Fitzpatrick</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C.
(3d) 144 (S.C.C.) LaForest J. for the court 
at p. 162 confirmed that the two fundamental purposes behind the
principle against self-incrimination are (1) to protect against unreliable
confessions and (2) to protect against abuse of power by the state and that
any limits on the principle against self-incrimination should be determined by
reference to these two underlying rationales. 
In my view, neither of these rationales are implicated in the
administration of a roadside screening test. 
I refer to the reasoning in <i>R. v.
White</i>, supra, at pp. 281-283, which was concerned with the compelled
accident report which was submitted to be admissible at trial, to indicate how
different the present case is from that in <i>White</i>.  In <i>White</i>
the court found both the risk of unreliable confessions and the abuse of state
power to be relevant to the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[46]   <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the present
case neither is the roadside test result a confession nor does the element of
compulsion create a risk that the result could be false.  With respect to abuse of state power, I do
not think that the possibility is real and serious that permitting the use of
compelled roadside breath test results, not as evidence at trial but as the
basis for making a breathalyzer demand, might increase the likelihood of
abusive conduct by the state (<i>R. v.
White</i> at p. 282).  Further, the test
results are evidence of objective facts and not a personal narrative of
events, emotions and decisions that are extremely revealing of the declarants
personality, opinions, thoughts, and state of mind (<i>R. v. White</i> at p. 283).</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;'> and <i>R. v. White </i>also referred to the factors of coercion and of
adversarial relationship as being relevant in the determination of the
application of the principle against self-incrimination in a case.  In <i>White</i>,
the court, with respect to accident reports, held the coercion factor to be a
neutral one.  For substantially the same
reasons as were given in <i>White</i>, I
would think that it is a neutral one also in the present case, although the
presence of detention in this case indicates that there may be some element of
coercion.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In connection
with the preventive purpose of the legislation, it will be recalled that the
principles of fundamental justice take into account more than just the
interests of the accused person: <i>R. v.
Darrach, supra</i>.  In the present case
the relevant interests, in addition to those of the detained motorist and the
broad interest of the state in the protection of the public, are the very
immediate interests of those motorists and pedestrians in the vicinity of the
detained motorist who are involuntarily subject to the perils created by
impaired drivers.  They have a real
interest in the police having pre-emptive investigative power.  In short, in the context relevant to this
case, the factors that favour the search for truth (to ascertain whether the
driver <i>is</i> a danger) clearly outweigh
the minimal intrusion on the right of the driver against undue compulsion by
the state.  <i>R. v. White, supra</i>, at p. 277.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>When all of the
foregoing is taken into account, particularly (a) the preventive purpose of the
legislation, (b) the inadmissibility of the roadside test result at trial, and
(c) the absence of the two underlying rationales of the principle against
self-incrimination (risk of false confessions and abuse of state power), I do
not think that the right against self-incrimination is infringed in this case.</span></p>

10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Because I have concluded that ss. 254(2) and
(5) do not infringe s.7, there is no infringement of s. 10(b) beyond what the
Supreme Court found in <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>.  The comments in <i>R. v. Bartle, supra, R. v. Milne, supra</i> and <i>R. v. Coutts, supra</i>, relating the right against self-incrimination
to the right to counsel, presume the existence of the right against
self-incrimination in these circumstances. 
<i>Milne</i> and <i>Coutts</i>, in particular, were concerned with the possibility of the
use of the conscriptive evidence at trial. 
That is not the situation in the present case.</span></p>

legal advice in the impaired driving context in <i>Bartle</i> at p. 319 in the context of the courts s. 24(2) analysis,
is of significance in the present case. 
The court confirmed that it was necessarily limited.  I have quoted what Le Dain J. said in <i>Thomsen</i> on the relevance of legal advice
in that case.  It does not indicate a
diminished view of the potential of s. 10(b) compared to that in <i>Bartle</i>. 
It will be recalled that the defendant in <i>Thomsen </i>had been acquitted at the trial because the trial judge
thought that his counsel might have advised him to comply with the demand.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>If I am wrong in
my conclusion that the extent of the <i>Charter</i>
infringement in this case is not different from that in <i>Bhagwandat</i>, and cases cited in it, it will be necessary to consider
the question of the continued justification of the infringement under s. 1 of
the <i>Charter</i>.  I shall do so briefly.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[54]   <span

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I note that there
is no issue raised by the appellant that resort to s. 1 is not possible in a
case where the principles of fundamental justice have been infringed.  In fact, the narrow issue raised by the
appellant, as indicated earlier in these reasons, is that the infringement
would be justified if what he submits is a less intrusive legal consequence
were substituted for that of a conviction for failing or refusing to comply
with the demand.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I would also note
that Hill J. in <i>R. v. F.(S.), supra</i>,
at page 310 was of the view that s. 1 could have some application where there
was an infringement of the principles of fundamental justice.  The subject is dealt with briefly in Hogg, <i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i>, Loose-leaf
ed. vol. 2 in para. 35.14.  In <i>R. v. Mills</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 321
(S.C.C.) at 359-361 there is a comparison of the balancing of the principles of
fundamental justice under s. 7 and the balancing of interests under s. 1 of the
<i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is not denied
that the objective of ss. 254(2) and (5) of the <i>Code</i> is of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutionally protected right (<i>R. v.
Oakes</i> (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at 348).  It relates to concerns that are pressing
and substantial.  This is reflected in
many cases since <i>R. v. Seo, supra</i>,
which contains an organized presentation of the data on the subject.  Fresh data of a similar nature was filed on
this appeal.</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Every year, drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death, injury,
heartbreak and destruction.  From the
point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society
than any other crime.  In terms of the
deaths and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is
clearly the crime which causes the most significant social loss to the country.</span></p>

tragic effects and devastating consequences of drinking and driving.  The social cost of the crime, great as it
is, fades in comparison to the personal loss suffered by the victims of this
crime through the death and injury of their loved ones.  The gravity of the problem  and its impact on Canadian society has been
so great that <i>Criminal Code</i>
amendments were enacted aimed at eliminating or, at least, reducing the
problem.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>What the appeal
on the application of s. 1 comes down to is the question of minimal impairment
of the right in question.  The appellant
submits that the criminalization of a refusal does not meet the minimal
impairment requirement of justification. 
In this regard, he submits that the s. 254(5) offence enforcement
requirement should be replaced by the creation of a presumption that the act of
failing or refusing to provide a roadside breath sample would be the equivalent
of failing the test, which would justify a s. 254(3) breathalyzer demand.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'> We received submissions on each
side on whether, in fact, the appellants proposal would result in lesser
impairment and also on whether it would be as effective in carrying out the
legislative policy as the current provision. 
This very issue has been dealt earlier by Kurisko D.C.J. in <i>R. v. Currie</i> (1988), 8 M.V.R. (2d) 176
(Ont. Dist. Ct.) in which he addressed the trial judgment in <i>R. v. Bhagwandat, supra</i>, which had
declared s. 254(5) to be unconstitutional. 
At p. 182 Kurisko D.C.J. said:</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>If as stated in <i>Bhagwandat</i>,
the least intrusive means (p. 17) were substituted for the foregoing by
making the refusal of a roadside test <i>the
equivalent of taking and failing the roadside test</i> (p.17, emphasis
original) there would undoubtedly be an increase in the frequency of roadside
refusals by drivers willing to take their chances in hopes of getting off
as happened in this case.  During busy
periods (such as Christmas) the overload on trained personnel and limited
equipment resulting from such refusals would undoubtedly tax the detailed, time
consuming breathalyzer procedure beyond its capacity to analyse the increased
number of breath samples within the mandatory 2-hour time limit imposed by
Parliament.  On these occasions the
objective of the R.I.D.E. program would surely be severely crippled.</span></p>

This is a case where a degree of deference should be afforded to the
legislature.  In <i>R. v. Butler</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at pp. 164-65,
Sopinka J. said for the court that a perfect solution is not necessary under
s. 1 but simply that the scheme be appropriately tailored in the context of the
right that is infringed.  He quoted the
following from <i>Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec
(Attorney General)</i> (1989), 58 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.) at 629-30:</span></p>

modest objectives were available to the government, there is evidence
establishing the necessity of a ban to meet the objectives the government had
reasonably set.  This court will not, in
the name of minimal impairment, take a restrictive approach to social science
evidence and require legislatures to choose the least ambitious means to
protect vulnerable groups.</span></p>

taken into account and the infringement of the principle against
