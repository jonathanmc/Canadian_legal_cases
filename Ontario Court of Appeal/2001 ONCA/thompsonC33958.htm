<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice J. Bryan Shaughnessy dated February 
  22, 2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>

  </span> In deciding whether the employer had just cause to dismiss the respondent, 
  the trial judge was correct in law in considering the respondent’s misconduct 
  in the context of his overall employment relationship:  <i>McKinley v. BC Tel</i> 
  2001 SCC 38.  In the circumstances of this case, that context included the respondent’s 
  employment history with his employer, his relationship with Mr. Foster, his 
  immediate supervisor, Mr. Foster’s role in the relevant events, the actual nature 
  of the misconduct, and the effect, if any, of the misconduct on the employer’s 
  business.  The trial judge considered these factors and concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I find that the single instance of poor judgment demonstrated by the plaintiff 
      [respondent] on July 10, 1998 in the context of an otherwise unblemished 
      employment record does not constitute just cause for immediate termination 
      of his employment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While some might regard this as a charitable assessment of the respondent’s 
  misconduct, we are satisfied that it is an assessment that was open to the trial 
  judge on the facts as he found them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant has challenged various findings of fact made 
  by the trial judge on which he based his ultimate conclusion.  We are satisfied 
  that the findings of fact made by the trial judge were open to him on the evidence.  
  We are also satisfied that he made the necessary findings of credibility, either 
  explicitly or implicitly, necessary to support his ultimate conclusion.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has also challenged the notice period assessed by the 
  trial judge.  We are satisfied that the period set by the trial judge was within 
  the range appropriate in the circumstances.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has also argued that the respondent’s alleged dishonesty 
  in his subsequent dealings with the Unemployment Insurance Commission should 
  somehow have resulted in a reduction of that notice period.  We see no error 
  in the trial judge’s finding that there should be no reduction.  In coming to 
  that conclusion, we should not be taken to agree with the premise of the appellant’s 
  submission, that is, that the subsequent conduct could somehow result in a reduction 
  of the notice period.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s ruling with respect to costs was within his discretion 
  as set out in Rule 49.10 and we see no reason to interfere with that ruling.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the result, the appeal is dismissed, leave to appeal costs is granted 
  but that appeal is also dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs 
  in this court forthwith after their assessment.</p>
