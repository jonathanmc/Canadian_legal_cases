<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Norman D. Dyson, sitting with a jury, 
  dated October 23, 1998.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After a 28-day jury trial, in which both liability and damages were 
  in issue, Dyson J. gave judgment for the plaintiffs further to answers to questions 
  submitted to the jury as part of the trial judge’s charge.  No issue is taken 
  with the trial judge’s charge or with the jury’s liability findings.  What is 
  in issue on the defendant Toronto Board of Education’s appeal is the jury’s 
  assessment of damages for the loss of guidance, care and companionship under 
  the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 61 in respect of the 14-year 
  old deceased’s father, mother and sister.  The assessments in issue are $100,000 
  for each of the deceased’s father and mother and $50,000 for his sister.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant Board of Education also takes issue with the trial judge’s 
  award of solicitor-and-client costs of the trial to the plaintiffs.  It seeks 
  leave to appeal costs and if leave is granted to vary the costs order from solicitor-and-client 
  to party-and-party costs.  </p>

  </span> On February 26, 1992, Binh Hoy To (the deceased), a 14-year old Grade 
  9 student,  was doing pull ups on the steel crossbar of a large European handball 
  net in the gymnasium during a physical education class at Harbord Collegiate.  
  He was killed when the net toppled over and crushed his head between the steel 
  frame of the net and the gymnasium floor.  He was survived by his father Quoc 
  Luong To (Mr. To), his mother, Kiet Linh Luong To (Mrs. To) and his younger 
  sister, Mary To.  </p>

  </span> In due course the deceased’s mother, father and sister sued the Toronto 
  Board of Education and the vendor of the equipment in question, Sports Equipment 
  of Toronto Limited.  The defendant Queonto Ltd. did not take part in the trial.</p>

  </span> The trial commenced before Dyson J. and a jury on September 15, 1998.  
  On October 23, 1998, in response to questions put to them, the jury returned 
  a verdict finding negligence on the part of the Board (75%) and the deceased 
  (25%).  The jury found no negligence on the part of Sports Equipment of Toronto 
  Limited.  In answer to the damages questions put to them, the jury assessed 
  damages as follows:</p>

  </span> On April 9, 1999, after hearing submissions from counsel, the trial 
  judge awarded the plaintiffs party-and-party costs to the date the trial commenced 
  and solicitor-and-client costs thereafter.  The disposition of this issue was 
  complicated by the fact that, despite instructions from the trial judge that 
  the jury should not be concerned about costs, the jury added to its damages 
  answers, “plus legal costs”.  After hearing counsel’s submissions, the trial 
  judge gave no weight to this jury recommendation.  However, he gave the plaintiffs 
  solicitor-and-client costs of the trial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In its appeal, the appellant Board submits that the damages assessed 
  by the jury for guidance, care and companionship are inordinately high and that 
  the trial judge erred in exercising his discretion on costs by awarding the 
  plaintiffs solicitor-and-client costs of the trial even though there were no 
  Rule 49 offers which would support a solicitor-and-client costs order.  </p>
<p class=headingtitle>The Evidence</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some reference to the evidence led at trial is required in order to 
  deal with the issue of the jury’s assessment of damages for guidance, care and 
  companionship.  The evidence to which I refer largely concerns the relationship 
  between the deceased and his mother, father and sister.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deceased was born in 1977 in South Vietnam.  Shortly after his birth, 
  his father and mother determined that as persons of Chinese descent in South 
  Vietnam, recently overtaken by Communist North Vietnam, the To family would 
  have a very difficult future.  They thus arranged to escape from South Vietnam 
  by travelling without the required papers to North Vietnam, from there to China 
  and then to the South China Sea, where they arranged to board a small boat destined 
  for Hong Kong with about 30 other people.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. and Mrs. To, with their young son, immigrated to Canada in 1980, 
  where they established themselves and became independent in a financial sense 
  by working in restaurants and eventually by becoming restaurant owners.  In 
  due course, they became Canadian citizens.  Mary To, the sister of the deceased, 
  was born shortly after the To family arrived in Canada, when the deceased was 
  about three years old.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was considerable evidence led at trial about the particular culture 
  into which the deceased was born, particularly with respect of the relationship 
  between the deceased and his family.  This evidence concerned, among other things, 
  the important place occupied by a first-born son.  It was expected from the 
  outset that the deceased as the To’s first-born son would excel scholastically 
  and graduate from a university with a view to obtaining highly remunerative 
  employment.  It was also expected that he would be obedient and provide financial 
  and social support for his parents and direct assistance to his sister, Mary.  
  Mr. and Mrs. To were devoted to, and relied upon, the deceased in many ways.  
  Their goals for him were shared and high.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> From the evidence adduced at trial, it is apparent that the deceased 
  fit comfortably into the expected mould.  He excelled at school, he was devoted 
  to his parents and they to him.  The deceased helped his father with both business 
  and personal correspondence because Mr. To did not read English.  The deceased 
  was in many ways his father’s contact with the English-speaking world.  By the 
  age of 14, he had become a trusted companion and adviser to his father.  There 
  is ample evidence of both guidance and companionship in the deceased’s relationship 
  with his father and mother.  I will comment on the meaning of guidance and companionship 
  later in these reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deceased’s relationship with his sister, Mary was extremely close, 
  almost paternal. The deceased was devoted to his mother, father and sister.  
  He recognized the need to meet his parents’ high expectations.  He accepted 
  responsibility for ensuring that his sister’s homework was properly completed.  
  He also helped her with her school work.  He would comfort and care for her 
  if his parents were not at home.  He was also consistently available to her 
  to discuss problems she had.  The deceased was a surrogate father to his sister 
  and an integral part of her life.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because Mr. and Mrs. To often worked very long hours in the family business, 
  the deceased was often required to care for his sister.  Mrs. To testified that 
  the deceased was of considerable assistance to Mary in school.  In addition, 
  there was evidence from Anh Honh Trinh that the deceased consistently helped 
  his sister do her homework.  Mrs. To testified that Mary’s academic performance 
  has declined since the deceased’s death.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deceased and Mary provided considerable companionship to one another.  
  They were inseparable until Mary was six years old.  Anh Honh Trinh testified 
  that when the family came to Canada “they are all the time together, and the 
  brother is always taking care of the sister because the sister was much younger”.  
  She testified that when the two attended the same school, they walked home together 
  and that even when the deceased moved to another school, they were still “always 
  together”.  Mary testified that she and the deceased planned to live near each 
  other as adults, and that they were as close as a brother and sister could be.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deceased’s tragic death had a devastating effect on his mother, 
  father and sister.  He was not buried until approximately three weeks after 
  his death, when an appropriate date in the Chinese calendar was reached.  His 
  family moved out of the family home for about one year.  After his death, the 
  family travelled every weekend from their home to the Cam Sham Temple on Bayview 
  Avenue in Toronto where incense was burned.  Mrs. To prepared the deceased’s 
  favourite foods, which she believed his spirit could smell but not eat.  At 
  some risk to her own health, Mrs. To tried on two occasions to produce another 
  son.  She made inquiries about fertilization.  In the end, she had complications, 
  and eventually required a hysterectomy.  After her hysterectomy, Mrs. To offered 
  to divorce Mr. To because she no longer could bear him a son.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. To has a partnership interest in two restaurants with his older 
  brother.  His time was reasonably flexible since he was the person in charge 
  of the administrative aspects of the business.  Mrs. To did not have a fixed 
  schedule.  She regularly picked the deceased and his sister up from school to 
  accompany them home from school, after which she prepared dinner.  The deceased 
  and his sister were almost always accompanied to and from school by one of their 
  parents. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deceased was a fun-loving, outgoing, popular, hardworking teenager 
  who was committed to school and who cared for his family and his friends at 
  Harbord Collegiate.  He was an excellent student.  Although he was a hockey 
  fan, he did not play hockey or any other sport because his goals did not permit 
  him time to pursue such hobbies.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the evidence led at trial, most of which was uncontradicted, it was 
  clearly open to the jury to conclude that the To family was extremely close 
  and that the family’s expectations were that the deceased would proceed to a 
  university education, likely to post-graduate work and a professional career.  
  In short, there was an abundance of evidence that the deceased provided, and 
  would have continued to provide, guidance and companionship to his mother and 
  father and guidance, care and companionship to his sister.</p>

  </span> The statutory scheme permitting recovery for damages for the loss of 
  guidance, care and companionship became part of the law of Ontario in 1978 with 
  the introduction of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i>, 1978, S.O. 1978, c. 2.  
  Section 60(2) of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> (now <i>Family Law Act</i>,

  </span> Section 61 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, makes provision for compensation 
  for the loss of guidance, care and companionship:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>61(1)  If a person is injured or killed by the fault or neglect of another 
      under circumstances where the person is entitled to recover damages, or

      their pecuniary loss resulting from the injury or death from the person 
      from whom the person injured or killed is entitled to recover or would have 
      been entitled to recover if not killed, and to maintain an action for the

  </span> The introduction of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> represented a major 
  change in the scope of the quantum of recovery of damages in fatal accident 
  claims.  At common law, no action lay for any loss in circumstances where the 
  tortious conduct of the defendant caused another person’s death.  However, in 
  1846 in England, through <i>An Act for Compensating Families of Persons Killed 
  by Accidents</i> (9 and 10 Vict., C.93), (made part of the law of Ontario and 
  Quebec in 1847 with the introduction of the <i>Fatal Accidents Act</i> (10 and 
  11 Vict., C.6), the tortfeasor was liable to an action for damages to certain 
  prescribed persons in particular relationships with the deceased.  The <i>Fatal 
  Accidents Act</i> was not interpreted to permit compensation for grief, mental 
  distress or solatium.  Companionship was limited to pecuniary loss.  It was 
  eventually held that the <i>Fatal Accidents </i>Act permitted the granting of 
  compensation to a child for the loss of his/her parents’ companionship.  See 
  <i>Vana v. Tosta</i>, [1968] S.C.R. 71.  The prevailing fiction was that a child’s 
  loss of a parent’s companionship was a pecuniary loss.</p>

  </span> In 1969, the Ontario Law Reform Commission in its <i>Report on Family 
  Law</i> (Toronto:  Department of Justice, 1969) Vol. 1 at p. 109, recommended 
  that a full study be undertaken of losses, including losses which were non-pecuniary 
  in their character, in both personal injury and fatal accident claims.  The 
  Commission recommended in its brief report that the legislation, which was then 
  contemplated, limit recovery of damages in fatal accident claims to pecuniary 
  losses, as the Commission assumed was the case under the <i>Fatal Accidents 
  Act</i>.</p>

  </span> The <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> was proclaimed in force in 1978.  It 
  provided for the recovery of “pecuniary loss” in respect of personal injury 
  and fatal accident claims.  However, s. 60(2) of the <i>Act</i> provided that 
  recoverable losses by certain relatives of the deceased, expanded in the <i>Family 
  Law Reform Act</i> to include siblings, may include an amount to compensate 
  for the loss of guidance, care and companionship.  </p>

  </span> The question quickly arose whether a compensable damages for the loss 
  of guidance, care or companionship, included essentially non-pecuniary losses.  
  This court’s judgment in <i>Mason v. Peters</i> (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 27, put 
  that debate to rest.  In that case, the trial judge assessed guidance, care 
  and companionship compensation for a mother whose 11-year old son was killed 
  in an accident in April 1978 at $45,000.  He assessed the deceased’s sister’s 
  damages at $5,000.  Robins J.A., after reviewing the relatively meagre damages 
  awarded in cases involving the death of children under the former <i>Fatal Accidents 
  Act</i>, focused on companionship.  He said, at p. 33:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whatever the situation may have been in earlier times when children were 
      regarded as an economic asset, in this day and age, the death of a child 
      does not often constitute a monetary loss or one measurable in pecuniary 
      terms.  The most significant loss suffered, apart from the sorrow, grief 
      and anguish that always ensues from such deaths, is not potential economic 
      gain, but deprivation of the society, comfort and protection which might 
      reasonably be expected had the child lived – in short, the loss of the rewards 
      of association which flow from the family relationship and are summarized 
      in the word “companionship”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Subsequent cases (decided under both the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> 
  and the <i>Family Law Act</i>) revealed a great disparity in guidance, care 
  and companionship damage awards.  See for example,  <i>Reidy v. McLeod</i> (1986), 
  54 O.R. (2d) 661 (C.A.), rev’g (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 313 (H.C.J.);  <i>Hamilton 
  v. Canadian National Railway Co.</i> (1991), 80 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 470 
  (Ont. C.A.);  and <i>Macartney v. Warner</i> (2000), 46 O.R. 669 (C.A.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because guidance, care and companionship damages assessments were not 
  consistent, in the interest of certainty, some called for conventional awards.  
  See <i>Gervais v. Richard</i> (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 191 (H.C.J.).  As it turned 
  out the call was not heeded.  Cases like <i>Nielsen v. Kaufmann</i> (1986), 
  54 O.R. (2d) 188 (C.A.) and <i>Zdasiuk v. Lucas</i> (1987), 58 O.R. (2d) 443 
  (C.A.) established that in assessing guidance, care and companionship damages 
  the particular family circumstances in each case must be taken into account 
  by the trier of fact.  Even when guidance, care and companionship damages awards 
  were reduced on appeal, the reduction was not premised on accepted “conventional” 
  awards.  For example, in <i>Reidy, supra</i>, this court reduced the trial judge’s 
  assessment of guidance, care and companionship damages but it did not suggest 
  that these assessments should be conventional. </p>

line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The result of a case-by-case analysis of family relationships has led 
  to a range of guidance, care and companionship assessments so broad as to defy 
  description as conventional.  The range of these assessments will, of course, 
  expand if we continue to permit juries to assess these damages.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I regard the existing disparity in guidance, care and companionship 
  awards as the inevitable result of choices made by the courts and the Legislature.  
  The courts could have established conventional guidance, care and companionship 
  awards, or could have imposed rough upper limits as the Supreme Court of Canada 
  did in respect of non-pecuniary general damages in personal injury cases.  See 
  <i>Andrews v. Grand and Toy Alberta Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229.  That has 
  not happened.  Alternatively, the Legislature could have moved towards a legislative 
  scheme such as exists in Alberta where the <i>Alberta Fatal Accidents Act</i>, 
  R.S.A. 1980, c. F-5, s. 8 (as amended), provides that in the event of the death 
  of a child under 18 years of age, the court is directed to award $43,000 to 
  each of the child’s parents for grief and loss of guidance, care and companionship.  
  This is done without reference to other damages or evidence of damage.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although one might quibble with the numbers, in my view, this system 
  merits serious consideration.  However, that is a matter for the Legislature.  
  As matters now stand, as I have said, each case must be given separate consideration 
  to measure what Krever J. viewed as “immeasurable” and “incalculable” in <i>Gervais, 
  supra</i>, at p. 201.  Judges and juries are left to do the best they can in 
  each case where the assessment of damages for guidance, care and companionship 
  is required.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>The Standard of Appellate Review</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is against that general background that I turn to consider the standard 
  of appellate review as it relates to the jury’s assessment of damages of the 
  deceased’s mother, father and sister for the loss of guidance, care and companionship.  
  It is manifest, merely because I would have assessed guidance, care and companionship 
  damages lower than the jury’s assessment, does not justify this court’s intervention 
  with the jury’s assessment.  In the circumstances where there was no error in 
  the charge so that the jury can be taken to have considered and applied the 
  proper factors and principles, the jury’s assessment must be so inordinately 
  high (or low) as to constitute a wholly erroneous estimate of the guidance, 
  care and companionship loss.  See <i>Woelk v. Halvorson</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 
  430;  <i>Macartney, supra</i>; and <i>Scott v. Musial</i> (1959), 3 All. E.R. 
  193 (C.A.).  While reference to other guidance, care and companionship assessments 
  involving deaths of children is helpful to test the reasonableness of the award, 
  it is not determinative.  Each case must be considered in light of the evidence 
  material to the guidance, care and companionship claims in that case.  When 
  this is done, for the reasons that follow, in my view, the $100,000 guidance, 
  care and companionship assessments of Mr. and Mrs. To are not so inordinately 
  high as to justify this court’s interference.  In my opinion, the assessment 
  of $50,000 for the deceased’s sister is outside the range of reasonableness 
  and is inordinately high.</p>

  </span> This court has consistently held that the guidance, care and companionship 
  compensation in each case must be assessed in an objective and unemotional way.  
  See <i>Hamilton, supra</i>; and <i>Macartney, supra</i>.  Since each case must 
  be considered in light of the particular family relationship involved, assessments 
  will, of course, vary.  An appellate court will not lightly interfere with a 
  properly instructed jury’s assessment of damages; however, the reasonableness 
  of the jury’s assessment will be tested but by comparison with assessments in 
  other cases.  This latter exercise leads to establishing a range of damages.  
  These issues were referred to by Krever and Finlayson JJ.A. in <i>Hamilton, 
  supra</i>, pp. 472-73:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We are mindful that <u>this is a jury award and that we should not lightly 
      interfere with it.</u>  However, in viewing the evidence in this case in 
      its totality and in a light most favourable to the claims, we are of the 
      opinion that the quantum of damages set by the jury cannot be justified.  
      <u>The quantum of damages here far exceeds the general range of damages 
      that has been awarded by our courts in cases involving the death of minor 
      children</u> … .   [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> In the result, in <i>Hamilton, supra</i>, this court (Galligan J.A. 
  dissenting) reduced the jury’s assessment of damages for the deceased’s mother 
  from $150,000 to $50,000; the assessment for the deceased’s two brothers was 
  reduced from $15,000 to $7,500 and the assessment for the deceased’s sister,

  </span> In <i>Macartney, supra</i>, a non-jury case involving the death of a 
  19-year old boy, the damage assessments were alleged to be too low.  Rosenberg 
  J.A., after recognizing that the amount of guidance, care and companionship 
  compensation in a particular case will depend on the facts and circumstances 
  in evidence in that case, referred to an accepted range of damages at p. 674:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While it is my view that [the trial judge’s guidance, care and companionship 
      damages assessments] are low, they were within the accepted range for this 
      type of case, albeit at the very bottom of that range.  The limits of appellate 
      review of damage awards are well settled.  The Court of Appeal should not 
      interfere merely because it would have come to a different conclusion …

  </span> In both <i>Hamilton, supra</i>, and <i>Macartney, supra</i>, there was 
  no evidence that would take the case out of the general range of guidance, care 
  and companionship damages that had been awarded in cases involving the death 
  of teenage children.  Both cases reveal a reluctance to interfere with a trial 
  judge’s assessment of damages.  The same reluctance prevails in respect of jury 
  assessments of damages.  In <i>Hamilton</i>, this court did interfere because 
  it concluded that the guidance, care and companionship assessments were higher 
  than the accepted range.  In <i>Macartney</i>, this court did not interfere 
  because the damages, although low, came within the accepted range.</p>

  </span> Companionship, as it was defined in <i>Mason v. Peters</i> in a fatal 
  accident context, consists of the deprivation of the society, comfort and protection 
  which might reasonably be expected had the child lived.  Robins J.A. described 
  it as “the loss of the rewards of association which flow from the family relationship”.  
  Care was referred to by Linden J. in <i>Thornborrow v. MacKinnon</i> (1981), 
  32 O.R. (2d) 740 (H.C.J.) as including “feeding, clothing, cleaning, transporting, 
  helping and protecting another person”.  <i>Thornborrow</i> was cited with approval 
  by Robins J.A. in <i>Mason v. Peters</i>.  See also <i>Huggins v. Ramtej</i> 
  [1999], O.J. No. 1696 (Ont. S.C.J.) (QL).  In <i>Thornborrow</i>, Linden J. 
  described guidance as including such things as education, training, discipline 
  and moral teaching.  </p>

  </span> The assessments of $100,000 for each of Mr. and Mrs. To might be viewed 
  as being at the high end of an accepted range of guidance, care and companionship 
  damages.  The question that must be considered is whether those assessments 
  are outside the accepted range of damages.  In my view, the $100,000 assessments 
  for Mr. and Mrs. To are not outside the range.  Expressed in constant dollars, 
  the $100,000 assessments for Mr. and Mrs. To are roughly comparable to the $45,000 
  guidance, care and companionship assessment in <i>Mason v. Peters</i>.  In April 
  1978, (the month of the <i>Mason v. Peters</i> accident) the consumer price 
  index for Canada was at 54.6.  In February 1992, the month of the deceased’s 
  death, the consumer price index was at 127.1.  Given that increase in the consumer 
  price index, it would take $104,753 in February 1992 dollars to purchase the 
  same basket of good purchased for $45,000 in 1978.  I view <i>Mason v. Peters</i> 
  to be an acceptable comparator for the purpose of assessing a range of “accepted 
  damages”.  In addition, I note that the $45,000 <i>Mason v. Peters</i> guidance, 
  care and companionship assessment was referred by Robins J.A. as “modest” and 
  an assessment that could “in no sense be considered excessive”.  Although I 
  think that the jury’s guidance, care and companionship assessments for Mr. and 
  Mrs. To are high, they are not so high as to justify this court’s intervention. 
  In my opinion, there was evidence in this case that would support a conclusion 
  that damages for guidance, care and companionship in respect of the mother, 
  father and sister were justifiably assessed at the high end of what one might 
  describe as an accepted range of damages.  There was evidence of an extremely 
  close relationship between the deceased and his mother and father.  It was open 
  to the jury to find that Mr. and Mrs. To suffered a substantial loss of society, 
  comfort and protection, all benefits that flow from the family relationship.  
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I should address two further points.  First, there was some confusion 
  as to whether counsel at trial referred to the assessment of guidance, care 
  and companionship damages in another case.  This turned out to be a non-issue 
  on the appeal, however, to avoid future problems, I should make it clear that 
  counsel should not refer to other cases when making submissions to the jury.  
  See <i>Thomas (Committee of) v. Bell Helmets</i> (1999), 40 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  31 (Ont. C.A.).  This will serve only to deflect the jury from the required 
  analysis of the evidence in the case before them.  Second, the constant dollar 
  comparison of the guidance, care and companionship assessments in this case 
  with the <i>Mason v. Peters</i> assessment was the subject matter of affidavit 
  evidence that the respondents sought to tender as fresh evidence.  In my opinion, 
  this “evidence” (the accuracy of which was accepted) is best viewed as an acceptable 
  aid to oral argument, not as fresh evidence.  Thus, I would dismiss the motion 
  to introduce fresh evidence without costs.</p>

  </span> As I have said, the jury assessed the deceased’s sister Mary’s claim 
  for the loss of guidance, care and companionship at $50,000.  As is the case 
  with the claim of the deceased’s mother and father, Mary To’s entitlement to 
  guidance, care and companionship compensation must be considered in light of 
  the particular relationship between her and the deceased.  </p>

  </span> There is no doubt that the evidence supports a finding that Mary To 
  suffered a loss of guidance, care and companionship as a result of her brother’s 
  death.  The question then is simply whether the jury’s assessment is so inordinately 
  high as to require this court’s intervention.  </p>

  </span> At the time of her brother’s death, Mary was 11 years old.  There was 
  evidence that Mary and her brother were close and that the deceased was “always 
  taking care of her”.  Mrs. To described her children’s relationship as “very 
  good”.  She said that they never fought, and that “he tried to yield to his 
  sister”.  Mr. To testified that his son was a companion to all members of the 
  family.  He described the family unit as “very, very happy”.</p>

  </span> The general or accepted range of damages in sibling claims for the loss 
  of guidance, care and companionship in roughly comparable cases is very broad 
  but the assessments are consistently lower than $50,000.  The facts in <i>Rintoul 
  v. Linde Estate</i> (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 704 (Gen. Div.) are closest to this 
  case.  In <i>Rintoul</i>, the deceased was 16 years old when he died.  He was 
  survived by one sister who was 12 at the time of the deceased’s death.  The 
  family was close and supportive.  Before the tragic accident, the deceased and 
  his sister discussed taking over the family farm together.  The trial judge, 
  Salhany J., held that the facts of that case were “unique”.  He concluded that 
  the deceased’s sister relied on him for guidance, even at his young age.  The 
  trial judge awarded the sister $20,000 for her guidance, care and companionship 
  loss.  In other guidance, care and companionship sibling assessment cases, the 
  awards are lower.  See for example, <i>Frawley v. Asselstine</i> (1990), 73 
  O.R. (2d) 525 (H.C.J.);  <i>Koncovy v. Hodulik</i>, [1986] O.J. No. 864 (H.C.J.)

  in question must fall somewhere within the range of damages established in comparable 
  cases involving the deaths of minor children.  In my opinion, a $50,000 guidance, 
  care and companionship assessment exceeds the accepted range of damages to a

  supra</i>, the circumstances of this case support a substantial assessment of 
  guidance, care and companionship damages for the deceased’s sister.  Since it 
  would make no sense to prolong these proceedings and since this court has authority 
  to vary the assessment in issue (see s. 119 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43), recognizing that the jury was prepared to be generous,

  – “plus legal costs” – was a basis for ordering the unsuccessful defendant, 
  the Board of Education, to pay solicitor-and-client costs to the plaintiffs.  
  The trial judge then reviewed several settlement offers made by the plaintiffs 
  and one made by the defendant Board. </p>

  </span> Two offers of the plaintiffs were for less than the amount of the judgment, 
  but neither was a valid Rule 49 offer.  Neither offer was submitted at least 
  7 days before the commencement of the trial and both offers expired before the 
  trial started.  Nonetheless, the trial judge observed that the two offers from 
  the plaintiffs were, “factors to be considered in the overall picture”.  The 
  trial judge then referred to the failure of the defendant, Board of Education, 
  to respond in any meaningful way to the plaintiffs’ request to admit.  He then 
  commented favourably on the manner in which the plaintiffs had put their case 
  in (much was made of the plaintiffs’ use of PowerPoint).  Then the trial judge 
  stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Under all the circumstances, the plaintiffs are entitled to party-and-party 
      costs until the commencement of the trial and solicitor-and-client costs 
      for the trial.  </p>
  </blockquote>

  </span> The plaintiffs’ settlement offers, the Board’s failure to meaningfully 
  respond to the plaintiffs’ request to admit and the efficiency of the presentation 
  of the plaintiffs’ case were all referred to by the trial judge in his reasons 
  dealing with costs and require brief comment. </p>

  </span> In some reasonably narrow circumstances, offers that do not comply with 
  Rule 49.10 can be used to justify a solicitor-and-client costs order under Rule 
  49.13.  See <i>Thomas, supra</i>, in which sequential plaintiffs’ settlement 
  offers, although not in compliance in a technical sense with Rule 49.10, were 
  held, nonetheless to justify a solicitor-and-client costs order under Rule 49.13.  
  However, I see no basis here in Rule 49.13 to order solicitor-and-client costs 
  of the entire trial, since the plaintiffs’ offers did not comply with the substantive 
  requirements of Rule 49.10.  </p>

  </span> The fact that the Board of Education played hardball with the plaintiffs’ 
  request to admit is a relevant matter if the failure to make reasonable admissions 
  prolonged the trial, or otherwise added to the trial costs.</p>

  </span> Finally, in the circumstances of this case, the fact that the plaintiffs’ 
  counsel was able to use modern technology to advance his client’s interests 
  at trial is commendable.  However, in my opinion, it is not a basis upon which 
  to make a defendant pay solicitor-and-client costs of the trial.  </p>

  </span> Apart from the problems attendant upon the defendant, Board of Education’s 
  refusal to meaningfully respond to the plaintiffs’ request to admit, I see no 
  basis to justify anything other than a party-and-party costs order throughout.  
  I would direct the assessment officer to determine whether, if at all, the trial 
  was prolonged as a result of the defendant, Board of Education’s failure to 
  respond in any meaningful way to the plaintiffs’ request to admit.  If the assessment 
  officer determines that the trial was prolonged, the plaintiffs will be entitled 
  to solicitor-and-client costs for the additional time spent at trial.  </p>

  </span> For these reasons, I would allow the appeal in part, and direct that 
  the assessment of guidance, care and companionship damages of Mary To be reduced 
  from $50,000 to $25,000.  I would vary the costs order at trial by awarding 
  the plaintiffs party-and-party costs throughout, subject to a direction to the 
  assessment officer to assess solicitor-and- client costs for any time that the 
  trial was extended because of the defendant’s failure to appropriately respond 
  to the plaintiffs’ request to admit.  Success was divided, however, Mr. and 
  Mrs. To have achieved the greater degree of success.  In the circumstances, 
  I would grant Mr. and Mrs. To 75% of their costs in responding to the Board’s 
  appeal.</p>
