  </span> Mr. Oliver pleaded not guilty.  His trial proceeded in January 1996 
  before Ferguson J. of the Ontario Court (Gen. Div.), sitting without a jury.  
  The complainant testified and was cross-examined.  Oliver testified in his own 
  defence and while acknowledging a close relationship with the complainant, denied 
  any sexual conduct.  Oliver also called several defence witnesses, including 
  witnesses who testified to his good character.</p>

  </span> Ferguson J. observed that the outcome of the criminal proceedings turned 
  very much on the credibility of the complainant and of Oliver.  He reviewed 
  the evidence and concluded that the complainant was credible, but that Oliver 
  was not.  Ferguson J. found that over a prolonged period, Oliver “slowly groomed” 
  the complainant to participate in various sexual activities, including oral 
  sex.  He found that sexual activity occurred in the community centre where Oliver 
  worked and in his apartment.  Ferguson J. found Oliver guilty and imposed a 
  sentence of 15 months.</p>

  Mr. Zanetti, Oliver’s supervisor, wrote to Oliver and informed him that his 
  employment could not continue in light of his conviction for sexual assault.  
  In Mr. Zanetti’s view, that conviction was directly linked to Oliver’s employment 
  with Toronto.</p>

  Local 79 (CUPE), and Toronto.  The grievance arbitration started in June 1998, 
  some 2 1/2 years after the conviction.  </p>

  </span> The arbitrator was asked to decide the admissibility of Oliver’s prior 
  conviction at the outset of the arbitration.  He held that the conviction was 
  admissible as <i>prima facie</i>, but not conclusive proof that Oliver had sexually 
  assaulted the complainant during the course of Oliver’s employment.  The arbitration 
  proceeded following that ruling.  Toronto called Mr. Zanetti, but did not call 
  the complainant.  Toronto relied on the conviction of Oliver to establish that 
  he had in fact sexually assaulted the complainant during the course of his employment.  
  Counsel for CUPE called Oliver and proposed to ask him whether he had sexually 
  assaulted the complainant.  Counsel for Toronto objected, contending that Oliver 
  could not deny his guilt in the face of his criminal conviction.  The arbitrator 
  rejected this submission holding:</p>

  The arbitrator’s finding that Oliver’s conviction for sexual assault was admissible

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for CUPE submits that the arbitrator’s decision should be afforded 
  maximum deference and must stand unless found to be patently unreasonable.  
  Counsel submits that the grievance process is designed to provide for the expeditious 
  and fair resolution of labour disputes arising out of collective bargaining 
  agreements by those with expertise in that field, and that any type of judicial 
  intervention other than the most limited form of judicial review unduly interferes 
  with that process.  Counsel also contends that for the same reason, the arbitrator 
  is given a wide latitude on questions of the admissibility of evidence and the 
  weight to be given to evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In making his case for limited review, counsel characterizes the issue 
  before the arbitrator as “whether there was just or reasonable cause for the 
  discharge”.  Counsel contends that as in any arbitration, this arbitrator had 
  to resolve a variety of legal and factual issues in the course of deciding whether 
  Toronto had shown reasonable cause for Oliver’s discharge.  Those issues included 
  the admissibility and effect of Oliver’s previous criminal conviction.  Counsel 
  submits that the patently unreasonable standard applies not only to the ultimate 
  determination of whether reasonable cause was shown, but also to other decisions 
  made by the arbitrator in the course of deciding whether Toronto had established 
  reasonable cause.  He relies on <i>Toronto (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F., 
  District 15</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487, where Cory J., for the majority, said 
  at p. 505:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            A decision as to whether there is “just cause” for discipline 
      of an employee comes within the jurisdiction of an arbitration board, and 
      therefore can only be set aside if it is patently unreasonable. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cory’s J.’s words must, however, be placed in their proper context.  
  In that case, the employee had engaged in misconduct.  The sole question for 
  the Tribunal was whether his discharge was an appropriate penalty.  As Cory 
  J. observed, at p. 510:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The only question was whether the disciplinary measure of dismissal was 
      too harsh.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A review of the appropriateness of disciplinary action taken by an employer 
  is at the very core of the arbitrator’s function and fully engages the arbitrator’s 
  expertise.  Not every issue that arises in the course of a grievance arbitration 
  can be so described.  Cory J. said, at p. 506:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It has been held on several occasions that the expert skill and knowledge 
      which an arbitration board exercises in interpreting a collective agreement 
      does not usually extend to the interpretation of “outside” legislation.  
      <u>The findings of a board pertaining to the interpretation of a statute 
      or the common law are generally reviewable on a correctness standard.</u> 
      [citations omitted]  An exception to this rule may occur where the external 
      statute is intimately connected with the mandate of the tribunal and is 
      encountered frequently as a result. [Citation omitted.]  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, the arbitrator’s decision that CUPE could relitigate the 
  issue decided in the criminal trial turned on his understanding of the common 
  law rules and principles governing the relitigation of issues finally decided 
  in a previous judicial proceeding.  Far from supporting the appellant’s submission 
  that every decision made by an arbitrator in the course of a grievance arbitration 
  is due maximum deference, the judgment of Cory J. suggests that a decision like 
  the one made by this arbitrator is “generally reviewable” on a correctness standard.  
  See also <i>United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 579 
  v. Bradco Construction Ltd.</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 316 at 336.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s submission erroneously assumes that the standard of 
  review applicable to a tribunal’s ultimate decision must be applied to every 
  decision made by the tribunal in the course of arriving at its ultimate conclusion.  
  It is implicit in the decision of Cory J. in <i>Toronto (City) Board of Education 
  v. O.S.S.T.F., District 15, supra</i>, that different standards of review may 
  apply to different decisions made by a tribunal in the course of a proceeding.  
  The same point is expressly made in <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. 
  Canada (Labour Relations Board)</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 157 at 187-8, where Iacobucci 
  J., for the majority, said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            While the Board may have to be correct in an isolated interpretation 
      of external legislation, the standard of review of the decision as a whole, 
      if that decision is otherwise within its jurisdiction, will be one of patent 
      unreasonableness.  Of course, the correctness of the interpretation of the 
      external statute may affect the overall reasonableness of the decision.  
      Whether this is the case will depend on the impact of the statutory provision 
      on the outcome of the decision as a whole.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While Iacobucci J. spoke of the “isolated interpretation of external 
  legislation”, his words have equal application to a tribunal’s interpretation 
  of common law principles that do not engage the expertise of the tribunal.  
  Consequently, while it is correct to assert, as CUPE does, that the arbitrator’s 
  decision that Toronto had not established reasonable cause to fire Oliver is 
  owed maximum deference on judicial review, that does not mean that the same 
  standard of review should be applied to the arbitrator’s decision that CUPE 
  could relitigate issues decided in the criminal trial.  If that decision is 
  reviewable on a correctness standard, the court must determine whether the arbitrator 
  was correct and if he was incorrect, whether his error made his determination 
  that Toronto had not established just cause patently unreasonable:  see also 
  <i>Ontario (Attorney General) v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union</i> 
  (2000), 52 O.R. (3d) 77 (C.A.), per Moldaver J.A. concurring at p. 88.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The standard of review cannot be fixed by reference to any single isolated 
  factor, but requires a consideration of the interaction of a variety of factors.  
  Apart from constitutional limits which need not be explored here, it is for 
  the legislature to decide the basis upon which courts may review the decisions 
  of tribunals.  In deciding the appropriate standard of review, the court must 
  determine the extent to which the legislature intended that a particular decision 
  of a tribunal should be final and beyond judicial review.  The search for the 
  appropriate standard of review is a search for that sometimes elusive legislative 
  intent:  <i>Pezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers)</i>, [1994] 
  2 S.C.R. 557 at 589-90;  <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. v. Canada (Labour 
  Relations Board), supra</i>, at 178-79;  <i>Pasiechnyk v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ 
  Compensation Board)</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 890 at 904-905;  <i>Committee for the 
  Equal Treatment of Asbestos Minority Shareholders v. Ontario (Securities Commission)</i>, 
  2001 S.C.C. 37, at paras. 46-49; and D. Jones, A. DeVillars, <i>Principles of

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The methodology to be used in determining the extent to which the legislature 
  intended that courts should review tribunals’ decisions was set out in some 
  detail in <i>Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.</i>, 
  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at 765-75.  That case involved a statutory appeal from a 
  tribunal’s decision.  The same methodology has been applied to judicial review 
  of tribunal decisions: <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and 
  Immigration)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982.  In <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, at pp. 
  1003-1012, Bastarache J., for the majority, identified four categories of factors 
  that should be considered in determining the appropriate standard of review:  
</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The categories identified by Bastarache J. should not be treated as 
  airtight compartments.  Nor will the various factors necessarily send the same 
  signal as to the appropriate level of judicial review.  Bastarache J. observed, 
  at p. 1004:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [T]his court has determined that the task of statutory interpretation 
      requires a weighing of several different factors, none of which are alone 
      dispositive, and each of which provides an indication falling on a spectrum 
      of the proper level of deference to be shown to the decision in question. 
      …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I begin my consideration of the factors identified by Bastarache J. 
  with s. 48(1) of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> <i>1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 
  1, Schedule A.  That section shelters the arbitrator’s decision under a finality 
  clause which reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Every collective agreement shall provide <u>for the final and binding settlement 
      by arbitration,</u> without stoppage of work, of all differences between 
      the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration 
      or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether 
      a matter is arbitable.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The language of s. 48(1) offers support for a deferential standard of 
  review of decisions made by arbitrators.  It is not, however, a full privative 
  clause and may be usefully compared to s. 116 of the <i>Labour Relations Act 
  1995</i>.  That section applies to decisions of the Ontario Labour Relations 
  Board and specifically interdicts review of those decisions by the court.  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>116.    <u>No decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling of the 
      Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court</u>, and no order shall 
      be made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court, whether by 
      way of injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, 
      quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain the 
      Board or any of its proceedings.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The predecessors to ss. 48(1) and 116 were considered in <i>Dayco (Canada) 
  Ltd. v. CAW-Canada</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 230 at 264, 268.  LaForest J. saw both 
  provisions as manifesting the legislature’s intent that judicial review of the 
  decisions affected by those sections should be limited.  He described the predecessor 
  to s. 48(1), however, as providing a more “limited shield against judicial review 
  for decisions of an arbitrator” than that provided to decisions of the Labour 
  Relations Board by the predecessor to s. 116.  In <i>Bradco, supra</i>, at pp. 
  331-35, Sopinka J., for the court, also drew a distinction between finality 
  clauses and full privative clauses.  He described a finality clause framed in 
  terms very similar to s. 48(1) as contemplating a standard of appellate review 
  falling “somewhere between a full privative clause and a clause providing for 
  full review by way of appeal”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although s. 48(1) of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> does not manifest 
  an intention to exclude judicial review entirely, it does indicate an intention 
  that courts should not become readily involved in the review of an arbitrator’s 
  decisions.  In so doing, it is consistent with the overall purpose of the grievance 
  process.  Mandatory arbitration of grievances aims at arriving at an efficient 
  and cost-effective resolution of disputes arising out of a collective bargaining 
  agreement, while enabling the parties to that agreement to maintain an ongoing 
  working relationship.  Unfettered judicial review of grievance decisions is 
  inconsistent with those goals:  <i>Bradco, supra</i>, at p. 334.  The finality 
  clause reflects the legislature’s determination that disputes arising out of 
  collective bargaining agreements should be resolved by arbitrators and not by 
  the courts. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Standing alone, s. 48(1) of the <i>Labour Relations Act 1995</i> would 
  suggest a deferential standard of review in the case at bar.  The other factors 
  outlined in <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, however, point towards a correctness 
  standard of review.  The most important of these factors is the relative expertise 
  of the arbitrator and the courts: <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, at p. 1006.  The 
  arbitrator’s decision that the appellant could relitigate an issue finally decided 
  in the previous criminal case had nothing to do with labour law principles, 
  the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or the interpretation 
  of any labour law statute.  The arbitrator’s decision turned on his understanding 
  of the common law principles derived from judge-made law having no special application 
  in the labour law field.  While arbitrators are no doubt competent to apply 
  common law principles and must do so on a daily basis, they have no special 
  expertise in that area.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Res judicata</i> and related principles which operate to preclude 
  relitigation of decided issues are judge-made doctrines.  They reflect a balancing 
  of fairness and finality concerns, both of which are fundamental to the maintenance 
  of the rule of law and the effective administration of justice.  The development 
  and application of these principles are quintessentially judicial functions.  
  I find nothing in the applicable legislation or in the terms of this collective 
  bargaining agreement that would suggest that the legislature or the parties 
  intended that the courts, as guardians of the common law, should defer to the 
  arbitrator’s view of the common law.  The court’s relative expertise in the 
  determination and application of the principles in issue on this appeal speaks 
  strongly in favour of a correctness standard of review.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second factor favouring the correctness standard of review is the 
  nature of the problem under review.  As Bastarache J. observed in <i>Pushpanathan, 
  supra</i>, at p. 1007, this factor is “closely interrelated” with expertise.  
  Decisions that turn on questions of law alone, especially questions having broad 
  application and, therefore, significant jurisprudential value are often subject 
  to a correctness standard of review.  In <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, at p. 1012, 
  Bastarache J. put it this way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… In the usual case, however, the broader the propositions asserted, and 
      the further the implications of such decisions stray from the core expertise 
      of the tribunal, the less likelihood that deference will be shown.  Without 
      an implied or express legislative intent to the contrary as manifested in 
      the criteria above, legislatures should be assumed to have left highly generalized 
      propositions of law to courts.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span

  </span> In this case, the arbitrator had to decide whether CUPE could relitigate 
  an issue decided in Oliver’s criminal trial.  As a first step in making that 
  decision, he had to settle on the legal principles to be applied.  Once he identified 
  those principles, he then had to apply them to the facts before him.  The first 
  step in this two-step process involves a question of law alone:  <i>Canada (Director 
  of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., supra</i>, at p. 766-67.  Not 
  only is it a question of law alone, it is, as the recent decisions of this court 
  demonstrate,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a> 
  a question of general significance with implications that reach into many areas 
  of the law.  To the extent that the arbitrator was required to identify the 
  appropriate legal principles to be applied to CUPE’s claim that it could relitigate 
  the issue decided against Oliver in the criminal proceedings, the nature of 
  the problem faced by the arbitrator strongly suggests a correctness standard 
  of review.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] </span></a>  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The final factor identified in <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, offers some 
  support for a correctness standard of review on this application and is also 
  closely connected to expertise.  Courts are best suited to decide issues that 
  settle specific disputes between clearly identifiable parties.  Tribunals whose 
  decisions are not the product of an adversarial process, reflect far ranging 
  non-legal policy considerations and address the interests of the variety of 
  constituencies, are much less amenable to judicial review.  This is particularly 
  true if the tribunal’s decision rests on an expertise possessed by it and not 
  the court.  In <i>Pushpanathan, supra</i>, at p. 1009, Bastarache J. said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…While judicial procedure is premised on a bipolar opposition of parties, 
      interests, and factual discovery, some problems require the consideration 
      of numerous interests simultaneously, and the promulgation of solutions 
      which concurrently balance benefits and costs for many different parties.  
      Where an administrative structure more closely resembles this model, courts 
      will exercise restraint.  The polycentricity principle is a helpful way 
      of understanding the variety of criteria developed under the rubric of the 
      “statutory purpose”.</p>

  whether Toronto had just cause for firing Oliver.  The dispute was “bipolar” 
  and turned on a very specific inquiry.  There is nothing in the nature of the

  </span> In his reasons, O’Driscoll J. at pp. 335-36 correctly observed that 
  s. 22.1 of the <i>Evidence Act</i> applied on the arbitration.  It does not 
  appear to me that his conclusion that Oliver could not relitigate the finding 
  that he had sexually assaulted the complainant turned on his interpretation 
  of s. 22.1.  The arbitrator did not refer to s. 22.1, but relied on cases decided 
  before the enactment of s. 22.1, including <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, per Blair 
  J.A. at 20-22, per Houlden J.A. at 13-17, to find that proof of a prior conviction 
  was admissible as “strong <i>prima facie</i>” but not “conclusive” proof that 
  Oliver had sexually assaulted the complainant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator’s ruling that the prior conviction was admissible as 
  evidence that Oliver had sexually assaulted the complainant accords with s. 
  22.1(1).  His further conclusion that the prior conviction is “strong <i>prima 
  facie</i> evidence” is not quite in line with the section.  It creates a rebuttable 
  presumption of law.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the prior conviction 
  is “proof” that the person committed the crime.  If there is no evidence to 
  the contrary, the court or tribunal must conclude that the person committed 
  the crime:  <i>R. v. Proudlock</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525, per Pigeon J. at 547-49; 
  and J. Sopinka, S. Lederman, A. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>,

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator’s slight understatement of the evidentiary effect of 
  evidence of a prior conviction in the absence of any evidence to the contrary 
  is of no consequence if the arbitrator was correct in holding that CUPE could 
  challenge the conviction.  If CUPE could relitigate Oliver’s culpability, there 
  was “evidence to the contrary” before the arbitrator that was capable of rebutting 
  the legal presumption created by s. 22.1.  The correctness of the arbitrator’s 
  decision to allow CUPE to relitigate the conviction turns on the answer to the 
  public policy question described above.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> <b>(ii)</b> <b> The public policy question</b></p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>(a)  The Divisional Court’s Answer</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court came down strongly in favour of a policy which 
  would preclude relitigation in the arbitration context of issues decided in 
  the criminal courts.  O’Driscoll J. made it clear that in his view the arbitrator 
  had no business reviewing the correctness of a conviction and substituting his 
  own view for that of the criminal court.  In reaching that result, O’Driscoll 
  J. relied on <i>issue estoppel</i>, abuse of process and the doctrine prohibiting 
  collateral attack on orders of superior courts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this jurisdiction, <i>issue estoppel</i> applies only where the parties 
  to the second proceeding where <i>issue estoppel</i> is said to preclude relitigation, 
  were parties to or privies of parties to the first proceeding.  Even if it could 
  be said that CUPE was Oliver’s privy, Toronto played no role in the criminal 
  proceedings and had no relationship to the Crown:  <i>Angle v. Minister of National 
  Revenue</i> (1974), 47 D.L.R. (3d) 544 at 555 (S.C.C.);  <i>Minott, supra </i>at 
  330, 336-40 (C.A.);  <i>Danyluk, supra</i>, at 238 (C.A.).  <i>Issue estoppel</i> 
  did not foreclose CUPE’s relitigation of the finding made in the criminal proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I also do not agree that the rule against collateral attack on orders 
  of superior courts provides a free-standing basis upon which to preclude relitigation. 
   Not all collateral challenges are offensive:  <i>R. v. Consolidated Mayburn 
  Mines Ltd.</i> (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.);  <i>Braithwaite v. Nova 
  Scotia Public Service Long Term Disability Plan Trust Fund</i> (1999), 176 N.S.R. 
  (2d) 173 (C.A.); and D. Lange, <i>The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada</i>, 
  (Butterworths, 2000) at pp. 369-374.  Describing CUPE’s attempt to relitigate 
  Oliver’s culpability as a collateral attack on the order of the criminal court 
  does not assist in determining whether that relitigation should be permitted.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do agree with O’Driscoll J.’s ultimate conclusion that public policy 
  should not permit CUPE to relitigate Oliver’s guilt in the grievance arbitration.  
  I will develop my reasons for coming to that conclusion after I address the 
  arbitrator’s reasons for holding that CUPE could relitigate.</p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>(b)  The Arbitrator’s Answer</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have set out above at paragraph 12 the arbitrator’s reasons for concluding 
  that Oliver could relitigate the issue decided in the criminal proceedings.  
  For convenience, I will repeat them:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I have jurisdiction under the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, I am obliged 
      to exercise that jurisdiction, and I will confine myself to the exercise 
      of that jurisdiction.  It is not an abuse of process under the collective 
      agreement and the <i>Labour Relations Act</i> for the grievor to maintain, 
      in these proceedings, that he did not do things that he was found to have 
      done in other proceedings.  My reading of the Del Core case  is that the 
      Court accepts that it is open to any person in a situation like that of 
      the grievor to do that.  Further, the criminal trial transcript can be used 
      to challenge his credibility in that testimony.  <u>My conclusion is that 
      the law recognizes that it is open to me in these proceedings to weigh all 
      the evidence and come to a different conclusion on the facts than was arrived 
      at in some other proceedings.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator’s conclusion was driven by his interpretation of <i>Re 
  Del Core, supra</i>, and <i>Demeter v. British Pacific Life Insurance Co.</i> 
  (1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 33 (H.C.J.) aff’d. (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 266 (C.A.).  The 
  arbitrator read <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, as holding that it was open to “any 
  person in the situation of the grievor” to relitigate an issue decided against 
  that person in a criminal proceeding.  He interpreted <i>Demeter, supra,</i> 
  as limiting the abuse of process doctrine, as it applied to attempts to relitigate 
  previously decided issues, to cases in which a convicted person instituted a 
  subsequent proceeding for the purpose of challenging a finding made in the prior 
  criminal proceedings.  I think the arbitrator misread both cases.  His misreading 
  led him to an erroneously narrow view of the circumstances in which public policy 
  will preclude relitigation of previously decided issues.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The result in <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, turned on whether the Discipline 
  Committee of the College of Pharmacists had made a finding against the pharmacist 
  that was not supported by the record.  That finding was germane to the seriousness 
  of the pharmacist’s misconduct.  The majority in this court held that the Committee 
  had not fallen into that error (Finlayson J.A., Blair J.A.).  Houlden J.A., 
  in dissent, and agreeing with the Divisional Court, found that the Committee 
  had made a finding that was not supported by the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue on which <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, turned had no jurisprudential 
  significance.  However, in the course of the discipline hearing, the Committee 
  had admitted into evidence a certificate of conviction indicating that the pharmacist 
  had been convicted on three counts of fraud arising out of his work as a pharmacist.  
  These frauds were the basis for the discipline proceedings against the pharmacist.  
  The pharmacist led no evidence to challenge the convictions and the Committee 
  found that he had committed the frauds.  Section 22.1 of the <i>Evidence Act</i> 
  had not been enacted and the admissibility and effect of the evidence of the 
  prior convictions became the focal point of the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court, each member of the panel wrote reasons.  All three agreed 
  that the certificate of conviction was admissible in the discipline proceedings 
  as evidence that the pharmacist had committed the frauds alleged in the criminal 
  charges.  There was no clear consensus beyond that finding.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finlayson J.A. held that the pharmacist could not challenge the finding 
  of the criminal court in the discipline proceedings.  He said, at p. 9:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [T]o insist that the civil court or other tribunal is required to have 
      proven to its satisfaction by independent evidence that the offence did 
      in fact take place, is to relitigate the issue in a collateral proceeding.  
      This is so even where, as here, the pharmacist is not initiating the proceeding.  
      By insisting, in his defence, on having the substance of his criminal misconduct 
      retried, he is initiating a collateral attack on a final decision of a criminal 
      court of competent jurisdiction. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I understand the reasons of Finlayson J.A., he would hold that where 
  the act underlying the criminal conviction is identical to the act underlying 
  the allegation of misconduct in the discipline proceedings, the convicted person 
  cannot relitigate in the discipline proceedings the issues determined against 
  him in the criminal proceeding.  O’Driscoll J., at pp. 341-42, referred with 
  approval to the words of Finlayson J.A.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Houlden J.A. took a very different view of the law in <i>Re Del Core, 
  supra</i>.  He held that evidence of the convictions was <i>prima facie</i> 
  evidence that the pharmacist had committed the frauds, but that the pharmacist 
  was entitled in the discipline proceeding to relitigate his culpability.  Houlden 
  J.A. rejected the argument that such relitigation constituted a collateral attack 
  on the criminal convictions or an abuse of process.  He read the latter doctrine 
  as limited to cases in which a plaintiff institutes a subsequent proceeding 
  for an oblique motive.  He concluded his reasons with these words, at p. 19:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I cannot agree with Finlayson J.A. that by insisting in his defence on 
      having the substance of his misconduct retried, the respondent is initiating 
      a collateral attack on a final decision of a criminal court of competent 
      jurisdiction.  If that proposition is correct, the <i>Demeter</i> case has 
      brought about an astounding amalgamation of criminal and civil law which 
      has heretofore been unknown in Canadian law.  …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reasons of Houlden J.A. offer strong support for this arbitrator’s 
  conclusion. Houlden J.A. would apparently impose no public policy limitation 
  on a defendant’s right to relitigate the merits of a criminal conviction in 
  a subsequent proceeding in which a plaintiff relied on the conviction to establish 
  a claim against the defendant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Blair J.A., the third member of the panel, agreed with his colleagues 
  that evidence of the conviction was admissible as evidence that the pharmacist 
  had committed fraud.  After observing that since there was no evidence to the 
  contrary, it was unnecessary to decide whether the conviction was conclusive 
  proof, Blair J.A. went on to say, at p. 21:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            I agree with my brother Houlden that such evidence constitutes 
      <i>prima facie</i> and not conclusive proof of the fact of guilt in civil 
      proceedings.  The prior conviction must of course be relevant to the subsequent 
      proceedings.  Its weight and significance will depend on the circumstances 
      of each case. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If one stopped reading the reasons of Blair J.A. at this juncture, they 
  would appear to support those of Houlden J.A. and the arbitrator in this case.  
  Blair J.A. went on, however, to acknowledge that the abuse of process doctrine 
  would prohibit attempts by defendants to relitigate facts underlying previous 
  convictions in some circumstances.  He was not prepared to limit the doctrine 
  as Houlden J.A. had in his reasons.  Blair J.A. said, at p. 22:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            The right to challenge a conviction is subject to an important 
      qualification.  A convicted person cannot attempt to prove that the conviction 
      was wrong in circumstances where it would constitute an abuse of process 
      to do so [citations omitted].  Courts have rejected attempts to relitigate 
      the very issues dealt with at a criminal trial where the civil proceedings 
      were perceived to be a collateral attack on the criminal conviction.  The 
      ambit of this qualification remains to be determined in future cases.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reasons of Blair J.A. stand between the absolute positions staked 
  out by Finlayson J.A. and Houlden J.A.  Blair J.A. recognized that while evidence 
  of a prior conviction was not conclusive proof that the convicted person committed 
  the crime, there would be circumstances where policy considerations would prohibit 
  the convicted person from leading evidence to challenge that conviction.  Where 
  those considerations operated, the evidence of the conviction would stand unchallenged 
  and thereby prove that the person had committed the crime.</p>

  would offend public policy to those cases in which a plaintiff sought to relitigate 
  the validity of a conviction by instituting subsequent proceedings.  He was 
  also not prepared to attempt to provide a definitive description of the circumstances 
  in which relitigation would offend public policy.  He left that for future cases.  
  The future has arrived and with it, a plethora of such cases.  They fully vindicate

  </span> A close reading of <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, reveals that only the 
  reasons of Houlden J.A. support the position taken by the arbitrator.  Like 
  Finlayson J.A., Houlden J.A. did not speak for a majority of the court on this 
  issue.  I believe that the arbitrator erred in law in concluding that <i>Re 
  Del Core, supra</i>, decided the issue before him and opened the door to CUPE’s 
  relitigation of the issue decided against Oliver in the criminal proceeding.  
  <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, determined the admissibility of the convictions as 
  evidence in a subsequent proceeding, but provided no majority opinion as to 
  when public policy would preclude relitigation of the issues determined in the 
  criminal proceeding.  Subsequent cases have addressed that issue.  </p>

  </span> The arbitrator’s second reason for concluding that Oliver could relitigate 
  the issue decided in his criminal proceedings rested on his view of the abuse 
  of process doctrine in so far as that doctrine operates to prevent relitigation 
  of decided issues.  As indicated above, the arbitrator, like Houlden J.A. in 
  <i>Re Del Core, supra</i>, saw the doctrine as limited to those situations in 
  which a previously convicted plaintiff initiates a proceeding for the purpose 
  of challenging that conviction. </p>

  </span> It is true that the two authorities most often cited to support the 
  court’s power to prevent relitigation of decided issues in circumstances where 
  <i>res judicata</i> does not apply, are cases where a convicted person commenced 
  a civil proceeding for the purpose of attacking a finding made in a criminal 
  proceeding against that person:  <i>Demeter, supra</i>; and <i>Hunter v. Chief 
  Constable of West Midlands Police</i>, [1982] A.C. 529 (H.L.).  Both cases recognize 
  that the court’s power to prevent relitigation reaches beyond the limits of 
  the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine.  Both also recognize that the power is founded 
  on public policy and is an expression of the court’s broad power to act to protect 
  the integrity of its own process.</p>

  </span> I do not read either <i>Demeter, supra</i>, or <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable 
  of West Midlands Police, supra</i>, as limiting the court’s power to prevent 
  abuses brought about by relitigation to the specific circumstances revealed 
  by the facts of those two cases.  In <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable of West Midlands 
  Police, supra</i>, at p. 536, Lord Diplock said this in the first paragraph 
  of his reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very varied;  
      those which give rise to the instant appeal must surely be unique.  <u>It 
      would, in my view, be most unwise if this House were to use this occasion 
      to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed categories the 
      kinds of circumstances in which the court has the duty (I disavow the word 
      discretion) to exercise this salutary power.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the course of his reasons, Lord Diplock cited with approval the speech 
  of Lord Halsbury L.C. in <i>Reichel v. Magrath</i> (1889), 14 App. Cas. 665.  
  In that case the court struck a statement of defence as an abuse of process 
  holding that it was an attempt to relitigate an issue finally decided in a previous 
  action in which the defendant in the second action had been the unsuccessful 
  plaintiff.  The plaintiff in the second action was not a party to the first 
  action.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [68]<span

  </span> The contention that the abuse of process doctrine operates to prohibit 
  relitigation only in the fact situation presented in <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable 
  of the West Midlands Police, supra</i>, is contrary to the caution sounded by 
  Lord Diplock at the outset of his reasons, and to at least one of the authorities 
  relied on by him.  </p>

  </span> In <i>Demeter, supra</i>, the plaintiff (Demeter) commenced an action 
  against his insurers claiming the proceeds of his wife’s life insurance policies.  
  Demeter had been convicted of murdering his wife, and made it clear that he 
  intended to use his action against the insurers to demonstrate that he had been 
  wrongly convicted.  His motive for instituting the action played a significant 
  role in Osler J.’s finding that the action constituted an abuse of process. 
   It is not clear to me, however, that Osler J. regarded that motive as essential 
  to his conclusion that Demeter’s attempt to relitigate his murder conviction 
  constituted an abuse of process:  see <i>Demeter, supra</i>, per Osler J. at 
  p. 50.  In this court, McKinnon A.C.J.O. emphasized Demeter’s motive.  Nothing 
  in his brief reasons suggests that, apart from the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, 
  the court could not prevent relitigation of already decided issues except in 
  the specific fact situation presented in <i>Demeter, supra</i>.  To dispose 
  of the appeal before him, the Associate Chief Justice did not have to describe 
  the full reach of the court’s power to prevent relitigation of decided issues 
  and he did not purport to do so.</p>

  </span> A review of the Canadian case law reveals that the courts have prohibited 
  relitigation of decided issues in cases that are not captured by the <i>res 
  judicata</i> doctrine, and do not involve plaintiffs who have commenced subsequent 
  proceedings for some improper motive.  In these cases defendants were precluded 
  from relitigating issues decided against them in a prior proceeding.  Some of 
  the cases involve prior criminal convictions:  <i>Nigro v. Agnew-Surpass Shoe 
  Stores Ltd.</i> (1977), 18 O.R. (2d) 215 at 218 (H.C.J.) aff’d. without reference

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The terminology used in these cases to describe the power to prevent 
  relitigation has varied.  Many cases have described the purported relitigation 
  as an abuse of process.  Others have expanded the conventional <i>issue estoppel</i> 
  component of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine to encompass situations which 
  deviate to some extent from the accepted criteria for the application of <i>issue 
  estoppel</i>.  It may be that the phrase “abuse of process” is best limited 
  to describe those cases where the plaintiff has instituted litigation for some 
  improper purpose: <i>Demeter, supra</i>; <i>Foy v. Foy</i> (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 
  747 (C.A.).  It is also established in this jurisdiction that <i>res judicata</i> 
  is limited to those cases which fall squarely within the established criteria:  
  <i>Minott, supra</i>.  Concerns with terminology cannot, however, obscure the 
  recognition by the courts of a power to prevent the relitigation of decided 
  issues in circumstances which extend beyond the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine 
  and beyond cases where a plaintiff has commenced a proceeding for an improper 
  purpose.  These cases hold that where relitigation would undermine the integrity 
  of the adjudicative process, it should not be permitted.  Plaintiffs who commence 
  a proceeding for the purpose of attacking the validity of an issue finally determined 
  in a prior criminal proceeding, clearly undermine the integrity of the criminal 
  justice process.  It ignores reality, however, to pretend that only those plaintiffs 
  commit that sin.  </p>

  </span> The arbitrator erred in law by limiting the scope of the power to prohibit 
  relitigation of issues previously decided in criminal proceedings to circumstances 
  in which the convicted person initiates the subsequent proceeding for the purpose 
  of challenging a finding made in the criminal proceeding.  The arbitrator took 
  what is perhaps the clearest example of abusive relitigation and declared it 
  to be the only situation in which relitigation would offend public policy.  
  His erroneous and unduly restrictive reading of the authorities from this court 
  led the arbitrator to fail to address the crucial policy considerations which 
  had to be assessed and balanced in order to determine whether relitigation of 
  Oliver’s conviction should be allowed in the grievance proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (b)<span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When a controversy arises over a party’s right to relitigate a decided 
  issue, important principles that are at the core of the due administration of 
  justice clash.  Parties who seek to relitigate stress their “right” to a decision 
  on the merits made after they have had a full opportunity to present their case 
  before the tribunal charged with the responsibility of rendering a decision.  
  Those who resist relitigation assert their “right” to rely on the previous determination.  
  All parties insist that “justice” is achieved by the position they assert.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The adjudicative process in its various manifestations strives to do 
  justice.  By the adjudicative process, I mean the various courts and tribunals 
  to which individuals must resort to settle legal disputes.  Where the same issues 
  arise in various forums, the quality of justice delivered by the adjudicative 
  process is measured not by reference to the isolated result in each forum, but 
  by the end result produced by the various processes that address the issue.  
  By justice, I refer to procedural fairness, the achieving of the correct result 
  in individual cases and the broader perception that the process as a whole achieves 
  results which are consistent, fair and accurate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt; From the perspective of the party who seeks to relitigate, that relitigation 
    will serve to correct, at least to some extent, the failure of justice in 
    the initial proceeding.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Parties who 
    seek to relitigate will sometimes point to procedural and substantive failures 
    of justice in the first proceeding as justification for relitigation.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt;CUPE makes that claim in this case.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt;While I do not understand it to contend that Oliver suffered any procedural 
    unfairness in the criminal process, CUPE certainly argues that Ferguson J. 
    got it wrong when he believed the complainant and disbelieved Oliver.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'> 
  [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Justice, must of course, look through a much broader lens than that 
  worn by the party who seeks to relitigate.  Other interests, including those 
  of the previously successful litigant, those collaterally affected by the proposed 
  relitigation (eg. witnesses), the institutions responsible for controlling and 
  administering the adjudicative process, and the community at large, are all 
  affected when an issue that has been finally decided is relitigated.  To those 
  interests, finality is a central feature of justice and to the extent that relitigation 
  uproots finality, it invites injustice.  This is so whether the relitigation 
  occurs in the same forum as the first adjudication, or in a different forum.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In deciding whether to permit relitigation, a court or tribunal must 
  decide whether finality concerns should outweigh an individual litigant’s claim 
  that the justice of the specific case warrants relitigation.  That determination 
  is fact-specific and requires that the court or tribunal weigh these competing 
  considerations in the context of the facts of the particular case.  Not all 
  relitigation compromises finality concerns to the same extent and finality is 
  not as important in some facets of the law as in others.  Similarly, a claim 
  that the justice of the individual case requires relitigation is much stronger 
  in some situations than in others.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The finality principle and the values underlying that principle are 
  well understood and have been stressed in various contexts by this court:  <i>Tsaoussis 
  (Litigation Guardian of) v. Baetz</i> (1998), 41 O.R. 257 at 264 (C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 518;  <i>R. v. H.(E.F.)</i> 
  (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 at 101 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 
  [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 256.  Those values warrant reiteration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finality is essential to the maintenance of a fair and effective adjudicative 
  process.  The values it serves are fundamental to that process and to the community.  
  Firstly, relitigation raises the spectre of inconsistent results.  Such results 
  create a myriad of problems for those involved in the proceedings, including, 
  but not limited to those arising from attempts to enforce conflicting orders. 
   Inconsistent results are also capable of bringing the administration of justice 
  into disrepute in the eyes of reasonable and well informed members of the community.  
  In this case, the conflicting results arrived at in the criminal proceedings 
  and in the arbitration would, in my view, cause reasonable persons to wonder 
  about the rationality of the adjudicative process.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Secondly, relitigation diminishes the overall authority of the adjudicative 
  process.  What value is a result if that result can be challenged and relitigated 
  in another forum at any time?  Thirdly, relitigation breeds uncertainty.  How 
  can those drawn into the adjudicative process determine when they have reached 
  the end of that process, get on with the rest of their lives and arrange their 
  affairs in reliance on the decisions reached in that process?  Finally, relitigation 
  drains individual and institutional resources.  Neither individuals, nor the 
  community as a whole, have the resources or the lifespan required to permit 
  the continual relitigation of decided issues.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In emphasizing the importance of finality, I do not pretend that the 
  decision made in the first proceeding is always correct.  It must, of course, 
  be observed that relitigation is not a guarantee of a more accurate result.  
  The simple truth is that finality is so essential that it is routinely given 
  priority over the possibility that relitigation would achieve a more accurate 
  result. The importance of finality is best seen in those cases where finality 
  has trumped individual constitutional rights: <i>Reference re Manitoba Language 
  Rights</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721;  <i>R. v. Thomas</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 713; 
  and <i>R. v. Sarson</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 223.  In those cases, even though the 
  decision is wrong in the most important sense in that it denies someone a fundamental 
  right, the courts have held that finality precludes relitigation.  A desire 
  to avoid the harm caused by permitting relitigation is given paramountcy over 
  the rights of the individual and the accuracy of the result in the particular 
  case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As indicated above, finality concerns are given more prominence in some 
  areas of the law than others.  For example, finality carries less weight in 
  cases involving child support and custody orders than in cases involving the 
  ownership of real property.  Finality is very important in criminal cases.  
  A criminal verdict is not simply a determination of an issue as between two 
  private litigants.  The prosecution is taken on behalf of the community and 
  the verdict is the verdict of the community.  The community has a real stake 
  in that verdict.  To permit relitigation of issues decided in criminal cases 
  in subsequent private litigation is to seriously diminish the force of the criminal 
  law in the community.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator made no reference to the finality principle or the values 
  it serves.  He dismissed any concerns about the effect of relitigation on the 
  integrity of the adjudicative process by observing:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I cannot see that the grievor’s protestations of innocence before this 
      arbitration tribunal is an affront to, or serves to under the criminal justice 
      system.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This observation misses the point.  The problem was not Oliver’s protestations, 
  but the arbitrator’s willingness to relitigate a decided issue and reach an 
  inconsistent result.  Despite the arbitrator’s insistence that he was not passing 
  on the correctness of the decision made by Ferguson J., that is exactly what 
  he did.  One cannot read the arbitrator’s reasons without coming to the conclusion 
  that he was convinced that the criminal proceedings were badly flawed and that 
  Oliver was wrongly convicted.  This conclusion, reached in proceedings to which 
  the prosecution was not even a party, could only undermine the integrity of 
  the criminal justice system.  The reasonable observer would wonder how Oliver 
  could be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in one proceeding and after 
  the Court of Appeal had affirmed that finding, be found in a separate proceeding 
  not to have committed the very same assault.  That reasonable observer would 
  also not understand how Oliver could be found to be properly convicted of sexually 
  assaulting the complainant and deserving of 15 months in jail and yet also be 
  found in a separate proceeding not to have committed that sexual assault and 
  to be deserving of reinstatement in a job which would place young persons like 
  the complainant under his charge.<a href="#_ftn10"

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator took no account of other adverse effects occasioned by 
  his decision to allow CUPE to relitigate Oliver’s conviction.  He did not consider 
  the drain on institutional resources occasioned by the relitigation.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span> 
  [11] </span></a>  He did not address the uncertainty created by the relitigation.  
  If the arbitrator’s view that CUPE was entitled to relitigate Oliver's guilt 
  was to prevail, employers like Toronto would be in a difficult position when 
  an employee is convicted of a serious crime in the course of his employment.  
  If Toronto had not discharged Oliver, it would have exposed itself to potential 
  liability should Oliver re-offend, and most certainly would have exposed itself 
  to legitimate criticism from the community.  If, however, Toronto discharged 
  Oliver, it would have exposed itself to a grievance arbitration at which it 
  may or may not have been able to prove that Oliver committed the sexual assault 
  for which he was convicted.  It cannot be assumed that an employer is positioned 
  to prove that an employee committed a crime in the same way as the prosecutorial 
  authorities are able to prove that crime.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator did not consider the adverse effects of relitigation 
  on complainants.  All witnesses are potentially inconvenienced by relitigation.  
  For victims of sexual assaults, the harm can go well beyond mere inconvenience.  
  For these victims, testifying about the abuse is a difficult and traumatic experience.  
  For some, it is physically and emotionally harmful. No one is more sympathetic 
  than I to arguments that concerns for the well-being of complainants cannot 
  diminish the rights of persons against whom such serious allegations are made 
  to fully defend themselves.  Concern for the harm done to the complainant by 
  exposure to the adjudicative process must, however, take on added weight when 
  the issue is not whether the accused person should have a full opportunity to 
  challenge that allegation, but whether that person should have more than one 
  full opportunity to challenge that allegation.  I think the potential harm done 
  to complainants by the relitigation of allegations of sexual abuse where those 
  allegations have been finally determined in the criminal courts is a significant 
  consideration in determining whether relitigation of those allegations should 
  be permitted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nor is it any answer to suggest that the complainant need not testify 
  in the second proceeding.  It seems to me that unless the complainant does testify, 
  the contention that the second proceeding is more likely than the first to yield 
  an accurate result loses much of its force.  Absent the testimony of the complainant, 
  the risk of an unjust and inaccurate result is very real.  In my view, this 
  case demonstrates that danger.  The arbitrator found the complainant to be incredible 
  without the benefit of seeing or hearing the complainant.  The risk inherent 
  in credibility assessments based only on a written record are well recognized.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator also failed to recognize the dangers inherent in relitigation 
  where that relitigation includes an assessment of prior proceedings which occur 
  in a forum with which the second adjudicator is not familiar.  The arbitrator’s 
  ultimate conclusion that Oliver had not sexually assaulted the complainant was 
  based in part on two misconceptions of the rules governing admissibility of 
  evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator observed that there was no evidence that the police investigation 
  uncovered any other complainant.  Referring, with apparent approval to counsel 
  for CUPE’s submission, the arbitrator observed that “multiple victims is a common 
  feature of sex assault cases involving men and young boys”.  He accepted that 
  if there were other boys who had made allegations against Oliver, they would 
  have testified at the criminal trial.  He suggested that the absence of any 
  such evidence compelled the conclusion that no one else had complained about 
  Oliver’s conduct.  This line of reasoning ignores the strict rules of evidence 
  governing the admissibility of “similar fact” evidence in criminal proceedings.  
  The arbitrator’s inference that because no other complainants testified at the 
  criminal trial, there were no other complainants, is not one that anyone familiar 
  with the rules of criminal evidence would readily draw. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arbitrator’s second misapprehension of the criminal rules of evidence 
  is revealed by this observation:</p>
<blockquote>

  </span> Evidence that an accused person had “a sexual interest in young boys” 
  is propensity evidence of the rankest sort and would be inadmissible as part 
  of the Crown’s case in a criminal proceeding.  The arbitrator’s inference that 
  the absence of such evidence supported the conclusion that Oliver had no interest 
  in young boys and hence did not commit the acts alleged by the complainant, 
  reveals a misapprehension of the evidentiary rules governing criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In referring to these two aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling, I do not 
  suggest that he should have a perfect understanding of the rules of criminal 
  evidence.  I refer to them only to demonstrate that relitigation has its own 
  pitfalls when it comes to getting at the truth in an individual case.  Those 
  pitfalls re-enforce the value of finality.  The arbitrator did not appreciate 
  these risks when he undertook a critical analysis of the criminal proceedings 
  in the course of making his own determination of Oliver’s culpability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The dangers associated with the relitigation of decided issues were 
  fully engaged in the circumstances of this case.  Finality concerns should have 
  been in the forefront of the arbitrator’s analysis.  Instead, he did not factor 
  those concerns into his decision at all.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As important as finality is in the adjudicative process, it does not 
  always block relitigation.  Finality concerns must be tempered by a search for 
  justice in each individual case.  Sometimes, finality will yield completely 
  to the interests of an individual litigant.  For example, if subsequent to a 
  final decision, new evidence is discovered which conclusively demonstrates that 
  a finding of fact made in the first proceeding was incorrect, the justice of 
  that case could demand an opportunity to relitigate.  The integrity of the adjudicative 
  process, the rationale underlying finality, may not be served by adhering to 
  an undeniably erroneous decision.  Similarly, if an initial decision is obtained 
  by fraud or other dishonest practice, relitigation must be allowed.  In those 
  cases, relitigation restores the integrity of the adjudicative process.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The balancing of finality concerns with the individual litigant’s claim 
  to access to justice is best seen in recent <i>res judicata</i> jurisprudence.  
  This court has held that the traditional criteria set out in the <i>res judicata</i> 
  doctrine provide the starting point for an analysis of any claim that a prior 
  determination precludes relitigation.  If those criteria are met, relitigation 
  will be foreclosed in the vast majority of cases.  However, even where the criteria 
  are met, a court or tribunal may refuse in exceptional circumstances to apply 
  the doctrine and may permit relitigation where the circumstances dictate that 
  finality interests should yield to the justice of the individual case:  <i>Danyluk 
  v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., supra</i>, at paras. 62-67 (S.C.C.);  <i>Minott, 
  supra</i>;  <i>Schweneke v. Ontario, supra</i>;  <i>Ontario (Attorney General) 
  v. Bear Island Foundation et al.</i> (1999), 126 O.A.C. 385 at 392-93 (C.A.);

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Minott, supra</i>, Laskin J.A., at p. 340, put it this way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            Issue estoppel is a rule of public policy and, as a rule of 
      public policy, it seeks to balance the public interest in the finality of 
      litigation with the private interest in achieving justice between litigants.  
      Sometimes these two interests will be in conflict, or at least there will 
      be tension between them.  Judicial discretion is required to achieve practical 
      justice without undermining the principles on which issue estoppel is founded.  
      Issue estoppel should be applied flexibly where an unyielding application 
      of it would be unfair to a party who is precluded from relitigating an issue.<a

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A second feature of the <i>res judicata</i> jurisprudence is the court’s 
  willingness to preclude relitigation in circumstances which do not quite come 
  within the <i>res judicata</i> criteria, but in which the policy considerations 
  barring relitigation operate as strongly as they do in cases captured by the 
  <i>res judicata</i> doctrine:  <i>Wernikowski, supra</i>; <i>Franco v. White, 
  supra</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After thorough and careful analysis of the case law, Sharpe J.A. said 
  in <i>Franco v. White, supra</i>, at p. 413:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Current Canadian law, through the doctrines of abuse of process and the 
      application of the <i>prima facie</i> evidence standard, results in giving 
      preclusive effect to prior determinations in many situations falling outside 
      the rules of traditional <i>issue estoppel</i>.  In this regard, Canadian 
      law may be seen as paralleling the discretionary approach to offensive non-mutual 
      <i>issue estoppel</i> in American law.  <u>The effect of a prior determination 
      is not determined through an inflexible application of mechanical rules, 
      but rather on the basis of the important underlying procedural values and 
      an element of judicial discretion is applied to ensure that justice is done 
      in each case.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> Those cases which have refused to apply <i>res judicata</i> to preclude 
  relitigation even though the criteria for the application of the doctrine were 
  met, and those cases which have refused to permit relitigation even though all 
  of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine were not met, reflect the same principled 
  approach to the problem of relitigating decided issues.  The ultimate question 
  must be whether finality concerns preclude relitigation or whether the justice 
  of the individual case demands relitigation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      </span></span> If the doctrine does not apply, can the party seeking to 
      preclude relitigation demonstrate that finality concerns should be given

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  reasons set out above (<i>supra</i> para. 47), <i>issue estoppel</i>, the applicable 
  component of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine, does not foreclose relitigation 
  by CUPE of Oliver’s culpability.  While acknowledging that <i>issue estoppel</i> 
  does not apply, it is important to recognize that save for the mutuality requirement 
  of that doctrine, all of the other criteria for its application are met in this 
  case.  The decision in the criminal proceeding is a judicial decision and a 
  final decision.  Perhaps most importantly, the issue decided in the criminal 
  case is exactly the issue that had to be decided in the arbitration.  Thus, 
  while the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine does not apply, the facts of this case 
  put it at the very edge of that doctrine.<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span> [13] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Even 
  though <i>issue estoppel</i> does not apply, I am convinced that in these circumstances, 
  finality concerns must be given paramountcy over CUPE’s claim to an entitlement 
  to relitigate Oliver’s culpability.  Several factors lead me to that conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There 
  is no suggestion that the criminal proceedings were tainted by fraud or any 
  procedural failing that could cast any doubt on the fairness of the criminal 
  trial or the accuracy of the result.  Oliver had all of the procedural and constitutional 
  rights which quite properly protect those charged with a crime.  These included 
  the right to full disclosure, the right to counsel, the right to silence, the 
  presumption of innocence, and the right to make full answer and defence.  Oliver 
  also had the benefit of the heavy burden imposed on the prosecution in a criminal 
  proceeding.  Despite these protections and the onus imposed on the Crown, Oliver 
  was found beyond a reasonable doubt to have sexually assaulted the complainant.  
  That finding was upheld on appeal.  In my view, the protections afforded an 
  accused and the heavy burden of proof imposed on the Crown are relevant to both 
  the fairness of the process and the accuracy of the result.  They fully justify 
  investing a criminal conviction with a very high degree of finality when the 
  same issue arises in subsequent litigation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  fact that CUPE is not a party to the criminal proceedings is of no consequence 
  in assessing the competing values outlined above.  CUPE presented the grievance 
  on behalf of Oliver.  Its interest was the same as Oliver’s.  CUPE cannot argue 
  that the outcome of the grievance arbitration had some significance to a broader 
  constituency beyond Oliver’s personal interest.  Nor can CUPE claim that its 
  participation in the arbitration altered the essential nature of the inquiry.  
  In both the criminal proceeding and the arbitration, the question was whether 
  Oliver sexually assaulted the complainant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This 
  is also not a case in which the prior determination of guilt arose out of some 
  relatively minor prosecution in which Oliver could argue that the stakes of 
  that proceeding did not warrant his full attention.  The charge against Oliver 
  was serious and he obviously knew it was serious.  The sentence imposed at trial 
  and affirmed in this Court demonstrates that the consequences of Oliver’s conviction 
  were very serious indeed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Counsel 
  for CUPE also argued that the arbitrator had evidence before him that was not 
  adduced in the criminal proceeding.  Counsel submitted that for this reason 
  alone, the arbitrator was correct in allowing CUPE to relitigate Oliver’s culpability.  
  I would reject this argument.  To justify discounting finality, the evidence 
  heard by the arbitrator that was not produced in the criminal court must be 
  evidence that was not available at the criminal trial through the exercise of 
  due diligence.  It must also be evidence that is sufficiently cogent to significantly, 
  if not conclusively, alter the evidentiary landscape from that which existed 
  in the first proceeding.  There is nothing in this record to suggest that anything 
  that was put before the arbitrator (eg. the complainant’s letters to Mr. Zanetti) 
  was not available to counsel conducting Oliver’s criminal defence.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span> [14] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  any event, the arbitrator did not purport to justify his finding that Oliver 
  had not sexually assaulted the complainant by reference to evidence that was 
  available to him and not to the criminal court.  To the contrary, his reasons 
  consist of a detailed and microscopic critique of the evidence offered by the 
  Crown in the criminal proceedings, the arguments advanced by the Crown and some 
  of the conclusions drawn by Ferguson J.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            When I balance the evidence in this case and subject it to 
      the tests of credibility outlined in the case law above, I simply cannot 
      believe [the complainant’s] story.  I accept that this is a different finding 
      on credibility than that of the Trial Judge and because of that I have taken 
      pains to outline the evidence which I rely on.  Counsel for the Employer 
      submitted that Oliver appealed the conviction and that the Court of Appeal 
      did not think that the grievor was wrongly convicted.  Where a Trial Judge 
      makes a finding of credibility, Appeal Courts are loathe to set aside such 
      a finding.  I am not in a position where I must pay the same deference to 
      the Trial Judge’s finding of credibility. … </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As 
  I am satisfied that CUPE has not shown that any evidence placed before the arbitrator 
  could qualify as “new” evidence, I need not come to any firm conclusion as to 
  the degree of cogency required of any such “new” evidence before that evidence 
  could justify relitigation of an otherwise final criminal conviction:  <i>Wernikowski, 
  supra</i>, at p. 636.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This 
  is also not a case where even if Oliver’s conviction is given pre-emptive force, 
  there would still be a need to hear much of the same evidence in the arbitration 
  proceeding.  In cases like that, finality arguments lose some of their force 
  as preventing relitigation will do little to preserve personal and institutional 
  resources.  Here, the savings would be very real.  Had Oliver not been allowed 
  to relitigate his criminal conviction, that would have effectively ended the 
  arbitration proceedings.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"
title=""><span> [15] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Lastly, 
  I can see nothing in the arbitration process that suggests that the result arrived 
  at through that process is more likely to be accurate than the result arrived 
  at in the criminal process.  In this particular case, given that the complainant 
  did not testify in the arbitration, there is good reason to doubt the accuracy 
  of the results arrived at in the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  fact-specific approach to determinations of whether previously decided issues 
  may be relitigated creates some uncertainty.  On that approach it cannot be 
  said definitely that a prior conviction will always foreclose relitigation of 
  culpability in a subsequent proceeding.  It seems to me, however, that some 
  uncertainty is the inevitable cost where flexibility is favoured over bright 
  line rules.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Flexibility 
  does not mean, however, that each case stands alone and provides no guidance 
  for subsequent cases.  In the context of a grievance arbitration, the principles 
  establish that where a prior conviction is proved and the facts underlying the 
  conviction are the same as the facts in issue on the arbitration, the party 
  seeking to relitigate those facts must demonstrate compelling circumstances 
  which warrant overriding the strong public interests served by treating a criminal 
  conviction as a final determination of those facts.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>IV</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  the reasons set out above, the arbitrator erred in law in permitting CUPE to 
  relitigate Oliver’s culpability.  The arbitrator should have held that Oliver’s 
  conviction established that he had sexually assaulted the complainant for the 
  purposes of the arbitration.  Based on that finding, any conclusion other than 
  that Toronto had established just cause for Oliver’s dismissal would be patently 
  unreasonable.  </p>

    That difficulty does not arise here.  If the conviction was admissible, it 
    was evidence that Oliver had, over a period of time, sexually assaulted a 
    young boy.  There was no dispute that if the assaults occurred, they were

name="_ftn13" title=""><span> [13] </span></a> Professor Watson, among others, 
    favours abandonment of the mutuality requirement for the application of <i>issue 
    estoppel</i>.  See G. Watson “Duplicative Litigation:  <i>Issue Estoppel</i>, 
    Abuse of Process and the Death of Mutuality”, <i>supra</i>.  As Sharpe J.A. 
    observed in <i>Franco v. White, supra</i>, at p. 407, this court has declined 
    to follow that path.  </p>

    provided everything to the police.  There was no reason to assume that the 
    prosecution did not make disclosure of this information to the defence.</p>

name="_ftn15" title=""><span> [15] </span></a> The arbitrator appeared to accept 
    CUPE’s argument that if the conviction could not be relitigated, there would 
    be no point to the arbitration.  He also seemed to accept that this was a 
    strong argument in favour of permitting CUPE to relitigate.  Avoiding subsequent 
    proceedings where issues that have already been decided would be relitigated 
    is of course one of the primary values underlying the finality principle.
