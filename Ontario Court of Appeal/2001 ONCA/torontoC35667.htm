  </span></span> The appellant Ontario English Catholic Teacher’s Association 
  appeals from a decision of the Divisional Court dated September 29, 2000.  The 
  respondent Toronto Catholic District School Board had applied for judicial review 
  of two decisions of arbitrator William Marcotte dated March 27, 2000 and June 
  22, 2000.  The Divisional Court allowed the application for judicial review 
  and set aside the arbitration decisions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal requires consideration of the relationship between 
  the reviewing role of the courts and the decisions reached by an arbitrator.  
  The context within which this general issue arises is an arbitrator’s decisions 
  flowing from his interpretation of the terms of <i>both</i> a collective agreement 
  and a general public statute.  The principal legal issue posed by the appeal 
  is the standard of judicial review of the arbitrator’s decisions: is it correctness 
  or patent unreasonableness? </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>At the time relevant to this dispute, the teachers 
  and the school board were parties to collective agreements governed by both 
  the <i>Education Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E-2, and the <i>Labour Relations Act, 
  1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A. (“the <i>LRA</i>”).</span></p>

  </span></span> The dispute between the parties relates to the scheduling of 
  teachers’ lunch breaks in Toronto elementary schools.  Teachers are entitled 
  to a lunch break, but they are also responsible for supervising students during 
  the students’ lunch break.  The dispute centres on the school board’s schedule 
  which purported to address both the teachers’ entitlement and their responsibility.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In November 1999, the teachers filed a grievance 
  alleging that the school board was scheduling teachers’ lunch breaks in breach 
  of the collective agreements and Regulation 298.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The parties agreed that the “St. Robert Supervision Schedule 
  1999/2000” set out a factual circumstance sufficient to determine the issue.  
  That schedule set a scheduled interval between classes for the lunch break that 
  ran from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and identified individual teacher supervision 
  responsibilities.  Two different components of the lunch break/student supervision 
  schedule were challenged in the grievance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, some teachers were not given 40 <i>consecutive</i> minutes 
  for lunch.  In its reply to the grievance, the school board acknowledged that 
  this component of the schedule contravened the collective agreement.  As a result, 
  the arbitrator did not have to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the grievance raised the issue of <i>when</i> the 40 
  minute lunch breaks for teachers could be scheduled.  Under the St. Robert schedule, 
  for some teachers, at least part of their 40 minute lunch break fell outside 
  the 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. period that constituted the “scheduled interval 
  between classes for the lunch break for pupils and teachers” (Regulation 298).  
  In their grievances, the teachers took the position that the entire 40 minute 
  lunch break for every teacher must fall within the common interval for lunch, 
  i.e., between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Arbitrator Marcotte agreed with the teachers’ position.  In an 
  award dated March 27, 2000, he ruled that “each teacher’s lunch break of no 
  less than 40 minutes must occur within any scheduled interval between classes 
  for the lunch break for pupils and teachers, also to be of no less than forty 
  consecutive minutes”.  Since the “scheduled interval between classes for the 
  lunch break” at St. Robert was 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., it followed that all 
  teachers were entitled to their entire 40 consecutive minute lunch break within 
  this period.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The school board changed its schedule in May 2000.  It broadened 
  the scheduled interval for <i>teachers’</i> lunch breaks from 11:10 a.m. to 
  12:50 p.m.  The interval for students remained 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.  The 
  teachers argued that this change was an impermissible implementation of the 
  arbitrator’s award.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his second award on June 22, 2000, the arbitrator agreed with 
  the teachers.  He ruled:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he Employer’s St. Robert May, 2000 schedule is not a proper implementation 
      of the March 27, 2000 award.  A proper implementation, based on that award, 
      requires that there be a scheduled interval between classes for the lunch 
      break for pupils and teachers which begins and ends at the same time for 
      pupils and teachers. . . . While the start, end and duration of the minimum 
      forty consecutive minutes that teachers have for the lunch break may vary, 
      the pupils’ and <i>teachers’ lunch breaks must occur within the scheduled 
      interval between classes for the lunch break</i>.  <span

lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The school board brought an application for judicial review of 
  the two arbitration awards.  The Divisional Court identified two issues as being 
  raised by the application – the standard of review and whether the arbitrator’s 
  awards breached the standard.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On the first issue, the Divisional Court concluded 
  that because the arbitrator was interpreting “outside” legislation, namely Regulation 
  298 made under the <i>Education Act</i>, the standard of review was correctness.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On the second issue, the Divisional Court concluded 
  that the arbitrator’s awards were not correct. After setting out s. 3(5) of 
  Regulation 298 and article 5.02(a) of the collective agreement, the court reasoned:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Although all teachers had lunch break of the prescribed duration, the break 
      commenced for some teachers before that of the pupils and for other teachers 
      it continued after the conclusion of the break for pupils. The arbitrator 
      held that the teachers and students must have a 40 consecutive minute lunch 
      break within the same scheduled interval between classes.  The arbitrator 
      found that the schedule for teachers violated the Collective Agreement.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In order to arrive at that conclusion the arbitrator would 
      necessarily have read into Reg. 298, s. 3(5) the words “at the same time” 
      so that the section would read:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>A scheduled interval between classes for the lunch break for pupils 
          and teachers shall be “at the same time” and not less than 40 consecutive 
          minutes.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We find that the arbitrator was not correct in interpreting the Regulation 
      in this manner.  In our view, it was not necessary that the lunch breaks 
      for all students and all teachers should be concurrent.</p>

  a leading case dealing with arbitrators in Ontario called upon to interpret

  linking arbitral interpretation of a public statute or the common law and judicial 
  review on a correctness standard.  Cory J. used the word “generally” in the

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

  </span></span> Accordingly, the question in the present appeal is whether the 
  arbitrator’s awards come within the general rule or the exception.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  In my view, the decision of this court in <i>Ontario 
  English Catholic Teachers’ Assn. v. Lanark, Leeds and Grenville County Roman 
  Catholic Separate School Board</i> (1996), 164 D.L.R. (4th) 429 (<i>“Lanark”</i>) 
  answers this question conclusively – the exception applies and, accordingly, 
  the standard of review is patently unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Lanark</i>, an arbitrator determined that a teacher newly 
  hired under the collective agreement was not entitled to credit for prior teaching 
  experience because of wage freezes emanating from the <i>Social Contract Act</i>, 
  S.O. 1993, c. 5 (<i>“SCA”</i>), and two documents (a province-wide Framework 
  Agreement for the education sector and a Local Agreement between the school 
  board and the teachers).  In reaching her conclusion, the arbitrator was called 
  upon to interpret the <i>SCA</i> (the “outside” legislation) and the collective 
  agreement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On an application  for judicial review, the Divisional Court 
  held that the standard of review was correctness:  see (1996), 136 D.L.R. (4th) 
  660.  On appeal, this court engaged in an extensive review of the <i>SCA</i>, 
  the Framework Agreement and the collective agreement  and concluded that the 
  essence of the dispute was a labour relations matter.  Thus, although the arbitrator 
  was called upon to interpret “outside” legislation, namely the <i>SCA</i>, the 
  context within which that interpretation took place was a labour relations context.  
  Accordingly, the court’s conclusion, expressed by Osborne J.A., was that “the 
  same deference is owed to the arbitrator in this matter as would be owed to 
  an arbitrator hearing a grievance arbitration under the collective agreement” 
  (<i>Lanark,</i> at p. 440).</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>Lanark</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> was followed very recently by this court in <i>Essex County Roman 
  Catholic School Board v. Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association,</i> 
  [2001] O.J. 3602 (<i>“Essex”</i>), another case dealing with an arbitrator’s 
  award flowing from his interpretation of both the <i>SCA </i>and a collective 
  agreement.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Returning to <i>City of Toronto</i> and its 
  statement of the factors that give rise to the exception to the general rule 
  that an arbitrator’s interpretation of “outside” legislation is subject to judicial 
  review on a correctness standard, it seems to me that in the present case those 
  factors tell in favour of the teachers even more strongly than they did in <i>Lanark</i> 
  and in <i>Essex</i>.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Lanark</i> and in <i>Essex</i>, the “outside” statute which 
  the arbitrator was required to interpret was the <i>SCA</i>, a temporary law 
  with a transient connection to the <i>Education Act</i>, the <i>LRA</i> and 
  collective agreements between school boards and teachers.  In the present case, 
  the “outside” statute is the <i>Education Act</i> itself or, more precisely, 
  a regulation made under that statute.  There is nothing transient about the 
  <i>Education Act</i> or its longstanding relationship with the <i>LRA</i> and 
  collective agreements.  Indeed, the relationship among these three sources is, 
  and has been for years, the core of labour relations in the public education 
  sector.  Moreover, the centrepiece of dispute resolution in that longstanding 
  relationship has been grievance arbitration.  Accordingly, the interpretation 
  of Regulation 298 by the arbitrator in the present case is precisely the situation 
  envisaged by Cory J. in <i>City of Toronto</i> when he enumerated the factors 
  that might give rise to judicial deference. The arbitrator’s interpretation 
  of Regulation 298 made under the <i>Education Act</i> involved an “external 
  statute . . . intimately connected with the mandate of the tribunal and . . 
  . encountered frequently as a result” (<i>City of Toronto, supra, </i>at 506).

  </span></span> I note that in recent cases, the Supreme Court of Canada has 
  enumerated in greater detail the factors that a court should consider in determining 
  the standard of review.  The list of factors now includes the absence or presence 
  (and wording) of a privative clause, the expertise of the decision-maker, the 
  purpose of the provision in issue, and of the statute as a whole, and the nature 
  of the problem facing the decision-maker: see <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister 
  of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 (<i>“Pushpanathan”</i>), 
  and <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 
  2 S.C.R. 817.<i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have dealt with two of these factors, the expertise of the 
  decision-maker and the purpose of the provision in issue and of the statute 
  as a whole, albeit under the somewhat different formulation of these factors 
  by Cory J. in <i>City of Toronto</i>.  I will say a brief word about the other 
  two factors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is a privative clause in play in this dispute.  It is s. 
  48 of the <i>LRA</i> which requires, in subsection (1), that every collective 
  agreement “provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration” of disputes, 
  and states, in subsection (18)(a), that the arbitrator’s decision is “binding 
  . . . upon the parties”.  In my view, this formulation is virtually identical 
  to formulations which the courts have upheld in many of the leading cases:  
  for example, “final settlement” in <i>United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners 
  of America, Local 579 v. Bradco Construction Ltd.</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 316, 
  and “final and conclusive” and “binding upon the parties” in <i>R.W.D.S.U. Local 
  454 v. Canada Safeway Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1079 (<i>“Canada Safeway”</i>).  
  The privative clause is clearly intended to protect the arbitral decisions from 
  judicial review.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As to the nature of the problem facing the decision-maker, it 
  is true that it involves the interpretation of a single section of a regulation 
  made under the <i>Education Act</i>. However, the problem also involves the 
  interpretation of the collective agreement, which is clearly a matter within 
  the expertise of the arbitrator.  Moreover, in my view it is important not to 
  lose sight of what is really at stake in the issue of interpretation relating 
  to these two sources.  The subject matter of the dispute is teachers’ lunch 
  breaks, specifically whether on a small number of days each month, certain teachers 
  with student supervision duties will take their lunch break for 40 consecutive 
  minutes between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. or between 11:10 a.m. and 12:50 p.m.  
  In my view, the subject matter of teachers’ lunch breaks is essentially an employment 
  or labour relations matter and is, therefore, well-suited to the regular process 
  of grievance arbitration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For these reasons, I conclude that the Divisional Court erred 
  by ruling that the standard of review to be applied in this case was correctness.  
  It should have asked whether the arbitrator’s two awards were patently unreasonable.  
  It is to that inquiry that I now turn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is an aura of serious rebuke around the label “patently 
  unreasonable”:  see <i>Essex, supra</i>, at para. 36.  In a long line of cases 
  the Supreme Court of Canada has cautioned courts against easy resort to the 
  label in the exercise of their judicial review function.  As expressed by Cory 
  J. in <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Services Alliance of Canada</i>, 
  [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941 at 963-64:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is said that it is difficult to know what “patently unreasonable” means.  
      What is patently unreasonable to one judge may be eminently reasonable to 
      another.  Yet any test can only be defined by words, the building blocks 
      of all reasons.  <i>Obviously, the patently unreasonable test sets a high 
      standard of review</i>.  In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary “patently”, 
      an adverb, is defined as “openly, evidently, clearly”.  “Unreasonable” is 
      defined as “[n]ot having the faculty of reason, irrational. . . . Not acting 
      in accordance with reason or good sense”.  Thus, <i>based on the dictionary 
      definition of the words “patently unreasonable”, it is apparent that if 
      the decision the Board reached, acting within its jurisdiction, is not clearly 
      irrational, that is to say evidently not in accordance with reason, then 
      it cannot be said that there was a loss of jurisdiction.  This is clearly 
      a very strict test.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Can it be said that arbitrator Marcotte’s interpretation of s. 
  3(5) of Reg. 298 and article 5.02 (a) of the collective agreement, taken together, 
  were patently unreasonable?  For convenience, I set them out again:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Collective Agreement</span></i></p>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>5.02(a)</span></b><span> </span>Each teacher shall 
      have not less than 40 consecutive minutes for a lunch break in accordance 
      with Regulation 298 under the <i>Education Act</i>.</p>
    <p><b>3(5) </b><span lang=EN-US>A scheduled interval between classes for the 
      lunch break for pupils and teachers shall be not less than forty consecutive 
      minutes.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The arbitrator carefully analyzed these provisions in the context 
  of the school board’s lunch break/supervision schedule for teachers.  He noted 
  that, in compliance with Regulation 298, the school board designated 11:30 a.m. 
  to 12:30 p.m. as the “scheduled interval between classes for the lunch break”.  
  He further observed that these words were followed immediately by the words 
  “for the lunch break for pupils and teachers”; this suggested to him an intention 
  that there be a common lunch break for students <i>and</i> teachers.  The implication 
  of this conclusion was that when the arbitrator turned to article 5.02(a) of 
  the collective agreement, he was led to conclude that the “40 consecutive minutes 
  for a lunch break” would have to occur only between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, this is a reasonable interpretation of the words 
  of the two provisions.  The Divisional Court thought otherwise; it concluded 
  that the arbitrator’s interpretation impermissibly injected the words “at the 
  same time” into s. 3(5) of Regulation 298.  With great respect, I do not agree 
  with this interpretation.  In my view, the existing words of s.3(5) clearly 
  suggest a common scheduled interval for lunch breaks for students and teachers.  
  All the arbitrator did was take this interpretation of s. 3(5) and inject it 
  into article 5.02(a) of the collective agreement.  This strikes me as a reasonable 
  step, especially since article 5.02(a) contains wording – “in accordance with 
  Regulation 298 of the <i>Education Act</i>” – that expressly links it with the 
  regulation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The school board submits that there is another reason why the 
  arbitrator’s interpretation is patently unreasonable – namely, that it leads 
  to the result that there will be no teacher supervision of the students from 
  11:50 a.m. to 12:10 p.m.  This result arises in the following manner.  Teacher 
  A, who is entitled to a lunch break of 40 consecutive minutes, is assigned a 
  lunch break from 11:30 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. and <i>supervision from 12:10 – 12:30 
  p.m.</i>  Teacher B is assigned a lunch break from 11:50 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
  and <i>supervision from 11:30 – 11:50 a.m.</i>  This schedule complies with 
  the arbitrator’s interpretation.  However, it creates a problem.  There is a 
  20 minute gap between 11:50 a.m. and 12:10 p.m. when no teacher is supervising 
  the students<i>.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The school board attempted to solve the gap problem by expanding 
  the teachers’ “scheduled interval” for lunch break from 11:10 a.m. to 12:50 
  p.m.  It then scheduled teachers to supervise in three rotations – 11:10 to 
  11:50 a.m., 11:30 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. and 11:50 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.  Moreover, 
  the school board made sure that the teachers who had their lunch breaks in time 
  slots including the ‘shoulder’ (my term) periods of 11:10 – 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 
  – 12:50 p.m. did so on days when they were not teaching in class during those 
  shoulder periods.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Frankly, this strikes me as a reasonable response to the gap 
  problem.  More relevantly, it also strikes me as a possible, and reasonable, 
  interpretation of article 5.02(a) of the collective agreement and s.3(5) of 
  Regulation 298, taken together.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However – and this is the important point – <i>the school board’s 
  interpretation is just another reasonable interpretation</i>.  It is not the 
  only, or the only reasonable, interpretation.  In particular, the arbitrator’s 
  awards, supporting the teachers’ submissions, are also based on a reasonable 
  interpretation.  Indeed, the arbitrator’s interpretation is probably more attuned 
  to the actual wording of the provisions than the school board’s interpretation.  
  Accordingly, it simply cannot be said that the arbitrator’s awards are patently 
  unreasonable.</p>
