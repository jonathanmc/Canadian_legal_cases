<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On appeal from conviction by Justice John 
  F. Hamilton dated September 28, 1999. </span></h1>
<p class=MsoHeader><b>BORINS J.A.:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, Vi Phuong Tran, was convicted on a number of charges 
  arising out of a motor vehicle accident.  He submits that his conviction should 
  be set aside and a new trial ordered.  The appellant was self-represented at 
  trial.  He argues that the trial judge’s failure to provide him with any significant 
  assistance or guidance throughout the trial, and, in particular, the trial judge’s 
  failure to conduct an inquiry into the admissibility of evidence of his impairment, 
  resulted in an unfair trial.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>Overview</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the early morning hours of October 21, 1996 the appellant, who was 
  driving his motor vehicle in downtown Toronto, collided with a taxi.  A passenger 
  in the appellant’s car was killed and the driver of the taxi was seriously injured.  
  The appellant, who was also injured, was transported by ambulance to the nearby 
  St. Michael’s Hospital where he consented to providing blood samples for medical 
  reasons.  No demand was made of him to provide a blood sample under s. 254(3) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i> so that it could be analyzed to determine the concentration 
  of alcohol in his blood.  Nor was a warrant to obtain a blood sample under s. 
  256(1) of the Code obtained.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was charged with five offences: impaired driving causing 
  death contrary to s.&nbsp;255(3), impaired driving causing bodily harm contrary 
  to s. 255(2), dangerous driving causing death contrary to s. 249(4), dangerous 
  driving causing bodily harm contrary to s.&nbsp;249(3) and impaired driving 
  contrary to s. 255(1).  He was found guilty on all counts, but was convicted 
  of only the first, second and fifth offences. The two dangerous driving charges 
  were stayed under the rule in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 725, which 
  precludes multiple convictions resulting from the same <i>delict</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because the blood sample taken at the hospital was not taken pursuant 
  to a demand or a search warrant or with the consent of the appellant, the prosecution 
  was unable to rely on the presumption of the appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration 
  at the time of the offence provided by s. 258(1)(d).  When the technical requirements 
  described in s. 258(1)(c), (d) and (d.1) are met, the evidence of the results 
  of an analysis of an accused’s blood is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
  proof of the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood at the time of 
  the offence and proof, where applicable, that the concentration of alcohol in 
  the blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  Rather, 
  the Crown sought to prove the impaired driving offences by relying on the results 
  of the analysis of the blood sample performed at the hospital for medical purposes.  
  To that end, it adduced expert evidence as to the progressive absorption of 
  alcohol into the bloodstream, relating the results of the analysis back to the 
  time the offences took place.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>The trial</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To determine whether the appellant received a fair trial, it is necessary 
  to review what occurred at the trial.  As I have stated, the appellant was unrepresented 
  by counsel.  He required the assistance of a Cantonese interpreter to understand 
  the proceedings and to testify.  The only assistance which the trial judge, 
  Hamilton J., provided the appellant before the first prosecution witness testified 
  is contained in the following exchange which took place after the appellant’s 
  arraignment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  What should I plead?</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Well, you can plead guilty or ---</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  I want to know what should I plead.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Well, there are only 2 ways you can plead, you can plead guilty 
      or you can plead not guilty.  If you plead guilty there will not be a trial.  
      If he wants a trial he’ll have to plead not guilty.</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  I don’t know what I can plead to.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Pardon me?</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  I don’t understand why I am being tried.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I’ll enter a plea of not guilty for him.</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  That’s right.</p>
    <p>MS. CRAWFORD:   Your Honour, I wonder ---</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  I do notice this matter has been going on for sometime.  He’s 
      had various lawyers and he’s discharged lawyers.  It’s been ordered on with 
      or without counsel.  I notice in June of this year his second counsel wished 
      to be removed from the record.  <i>Various trial dates have been set and 
      not proceeded because of change in plea</i>.  In any event, he’s pleading 
      not guilty and we’ll have a trial.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> From the trial judge’s comments it is obvious that he was aware of the 
  background of the case which, in any event, was apparent from a number of endorsements 
  on the indictment.  There had been several court attendances by the appellant 
  so that the case could be spoken to or to set trial dates.  On two occasions 
  the appellant’s counsel was removed as counsel of record.  On June 18, 1999, 
  McRae J. fixed September 27, 1999 as the date for a seven day jury trial “with 
  or without counsel”.  Hamilton J. was aware that at one time the appellant had 
  intended to plead guilty because he was the presiding judge on June 14, 1999.  
  At that time, he removed the appellant’s second counsel from the record and 
  endorsed the indictment: “matter was to be a plea”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following the above exchange between the appellant and the trial judge, 
  the prosecution commenced its case.  The evidence presented by Ms. Crawford 
  for the Crown dealt, first, with the circumstances of the accident, and, second, 
  with the concentration of alcohol in the appellant’s blood at the time of the 
  accident.  At the conclusion of the testimony of each witness, the trial judge 
  asked the appellant whether he had any questions to ask the witness.  On each 
  occasion, the appellant said that he had no questions to ask.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One of the witnesses called by the Crown was Police Constable Andersen, 
  whom the Crown intended to qualify as an expert in accident reconstruction.  
  This prompted the following exchange.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>THE COURT:  What are you calling him for?</p>
    <p>MISS CRAWFORD:  He’s the accident reconstructionist. He has an expertise 
      in accident reconstruction and he’s going to do a diagram or give point 
      of impact, information on the point of impact, the estimated speed of the 
      vehicles, that sort of stuff.  I could qualify him.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Have you been qualified before as an expert in accident reconstruction?</p>
    <p>THE WITNESS:  Yes, Your Honour.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Testified in court on that subject?</p>
    <p>THE WITNESS:  Yes, several times.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  I’m satisfied.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge failed to explain to the appellant the purpose of expert 
  testimony or afford him an opportunity to participate in a <i>voir dire</i> 
  concerning the qualification of the witness as an expert.  Indeed, the manner 
  in which the trial judge took over the qualification inquiry of P.C. Andersen 
  – his perfunctory inquiry of the witness and his failure to permit the appellant 
  to participate – was typical of how he subsequently dealt with the qualification 
  of the expert witnesses called by the Crown to prove the appellant’s blood/alcohol 
  concentration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the trial had been scheduled for seven days with a jury, Crown 
  counsel took less than one day to present her evidence on how the accident occurred 
  and half a day to present her evidence of the appellant’s impairment.  Dr. Blundell 
  described how a blood sample was taken from the appellant for medical purposes.  
  Part of the blood sample was sent to the Wellesley Hospital for toxicology analysis, 
  while the remainder was analyzed at the St. Michael’s Hospital.  Ms.&nbsp;Dibartolomeo, 
  a health records technician, identified the appellant’s hospital records, including 
  the laboratory reports which contained the results of the toxicological analysis 
  performed on the appellant’s blood at the Wellesley Hospital.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown then called two expert witnesses.  Dr. Suria was qualified 
  as an expert in clinical biochemistry with special expertise in the testing 
  and interpretation of bodily fluid.  He testified that in relation to the presence 
  of alcohol in the appellant’s blood sample there was a serum concentration of 
  40.2 MMOL/L.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Mammoliti was qualified as a toxicologist with expertise in the 
  areas of the physical effects of alcohol and impairment.  She interpreted the 
  results of the blood analysis provided by Dr. Suria and expressed the opinion 
  that at the time of the accident the appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration 
  was between 159 and 169 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  
  In her opinion, a person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle would be impaired 
  at this concentration.  She testified that she would be basing her opinion on 
  four assumptions, including that Mr. Tran consumed no alcohol after the accident 
  and before the blood was drawn, that he consumed no large quantities of alcohol 
  just before the time of driving, and that the rate of elimination of alcohol 
  from Mr. Tran’s blood and the plateau of alcohol concentration were both normal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to the above evidence, the Crown sought to prove that two 
  search warrants were obtained by Police Constable Britton to procure the appellant’s 
  medical records at St. Michael’s Hospital relating to “blood alcohol/drug levels 
  found during [Mr. Tran’s] treatment at [the hospital] on October 21, 1996”.  
  Search warrants dated October 24, 1996 and February 10, 1999, together with 
  the informations to obtain each of them, were entered into evidence by the trial 
  judge.  However, neither information was signed or sworn by P.C. Britton.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown closed her case before noon on the second day of the trial, 
  following which the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>THE COURT:  Well, I’ll put the matter over to 2:15.  Mr. Tran, at 2:15 
      if you wish to give evidence and tell your story you can.  If you have any 
      witnesses you want to call have them here at 2:15.  If you do not want to 
      testify you don’t have to but if you are going to testify and tell me your 
      story you’re going to do that at 2:15.  I don’t want you to feel you’re 
      compelled to testify.  You need not testify if you don’t wish to.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When court resumed in the afternoon, this exchange took place:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>THE COURT:  Mr. Tran do you have any witnesses you wish to call?</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  I have witnesses but I want to speak for myself.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  All right. Do you want to testify?</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  I have all these papers.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Do you want to testify under oath or do you want to just tell 
      me from the counsel table there your submissions?</p>
    <p>THE ACCUSED:  Yep.</p>
    <p>THE COURT:  Yes what?</p>
    <p>THE INTERPRETER:  He will testify under oath.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s testimony began with the trial judge asking:  “What 
  do you wish to tell me, Mr. Tran?”  The entirety of the appellant’s testimony 
  in-chief followed questions asked by the trial judge.  He was then cross-examined.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  As I understand the appellant’s evidence, he was attempting to make 
  two points:  (1) before the accident he had consumed only one and a half bottles 
  of beer; and (2) the accident was caused by slippery road conditions produced 
  by rain, not by the manner of his driving.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the completion of his evidence, the appellant was asked by the trial 
  judge if he had any witnesses he wished to call.  He replied that he had friends 
  he wanted to call, presumably to testify about the amount of alcohol that he 
  had consumed before the accident, but that he was unable to locate them.  He 
  said that he felt his best witnesses would be the police and the doctor to whom 
  he spoke at the hospital, because they could say that he was “clear and sober” 
  when he spoke to them.  He also told the trial judge that before the trial he 
  had heard nothing about there being alcohol in his blood.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the Crown and the appellant made closing submissions, they 
  were not transcribed.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge’s reasons</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge appreciated that the central issue was whether the appellant 
  was impaired at the time of the accident.  He stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The issue is was Mr. Tran impaired.  He indicates he only had one and a 
      half beers. From the blood sampling there is a reading of 1.5 which is twice 
      the legal limit and the expert that I heard, Ms. Mammoliti, indicates that 
      type of a reading could indicate one was impaired and said that not only 
      would that impair one’s vision but judgment is impaired, muscle coordination 
      would be impaired and attention span would be impaired.</p>
    <p>From the evidence I find that Mr. Tran had more than one and a half beers 
      and even though he is small of statuture and <i>from knowing that I know 
      one and a half beers would not give a reading of 1.5.</i>  And also it’s 
      3:00 in the morning and I understand that at least from the evidence that 
      this beer was drank around midnight when he comes back to the bar <i>but 
      in any event I find that there was more than one and a half beer consumed 
      in order to give this particular reading of 1.5 and I find that the alcohol 
      had some effect on his driving.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
    <p align="center">…</p>
    <p>I accept the opinion of the toxicologist that says <i>notwithstanding her 
      opinion was based on some assumptions</i>, one being there was no alcohol 
      after the accident, no evidence there was any alcohol consumed after the 
      accident, <i>no large quantities beforehand</i>, Mr. Tran said he only had 
      a beer and a half the whole evening, and the elimination rate, she can’t 
      say what the elimination rate was, <i>there was nothing on the evidence 
      to the contrary of what Mr. Tran’s elimination rate was other than the assumption 
      it was a normal rate</i> and there is another assumption of a two hour plateau.  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=Subquote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I find he was driving dangerous in the circumstances and as well I find 
      his blood alcohol reading was over .08 and he’ll be convicted on all counts.</p>

  </span> Counsel for the appellant relied on a number of grounds why his client, 
  as an unrepresented defendant, did not receive a fair trial, including the fact 
  that his client received virtually no assistance from the trial judge and that 
  what assistance he did receive was either misleading or unhelpful. Of the several 
  grounds raised by counsel, in my view the most significant ground has to do 
  with the trial judge’s failure to conduct an inquiry into whether the evidence 
  of the appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration should have been excluded under 
  s. 24(2) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> as having been 
  obtained in violation of the appellant’s s. 8 Charter right to be secure against 
  unreasonable search or seizure.</p>

  </span> It is not an enviable task for a trial judge to conduct a criminal trial 
  where the defendant is without counsel.  Although an individual charged with 
  an indictable offence is guaranteed the right to counsel by the combined effect 
  of ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter<i> (R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.)), there will be cases where, for various reasons, the defendant 
  does not have a lawyer.  When this occurs, the trial judge’s duty is to ensure 
  that the defendant has a fair trial and to provide guidance to the defendant 
  as the circumstances of the case may require.  This duty was described by Griffiths 
  J.A. in <i>R. v. McGibbon</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. C.A.) at 347:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Consistent with the duty to ensure that the accused has a fair trial, the 
      trial judge is required within reason to provide assistance to the unrepresented 
      accused, to aid him in the proper conduct of his defence, and to guide him 
      throughout the trial in such a way that his defence is brought out with 
      its full force and effect.  How far the trial judge should go in assisting 
      the accused in such matters as the examination and cross-examination of 
      witnesses must of necessity be a matter of discretion.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
'>In <i>McGibbon</i>, the trial judge directed the Crown Attorney to have witnesses 
  subpoenaed for the defendant and advised the defendant when certain evidence

  </span> Similar expressions of the duty of a trial judge to provide appropriate 
  assistance to an unrepresented defendant to ensure the fairness of the trial 
  were expressed by this court in <i>R. v. Littlejohn and Tirabasso</i> (1978), 
  41 C.C.C. (2d) 161 (Ont. C.A.) <i>per</i> Martin J.A. at 170-72; <i>R. v. Tauber</i>

  (3d) 186 at 191.  In <i>Tauber</i>, Thorson J.A. stated at p. 71:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While it is undoubtedly true that a trial judge has a duty to see that 
      an unrepresented accused person is not denied a fair trial because he is 
      not familiar with court procedure, the duty must necessarily be circumscribed 
      by what is reasonable.  Clearly it cannot and does not extend to his providing 
      to the accused at each stage of his trial the kind of advice that counsel 
      could be expected to provide if the accused were represented by counsel.  
      If it did, the trial judge would quickly find himself in the impossible 
      position of being both advocate and impartial arbiter at one and the same 
      time.</p>

  </span> In <i>R. v. Dimmock</i> (1996), 47 C.R. (4th) 120 (B.C.C.A.), the court 
  was of the opinion that where a defendant is unrepresented, there is a heavy 
  onus on the trial judge to assist the defendant.  In that case, a new trial 
  was ordered where the trial judge had not intervened to hold a <i>voir dire</i> 
  as to the admissibility of certain evidence, or to obtain the defendant’s informed 
  waiver of the <i>voir dire</i>.  At pp. 127-28, McEachern C.J.B.C. stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mr. McKinnon emphasized that the accused was unrepresented by counsel at 
      both the pre-trial conference and at trial.  He refers to <i>R. v. Darlyn</i> 
      (1946), 88 C.C.C. 269 (B.C.C.A.), which was endorsed by this Court in <i>R. 
      v. Wheelton</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (Y.T. C.A.) at 488, and which 
      places a heavy onus on the trial judge to assist the unrepresented accused.  
      In <i>Darlyn</i>, at pp. 271&#8209;272, this Court said:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>There are two traditional common law rules which have become so firmly 
        imbedded in our judicial system that a conviction is very difficult to 
        sustain on appeal if they are not observed.  The first is, that if the 
        accused is without counsel, the Court shall extend its helping hand to 
        guide him throughout the trial in such a way that his defence, or any 
        defence the proceedings may disclose, is brought out to the jury with 
        its full force and effect.  The second is, that it is not enough that 
        the verdict in itself appears to be correct, if the course of the trial 
        has been unfair to the accused.  An accused is deemed to be innocent, 
        it is in point to emphasize, not until he is found guilty, but until he 
        is found guilty according to law.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There can be no doubt that the evidence of what the accused said to the 
      police officers could not be admitted without a <i>voir dire</i> unless 
      there was an informed waiver by the accused of the right to have voluntariness 
      tested on a <i>voir dire</i>:  <i>Park v. R.</i> (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 
      385 at 389 to 392 (S.C.C.); <i>Korponey v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>

  </span> In <i>R. v. Travers</i>, [2001] N.S.J. No. 154 (N.S.C.A.), another case 
  in which the defendant was unrepresented, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal also 
  considered the effect of the trial judge’s failure to intervene to rule on the 
  admissibility of evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless search that 
  infringed the defendant’s s. 8 Charter rights.  Oland J.A. held that the trial 
  judge should have intervened.  At paragraph 34 she stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view, the evidence at trial was more than sufficient to alert the 
      trial judge that he should raise the question of the admissibility of evidence 
      in light of possible Charter infringement. The trial judge should have conducted 
      an inquiry into whether there had been any violation of the appellant’s 
      Charter rights.  At that time, after hearing submissions from the appellant 
      and the Crown, the judge could have considered any argument by the Crown 
      based on exigent circumstances.  If he found any infringement of rights, 
      he should have then determined whether the evidence obtained pursuant to 
      it, namely the clock radio, should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>

  </span> Applying <i>R. v. Arbour</i> (1990), 4 C.R.R. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), 
  Oland J.A. was of the opinion that, even when the defendant is represented by 
  counsel, there are circumstances in which it is appropriate for a trial judge 
  to raise Charter issues.  These circumstances include when the evidence indicates 
  a possible infringement of a defendant’s Charter rights.  In <i>Arbour</i>, 
  where the defendant had counsel, this court stated at p. 372:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We are of the view that once there was admissible uncontradicted evidence 
      before the court, indicating that there had been an infringement of the 
      appellant’s rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter, it was incumbent on the 
      trial judge to enter upon an inquiry to ascertain whether such an infringement 
      had occurred.  This was not done.  Accordingly, the statement should not 
      have been admitted in evidence or, having been admitted, should not have 
      been considered as evidence in the circumstances.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Oland J.A. added at paragraph 37 that the principle stated in <i>Arbour</i>, 
  that it is incumbent on a trial judge to inquire into any possible infringement 
  of a defendant’s Charter rights, “is equally applicable, if not more so, to 
  proceedings involving a self-represented litigant who is unfamiliar with the 
  law”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have explained, following the accident a blood sample was taken 
  from the appellant for medical reasons.  Because it was not obtained pursuant 
  to a demand under s. 254(3) of the Code or a warrant under s. 256(1), the Crown 
  was not able to rely on the presumption of the appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration 
  at the time of the accident as provided by s. 258(1)(d).  Instead, the Crown 
  had to prove this fact by relying upon the blood sample that was taken for medical 
  purposes, and on the expert evidence which I have reviewed.  In addition, the 
  Crown had to execute two search warrants to obtain the appellant’s hospital 
  records, each of which had been issued in the absence of a sworn information 
  by the applicant for the search warrant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the appellant apparently gave his consent to the taking of 
  blood samples for medical purposes, there is no evidence that he consented to 
  their use for determining his blood/alcohol concentration at the time of the 
  accident.  The Supreme Court of Canada has held that a hospital patient undergoing 
  treatment for injuries sustained in an automobile accident has a reasonable 
  expectation of privacy, as well as a reasonable expectation that the results 
  of a blood analysis undertaken for medical reasons will not be shared with non-medical 
  personnel without his or her consent.  See:  <i>R. v. Pohoretsky</i>, [1987] 
  1 S.C.C. 945; <i>R. v. Dyment</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417; <i>R. v. Dersch</i>, 
  [1993] 3 S.C.R. 768; <i> R. v. Borden</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145.  Where the use 
  of the blood samples for a non-medical purpose infringes a defendant’s s. 8 
  Charter rights, the court is required to conduct a s. 24(2) analysis to determine 
  whether the evidence should be excluded.  Generally speaking, conscriptive evidence 
  – such as when a defendant is compelled to incriminate himself or herself by 
  means of the use or production of bodily samples – will be excluded.  See:  
  <i>R. v. Stillman</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are not required to decide the admissibility of the evidence of the 
  appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration at the time of the accident.  However, 
  it is clear that there was a genuine issue as to its admissibility.  Absent 
  this evidence, the Crown had no case.  That is, there was no evidence of the 
  appellant’s impairment at the time of the accident sufficient to convict him 
  of the impaired driving offences.  See:  <i>R. v. Stellato (T.)</i> (1993), 
  78 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 478.  As in <i>Dimmock, 
  Travers</i> and <i>Arbour</i>, the evidence of consumption was more than sufficient 
  to alert the trial judge that he should have raised the issue of admissibility.  
  It was incumbent upon the trial judge to have entered into an inquiry to ascertain 
  whether there had been an infringement of the appellant’s s. 8 Charter rights 
  and, if so, whether the evidence of impairment should be excluded under s. 24(2).  
  This is particularly true given that the appellant was unrepresented.  Included 
  in the trial judge’s inquiry ought to have been the admissibility of the appellant’s 
  hospital records that were obtained pursuant to two search warrants issued in 
  the absence of  sworn informations.  In failing to enter into such an inquiry, 
  the trial judge compromised the fairness of the appellant’s trial, thereby committing 
  a reversible error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the trial judge’s failure to intervene and conduct an inquiry 
  into the admissibility of the evidence of the appellant’s impairment is sufficient 
  to decide this appeal, there are several other aspects of the trial that are 
  very troubling. Although the amount of assistance which a trial judge should 
  provide an unrepresented defendant is a matter for his or her discretion, and 
  although a trial judge is not required to become the defendant’s advocate, there 
  is a minimum level of assistance that is required in order to ensure that the 
  defendant obtains a fair trial.  This minimum level of assistance was not provided 
  by the trial judge in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, unlike the trial judge in <i>McGibbon, supra</i>, who took great 
  pains to assist the unrepresented defendant, Hamilton J. did little or nothing 
  to assist the appellant in this case.  I have already referred to the questionable 
  manner in which he conducted the <i>voir dires</i> concerning the qualification 
  of expert witnesses, and to his questionable advice regarding the appellant’s 
  right to testify in his own defence.  His perfunctory comments respecting the 
  appellant’s right to testify are to be contrasted with the thorough explanation 
  given by the trial judge to the unrepresented defendant in <i>Littlejohn and 
  Tirabasso, supra</i>, who took care to ensure that the defendant was aware of 
  both his right to testify, and his right to elect not to testify.  In that case, 
  the trial judge also explained to the defendant that if he testified he would 
  be cross-examined by the Crown Attorney, and that he might be asked about his 
  criminal record if he had one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the exchange between the trial judge and the appellant at the 
  outset of the trial, which is reproduced in paragraph 5 of these reasons, should 
  have alerted the trial judge that the appellant was ignorant of the most basic 
  stage of his trial – his arraignment. This is highlighted by the fact that in 
  addition to being unrepresented, the appellant required the assistance of an 
  interpreter to participate in his trial.  It was incumbent upon the trial judge 
  to recongise that the task of conducting a fair trial for this unrepresented 
  defendant would require a significant degree of instruction and vigilance on 
  his part.  At this stage of the trial, to satisfy the minimum requirement of 
  providing assistance for the appellant, the trial judge should have explained 
  to the appellant the course which the trial was to take, beginning with his 
  arraignment, followed by the Crown Attorney calling her witnesses, his right 
  to cross-examine the witnesses and to object to irrelevant evidence, his right 
  to call witnesses and to testify, the risks inherent in testifying and not testifying, 
  and finally, the right to make closing argument.  Regrettably, throughout the 
  trial Hamilton J. appeared insensitive to the appellant’s right to a fair trial 
  and failed to fulfill his duty to ensure that the appellant received a fair 
  trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am further troubled by the trial judge’s treatment of the appellant’s 
  evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed and his explanation for his 
  manner of driving.  The trial judge neither accepted nor rejected the appellant’s 
  evidence, nor did he consider whether it raised a reasonable doubt.  Given that 
  the presumption of impairment under s. 258(1)(d) of the Code was not available 
  to the prosecution, the trial judge did not give appropriate consideration to 
  whether the appellant’s evidence that he had consumed one and a half beers raised 
  a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the toxicologist’s opinion that 
  the appellant’s blood/alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was 
  in the range of 159 to 169 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  
  This is particularly true in light of the assumptions on which she based her 
  opinion.  It appears that based on his own knowledge that “one and a half beers 
  would not give a reading of 1.5” the trial judge attached no weight to the appellant’s 
  evidence.  Yet the trial judge’s own experience in this regard was not a fact 
  of which he was entitled to take judicial notice.  The appellant’s evidence 
  of the amount of alcohol he had consumed may therefore have been capable of 
  raising a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the toxicologist’s opinion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fourth, the trial judge did not find that the appellant’s ability to 
  drive his motor vehicle at the time of the accident was impaired by alcohol.  
  He found only that “alcohol had some effect on [the appellant’s] driving” and 
  that the appellant’s “blood/alcohol reading was over .08”.  Indeed, it appears 
  from the passage from his reasons quoted in paragraph 20 of this judgment, that 
  the trial judge may have thought that the presumption of impairment under s. 
  258(1)(d) applied, which, as I have explained, it did not.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have one final concern regarding the June 14, 1999 endorsement which 
  the trial judge wrote on the indictment.  At that time the appellant’s counsel 
  was removed from the record and the trial was adjourned.  Hamilton J. wrote: 
  “matter was to be a plea”.  Although this information may be of assistance to 
  a trial co-ordinator or to the court in considering whether a defendant’s s. 
  11(b) Charter right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed, 
  ordinarily it is not information that should be placed on an indictment as it 
  may prove prejudicial to a defendant who subsequently asserts his or her right 
  to a trial.  It is also information irrelevant to whether the defendant committed 
  the offence.  In my view, the fact that a defendant once intended to plead guilty 
  and later decided to require the prosecution to prove his or her guilt beyond 
  a reasonable doubt should not be known to the trial judge or to the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>Conclusion</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For all of the above reasons, the appeal is allowed, the convictions 
  on the impaired driving charges are set aside and a new trial is ordered.  In 
  exercising its discretion as to whether to proceed with a new trial, I expect 
  that the Crown will take into account the fact that the appellant has served 
  the two year sentence imposed by the trial judge, as well as the problems surrounding 
  the admissibility of the evidence of his impairment.</p>
