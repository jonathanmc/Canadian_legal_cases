  </span></span> The appellant, Unisys Canada Inc. (“Unisys”), appeals the judgment 
  of Mr. Justice Sutherland dated December 17, 1999 in which, following a 6½-day 
  trial, he dismissed Unisys’ claim against the defendant, George H. Cancilla 
  (“Cancilla”), for allegedly inducing the breach of a sub-sublease agreement 
  dated January 27, 1992 (the “sublease”) between York Three Associates Inc. (“York 
  Three”), as sub-subtenant, and Unisys, as sub&#8209;sublandlord, in respect 
  of approximately 5,900 square feet of office space on the 10<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>floor 
  of 130 Adelaide Street West, Toronto (the “premises”).  The trial judge’s judgment 
  is reported at 39 R.P.R. (3d) 220.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The action as framed was for payment of rent and for damages 
  equal to the balance of the unexpired term of the sublease for the commercial 
  space to which I have referred above.  The trial judge awarded judgment in favour 
  of Unisys against York Three in the amount of $276,131.00, $260,000 less than 
  the amount claimed.  The trial judge deprived Unisys of the balance of its claim 
  on the ground that it failed to mitigate its damages.  The action as framed 
  against Cancilla was for the balance owing on the limited guarantee of the sublease 
  that Cancilla had signed as the President of York Three and against Cancilla 
  personally for inducing a breach of the sublease, for intentional interference 
  with contractual relations and for exercising control over and improper use 
  of the corporation York Three as a vehicle to unlawfully breach the lease.  
  The latter three claims were pleaded in an amended statement of claim.<span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Narrow";color:black'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Early in the proceedings Hoilett J. granted Unisys’ summary judgment 
  on consent against Cancilla under his limited guarantee in the amount of $100,000 
  plus interest thereon in the amount of $3,484.93 for a total of $103,484.93, 
  which sum was paid by Cancilla.  The summary judgment, however, was without 
  prejudice to Unisys’ right to proceed with the balance of its claims against 
  York Three and Cancilla. York Three did not deliver a statement of defence or 
  appear at trial.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Unisys also appeals the trial judge’s order 
  that Unisys pay Cancilla 98% of his costs assessed on a party-and-party basis 
  to and including October 25, 1998 (the date of amendment of the statement of 
  claim to allege misconduct tantamount to fraud), and on a solicitor-and-client 
  basis thereafter.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> The facts of this case are straightforward.  Cancilla is a practising 
  lawyer and was the principal shareholder and the directing mind of York Three.  
  He had incorporated the company solely for the purposes of subleasing the premises 
  in issue from Unisys and then sub-subleasing them.  He caused York Three to 
  enter into the sublease with Unisys for a period of five years and six months 
  at a base rent of $12 per square foot.  York Three in turn entered into a sub-sublease 
  with Jean Yves David, a solicitor, for almost 80% of the premises.  Cancilla 
  personally took the balance of the space from York Three under another sub-sublease. 
  At the time these arrangements were made, Unisys was well aware of Cancilla’s 
  relationship with York Three and that York Three was a shell corporation whose 
  only assets were the sub-subleases referred to above. <span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Narrow";color:black'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Unfortunately, well into the term of the sublease, David went 
  bankrupt.  Cancilla scrambled on behalf of York Three to acquire new subtenants, 
  principally from among the legal profession. However the rental market in Toronto 
  had gone into a deep slump and it was impossible for Cancilla to sub-sublease 
  the David portion of the premises at the base price of $12 per square foot, 
  much less at the increase called for in the sublease with Unisys.  Comparable 
  rents were as low as  $2 to $3 per square foot. <span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Narrow";color:black'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cancilla attempted to renegotiate the sublease with Unisys to 
  obtain lower rents that he could pass on to his prospective subtenants but Unisys 
  refused to consider any adjustments in the sublease.  Cancilla then negotiated 
  for himself a new sub-sublease for premises at 401 Bay Street in Toronto with 
  a new landlord, Markborough Properties Inc. (“Markborough”) for a base rent 
  of $7 per square foot.  The sub-sublease included a provision that the new landlord 
  would provide its new tenant with a cash allowance of $107,000. Cancilla then 
  walked away from the Unisys premises.  Lacking any cash flow, York Three was 
  unable to meet its subleasing obligations to Unisys and defaulted in its rental 
  payments thus breaching its sublease.  Cancilla was called upon to honour his 
  guarantee of a portion of the sublease and used the cash allowance from Markborough 
  to pay $100,000 towards the consent summary judgment referred to above.<span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Narrow";color:black'></span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Unisys takes the position that it had a valid sublease with York 
  Three and that it was under no obligation to renegotiate it in order to mitigate 
  its damages in the event that York Three should default.  It is correct in this.  
  The trial judge should not have penalized Unisys for its failure to mitigate.  
  The judgment against York Three should be increased by $260,000.  Cancilla concedes 
  the above but argues that mitigation is relevant for the claims asserted against 
  him other than the claim under the guarantee.  In view of the disposition that 
  I propose, it is not necessary to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> York Three is still a shell company and there is no live issue 
  about the balance owing by Cancilla on his guarantee.  Unisys’ appeal is really 
  about the claims against Cancilla for inducing a breach of the sublease, for 
  intentional interference with contractual relations and for exercising control 
  over and improper use of the corporation York Three as a vehicle to unlawfully 
  breach the lease.  The last claim has been abandoned.  In asserting the first 
  two, Unisys does not take appropriate account of the nature of the corporate 
  structure.  It talks about York Three not being able to act without Cancilla.  
  It states in its factum that Cancilla was the sole, controlling director, and 
  that it was in that capacity that he entered into the sublease and into a sub-sublease 
  with himself in his capacity as a lawyer.  According to Unisys, York Three could 
  not breach the sublease or abandon the premises without action on the part of 
  Cancilla.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Corporate entities must by their very nature operate through 
  human agency.  This aspect of the corporate structure was explained in <i>ScotiaMcLeod 
  Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd.</i> (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.) at p. 491:   
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A corporation may be liable for contracts that its directors or officers 
      have caused it to sign, or for representations those officers or directors 
      have made in its name, but this is because a corporation can only operate 
      through human agency, that is, through its so-called “directing mind”.  
      Considering that a corporation is an inanimate piece of legal machinery 
      incapable of thought or action, the court can only determine its legal liability 
      by assessing the conduct of those who caused the company to act in the way 
      that it did.  This does not mean, however, that if the actions of the directing 
      minds are found wanting, that personal liability will flow through the corporation 
      to those who caused it to act as it did.  To hold the directors of Peoples 
      personally liable, there must be some activity on their part that takes 
      them out of the role of directing minds of the corporation.  In this case, 
      there are no such allegations.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is well established that the directing minds of a corporation 
  cannot be held civilly liable for the actions of the corporations they control 
  and direct, unless it can be shown that their actions are themselves tortious 
  or exhibit a separate identity or interest from that of the corporation so as 
  to make the acts or conduct complained of those of the directing minds:  see 
  <i>Normart Management Ltd. v. West Hill Redevelopment Co.</i> (1998), 37 O.R. 
  (3d) 97 (C.A.) at 102; <i>ScotiaMcLeod Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd., supra</i> 
  at p. 491.  Therefore, a claim in tort may proceed against the directing minds 
  of corporations for acts performed in the course of their duties.  This court 
  has recently confirmed that in all events, directors, officers and employees 
  of corporations are responsible for their tortious conduct, even though that 
  conduct was directed in a <i>bona fide</i> manner to the best interests of the 
  company, provided that the evidence justifies an allegation of a personal tort:  
  see <i>ADGA Systems International Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd. </i>(1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 
  101 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused April 6, 
  2000.</p>

  </span></span> However, in the case in appeal the trial judge found that Cancilla 
  neither induced a breach of contract by York Three nor interfered with the commercial 
  relationship between York Three, as sub&#8209;subtenant and Unisys, as sub-sublandlord.  
  The trial judge also found that Cancilla “did no wrongful act” and that at all 
  times he acted in good faith. He was fully justified on the evidence in so finding.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge correctly held that Cancilla’s conduct did not 
  amount to interference with Unisys’ contractual relations or to an inducement 
  of breach of contract because the requisite elements of the tort were not proved.  
  In particular, the trial judge correctly found that Cancilla had not performed 
  any intentional act to cause York Three to breach the sublease.  York Three 
  simply lost the revenue it needed to pay rent to Unisys when one of its subtenants 
  went bankrupt and another abandoned the premises in anticipation of the termination 
  of the rent free period.  Without subtenants, York Three had no revenue.   It 
  could not, therefore, honour the sublease.  No intentional act was required 
  and none was performed.</p>

  </span></span> On the issue of costs we agree with the respondent that the appellant’s 
  conduct in making unsubstantiated allegations of fraud, misconduct, or dishonesty, 
  (or other conduct analogous to the foregoing), is sufficiently reprehensible 
  to warrant awarding solicitor-and-client costs in favour of the aggrieved party:  
  see <i>Murano v. Bank of Montreal</i> (1995), 41 C.P.C. (3d) 143 (Ont. Gen. 
  Div.) at 145-46, aff’d, (1998), 163 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 21 (Ont. C.A.).  
  Conduct of this nature is particularly blameworthy when aimed at the integrity 
  of a lawyer:  see <i>Parsons v. NRS March Real Estate Ltd.</i>, a judgment of 
  the Ontario Court General Division, delivered May 23, 1995, at para. 84.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:

lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We would not interfere with the exercise of discretion by the 
  trial judge in this case given that Unisys failed to prove its allegation that 
  Cancilla acted dishonestly when he formed and used York Three to commit unlawful 
  acts.  In the circumstances the trial judge was justified in ordering Cancilla’s 
  costs on a solicitor-and-client basis from the date the statement of claim was 
  amended to allege that Cancilla engaged in conduct tantamount to fraud (i.e. 
  from October 26, 1998) to the conclusion of the action. </p>
