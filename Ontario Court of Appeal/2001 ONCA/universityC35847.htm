  </span> The question on this appeal is whether the respondent hospital, the 
  University Health Network (“UHN”) is exempt from paying retail sales tax.  It 
  is a difficult question of statutory interpretation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> UHN is an amalgamation of the Ontario Cancer Institute, better known 
  as the Princess Margaret Hospital, (“OCI”) and The Toronto Hospital.  The Toronto 
  Hospital itself was an amalgamation of Toronto General Hospital (“TGH”) and 
  Toronto Western Hospital.  The enabling statutes of the three individual hospitals 
  – OCI, TGH and Toronto Western – each contained an express tax exemption.  These 
  statutes were repealed on amalgamation.  Neither of the two amalgamation statutes 
  contains an explicit tax exemption provision.  Each, however, contains a “continuation 
  of rights” clause providing that all rights of the amalgamating corporations 
  become the rights of the amalgamated corporation.  Relying on these clauses, 
  Rivard J. granted UHN’s application for a declaration that neither amalgamation 
  nullified the tax exemption granted to the three hospitals.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Minister of Finance appeals.  His appeal raises two questions.  
  First, is a tax exemption a “right” under the continuation of rights clauses 
  in the amalgamation statutes?  If so, second, does that right continue after 
  the repeal of the statute in which the express tax exemption was granted?  Although 
  I think it likely that the tax exemptions in issue in this case are “rights”, 
  it is unnecessary to finally decide this first question because I would answer 
  the second question “no”.  I would therefore allow the Minister’s appeal and 
  dismiss UHN’s application.</p>

  </span> In <i>Ontario Cancer Institute v. Ontario (Minister of Finance)</i> 
  (1997), 150 D.L.R. (4th) 351 (Ont. Gen. Div.), Lederman J. held that s. 29 of 
  the <i>Cancer Act</i> was broad enough to exempt OCI from paying retail sales 
  tax.  On this appeal, the Minister accepts that s.&nbsp;12 of the TGH Act and 
  s. 14 of the Toronto Western Act were also broad enough to exempt the TGH and 
  Toronto Western from paying retail sales tax.  As I will discuss, however, all 
  of these tax exemptions were repealed on the subsequent amalgamations.</p>
<h3 align=left style='text-align:left;'><span>            </span>(c)            
  <u>The Amalgamations</u></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In 1986, TGH and Toronto Western were “amalgamated and continued as 
  a corporation without share capital under the name of the Toronto Hospital” 
  by s.&nbsp;2(1) of the <i>Toronto Hospital Act, 1986</i>, S.O. 1986, c. 36.  
  Section 17 of that amalgamation statute repealed the TGH Act and the Toronto 
  Western Act.  Therefore on the 1986 amalgamation, the tax exemptions granted 
  to TGH and Toronto Western were abolished.  And they were not expressly re-enacted 
  in the amalgamation statute.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the amalgamation statute contained a continuation of rights 
  clause on which the respondent relies.  Section 4(3)(a) of  the<i> Toronto Hospital 
  Act, 1986</i> provided that the Toronto Hospital shall:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) possess all the property, rights, privileges and franchises and shall 
      be subject to all liabilities, contracts, disabilities and debts of Toronto 
      General Hospital and Toronto Western Hospital existing on the day this Act 
      comes into force[.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Effective January 1, 1998, the Toronto Hospital and OCI were “amalgamated 
  and continued as a corporation without share capital under the name of The Toronto 
  Hospital” pursuant to s.&nbsp;2(1) of the <i>Toronto Hospital Act, 1997</i>, 
  S.O. 1997, c. 45.  The amalgamated entity, The Toronto Hospital, later changed 
  its name to the respondent UHN.  Sections 15 and 16 of the amalgamation statute 
  repealed both Part II of the <i>Cancer Act</i> (including the tax exemption 
  in s. 29) and the<i> Toronto Hospital Act, 1986</i>.  The express tax exemption 
  in s. 29 of the <i> Cancer Act</i> was not re-enacted in the<i> Toronto Hospital 
  Act, 1997</i>.  However, the 1997 Act contains a continuation of rights clause.  
  Section 3(1) provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>3. (1) All rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of The Toronto Hospital 
      and The Ontario Cancer Institute become the rights, obligations, assets 
      and liabilities of the corporation and the corporation stands in the place 
      of The Toronto Hospital and The Ontario Cancer Institute for all purposes.</p>

<p>The interpretation of this provision and s. 4(3) of the 1986 amalgamation statute 
  lie at the heart of this appeal.</p>

  </span> The Minister of Finance is responsible for the administration and enforcement 
  of the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 31.  The general obligation 
  to pay retail sales tax is contained in s. 2 of the Act.  Section 2(1) requires 
  purchasers to pay an 8 per cent sales tax on tangible personal property purchased 
  for consumption or use.  Section 7 of the Act lists a series of exemptions.  
  Section 7(1)38 applies to public hospitals.  It<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a> exempts public hospitals from paying sales tax

  </span> To succeed on this appeal, UHN must show that the tax exemptions granted 
  to TGH, Toronto Western and OCI are rights under the continuation of rights 
  clauses in the amalgamation statutes, and that these rights survived the repeal 
  of the exemptions.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b><u>First Issue</u></b>:  Are  
  the tax exemptions “rights” under s. 4(3) of the Toronto Hospital Act, 1986 
  and s. 3(1) of the Toronto Hospital Act, 1997?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A tax exemption is a right.  A convenient definition of “right” is found 
  in <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 6th ed. (St. Paul, Minn.: West Publishing, 
  1990) at p. 1324:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>a power, privilege, faculty, or demand, inherent in one person and incident 
      upon another …</p>
    <p>A power, privilege, or immunity guaranteed under a constitution, statutes 
      or decisional laws, or claimed as a result of long usage … </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A tax exemption comes within this definition.  See also Locke J. in <i>Canadian 
  Pacific Railway Co. v. Winnipeg (City)</i>, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 424 at 488-89.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The more difficult question is whether a tax exemption is a “right” 
  under s. 4(3) of the 1986 amalgamation statute and 3(1) of the 1997 amalgamation 
  statute. On an amalgamation, two or more corporations “coalesce to create a 
  homogeneous whole”.  See <i>R. v. Black &amp; Decker Manufacturing Co. Limited</i> 
  (1974), 43 D.L.R. (3rd) 393 at 400 (S.C.C.).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>   Continuation of rights clauses like ss. 4(3) and 3(1) are 
  typically included on an amalgamation.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a>  Their purpose is to ensure that a wide array of rights and 
  liabilities belonging to the amalgamating corporations are transferred to the 
  amalgamated entity.   In <i>R. v. Black &amp; Decker</i> at p. 400, Dickson 
  J. explained that a continuation of rights clause operates to “spell out in 
  broad language amplification of a general principle”, that amalgamating companies 
  continue on amalgamation.  He expanded on this principle at pp. 400-401:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The effect of the statute, on a proper construction, is to have the amalgamating 
      companies continue without subtraction in the amalgamated company, with 
      all their strengths and their weaknesses, their perfections and imperfections, 
      and their sins, if sinners they be.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Minister submits that the rights and obligations in a continuation 
  of rights clause include contractual or corporate rights, like leases or employment 
  contracts, and even criminal liability, but not statutory rights, like the right 
  to a tax exemption.  What supports the Minister’s position is the broad principle 
  that tax exemptions must be expressly granted by statute.  Holding that a continuation 
  of rights clause includes the statutory right to a tax exemption may arguably 
  conflict with this principle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The contrary argument is that the Minister’s interpretation of ss. 4(3) 
  and 3(1) seems unduly narrow and inconsistent with the recognized meaning of 
  “right”. Had the legislature intended to restrict the meaning of “right” and 
  exclude the statutory right to a tax exemption, it could easily have said so.  
  Moreover, what little authority exists supports a broad interpretation of “right” 
  (or “obligation”) in a continuation of rights clause to include statutory rights 
  (or obligations).  See <i>Ebco Industries Ltd. v. Canada</i>, [2000] F.C.J. 
  No. 24 (F.C.T.D.) and <i>Smith v. Humberville Cemetery Co.</i> (1915), 33 O.L.R. 
  452 (App. Div.).  As I said earlier, it is unnecessary to decide whether the 
  tax exemptions granted to TGH, Toronto Western and OCI were rights under the 
  continuation of rights clauses in the two amalgamation statutes because even 
  if they were, these rights ended when the statutes granting them were repealed.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b><u>Second Issue</u></b>:  
  Do the tax exemptions continue after their repeal?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before the applications judge, UHN sought a declaration that the amalgamations 
  did not nullify the tax exemptions granted to TGH, Toronto Western and OCI.  
  In seeking this declaration, UHN has mischaracterized the issue.  The issue 
  is not the effect of the amalgamations, but the effect of the repeal of the 
  individual tax exemptions.  The question the court must answer is whether the 
  continuation of rights clauses preserve the tax exemptions for UHN, even though 
  the statutes expressly authorizing these exemptions were repealed on the amalgamations.

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> UHN argues that the tax exemptions continue because ss. 4(3) and 3(1) 
  of the amalgamation statutes incorporated the exemptions by reference before 
  they were repealed.  The repeal of the exemptions was irrelevant, argues UHN, 
  because by the time of repeal ss. 4(3) and 3(1) had swept the exemptions into 
  the bundle of rights continued on amalgamation.  The Minister, however, contends 
  that if the right to the tax exemptions was continued in the amalgamated entities, 
  the Toronto Hospital and UHN, by ss. 4(3) and 3(1), it would continue only until 
  the statutes explicitly authorizing these exemptions were repealed.  As those 
  statutes authorizing the exemptions were repealed on the effective dates of 
  the amalgamations, the exemptions ended on those dates.  Therefore the Minister 
  contends that UHN must pay retail sales tax.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the Minister’s position is correct.  To resolve the competing 
  positions of the parties, the court must interpret s. 4(3) and s. 3(1) of the 
  amalgamation statute.  The modern approach to statutory interpretation calls 
  on the court to interpret a provision in its total context.  The court’s interpretation 
  should comply with the legislative text, promote the legislative purpose and 
  produce a reasonable and just meaning.  In short, the court must take into account 
  all relevant indicators of legislative meaning.  See Ruth Sullivan, <i>Driedger 
  on the Construction of Statutes</i> 3rd ed<i>.</i> (Toronto:  Butterworths, 
  1994) at p. 131.  Here, three related indicators of legislative meaning support 
  the Minister’s position.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that “[w]hen 
  a repeal takes effect, the repealed legislation ceases to be law and ceases 
  to be binding or to produce legal effects.”  Sullivan, at p. 492.  Holding that 
  the tax exemptions continue after the repeal of the statutes granting them offends 
  this principle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Admittedly, there are exceptions to this principle, but none apply here.  
  For example, a statutory right will survive the repeal if the right is already 
  acquired or vested: <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, s. 14(1)(c).  
  Therefore, if OCI became entitled to a retail sales tax refund before its exemption 
  was repealed, it could still claim the refund after repeal.  The right to the 
  refund would have been an acquired right.  However, the general right to take 
  advantage of a tax exemption is not an acquired or vested right.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even if the statutory right is not an acquired right, the Legislature 
  can still provide for its survival after repeal.  The Legislature can do so 
  by a specific transitional provision.  See Sullivan, <i>supra</i>, at 526.  
  An example of a specific transitional provision is s. 52 of the <i>Succession 
  Law Reform Act 1977</i>, S.O. 1977, c. 40, which provided that a repealed law 
  would continue to apply to the wills of those who died before a specified date.  
  That section stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The enactments repealed or amended by sections 50 and 51 continue in force 
      as if unrepealed or unamended in respect of a death occurring before the 
      31st day of March, 1978.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither s. 4(3) nor s. 3(1) of the amalgamation statutes can be construed as 
  a specific transitional provision permitting the tax exemptions to survive after 
  their repeal.  Instead the basic principle applies:  after their repeal the 
  tax exemptions ceased to produce legal effects.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One further example illustrates the application of the principle in 
  this case.  Section 3 of the <i>Assessment Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. A. 31, exempts 
  all public hospitals from paying real property tax.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
  [4] </span></a>  If the Legislature were to abolish s. 3 tomorrow, one would 
  expect that Ontario public hospitals would lose their entitlement to this exemption.  
  However, to interpret s. 3(1) of the <i>Toronto Hospital Act, 1997</i> as effecting 
  the survival of all the amalgamating hospitals’ statutory rights as they existed 
  on amalgamation would produce a very different result.  Despite the repeal of 
  s. 3, UHN would continue to benefit from this statutory right.  It strains credulity 
  to think that the Legislature intended this result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second indicator of legislative meaning flows from the principle 
  of implied exclusion.  Professor Sullivan explains this principle at p. 168:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>An implied exclusion argument lies whenever there is reason to believe 
      that if the legislature had meant to include a particular thing within the 
      ambit of its legislation, it would have referred to that thing expressly.  
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In other words, legislative exclusion can be implied when an express 
  reference is expected but absent.  Tax exemptions must be expressly granted 
  by statute and therefore if they are to be granted an express reference is expected.  
  The absence of any express exemptions in the amalgamation statutes suggests 
  that the Legislature did not intend to grant them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The expectation of an express reference on which the principle of implied 
  exclusion depends may be found by considering a related statute.  See <i>Sullivan</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at p. 172.  Here a comparison of the 1986 and 1997 Toronto Hospital 
  Acts with the provisions of the <i>Sunnybrook and Women’s College Health Sciences 
  Centre Act, 1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 12, is apt.  That 1998 statute amalgamated 
  Sunnybrook Hospital and Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital and transferred all 
  the assets and liabilities of Women’s College Hospital to the amalgamated entity.  
  Sunnybrook Hospital was incorporated in 1966, S.O. 1966, c. 150.  Section 10(3) 
  of the 1966 statute exempted Sunnybrook from tax in terms similar to the exemptions 
  granted to TGH, Toronto Western and OCI.  The 1998 Sunnybrook amalgamation statute 
  contains a continuation of rights provision similar to ss. 4(3) and 3(1) of 
  the 1986 and 1997 Toronto Hospital Acts.  But the Sunnybrook amalgamation statute 
  also contains an explicit exemption from tax.  Section 21(1) states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>21. (1)  All real and personal property vested in the corporation and all 
      lands and premises leased to or occupied by the corporation shall not be 
      liable to taxation for provincial, municipal or school purposes, and shall 
      be exempt from every description of taxation so long as the same are actually 
      used and occupied for the purposes of the corporation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The inclusion of an explicit tax exemption in the Sunnybrook amalgamation 
  statute and the absence of an explicit exemption in either of the two amalgamation 
  statutes under consideration in this appeal together indicate that the Legislature 
  did not intend to continue the tax exemptions granted to TGH, Toronto Western 
  and OCI.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The applications judge took the opposite view.   He held at para. 25,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I find it difficult to believe that the Ontario Legislature specifically 
      intended to preclude the applicant from enjoying the same kind of tax benefits 
      as Sunnybrook Hospital … I find it unreasonable to draw the inference that 
      the failure to include a tax exemption provision in the 1986 and 1997 acts 
      signifies the intention by the Legislature not to grant three of Toronto’s 
      major hospital the same tax benefits available to Sunnybrook and Women’s 
      College.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the applications judge read a tax exemption into the amalgamation 
  statutes, an exemption which he recognized the Legislature had failed to provide.  
  Doing so runs contrary to Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, which has warned 
  against finding an unexpressed legislative intention in taxing provisions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This Court has consistently held that courts must therefore be cautious 
      before finding within the clear provisions of the [Income Tax] Act an unexpressed 
      legislative intention … Finding unexpressed legislative intentions under 
      the guise of purposive interpretation runs the risk of upsetting the balance 
      Parliament has attempted to strike in the Act.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='text-align:justify'>See <i>Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada</i>, [1999] 3 
  S.C.R. 622 at 643.  See also <i>Ludco Enterprises Ltd. v. Canada</i>, [2001]

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The obligation to pay taxes is an obligation created by statute, and 
  any exemption from that obligation must also be explicitly expressed by statute.  
  See <i>Toronto Transit Commission v. Ontario (Regional Assessment Commissioner, 
  Region No. 9),</i> [1994] O.J. No. 2004; and <i>University of Windsor v. Ontario 
  (Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 37</i>) (1992), 94 D.L.R. (4th) 
  328.  A tax exemption cannot be read into legislation.  For whatever reason 
  – perhaps different negotiations – the Legislature continued the tax exemption 
  in the Sunnybrook amalgamation statute but not in the Toronto Hospital amalgamation 
  statutes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Any apparent unfairness in this different treatment is diluted by considering 
  the third indicator of legislative meaning, the statutes of other Ontario public 
  hospitals.  In addition to UHN, 21 other public hospitals in Ontario have been 
  established by special act of the legislature.  None of these other hospitals 
  – including another major hospital in Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children 
  – was granted a tax exemption.  They all pay retail sales tax.  Viewed in this 
  larger context I do not consider it unreasonable to infer that the Legislature 
  intended that UHN not be exempt from paying retail sales tax.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> UHN advanced two other arguments in support of its position.  First, 
  it pointed to the statements in Ontario Hansard at the time of the amalgamations 
  in 1986 and 1997.  The applications judge also relied on these statements, which 
  pronounced that the amalgamations would provide better patient care, significant 
  savings and a more efficient use of resources.  The applications judge considered 
  these general pronouncements at odds with an interpretation of the amalgamation 
  statutes that would deprive UHN of the tax exemptions.  I do not think that 
  these pronouncements in Ontario Hansard assist in interpreting the continuation 
  of rights clauses.  Greater efficiency and cost savings are the intended results 
  of any amalgamation.  The statements in the Legislature say nothing about whether 
  the tax exemptions were to continue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> UHN’s other argument focuses on the express list of powers granted to 
  the Toronto Hospital in the 1986 amalgamation statute and the absence of such 
  a list in the 1997 amalgamation statute. UHN submits that the Legislature must 
  have intended the continuation of rights clause – s. 3(1) of the <i>Toronto 
  Hospital Act, 1997</i> – to incorporate the list of powers from the 1986 statute.  
  Otherwise, UHN would have few powers to administer the hospital.  And if s. 
  3(1) incorporated the list of powers, it must also have incorporated the tax 
  exemption in s. 29 of the <i>Cancer Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This submission, however, ignores s. 23 of the <i>Corporations Act</i>, 
  which applies to all incorporated public hospitals in Ontario and which grants 
  broad powers to these hospitals.  A specific list of powers was not needed in 
  the 1997 amalgamation statute.  Moreover, one of the listed powers in the 1986 
  amalgamation statute – the hospital’s power to invest its funds in securities 
  authorized by by-law – was re-enacted in the 1997 amalgamation statute.  This 
  re-enactment would have been unnecessary if the continuation of rights clause 
  had the effect UHN claims it has.  For all these reasons I conclude that UHN 
  is not exempt from paying retail sales tax.</p>

  </span> I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of Rivard J. and dismiss 
  UHN’s application.  The Minister is entitled to his costs of the application 
  and the appeal.  The Minister also sought declaratory relief, but as he did 
  not bring a cross-application he is not entitled to such relief.</p>
