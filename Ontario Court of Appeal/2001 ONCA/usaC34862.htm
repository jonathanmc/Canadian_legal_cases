  </span></span> These appeals arise from extradition proceedings on charges relating 
  to an allegedly fraudulent loan scheme.  The appellant was arrested for extradition 
  in August 1997.  An extradition hearing was held and on October 21, 1997, a 
  warrant of committal was issued.  That committal order was set aside on appeal 
  by this court on May 17, 1999 and a new hearing was ordered.  Prior to the hearing 
  of the appeal, in October 1998, a new indictment was returned against the appellant 
  in the United States.  This “superseding” indictment altered the number of co-defendants 
  and narrowed the scope of the charges against the appellant.  After the order 
  of this court directing a new hearing, the new <i>Extradition A</i>ct came into 
  force in June 1999.</p>

  </span></span> In October 1999, prior to the second extradition hearing, the 
  appellant brought a <i>habeas corpus</i> application before Laforme J.  The 
  appellant argued that the superseding indictment created a new set of charges 
  and that under the Treaty with the United States and the <i>Extradition Act</i>, 
  new documents had to be filed to recommence the extradition proceedings.  Laforme 
  J. dismissed the <i>habeas corpus</i> application, ruling that the appellant’s 
  detention was valid and that the appellant’s argument should be presented at 
  the extradition hearing.</p>

  </span></span> In December 1999, the appellant filed a further <i>habeas corpus</i> 
  application on the ground that the Minister had not issued an authority to proceed 
  pursuant to s. 15 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  Ewaschuk J. dismissed that 
  application, ruling that the appellant’s detention was valid pursuant to the 
  original arrest warrant issued under the old Act.  </p>

  did not proceed as Lederman J. ruled that the Minister was required to file 
  an authority to proceed.  The authority to proceed was filed and the hearing 
  was adjourned to June 2000<b>.</b>  After the hearing, Lederman J. ruled that 
  the respondents had satisfied the relevant legal and factual requirements.  
  He dismissed the appellant’s abuse of process application pursuant to s. 7 of 
  the <i>Charter</i> and the appellant’s motion concerning alleged non-compliance 
  with the Treaty, and ordered the appellant committed into custody for surrender 
  for extradition.</p>

  to s. 43 of the <i>Extradition Act.</i>  By letter dated December 1, 2000, the 
  Minister provided detailed reasons for her decision to order the appellant’s 
  surrender to the United States.  The appellant then moved before Grossi J. for 
  an order of release pursuant to s. 69 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> on the ground 
  that the Minister had not made her order in a timely fashion in compliance with 
  s. 40 of the <i>Extradition A</i>ct.  Grossi J. dismissed that application.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB>Analysis</span></u></b></p>
<h4>Issue 1      Is the appellant entitled to an order releasing him pursuant 
  to s. 69 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> on the ground that the Minister failed 
  to comply with the time limits prescribed by s. 40 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>?</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The <i>Extradition Act,</i> s. 40 provides that the Minister 
  may, within a period of 90 days after the date of a person’s committal to await 
  surrender, order that the person be surrendered to the extradition partner.  
  Under s. 40(5), the Minister may extend this period by one additional period 
  that does not exceed 60 days.  The Minister did extend the period for the order 
  to December 2, 2000.  On the appellant’s s. 69 application for release, Grossi 
  J. found that the appellant did not receive until December 8, 2000, the Minister’s 
  letter dated December 1, 2000, stating that an order for his surrender had been 
  made and that no formal order for the appellant’s surrender had been supplied 
  to the appellant or his jailer up to the time the application was heard.  However, 
  Grossi J. also found that the Minister in fact had made an order for the appellant’s 
  surrender on December 1, 2000 on the basis of the Minister’s statement to that 
  effect in her letter.  Grossi J. ruled that the Minister was not required to 
  deliver the order to the jailer on or before December 2, 2000 and dismissed 
  the application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant submits that as the liberty of 
  the subject is at stake, strict compliance with the time limits prescribed by 
  the <i>Extradition Act</i> is required and further, that the Minister does not 
  “make” the order for surrender until the formal order is delivered to the jailer.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the appellant has failed to establish a basis for 
  us to interfere with Grossi J.’s dismissal of the s. 69 application.  Even if 
  we were to accept the appellant’s submission that the order is only “made” when 
  delivered to the jailer (a point we find unnecessary to decide), we are satisfied 
  that “sufficient cause is shown against the discharge” within the meaning of 
  s. 69.  At the time the Minister considered the appellant’s submission and made 
  her decision for his surrender to the United States, the appellant had appealed 
  the order of Lederman J. committing him for surrender.  Pursuant to the <i>Extradition 
  Act</i>, the appellant could not be surrendered until he either abandoned his 
  appeal or the appeal was finally decided.  It follows that while the Minister’s 
  order is a necessary step in the extradition process, the timing of that order 
  had no practical effect in this case at the time of the s. 69 application, because 
  of the outstanding appeal.  The legal basis for the appellant’s detention was 
  Lederman J.’s committal order which, under the Act, continued to provide legal 
  justification for his detention so long as his appeal from that order was outstanding.  
  As Grossi J. stated, the Minister could not require the appellant to be surrendered 
  in violation of the <i>Extradition Act. </i> It follows that even if the Minister’s 
  order for surrender should have been in the hands of the jailer on or before 
  December 2, 2000, failure to comply with this alleged requirement does not vitiate 
  the legality of the appellant’s detention or provide a basis in law for ordering 
  his release under s. 69.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal from 
  the order of Grossi J. dismissing the s. 69 application.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>Issue 2      Did the superseding indictment require 
  the authorities to file additional materials or take additional proceedings 
  to validate the extradition?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We do not accept the submission that the superseding indictment 
  had the effect of invalidating the ongoing extradition proceedings or requiring 
  the respondents to file any additional materials.  As we have already noted, 
  the new indictment narrowed the scope of the charges against the appellant.  
  It did not add any new allegations against him.  There is nothing in the <i>Extradition 
  Act</i> or in the Treaty with the United States that requires the requesting 
  State to file the formal indictment as part of the extradition record.  Nor 
  does the foreign indictment provide the basis for the proceedings before the 
  extradition judge, where the question is whether there is <i>prima facie</i> 
  admissible evidence of allegations that would constitute a criminal offence 
  if committed within Canada.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Article 9 of the Treaty does require the United States to provide 
  a copy of the warrant of arrest when making its request for extradition.  However, 
  we do not agree with the submission that the respondents were required to file 
  a fresh warrant of arrest after the superseding indictment had been issued.  
  Article 9 of the Treaty relates to the originating request for extradition that 
  is made through diplomatic channels.  The respondents complied with its terms 
  at the time these proceedings were initiated.  We do not agree that in the circumstances 
  of this case Article 9 creates an ongoing obligation to file fresh materials 
  as the proceedings unfold.  Accordingly, even if, as the appellant submits, 
  the original warrant of arrest was no longer valid when the superseding indictment 
  was issued, it was valid both at the time the original request for extradition 
  was made through diplomatic channels and at the time the appellant was arrested.  
  In our view, that satisfied the requirements of Article 9.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, we reject the appellant’s submission 
  that the respondents were required to file a fresh warrant of arrest or the 
  superceding indictment to maintain these proceedings for his extradition. </span></p>
<p><b>Issue 3      Did the respondents fail to comply with the requirements of 
  the <i>Extradition Act</i> relating to the need for an authority to proceed?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, jurisdiction was not lost on account of the Minister’s 
  alleged failure to provide an authority to proceed in the manner and within 
  the times prescribed by ss. 14 and 15 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  These 
  extradition proceedings were initiated long before the new <i>Extradition Act 
  </i>came into force.  Because the proceedings were commenced under the scheme 
  of the prior legislation, it was not possible for the Minister to comply with 
  the requirements of s. 14 which are keyed to the provisions of the new Act.  
  The appellant was not arrested pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant under 
  s. 13 of the Act and accordingly the time limits prescribed by s. 14 that relate 
  to “a person who has been provisionally arrested” have no meaningful application 
  to this case.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In <i>U.S.A. v. </i>Cobb (2001), 152 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 270, the Supreme Court of Canada referred to <i>R. v. Keyowski</i> (1988), 
  40 C.C.C (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) as setting out the authority for the nature of the 
  remedy fashioned by the courts in the case of abuse of process, and the circumstances 
  when recourse to it is appropriate:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The availability of a stay of proceedings to remedy an abuse of process 
      was confirmed by this court in <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128.  
      On that occasion the Court stated that the test for abuse of process was 
      that initially formulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Young</i> 
      (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289.  A stay should be granted where &quot;compelling 
      an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of 
      justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency&quot;, 
      or where the proceedings are &quot;oppressive or vexatious&quot; ([1985] 
      2 S.C.R. at pp. 136-7).  The court in <i>Jewitt</i> also adopted &quot;the 
      caveat added by the Court in <i>Young</i> that this is a power which can 
      be exercised only in the 'clearest of cases' &quot; (p. 137). </p>

  </span></span> We are not persuaded that there is any basis for us to interfere 
  with the findings of Lederman J. relating to abuse of process.  After considering 
  the documentary evidence and hearing the appellant’s evidence, he concluded 
  that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the drastic remedy of a stay of 
  proceedings.  As Lederman J. observed, the appellant can raise some of these 
  matters by way of defence in the American proceedings.  Lederman J. applied 
  the correct legal test for committal and the appellant has failed to demonstrate 
  any error that would justify this court’s intervention.</p>

  (3d) 447, this court at p. 110 described the standard of review of the Minister’s

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span

      acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or for improper motives, or if the Minister’s

  </span></span> In our view, that standard of review has not been met in the 
  present case.  We have already disposed of most, if not all of the legal points 
  that are also relied on in the judicial review application.  The Minister provided
