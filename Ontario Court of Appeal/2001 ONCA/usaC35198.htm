<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the extradition order of Justice P. Dilks 
  dated September 25, 2000</span></b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant is charged with a number of offences, including 
  attempted murder, in the United States.  Following an extradition hearing, Dilks 
  J. ordered that he be committed for surrender to the United States.  The appellant 
  submits that he should not have been committed because the material placed before 
  the extradition judge was inadmissible.  The primary basis for this submission 
  is that certain provisions of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c.&nbsp;18, 
  which govern the admissibility of evidence at the extradition hearing, are unconstitutional.  
  The appellant argues that these provisions require the extradition judge to 
  admit unreliable, unsworn evidence and that this violates the guarantee to fundamental 
  justice in s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no question that s. 7 applies to the judicial phase 
  of the extradition process.  As Arbour J. said most recently in <i>United States 
  of America v. Cobb</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (S.C.C.) at 284, “although 
  the committal hearing is not a trial, it must conform with the principles of 
  procedural fairness that govern all judicial proceedings in this country, particularly 
  those where a liberty or security interest is at stake”.  The issue presented 
  by this case is whether, in the context of an extradition hearing, the principles 
  of procedural fairness demand that the evidence meet some minimal standard of 
  reliability before it can be used to deprive the person sought for extradition 
  of his or her liberty.  In the particular circumstances of this case, the question 
  is whether these principles of procedural fairness require that the hearing 
  be based upon affidavits sworn to by witnesses with first-hand knowledge of 
  the events.  The appellant also attacks the sufficiency of the evidence submitted, 
  on the basis that, in any event, it does not conform to the statutory requirements.  
  For the reasons that follow, I would uphold the constitutionality of the impugned 
  provisions and dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE STATUTORY SCHEME</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before turning to the facts of this case, it will be helpful 
  to set out the statutory scheme relating to the judicial committal phase of 
  the extradition process.  Since the appellant has not yet been tried by the 
  extradition partner, the only provisions of concern relate to a person sought 
  for prosecution.  Section 29(1)(a) sets out the extradition judge’s function:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>29. (1) A judge shall order the committal of the person into custody 
      to await surrender if</span></p>
    <p>(a) in the case of a person sought for prosecution, <u>there is evidence 
      admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, would 
      justify committal for trial in Canada</u> on the offence set out in the 
      <u>authority to proceed</u> and the judge is satisfied that the person is 
      the person sought by the extradition partner.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The “authority to proceed” referred to in s. 
  29(1)(a) is defined by s. 15:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>15. (1) The Minister may, after receiving a request for extradition 
      and being satisfied that the conditions set out in paragraph 3(1)(a) and 
      subsection 3(3) are met in respect of one or more offences mentioned in 
      the request, issue an authority to proceed that authorizes the Attorney 
      General to seek, on behalf of the extradition partner, an order of a court 
      for the committal of the person under section 29.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(3) The authority to proceed must contain</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a) the name or description of the person whose extradition is sought; 
      </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b) the name of the extradition partner; and</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(c) the name of the offence or offences under Canadian law that correspond 
      to the alleged conduct of the person or the conduct in respect of which 
      the person was convicted, as long as one of the offences would be punishable 
      in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(b).</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The combined effect of ss. 15 and 29 is to implement the double 
  criminality requirement.  The authority to proceed sets out the Canadian offence 
  that is equivalent to the offence allegedly committed in the extradition partner 
  state.  The extradition judge is therefore not concerned with foreign law.  
  He or she merely determines whether there is evidence of conduct that would 
  amount to the Canadian offence described in the authority to proceed.  The evidence 
  must be sufficient as would justify an accused’s committal for trial if the 
  offence were alleged to have been committed in Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The provisions attacked in this proceeding are contained in ss. 
  32, 33 and 34.  Section 32 sets out the types of evidence admissible at the 
  extradition hearing:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>32. (1) Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would otherwise be 
      admissible under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an extradition 
      hearing. <u>The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if it 
      would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law</u>:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a) <u>the contents of the documents contained in the record of the 
      case certified under subsection 33(3)</u>; </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b) the contents of the documents that are submitted in conformity 
      with the terms of an extradition agreement; and</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(c) <u>evidence adduced by the person sought for extradition that is 
      relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the judge considers 
      it reliable</u>.</span></p>
    <p><span> </span>(2) Evidence gathered in Canada must satisfy the rules of 
      evidence under Canadian law in order to be admitted.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, s.&nbsp;32 contemplates that evidence that would 
  not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law is admissible at the extradition 
  hearing and can be used to make out the case for committal under s.&nbsp;29.  
  This evidence can fall into three categories.  If the evidence is adduced by 
  the person sought for extradition it can be admitted if it is relevant and the 
  judge considers it reliable even if it would not be admissible under Canadian 
  law [(1)(c)].  The contents of documents submitted in accordance with an extradition 
  agreement (treaty) are admissible [(1)(b)].  Finally, the contents of documents 
  contained in the s.&nbsp;33 record of the case are admissible although those 
  contents would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law [(1)(a)].  The 
  constitutionality of this provision, s. 32(1)(a), is challenged by the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, it is s.&nbsp;33, which describes the contents of the 
  record of the case, that is at the heart of the constitutional challenge in 
  this case.  I will set out its provisions before describing its effect.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>33. (1) The <u>record of the case must include</u></span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
      <u>a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The record of the case need only contain a summary of the evidence.  
  A judicial or prosecuting authority must certify that evidence summarized or 
  contained in the record of the case is available for the trial.  In addition, 
  the judicial or prosecuting authority must certify either that the evidence 
  is sufficient under the law of the extradition partner to justify prosecution 
  or was gathered according to the law of the extradition partner.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, s. 34 provides that a document is admissible 
  (and this would apply to all of the various types of documents contemplated 
  by s. 32) whether or not it is solemnly affirmed or under oath.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is important to note that although under s.&nbsp;32 the prosecuting 
  or judicial authority must certify either the sufficiency of the evidence or 
  the manner in which it was gathered, whether the evidence is in fact sufficient 
  to meet the test under s.&nbsp;29 must be determined by the extradition judge.  
  Put another way, ss. 32 to 34 determine admissibility only.  It is for the Canadian 
  judge presiding at the extradition hearing to decide whether the evidence is 
  sufficient to meet the test under s. 29.  Having said that, it is apparent that 
  various types of evidence that would not be admissible at a Canadian trial are 
  admissible at the extradition hearing.  In particular, hearsay is admissible 
  although it would not meet a common law or statutory exception and would not 
  meet the necessity and reliability requirements set out by the Supreme Court 
  in cases such as <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740 and <i>R. v. Smith,</i> 
  [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915.  Thus, as I will describe below, the record of the case 
  in the appellant’s case consisted entirely of second- or third-hand hearsay 
  that would probably not be admissible in a Canadian trial.  The impugned provisions 
  would also permit admission of character or opinion evidence at the extradition 
  hearing although such evidence might not be admissible at a Canadian trial. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the result, the extradition hearing has moved very far from 
  the typical Canadian trial or preliminary inquiry where the judge, by applying 
  the common law and statutory rules of evidence based on the paradigm of trial 
  by the lay jury, performs a gatekeeper function to keep potentially unreliable 
  and prejudicial evidence away from the trier of fact.  The new <i>Extradition 
  Act</i> has also moved some distance from the scheme under the <i>Extradition 
  Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 c. E-23, which required, in most cases, that the evidence 
  be presented in the form of sworn affidavits by persons with first-hand knowledge 
  of the events.  Although the deponents of the affidavits were not subject to 
  cross-examination (See <i>Re United States of America and Smith</i> (1984), 
  10 C.C.C. (3d) 540 (Ont. C.A.)), the affidavits usually<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> had to be sworn and contain evidence 
  that would otherwise be admissible in a Canadian court.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The evidence in the extradition court was in two parts.  First, 
  there was the evidence relevant to the inquiry under s. 29.  This was in the 
  form of the s. 33 record of the case as certified by the prosecuting authority, 
  an Assistant District Attorney with the New York County District Attorney’s 
  Office.  The record of the case consisted of the original record of the case 
  and a supplement.  The appellant also adduced certain material.  The second 
  type of evidence consisted of testimony and various other materials relevant 
  to the constitutional challenge.  I will briefly summarize the two parts.</p>

  </span></span> The Assistant District Attorney summarized the evidence against 
  the appellant in the original record of the case as follows.  On September 6, 
  1995, at approximately 6:15&nbsp;p.m., several eyewitnesses saw the appellant 
  and numerous other individuals attacking the victim.  As a result of the attack, 
  the victim fell to the ground, bloodied.  The appellant and others fled the 
  scene.  Two named police officers observed the crowd and saw the appellant and 
  the others fleeing.  They gave chase and were able to capture the appellant 
  and another person, Shan Zhang, who has since been convicted.  When arrested, 
  Zhang was in possession of a knife covered with blood.  The victim suffered 
  numerous stab wounds to the back and was hospitalized for a week.  The police 
  suspected possible gang activity.</p>

  </span></span> After his arrest, the appellant was charged with attempted murder 
  in the second degree and other charges and released on bail.  He was to appear 
  in court on October 3, 1995 but failed to do so.  A warrant was issued for his 
  arrest and he was charged with bail jumping in the first degree.  The record 
  of the case states that the identity of the victim and the other eyewitnesses 
  has been omitted to protect their safety.  The record of the case does contain 
  material relevant to the identification of the appellant.  </p>

  It is certified in the same manner as the original record of the case.  The 
  summary of evidence in the supplement is somewhat fuller.  The Assistant District 
  Attorney states that this summary is based on the Grand Jury testimony and indicates 
  that there are three eyewitnesses.  The summary discloses the locations of two 
  of the witnesses at the time they made the observations.  One witness saw the 
  appellant hitting the victim over the head with a plastic milk crate while another 
  assailant appeared to be stabbing him.  The evidence of the two arresting officers 
  is also set out in more detail, as is medical evidence concerning the injuries 
  suffered by the victim.  The summary also makes clear that the victim did not 
  testify before the Grand Jury and has refused to cooperate with the police or 
  the District Attorney’s Office.</p>

  District Attorney wrote a letter that was disclosed to the defence.  It would 
  seem that this letter came in response to information in the hands of the appellant’s 
  counsel indicating that the New York police had been unable to locate witnesses.  
  In the letter, she states that the prosecution has always relied upon the testimony 
  of the several eyewitnesses and the medical records and is prepared to take 
  the case to trial despite the victim’s refusal to cooperate.  She further states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

  </span></span> In view of this letter and some other material, the appellant 
  submits that the certification is false in so far as it indicates that evidence 
  is available for trial.  He also submits that the certification is false because 
  the record of the case states that the victim is one of the witnesses who is 
  available and supplied information to the Assistant District Attorney.  The 
  appellant submits that irrespective of the constitutionality of ss. 32 to 34, 
  the record of the case and the supplement should have been excluded on the basis 
  of false certification.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>The facts relating to the constitutional

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The evidence concerning the constitutional challenge came primarily 
  from three expert witnesses called by the Attorney General of Canada.  Two witnesses 
  testified before the extradition judge.  The evidence of the third witness was 
  tendered in the form of a transcript of her testimony before Ewaschuk J. in 
  the earlier case of <i>Bourgeon v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2000), 187 
  D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 542 (Ont. S.C.J.) where a similar constitutional challenge 
  was made.  I will make further reference to the decision in <i>Bourgeon</i> 
  below.  A Canadian lawyer with expertise in United States law testified on behalf 
  of the appellant.  The parties also placed before the extradition judge numerous 
  documents including excerpts from Hansard and various treaties and extradition 
  agreements to which Canada is a party.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The evidence adduced by the Attorney General was directed to 
  explaining the rationale for changes to the evidentiary provisions.  At least 
  since the 1980’s, Canada has been involved in a project to modernize its extradition 
  process.  At that time, Canadian legislation was based upon 19<sup>th</sup> 
  century Imperial statutes and treaties that did not easily accommodate modern 
  offences and the increasingly global nature of crime itself.  A particular problem 
  was that non-common-law states found it difficult to comply with the requirement 
  of sworn affidavits based upon first-hand knowledge of the events.  These countries 
  (for convenience I will refer to them as civilian states) do not gather their 
  evidence nor present it in the same way as do the common-law countries.  The 
  concept of preparing, at the investigatory stage, a <i>prima facie</i> case 
  based upon affidavits that do not infringe our hearsay rule is foreign to these 
  countries.  They had difficulty meeting deadlines in the legislation or the 
  treaties.  Extradition would be refused for failure to comply with what the 
  civilian states would consider needless technicalities.  In the result, there 
  was evidence, admittedly mostly anecdotal, that civilian states had stopped 
  making requests of Canada for extradition.  Even the United States, with whom 
  Canada transacts most of its extradition business, found the Canadian rules 
  cumbersome, especially in very complex drug and fraud investigations.  The task 
  of gathering affidavits based upon first-hand information from all of the various 
  witnesses and victims was a daunting and expensive one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The initial attempt to modernize the extradition process was 
  through bilateral negotiations.  The former <i>Extradition Act</i> provided 
  that in case of a conflict between the Act and a treaty, the terms of the treaty 
  governed.  Thus, if the evidence were admissible in accordance with the treaty, 
  that evidence could be used as a basis for proof of a <i>prima facie </i>case, 
  even if the evidence did not, for example, meet the requirements of sworn affidavits 
  containing evidence that met our hearsay rule.  See for example: <i>Netherlands 
  (Kingdom) v. Clarkson</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the same time that Canada was undertaking these bilateral 
  initiatives the growth in transnational crime had sparked worldwide initiatives 
  to modernize extradition – to make extradition simpler and more expeditious.  
  Canada participated in a number of meetings, especially with other Commonwealth 
  states.  These states – the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia – were 
  experiencing similar problems.  The United Kingdom, in particular, was under 
  pressure from the members of the European Union, with whom most of its extradition 
  business was conducted, to accommodate the civilian system.  The civilian states 
  complained about the need for proof of a <i>prima facie</i> case, affidavits 
  without inadmissible hearsay and, in some cases, the requirement that the documentary 
  evidence be made under oath or affirmation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Various multilateral initiatives favoured abolition of one or 
  all of the requirements of an oath, affidavits based upon first-hand information 
  and proof of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  The proponents of these initiatives 
  considered that other safeguards, such as the rules of speciality and double 
  criminality and the right not to extradite for political crimes, provided adequate 
  safeguards for the fugitive.  These initiatives have been codified in various 
  documents such as the <i>European Convention on Extradition</i>, adopted by 
  the European Union in 1957, and the <i>Model Treaty on Extradition</i>, adopted 
  by the United Nations General Assembly in 1990.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The scheme in the new <i>Extradition Act</i> originates in negotiations 
  between law ministers of the Commonwealth.  In 1986, the Government of Australia 
  proposed the abolition of the <i>prima facie</i> test within the Commonwealth 
  scheme for rendition.  Canada, in particular, was opposed to this suggestion, 
  which would have abolished any judicial assessment of the sufficiency of the 
  request.  Accordingly, in 1989 at a meeting in New Zealand, Canada proposed 
  that the <i>prima facie</i> test be retained but that the requesting state could 
  rely upon a record of the case.  The record of the case would contain a recital 
  of the evidence.  Thus, there would be no requirement for affidavits containing 
  first-hand accounts.  Further, the recital of evidence could be based upon evidence 
  admissible in the requesting state and not necessarily admissible in the requested 
  state.  This proposal would bring the Commonwealth more in line with the scheme 
  for extradition as set out in the <i>European Convention on Extradition</i> 
  and the United Nations <i>Model Treaty on Extradition</i>.  The law officers 
  of the Commonwealth adopted Canada’s proposal.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Another important consideration for Canada was its obligation 
  to cooperate with the United Nations Tribunals, which oversee trials of war 
  crimes and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.  
  These tribunals designed their own evidentiary and procedural rules that borrowed 
  from both the common-law and civilian systems.  In particular, hearsay evidence 
  is admissible at the trials in these tribunals.</p>

  </span></span> Canada has implemented its 1989 proposal in the impugned provisions 
  of the new <i>Extradition Act,</i> which came into force on June 17, 1999.  
  Amendments to the Act came into force October 23, 2000 to deal particularly 
  with requests for extradition from the war crimes tribunals (S.C. 2000, ss. 
  47 to 53).  The new Act includes the following protections:  the rule of double 
  criminality (s. 3); time limits on proceedings against a person arrested on 
  a provisional warrant (ss. 14, 21); the right to apply for bail (ss. 19, 20); 
  the right of the Minister to seek assurances from the extradition partner (s. 
  40); the right to attach conditions that the fugitive not be prosecuted for 
  other offences (the rule of speciality) (s. 40); prohibition against surrender 
  for political crimes, certain military crimes and offences barred by a limitation 
  period (s. 46); and the right of the Minister to refuse surrender in cases concerning, 
  <i>inter alia</i>,<i> autrefois acquit </i>or <i>convict</i>, persons convicted 
  in their absence and having no right to have the case reviewed, and young persons 
  where the procedure in the extradition partner is inconsistent with the fundamental 
  principles governing the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>.  The <i>Act</i> also includes 
  provisions for appealing the committal (s. 49) and reviewing the decision of 
  the Minister to surrender (s. 53).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The parties adduced evidence of extradition schemes in other 
  jurisdictions.  There is no single universal model for extradition in all countries 
  or even in the same country.  Thus some states treat some countries differently 
  from others.  Below is a very brief summary of the extradition schemes in the 
  countries with which Canada would conduct most of its extradition business.  
  I point out, however, that, as is to be expected, the overwhelming number of 
  extradition requests come from and go to the United States.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> European countries examine the formal validity of extradition 
  requests but, typically, there is no assessment of the sufficiency of evidence.  
  On the other hand, many of these countries do not extradite their own citizens.  
  The United Kingdom has a bifurcated system as set out in the <i>Extradition 
  Act, 1989</i>, 1989 c. 33.  The scheme retains both the <i>prima facie</i> standard 
  of proof and the necessity that evidence be admissible according to the domestic 
  rules of evidence.  By Order in Council, however, specified countries may be 
  exempted from these requirements.  Where such an exception is permitted, particulars 
  of both the person sought and the offence alleged must be provided.  The United 
  Kingdom ratified the <i>European Convention on Extradition</i> in 1989 and member 
  states of the European Union are exempted.  Britain also has a special arrangement 
  with Ireland, which involves a scheme of judicial backing of an arrest warrant:  
  <i>Backing of Warrant (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965</i>, 1965 c. 45.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Australia and New Zealand have schemes that are similar to that 
  of Great Britain.  They have adopted the backing of the arrest warrant procedure 
  for extradition between each other.  New Zealand has designated Canada as an 
  exempted state.  Australia exempts certain states from the <i>prima facie</i> 
  case requirement, but not Canada and other members of the Commonwealth.  In 
  the United States, consideration of extradition requests is on a probable cause 
  standard and there is a relaxed standard of admissibility, with hearsay being 
  admissible.  See <i>Artukovic v. Rison</i>, 784 F.2d 1354 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir., 
  1986).  Thus, an affidavit from the prosecutor in the requesting state summarizing 
  the evidence, similar to the record of the case presented in the appellant’s 
  case, would be admissible in the United States:  <i>Emami v. United States District 
  Court for the Northern District of California</i>, 834 F.2d 1444 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir., 1987).</p>

  </span></span> In his reasons for dismissing the constitutional challenge to 
  the legislation, Dilks J. pointed out that in deciding whether the principles 
  of fundamental justice have been respected in a particular case it is necessary 
  to balance the importance of the rights with the importance of the legislative 
  purpose.  He observed that while the judicial role has been considered to be 
  a critical one in extradition, it is a modest one.  He concluded that given 
  the abundance of safeguards existing in the legislative scheme as a whole, the 
  new evidentiary provisions do not infringe s. 7 of the <i>Charter.</i>  In particular 
  he held that any apparent lack of reliability because of s. 32 is compensated 
  for by the certification requirements of s. 33.  He summed up his conclusion 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Having regard to the many safeguards built into the process to ensure 
      its integrity and to protect the person sought, any prejudice to that person 
      caused by admission of the type of evidence permitted by the impugned sections 
      is so minimal that when weighed against the limited role of extradition 
      in the whole criminal process and, as well, Canada’s international commitments, 
      the result is that there is no violation of the fundamental justice rights 
      of [the fugitive].</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dilks J. also dealt with the argument that the requirements of 
  s. 32 of the Act had not been met because the affidavit gave the misleading 
  impression that the victim was available to testify when other material clearly 
  showed he was not cooperating.  He interpreted the affidavit to mean that the 
  information and the summary of the case came wholly from persons other than 
  the victim.  He therefore held that the affidavits were admissible, that the 
  appellant had been properly identified and that there was evidence upon which 
  a jury acting reasonably and properly instructed could convict.  Accordingly, 
  he ordered that the appellant be committed for extradition.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION IN <i>BOURGEON v. CANADA (ATTORNEY

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A challenge similar to the one made in this case came before 
  Ewaschuk J. in <i>Bourgeon v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>.  He made the following 
  findings concerning the evidentiary provisions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)            Abolition of the requirement of evidence on oath or by way 
      of solemn affirmation did not contravene s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
    <p>(ii)            Admissibility of otherwise inadmissible foreign evidence 
      must not be determined by foreign standards, varying from country to country.</p>
    <p>(iii)            Abolition of the common law exclusionary rules as they 
      apply to foreign evidence may result in the deprivation of the fugitive’s 
      liberty in a fundamentally unjust manner since the extradition judge may 
      base committal on unreliable evidence.  It was “inexplicable” that evidence 
      in favour of the fugitive must meet a reliability threshold under s. 32(1)(c), 
      but evidence adduced by the requesting state need not.  This is “fundamentally 
      unfair”.</p>
    <p>(iv)            Thus, s.&nbsp;32(1)(a) and (b) contravene s.&nbsp;7 as 
      it is fundamentally unjust to a fugitive to permit an extradition judge 
      to admit evidence at an extradition hearing that would not otherwise be 
      admissible in the absence of “a statutory safeguard against the reception 
      of unreliable evidence”.  Further, this contravention was not a reasonable 
      limit within the meaning of s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
    <p>(v)            However, the appropriate remedy was to “read down” the provisions 
      by reading the provisions to authorize the admission of otherwise inadmissible 
      evidence only “if the judge considers it reliable”.  As so interpreted the 
      provision, although contravening s.&nbsp;7, would constitute a reasonable 
      limit.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Justice Ewaschuk’s holding that s. 32 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> 
  should be read down, authorizing the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence 
  at the instance of the demanding state only if the judge considers that evidence 
  to be reliable, has been considered by other superior court judges.  As indicated, 
  Dilks J. refused to follow the decision in this case and it was not followed 
  by Low J. in <i>United States of America v. Reid</i> (Ont. S.C.J.; May 23, 2000) 
  or by Vertes J. in <i>Germany v. Ebke</i>, [2001] N.W.T.J. No. 13 (S.C.).  Low 
  J. made the point in <i>Reid</i> at p. 22:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he extradition judge has a very limited, indeed a negligible ability 
      to assess the reliability of the evidence, for, apart from the situation 
      relating to evidence adduced <i>viva voce</i> at the extradition hearing, 
      there is no opportunity to assess the quality of the potential witnesses 
      whose evidence is summarized in the authenticated documentary evidence and 
      the record of the case adduced under section 32 of the Act.  At best, the 
      extradition judge may be able to say that there is or is not evidence before 
      him to indicate that such evidence may be unreliable.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The challenge to the constitutionality of the 
  evidentiary provisions of the <i>Extradition Act</i> is based upon s. 7 of the 
  <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>which provides as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

      and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles

  </span></span> As I have said, there is no question that the appellant’s right 
  to liberty is engaged and the question in this case therefore concerns whether 
  the evidentiary provisions in the legislative scheme of extradition accord with 
  the principles of fundamental justice.  In <i>Rodriguez v. British Columbia 
  (Attorney General)</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 at 593-94, Sopinka J. held that 
  in arriving at the principles of fundamental justice the court is required to 
  balance the interests of the state and the individual.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The court must also take a contextual approach.  Procedure that 
  in one context would not comport with the principles of fundamental justice 
  may accord with the principles of fundamental justice in an entirely different 
  context.  In <i>Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 51, McLachlin J. identified three elements that must be taken 
  into account in identifying the principles of fundamental justice in the extradition 
  context.  They are reciprocity, comity and respect for differences in other 
  jurisdictions.  The implications of these contextual factors are profound.  
  First and foremost, the courts are instructed not to impose Canadian standards 
  upon our extradition partners.  A foreign justice system is not fundamentally 
  unjust because it does not recognize certain safeguards that we would consider 
  principles of fundamental justice.  La Forest J. put the case for accommodating 
  differences in blunt terms when he said in <i>Schmidt v. The Queen</i> (1987), 
  33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 214 that the judicial process in the foreign 
  country “must not be subjected to finicky evaluations against the rules governing 
  the legal process in this country”.  He recognized that Canada has no monopoly 
  on fairness or truth-seeking:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>A judicial system is not, for example, fundamentally unjust -- indeed 
      it may in its practical workings be as just as ours -- because it functions 
      on the basis of an investigatory system without a presumption of innocence 
      or, generally, because its procedural or evidentiary safeguards have none 
      of the rigours of our system.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, given the pronouncements of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in post-<i>Charter</i> extradition cases and particularly the need to 
  respect differences in other jurisdictions, the evidentiary provisions of the 
  <i>Extradition Act</i> comply with the principles of fundamental justice.  Put 
  simply, if we are prepared to countenance a trial of persons, including our 
  own citizens, in jurisdictions with very different legal systems from our own, 
  it is open to Parliament to design an extradition procedure that, with appropriate 
  safeguards, accommodates those differences.  Our extradition process need only 
  meet “the basic demands of justice”.  The system must be one that is “reasonably 
  effective … for the surrender of fugitives from one country to another untrammeled 
  by excessive technicality or fastidious demands that foreign systems comply 
  with our constitutional standards” [<i>Schmidt</i> at p. 215].  The United States 
  Supreme Court adopted a similar approach in <i>Glucksman v. Henkel, United States 
  Marshal</i>, 221 U.S. 508 (1911) at 512 where Mr. Justice Holmes said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>For while of course a man is not to be sent from the country merely 
      upon demand or surmise, yet if there is presented, even in somewhat untechnical 
      form according to our ideas, such reasonable ground to suppose him guilty 
      as to make it proper that he should be tried, good faith to the demanding 
      government requires his surrender.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A basic tenet of our legal system that informs the nature of 
  fundamental justice for extradition is, as stated in <i>United States v. Burns</i> 
  (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 130, “that individuals who choose to 
  leave Canada leave behind Canadian law and procedures and must generally accept 
  the local law, procedure and punishments which the foreign state applies to 
  its own residents”.  The new <i>Extradition Act</i> to a significant degree 
  allows the foreign state to make its extradition request in accordance with 
  its own procedures, especially its own rules of evidence.  I have not been persuaded 
  that the Act, on its face, infringes the s. 7 rights of fugitives.  Whether 
  the Act may operate unfairly in a particular case is a matter I will discuss 
  at the end of these reasons.  I will now set out my reasons for holding that 
  the impugned provisions are constitutional.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Kindler</i> at p.&nbsp;54, McLachlin J. held that in defining 
  the principles of fundamental justice relevant to extradition the court “draws 
  upon the principles and policies underlying extradition law and procedure”.  
  The court asks whether the impugned provision is “consistent with extradition 
  practices, viewed historically and in the light of current conditions” and whether 
  the provision serves the “purposes and concerns which lie at the heart of extradition 
  policy”.  I have briefly reviewed the extradition procedure in the countries 
  with which Canada does most of its extradition business as well as the U.N. 
  <i>Model Treaty on Extradition</i> and the <i>European Convention on Extradition</i>.  
  Similar material had persuasive effect in <i>Burns</i>.  While there may not 
  be any accepted universal international norm governing extradition process, 
  the trend is towards simplifying the extradition process to accommodate differences 
  in the legal systems of extradition partners.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is possible to identify certain principles of fundamental 
  justice in the extradition context.  The fugitive is entitled to a hearing before 
  an unbiased decision maker and to be present: <i>Idziak v. Canada (Minister 
  of Justice)</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (S.C.C.) at 83 and 85.  The fugitive 
  has the right to know the case against him or her including the materials relied 
  upon to establish the <i>prima facie </i>case:  <i>United States of America 
  v. Kwok</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.) at 267, <i>United States of 
  America v. Dynar</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 524-25.  The fugitive 
  also has the right to participate in the hearing free of coercion from the requesting 
  state:  <i>Cobb</i> at pp.&nbsp;284-85.  However, the fugitive is not, in my 
  view, entitled to any particular form of evidence.  As Sopinka J. said in <i>Rodriguez</i> 
  at p.&nbsp;590, “a mere common law rule does not suffice to constitute a principle 
  of fundamental justice”.  Rather, principles of fundamental justice are ones 
  “upon which there is some consensus that they are vital or fundamental to our 
  societal notion of justice”.  Bearing in mind the need to respect differences 
  in other jurisdictions, developments in extradition in other jurisdictions and 
  the traditionally modest role of the extradition judge I cannot find that the 
  hearsay rules, opinion rules or the other common-law rules of evidence are vital 
  to our societal notion of justice in the extradition context.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If, as said by La Forest J. in <i>Schmidt</i> in the passage 
  quoted above, it is not unjust to extradite to a country that does not recognize 
  the presumption of innocence or other evidentiary and procedural safeguards 
  that we would consider fundamental, the question naturally arises whether there 
  are any Canadian evidentiary standards that can be imposed, as constitutional 
  requirements, at the extradition hearing.  The starting point must be an examination 
  of the role of the judicial phase of the extradition process.  That role, described 
  repeatedly as a modest one, is primarily to ensure the identity of the person 
  sought and to protect that person from being surrendered for conduct that we 
  would not recognize as criminal.  In <i>Schmidt</i> at p. 209, the hearing was 
  described as protecting the individual from being surrendered “unless <i>prima 
  facie</i> evidence is produced that he or she has done something there that 
  would constitute a crime … if committed here”.  Similarly, in <i>McVey (Re); 
  McVey v. United States of America</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 20, 
  La Forest J. described the judge’s function as to “determine whether the <i>conduct</i> 
  of the accused would constitute a crime if it had been committed in this country”.  
  Thus, the judicial hearing acts as a modest screening device.  It is structured 
  around the fundamental concept that the actual trial takes place in the requesting 
  state.  Accordingly, the hearing is “intended to be an expedited process, designed 
  to keep expenses to a minimum and ensure prompt compliance with Canada’s international 
  obligations”:  <i>Dynar</i> at p. 522.  The evidence adduced in this case demonstrates 
  that the procedure under the former <i>Extradition Act</i> has, on occasion, 
  frustrated that fundamental obligation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If fundamental justice does not mandate any particular evidentiary 
  safeguards, does it nevertheless impose a reliability minimum as held in <i>Bourgeon</i>?  
  In my view, it does not.  To the contrary, imposing such a requirement is inconsistent 
  with an important aspect of the extradition hearing, which is the need to accommodate 
  differences in procedure in the extradition partners.  In the foundation case 
  of <i>United States of America v. Sheppard</i> (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (S.C.C.) 
  at 433-34, Ritchie J. made it clear that the judge’s role in determining sufficiency 
  of evidence did not extend to passing judgment on its reliability.  He held 
  at p.&nbsp;427 that the judge was required to commit the fugitive in any case 
  “in which there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result 
  in a conviction”.  The committal could even be based upon evidence that was, 
  in the opinion of the judge, “manifestly unreliable”.  <i>Sheppard</i>  is a 
  pre-<i>Charter</i> case and must be read in that light.  It must also be read 
  in light of the statutory framework that existed at the time and required that, 
  absent a treaty provision to the contrary, evidence be presented by way of sworn 
  affidavits based on first-hand knowledge.  It does, nevertheless, provide strong 
  support for the view that it has not traditionally been the function of the 
  extradition judge to pass upon the reliability of the evidence presented.  Post-<i>Charter</i> 
  cases have held that the <i>Sheppard</i> test applies and that the extradition 
  judge must refrain from weighing the evidence or assessing credibility.  See, 
  most recently, <i>United States of America v. Kwok</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 
  225 (S.C.C.) at p. 244.  It is certainly open to Parliament to give the extradition 
  judge, as it has in s.&nbsp;32(1)(c) in respect of evidence adduced by the person 
  sought for extradition, the right to pass on the reliability of evidence, but 
  that does not mean that such a power is fundamental to the fairness of the process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly stated that in determining 
  whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, whether at the preliminary inquiry 
  or trial stage, the judge is not to consider the quality of the admissible evidence.  
  See, for example, <i>R. v. Mezzo</i> (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 107-8 
  and <i>R. v. Monteleone</i> (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 198.  In a domestic 
  trial, reliability is a matter for the trier of fact.  In the extradition context, 
  it is a matter for the judiciary in the extradition partner.  See <i>Re United 
  States of America and Smith</i> (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 540 (Ont. C.A.) at 554-55, 
  <i>United States of America v. Wagner</i> (1995), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 66 (B.C.C.A.) 
  and <i>United States of America v. Waddell</i> (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (B.C.C.A.) 
  at 571.  As Arbour&nbsp;J.A. said in <i>United States of America v. Shulman</i> 
  (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 294 (S.C.C.) at 316, “Weighing the evidence or assessing 
  credibility is not part of the extradition judge’s jurisdiction … and it is 
  not open to that judge to assume responsibility over the actions of foreign 
  officials in preparing evidence or to assume that foreign courts will not give 
  the fugitive a fair trial or cannot properly weigh evidence”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Dynar</i> at pp. 527-28, La Forest J. said that the court 
  must exercise extreme caution in excluding foreign evidence from consideration 
  in the extradition process on <i>Charter</i> grounds because it would be “difficult 
  to imagine how such evidence could be excluded without indirectly applying the 
  <i>Charter</i> extraterritorially to the foreign jurisdiction”.  To impose a 
  reliability requirement on the evidence from the foreign state in the extradition 
  process as a matter of fundamental justice would indirectly apply the <i>Charter</i> 
  extraterritorially.  The extradition partner would be precluded from relying 
  upon evidence that it had gathered in conformity with its own procedures or 
  that, in its own jurisdiction, would be sufficient to warrant a trial and conviction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the argument of this appeal, much was made of the disturbing 
  specter of a fugitive being committed for surrender based upon fifth-hand hearsay, 
  non-expert opinion and prejudicial character evidence.  For example, in <i>Ebke</i> 
  the record of the case from the Federal Republic of Germany is described as 
  containing “hearsay, character evidence, unqualified opinion evidence, and other 
  forms of evidence that would not ordinarily be admissible in domestic Canadian 
  criminal proceedings” [at para. 13].  This is disturbing only when viewed through 
  the lens of the Canadian system and its paradigm of the jury trial.  If such 
  evidence is admissible in our extradition partners it is because their experience 
  is that this kind of evidence can be weighed by the judicial official and will 
  be accorded the weight it deserves.  It is not for this country to assume that 
  it alone knows how to arrive at a true verdict.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It seems to me that much of the concern about the reliability 
  of evidence from civilian states is based upon a lack of understanding of that 
  system and a tendency to isolate certain parts of the process, such as admission 
  of hearsay, without an appreciation that there are other safeguards in the system 
  that protect the accused from wrongful conviction.  Thus, although all manner 
  of information goes into the dossier that is presented to the court, usually 
  that evidence is gathered under the supervision of a legal officer, either a 
  prosecutor or a magistrate.  At all phases of the investigation and trial an 
  expert judge has wide powers to seek out additional evidence, for example from 
  court-appointed neutral experts, and control the investigatory process.<a href="#_ftn2"

  </span></span> Most telling against the appellant’s submission are the remarks 
  of La Forest J. for the majority of the court in <i>Republic of Argentina v. 
  Mellino</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (S.C.C.) at 351 that he saw “nothing 
  offensive to fundamental justice in surrendering in accordance with our extradition 
  procedures an accused to a foreign country for trial in accordance with its 
  traditional judicial processes for a crime alleged to have been committed there”.  
  And, as he said at p.&nbsp;353, our courts “must assume that he will be given 
  a fair trial in the foreign country.  Matters of due process generally are to 
  be left for the courts to determine at the trial there as they would be if he 
  were to be tried here.”  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>The effect of the impugned provisions is simply to permit the extradition partner 
  to rely upon the same type of evidence that it could use to try the accused 
  in that country.  The certification requirement ensures that a high official 
  has certified that this is what will happen.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The fact that I have held the impugned provisions of the <i>Extradition 
  Act</i> are valid does not preclude an argument that the application of the 
  provisions may, in a particular case, operate to violate the fugitive’s rights.  
  The extradition judge is deemed to be a court of competent jurisdiction for 
  the purposes of the <i>Charter</i> by s. 25 of the Act.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Kwok</i> at pp. 253&#8209;54, Arbour J. explained that 
  the similarly worded section in the <i>Extradition Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 
  E-23 (as amended by <i>An Act to amend the Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1992, c.&nbsp;13) 
  confers <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction upon the extradition judge “insofar as the 
  issues are specific to the functions of the extradition hearing, and to the 
  extent that the <i>Charter</i> remedies could have previously been granted by 
  the <i>habeas corpus</i> judge [under the old Act]”.  She further explained 
  at p. 255 that this provision permits the extradition judge to give remedies 
  for <i>Charter </i>breaches that “pertain directly to the circumscribed issues 
  relevant at the committal stage of the extradition process”.  The scope of this 
  power was illustrated in <i>Cobb</i> where the Supreme Court upheld the decision 
  of the extradition judge staying the proceedings because of the conduct of the 
  prosecutor and judge in the demanding state in attempting to force the fugitives 
  to abandon their right to an extradition hearing.</p>

  </span></span> The fact that, for example, evidence is admissible under ss. 
  32 to 34 because it has been gathered in accordance with the law of the extradition 
  partner, will not preclude the extradition judge from concluding in the particular 
  case that the evidence is inadmissible.  This was recently affirmed by Arbour 
  J.A. in <i>Shulman </i>at p. 315:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[I]n an appropriate case, the extradition judge could exclude evidence 
      gathered by the foreign authorities in such an abusive manner that its admission

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It follows that I do not agree with Ewaschuk J. that fairness 
  requires that the reliability condition imposed by statute upon evidence sought 
  to be adduced by the fugitive must also be applied to the evidence sought to 
  be adduced by the extradition partner.  As Vertes J. noted in <i>Ebke</i> at 
  para. 79, this fails to give effect to the reliability requirement inherent 
  in the certification requirements of the Act.  Under s.&nbsp;33(3), the judicial 
  or prosecuting authority must certify that the evidence summarized in the record 
  of the case is available and either would be sufficient under the law of the 
  extradition partner to justify prosecution or was gathered according to the 
  law of the extradition partner.  In short, the evidence must be available and 
  must satisfy the legal standards of the extradition partner.  I do not see why 
  Canada should demand any greater guarantee of reliability from the extradition 
  partner.  Further, I do not see how the extradition judge would be in a position 
  to make the reliability determination without having a detailed knowledge of 
  the legal system of the extradition partner and then, purportedly passing on 
  its legitimacy.  Both concepts are antithetical to the extradition process.  
  Doherty J.A. made this point in <i>Pacificador v. Philippines (Republic of)</i> 
  (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 210 (Ont. C.A.) at 218 in considering the jurisdiction 
  of the extradition judge to require that a Canadian police officer be produced 
  for cross-examination to provide information about his involvement in the extradition 
  request:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

      evidence offered at the extradition hearing is relevant to a fugitive's 
      right to make full answer and defence at some subsequent proceeding, when 
      the extradition judge has no knowledge of what full answer and defence means 
      in the context of the foreign proceeding, and no knowledge of the legal 
      matrix in which the ultimate adjudication of the merits of the charge would

  </span></span> One additional comment.  The appellant argued that the new provisions 
  of the <i>Extradition Act</i> represent a radical departure from existing extradition 
  practice.  They are certainly a departure from the former statutory scheme.  
  However, under s. 3 of the former Act where a treaty provides a different procedure, 
  including different rules of evidence, the treaty governs:  <i>Re Voss and The 
  Queen</i> (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (B.C.C.A.); <i>Government of Republic of 
  Italy v. Piperno</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.).  Several of the treaties 
  allowed for admission of evidence in the manner contemplated by ss. 32 to 34 
  of the present Act, for example, the 1989 treaty with the Republic of Philippines:  
  <i>Pacificador v. Philippines (Republic of)</i> (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 210 (Ont. 
  C.A.) at 215-16.  The new Act merely accelerates a process that Canada had embarked 
  upon through bilateral negotiations.</p>

  provisions with this comment.  The judicial function has been described as a 
  critical one.  For example, in <i>Dynar</i> at p. 521 the court said:</p>

lang=EN-US>One of the most important functions of the extradition hearing is the 
      protection of the liberty of the individual</span></u>.  It ensures that 
      an individual will not be surrendered for trial in a foreign jurisdiction 
      unless, as previously mentioned, the Requesting State presents evidence 
      that demonstrates on a <i>prima facie</i> basis that the individual has 
      committed acts in the foreign jurisdiction that would constitute criminal 
      conduct in Canada.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Similarly see <i>Schmidt</i>, at pp. 208-9 and <i>McVey </i>at 
  pp. 15, 17 and 20.  Although the impugned provisions contemplate admission of 
  evidence that a Canadian court would not normally admit nor accord weight to, 
  the extradition judge must still determine whether that evidence is sufficient 
  to warrant committal.  The fact that the prosecuting or judicial authority in 
  the extradition partner has certified that the evidence is sufficient under 
  the law of the extradition partner to justify prosecution does not eliminate 
  the function of the extradition judge to determine its sufficiency.  </p>

  </span></span> Equally, this critical function for protection of the liberty 
  of the individual cannot be reduced to a meaningless ritual.  While the judicial 
  phase is not a full-fledged trial, neither “is it a mere formality”: <i> Shulman</i> 
  at p. 307.  Thus, the judge must be in a position to exercise that function.  
  If the material presented in the record of the case is so bereft of detail, 
  such as the witness’ means of knowledge, that the judge cannot determine its 
  sufficiency, the judge will have to discharge the person sought for prosecution.  
  This is not a question of the judge weighing the evidence or passing on its 
  reliability, but of carrying out the function assigned by statute.  For example, 
  if the record of the case contained a statement that the police suspected the 
  fugitive committed the offence, without stating the basis for this opinion, 
  and this was the only evidence proffered by the extradition partner as proof 
  that the fugitive committed the offence then, even if this opinion was admissible 
  in the requesting state as proof of the offence, it would not be sufficient 
  to meet the s. 29 test for committal because it would have no probative value.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is to be distinguished from a case that depends solely upon 
  hearsay.  If the hearsay statement contains direct evidence of guilt, albeit 
  second or third hand, the judge would nevertheless be required to commit, since 
  the judge’s function does not include the power to pass on the reliability of 
  that evidence.  </p>

  </span></span> As I have indicated, the appellant submitted that the certification 
  of the initial record of the case is demonstrably false since it left the impression 
  that the victim was available to testify at trial.  Dilks J. concluded that 
  a “reasonable reading of the affidavit is such that the information contained 
  therein and the summary of the case comes wholly from persons who do not include 
  the victim”.  I have considerable difficulty with the proposition that this 
  is a reasonable reading of the initial affidavit.  I repeat the critical line 
  from the Assistant District Attorney's affidavit:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The following is <u>a summary based upon information that I have personally 
      received from conversations and/or Grand Jury testimony of the victim/complainant</u>, 
      the several eyewitnesses, the police officers who were at the scene of the 
      incident, from reviewing the Grand Jury minutes, the indictments in the 
      case, in addition to the Criminal Court Papers, other documentation, and 
      the New York City Police Department documents in connection with the above 
      cases.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It seems to me that, at best, the affidavit is unclear as to 
  who or what were the sources of the information for the summary contained in 
  the affidavit.  However, I do not agree that this rendered the certification 
  false.  The certification is in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I, Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo, certify that 
      the evidence summarized or contained in the attached documents is available 
      for trial and:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>is sufficient under the law of United States, State of New York, County 
      of New York to justify prosecution,</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>and,</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>was gathered according to the law of the United States of America, 
      State of New York, County of New York.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The wording of the certification is consistent with s. 33(3)(a) 
  which requires that the authority certify that the “evidence summarized or contained 
  in the record of the case is available for trial”.  I do not read s. 33(3)(a) 
  as requiring the prosecuting authority to certify that any particular source 
  of evidence is available, so long as the evidence summarized in the record of 
  the case is available.  There is no evidence summarized in the affidavit that 
  could only have come from the victim.  This is made plain in the Supplement 
  to the Record of the Case for Prosecution, which is much more detailed and more 
  clearly identifies the source of the evidence to be used at the trial.  Similarly, 
  the statement in the letter from the Assistant District Attorney that at the 
  time of the extradition hearing the state had apparently not located all of 
  the eyewitnesses did not render the certification that the evidence was available 
  false.  For these reasons, I would not interfere with the decision of the extradition 
  judge admitting the original and supplemental record of the case.</p>
