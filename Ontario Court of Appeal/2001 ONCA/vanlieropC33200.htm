<p style='text-align:justify'><b>On appeal from judgment of Justice Nancy M. Mossip 
  dated October 27, 1999, reported at [1999] O.J. No. 4225.</b></p>
<p><b>BY THE COURT:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants, Franz Hollenbach and Elke Hollenbach (“the Hollenbachs”), 
  appeal from the judgment of Justice N. Mossip awarding net damages of $94,305 
  to the respondents, Bert Van Lierop and Anja Van Lierop (“the Van Lierops”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Hollenbachs owned Long Lane Farms near Puslinch, Ontario.  There 
  were three houses at Long Lane Farms.  The Hollenbachs lived in the main house.  
  Beside the main house was a guest house.  Some distance from these two structures 
  was a red brick house which had been used continuously as a residence for employees 
  and their families since the Hollenbachs acquired the farm in 1980.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In 1993, the Hollenbachs were looking for a responsible couple to occupy 
  the red brick house and to help on the farm.  They approached the Van Lierops 
  who had lived in the same apartment in Burlington for 19 years.  The parties 
  entered into an agreement which was not reduced to writing.  The Van Lierops 
  would come to live in the red brick house.  They would engage in general property 
  maintenance on the farm, which included work each day after Mr. Van Lierop returned 
  from his regular job as a co-ordinator of major projects for the Halton District 
  School Board, as well as work on week-ends and holidays.  In addition, the Van 
  Lierops would look after the farm when the Hollenbachs were away.  These duties 
  would be recompensed by deemed rent on the red brick house and by the Hollenbachs 
  paying the hydro, fuel and pool maintenance expenses associated with the red 
  brick house.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Van Lierops moved onto Long Lane Farms in January 1994.  It appears 
  that the arrangement worked well until March 1997 when Mr. Van Lierop and Mrs. 
  Hollenbach had angry words about repairs to one of the farm trucks.  Mr. Van 
  Lierop continued working until May 3.  On June 1, he received a letter from 
  Mr. Hollenbach which stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As our business needs a full-time manager in residence at the farm, we 
      require vacant possession of the brick house at Long Lane Farms you occupy 
      at present by August 1, 1997.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Van Lierops initiated an action against the Hollenbachs.  The essential 
  relief they sought was restitution by way of damages of $425,000 for unjust 
  enrichment.  The basis of their claim was their view that Mr. Van Lierop had 
  done far more than general maintenance and caretaker work on the farm and that 
  it would be unfair of the Hollenbachs to both order them off the farm and keep 
  the benefits of all the extra work Mr. Van Lierop had done.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The particular focus of the Van Lierops’ claim was what the parties 
  described as “special projects”, that is, work above and beyond the general 
  maintenance and caretaker duties Mr. Van Lierop performed on almost a daily 
  basis.  The special projects on which Mr. Van Lierop worked during the 1994-1997 
  period were the construction of two lean-to sheds, renovations to the basement 
  of the guest house, conversion of a cattle barn, and panelling of a horse trailer.  
  In addition, in the autumn of 1993 before they moved to the farm, Mr. Van Lierop 
  did a great deal of work renovating the red brick house in which the Van Lierops 
  would live.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, the Van Lierops divided their claim into three categories:  
  daily work on the horse farm, special building projects, and additional duties 
  primarily related to extra work they performed when the Hollenbachs were away 
  from the farm.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following a trial which lasted seven days, Mossip J. held that the Van 
  Lierops were entitled to be compensated at an hourly rate of $10 (not $30 as 
  they sought) for 20 hours per week (not the 25 they sought) for their daily 
  work.  The Van Lierops were also entitled to be compensated for Mr. Van Lierop’s 
  work on the special projects.  The trial judge also held, however, that the 
  Van Lierops were not entitled to be compensated for the extra work they performed 
  when the Hollenbachs were away because “whatever extra work there was during 
  these periods is included in the average of 20 hours per week during the time 
  Mr. Van Lierop worked for the Hollenbachs”.  Finally, the trial judge held that 
  the amount owed by the Hollenbachs to the Van Lierops should be reduced by the 
  value of the rent for the red brick house which she determined was $750 per 
  month.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the result, the trial judge summarized her conclusions in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> $35,600.00 for damages for payment for work done on the farm on 
        a regular basis from January, 1994 to June 4, 1997, calculated at 20 hours 
        per week for 178 weeks @ $10.00 per hour.</p>
      <p> (2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> $111,205.00 for damages for the value of the benefit conferred 
        on the defendants for the renovation of the red brick house and the special 
        projects completed by Mr. Van Lierop on the Hollenbachs farm, as well 
        as for out of pocket expenses paid by the Van Lierops.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Total   $146,805.00</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Defendants are therefore entitled to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>$52,500 for rent calculated from January, 1994 to October, 1999,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> being 70 months 
        at $750.00 per month.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly, judgment to go for the Plaintiffs in the amount of $94,305.00.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants appeal from the trial judge’s decision on three bases:  
  (1) she misapplied the law of unjust enrichment; (2) she erred in her calculation 
  of damages; and (3) she erred by awarding costs to the plaintiffs on a solicitor-and-client 
  basis for the trial.</p>
<p><b>(1)       <u>Unjust enrichment</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants contend that the trial judge erred by concluding that 
  the Hollenbachs were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Van Lierops.  In 
  particular, they submit that she erred by finding that there was no juristic 
  reason for the enrichment of the Hollenbachs.  The appellants’ position is that 
  the essence of the parties’ agreement was that no money would change hands during 
  the life of their relationship.  Accordingly, the special projects were merely 
  part of the work the Van Lierops did in return for rent free accommodation in 
  the red brick house.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We disagree. The evidence indicates that the original agreement between 
  the parties contemplated general maintenance and caretaker duties in return 
  for accommodation, utilities and pool maintenance.  For example, Mrs. Hollenbach 
  described the conversation her husband had with the Van Lierops at their first 
  meeting in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.        Okay.  Now, did anything else happen that day in terms of discussing 
      this issue between the Hollenbachs and the Van Lierops?</p>
    <p>A.        Franz explained to him exactly what he would have to do about 
      the small repairs and looking – mainly be there when we were gone and – 
      they were talking about the day-to-day duties he would have to fulfil.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even more telling was the evidence of Mr. Hollenbach, who did not testify 
  at the trial.  However, plaintiffs’ counsel read in some of the testimony he 
  gave at discovery, where Mr. Hollenbach said that the special projects “had 
  nothing to do with his [Mr. Van Lierop’s] general being on the farm”.  Later 
  there was this exchange:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.        Okay. But those one time things you indicate you expected to 
      receive an invoice from my client?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>Later Mr. Hollenbach gave a clear description of his view of the nature 
  of the relationship:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> His coming to the farm and I think I said this before, was subject 
      to being there when we were gone and doing certain chores. That was why 
      he was there.  When he was working, then his work would have been offset 
      against outstanding rent.  I think I mentioned that before in that – in 
      that way. So this project, the big project, that was the one time situation.  
      That was not what was meant by letting him live on the farm, at no time.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given this testimony, the trial judge concluded that the Van Lierops 
  had conferred a benefit on the Hollenbachs and that there was no juristic reason 
  for the Hollenbachs to retain the benefit.  In reaching this conclusion, she 
  carefully considered and, in our view, correctly applied, the leading authorities 
  on unjust enrichment, including <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 837, 
  <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Canada</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762, and <i>Campbell 
  v. Campbell</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 783 (C.A.).</p>
<p><b>(2)       <u>Damages</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants contend that the trial judge erred by relying on the 
  expert report of William Huinink with respect to both the method for calculating, 
  and the quantum of, damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We disagree.  The method of calculation – namely, as expressed by the 
  trial judge, “an assessment of the ‘cost’ value of the work to the Hollenbachs, 
  less of course amounts already paid by the Hollenbachs for these projects” – 
  was an acceptable method:  see <i>Peter v. Beblow, </i>[1993] 1 S.C.R. 980 and 
  <i>Bell v. Bailey</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 3368 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As to the quantum, the calculations of the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ 
  experts were quite close, $286,745 and $235,070 respectively before deductions. 
   The trial judge accepted the calculations of the plaintiffs’ expert.  We can 
  see no principled basis for interfering with this choice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants further contend that the trial judge erred by granting 
  all of the expenses claimed by the Van Lierops for materials and labour which 
  they paid for in relation to renovations to the red brick house.  The amount 
  the trial judge credited to the Van Lierops was $16,594 whereas in their statement 
  of claim they sought only $13,050.  At the appeal hearing, counsel for the respondents 
  did not disagree with the appellants’ submission on this issue. We are of the 
  view that the damages should be reduced by $3,544 to bring the award into line 
  with the statement of claim.</p>
<p><b>(3)       <u>Costs</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge awarded the Van Lierops their costs on a party-and-party 
  basis up to the commencement of the trial and on a solicitor-and-client basis 
  for the trial.  The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in the second 
  component of this award because they did not engage in any reprehensible conduct 
  that might attract such an award.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We agree.  Although appellate courts should accord a good deal of latitude 
  to trial judges on the question of costs, the basic principle is that “it is 
  only in the rare and exceptional case that costs are awarded on a solicitor-and-client 
  scale rather than on a party-and-party scale”:  see <i>Mortimer v. Cameron</i> 
  (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 1 at 23 (C.A.); <i>Foulis v. Robinson</i> (1978), 21 O.R. 
  (2d) 769 (C.A.); and <i>Neill v. Pellolio</i> (Ont. C.A., unreported, November 
  30, 2001).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is nothing in the nature of this case or in the conduct of the 
  appellants to justify an award, even a partial one, of costs on a solicitor-and-client 
  scale.  There was a good deal of money at stake in the litigation.  There was 
  no document of any kind setting out the relationship between the parties.  The 
  trial judge herself described the proceeding as “novel and complex”.  Accordingly, 
  it was not wrong for the appellants, in the words of Dubin J.A. in <i>Foulis 
  v. Robinson, supra</i>, at p. 776, “to put the plaintiff to the proof”.  Moreover, 
  although the respondents succeeded at trial, on several issues the trial judge 
  found against them or awarded damages well below what the respondents sought.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, in our view the trial judge erred by departing from 
  the general rule that the successful party should be awarded costs on a party-and-party 
  basis.</p>
<p><b>(4)       <u>Disposition</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The judgment of the trial judge on the substantive issues relating to 
  unjust enrichment is affirmed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The judgment of the trial judge on the damages issue is affirmed, with 
  one minor exception.  We would allow the appeal to the extent of reducing the 
  damages awarded to the plaintiffs/respondents from $94,305 to $90,761.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We would allow the appeal on the costs issue and vary the order of the 
  trial judge to provide that the plaintiffs/respondents receive their costs of 
  the trial on a party-and-party basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although, viewed globally, the respondents have been more successful 
  than the appellants on the appeal, in our view the appellants have succeeded 
  on enough matters to justify the conclusion that the parties should bear their 
  own costs of the appeal.</p>
