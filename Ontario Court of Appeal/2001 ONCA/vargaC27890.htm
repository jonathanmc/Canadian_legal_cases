<p class=headingtitle><span style='font-weight:normal'>On appeal from the conviction

  </span> The appellant shot three people in the head.  Christopher Spence died, 
  Martin Hooper was in a coma for months but survived, and Virginia Suzana suffered 
  a fractured skull but also survived.  The appellant was tried on one count of 
  murder and two counts of attempted murder.  He was convicted of manslaughter 
  (count 1), unlawfully attempting to cause bodily harm to Mr. Hooper (count 2), 
  and the attempted murder of Ms. Suzana (count 3).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge imposed a sentence of 12 years on the manslaughter conviction, 
  6 years on the unlawfully attempting to cause bodily harm conviction and life 
  on the attempted murder conviction.  The appellant was in custody for about 
  22 months prior to sentence.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.  Counsel advanced 
  five arguments on the conviction appeal:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The trial judge erred in finding that the police did not 
      violate the appellant’s right under s. 7 and s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i> 
      when they failed to permit counsel to obtain a sample of the appellant’s 
      blood and/or urine in a timely manner while the appellant was in custody.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The trial judge erred in refusing to admit evidence that 
      the deceased Spence drugged and stabbed a person nine years before the shooting.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The trial judge’s reasonable doubt instruction is not in 
      substantial compliance with the principles set out in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> 
      (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The trial judge misdirected the jury as to the onus of proof 
      as it applied to self-defence.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of Ms. 
      Suzana is inconsistent with his acquittal on the charges of murdering Mr. 
      Spence and attempting to murder Mr. Hooper.</p>

line-height:normal'> [4]<span

  </span> Identity was not an issue.  The appellant testified that he shot the 
  victims.  He fired two shots into Mr. Hooper, followed quickly by two shots 
  into Mr. Spence and then, again quickly one shot into Ms. Suzana.  He said that 
  he shot Mr. Hooper and Mr. Spence in self-defence and that when he shot Ms. 
  Suzana it was a “reflex action”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The murder charge raised three issues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Did the Crown prove that the appellant did not act in self-defence?</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Did the Crown prove, having regard to all of the circumstances, 
      including the appellant’s ingestion of cocaine and heroin, that the appellant 
      had one of the culpable states of mind required by s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i>?</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Did the Crown prove that the appellant was not provoked as 
      defined in s. 232 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>?</p>

line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The verdict of manslaughter indicates that the jury was satisfied that 
  the appellant did not act in self-defence.  The verdict also indicates that 
  the jury was either not satisfied that the appellant had one of the requisite 
  intents, or that even if he had one of those intents, the Crown had failed to 
  prove that he was not provoked.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Did the Crown prove that the appellant intended to kill Mr.

line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The verdict of unlawfully attempting to cause bodily harm to Mr. Hooper 
  indicates that the jury was satisfied that the appellant did not act in self-defence, 
  but was not satisfied that the Crown had proved that the appellant intended 
  to kill Mr. Hooper.  The verdict of attempting to murder Ms. Suzana indicates 
  that the jury was satisfied that the appellant did not act in self-defence and 
  did intend to kill Ms. Suzana.</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>III</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was a drug dealer and a heavy user of drugs.  He dealt 
  in relatively large amounts of cocaine and prided himself on the quality of 
  the product he distributed.  He always carried a loaded handgun.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant and Mr. Spence were friends, had been in jail together 
  and had been partners in crime.  In the days immediately prior to the shooting, 
  the appellant had encouraged Mr. Spence to become involved in his drug distribution 
  schemes. Mr. Hooper was a friend of Mr. Spence and did not know the appellant 
  before the shooting.  Ms. Suzana was a long-time friend of Mr. Spence and also 
  did not know the appellant.  The shootings occurred in her apartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The shootings occurred on the morning of February 10, 1995.  About four 
  days earlier, the appellant had acquired a large amount of cocaine and offered 
  to supply some of that cocaine to Mr. Spence for resale.  On February 9<sup>th</sup>, 
  the appellant drove to Shelburne, Ontario with Mr. Spence.  Both men consumed 
  heroin.  The appellant spent that evening with his girlfriend.  He consumed 
  cocaine.  His girlfriend described him as “really, really high” and “paranoid”.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At about 3:00 a.m. on February 10<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Spence called the 
  appellant and asked him to come over to Ms. Suzana’s apartment.  Mr. Spence 
  said that he had a buyer for some of the cocaine.  The appellant put a large 
  amount of cocaine and a loaded .357 magnum pistol into a gym bag, placed a loaded 
  .25 calibre Colt pistol into his pocket and made his way to Ms. Suzana’s apartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the appellant arrived at Ms. Suzana’s apartment, he divided the 
  cocaine into one ounce amounts.  After some discussion, he gave Mr. Spence one 
  ounce and told him to give it to the prospective purchasers as an indication 
  of the quality of the product they could acquire.  Mr. Spence left with the 
  one ounce of cocaine.  Before leaving, he and the appellant took drugs.  After 
  Mr. Spence left, the appellant consumed more drugs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Spence went to Mr. Hooper’s apartment in the early morning of February 
  10<sup>th</sup>.  Mr. Hooper knew nothing about the purchase of cocaine from 
  the appellant, and it would appear that Mr. Spence had lied about the existence 
  of prospective purchasers.  Mr. Spence asked Mr. Hooper to go with him to Shelburne.  
  He said that they had to pick up “Ray” [the appellant] before going to Shelburne.  
  Mr. Hooper and Mr. Spence went to Ms. Suzana’s apartment.  After they arrived, 
  more drugs were consumed by the appellant and Mr. Spence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The atmosphere in the apartment became tense.  The appellant, with very 
  good reason, came to believe that Mr. Spence, perhaps with the assistance of 
  Mr. Hooper, was trying to steal his cocaine.  Eventually, all four persons were 
  in the small kitchen area.  Mr. Spence offered the appellant a syringe full 
  of drugs.  The appellant, again with some justification, believed that the syringe 
  contained a lethal dose of heroin.  Mr. Spence had previously told the appellant 
  that injecting someone with an overdose of drugs was an ideal way to commit 
  murder.  He had told the appellant that he had “O.D.’d” people in the past.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, Mr. Hooper and Ms. Suzana all testified as to how the 
  shootings occurred.  The evidence of self-defence came exclusively from the 
  appellant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Hooper testified that after the appellant refused to take the syringe 
  offered by Mr. Spence, Mr. Spence appeared to be injecting the syringe into 
  his own arm.  The appellant drew two pistols and opened fire at Mr. Hooper.  
  A shot hit Mr. Hooper in the back of the head and a second shot hit him as he 
  fled towards the door.  He collapsed outside the apartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Hooper denied attacking the appellant with a knife.  He knew that 
  the appellant was armed with a gun and he was unarmed.  He did indicate that 
  shortly before the shooting he had seen a knife which he thought belonged to 
  his son sitting on the table.  Mr. Spence handed Mr. Hooper the knife and he 
  put it in his pocket.  That knife was found beside Mr. Hooper’s body in a pool 
  of blood.  Forensic testing showed that the blood on the knife came exclusively 
  from Mr. Hooper.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified that he feared that Mr. Spence was trying to 
  give him an overdose of heroin.  He pulled out his Colt revolver, pointed it 
  at Mr. Spence and told him to take the drugs himself.  Mr. Spence emptied some 
  of the contents of the syringe, injected himself with the remainder and turned 
  away from the appellant.  The appellant put his gun back into his pocket.  Mr. 
  Hooper then attacked the appellant and tried to stab him with a knife.  They 
  struggled, the appellant pulled out his revolver and shot Mr. Hooper in self-defence.  
  He said that he fired a second time because Mr. Hooper did not stop after the 
  first shot.  Mr. Hooper was shot in the back of the head and in the buttocks.  
  It is highly unlikely that he was facing the appellant when either shot was 
  fired.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified that after he shot Mr. Hooper in self-defence, 
  he turned and shot Mr. Spence twice.  Mr. Spence was standing at the stove with 
  his back to the appellant.  A syringe was found in his hand.  The appellant 
  said that he had seen two knives on the stove and he feared that Mr. Spence 
  would come at him with one of the knives.  Mr. Spence was shot in the back of 
  the head and through the left armpit.  It is highly unlikely that he was facing 
  the appellant when either shot was fired.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Suzana testified that Mr. Spence approached the appellant with a 
  syringe that appeared to contain a lethal overdose of heroin.  The appellant 
  stepped back, pulled out his gun and told Mr. Spence to inject himself.  Mr. 
  Spence did so and then moved back towards the stove.  At this moment, the appellant 
  shot Mr. Hooper.  Ms. Suzana did not see any struggle between Mr. Hooper and 
  the appellant before the appellant opened fire.  One of the shots fired at Mr. 
  Hooper went over her head.  She dropped to her knees.  Ms. Suzana was then struck 
  in the head with a bullet and collapsed.  Expert medical evidence indicated 
  that Ms. Suzana was sitting or kneeling down with her head bent when shot.  
  The shooter was above and in front of her.  The bullet did not enter her brain.  
  If Ms. Suzana’s head had been angled slightly differently the bullet would have 
  entered her brain and would likely have killed her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Immediately after the shootings, the appellant fled the apartment.  
  He threw both guns and the gym bag containing cocaine away as he fled.  They 
  were later recovered at various locations.  The appellant also attempted to

  </span> The appellant appeared to be under the influence of cocaine or some 
  other drug when he was arrested.  He still appeared to be “high” when he was 
  first seen by his lawyer some 11 or 12 hours after the shootings.  It was apparent 
  from the early stages of the investigation that identity was not likely to be 
  an issue, but that the appellant’s mental state when the shootings occurred 
  could be relevant to his liability.  </p>

  </span> At about 8:15 p.m., after speaking with the appellant, Mr. Breen, a 
  lawyer, advised the police that he wished to obtain a sample of the appellant’s 
  blood.  At about 11:30 p.m., Mr. Breen left the police station without having 
  obtained that sample.  It was argued at trial that the police deliberately refused 
  to co-operate in efforts to acquire that sample until sufficient time had passed 
  so that any sample that might be taken would be of no use to the defence.  It 
  was argued at trial that the police conduct amounted to a breach of the appellant’s 
  rights under s. 7 and s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.  On appeal, the same sections 
  of the <i>Charter</i> were relied on, although counsel set forward a somewhat 
  different basis upon which he alleged those sections had been breached.  </p>

  </span> The appellant was arrested for break and enter at about 9:00 a.m.  He 
  became aware later that morning that he was also under investigation for the 
  shootings which had occurred in the vicinity of the break and enter.  Some time 
  in the afternoon, he spoke on the telephone to a lawyer at the law firm of Rosen, 
  Fleming.  She believed that the appellant was “high” and passed that information 
  on to Mr. Breen.</p>

  </span> The appellant was charged with murder at about 6:00 p.m., some two hours 
  after Mr. Spence died.  Staff Sergeant McDermott assumed carriage of the investigation.  
  It was obvious to him that the appellant was coming down from a drug induced 
  high.  The appellant was given his right to counsel after he was charged with 
  murder and elected to contact the firm of Rosen, Fleming again.  He spoke to 
  Mr. Breen, who also spoke with Staff Sergeant McDermott to make sure that he 
  understood that the appellant was exercising his right to remain silent.  </p>

  </span> Mr. Breen spoke on the telephone to the senior partner, Mr. Rosen, who 
  it was anticipated would act for the appellant.  Mr. Rosen suggested that someone 
  from the office should go to the police station to speak with the appellant.  
  Mr. Breen sent a student, however, Staff Sergeant McDermott declined to allow 
  that student to speak to the appellant.  Mr. Breen, on Mr. Rosen’s instructions, 
  attended at the station himself.  He arrived there shortly before 8:00 p.m. 
  and spoke to Staff Sergeant McDermott who advised him of some of the information 
  that had been gathered in the investigation.  </p>

  </span> After speaking with Staff Sergeant McDermott, Mr. Breen spoke with the 
  appellant at about 8:00 p.m.  It was evident to him that the appellant was “high” 
  on drugs.  He concluded, based on the information given to him by Staff Sergeant 
  McDermott and his observations of the appellant, that intoxication might well 
  be a relevant issue.  Mr. Breen decided that a sample of the appellant’s blood 
  might be useful in the defence of the appellant.  He spoke with Mr. Rosen and 
  reviewed the situation with him.  Mr. Rosen instructed Mr. Breen to try to get 
  a sample of the appellant’s blood. </p>

  </span> Mr. Breen approached the officers at the front desk of the police station 
  at about 8:15 p.m.  He asked to speak with Staff Sergeant McDermott and was 
  told that he was busy interviewing certain witnesses.  Mr. Breen told the officer 
  behind the desk that he wanted to get a sample of his client’s blood.  Mr. Breen 
  was unaware of any protocol that might exist covering his request.  He had never 
  made such a request before.  Initially, he believed that the police would have 
  the facilities available to take the sample.  In his cross-examination, Mr. 
  Breen made it clear that if the police had taken the sample, he anticipated 
  that they would keep the sample.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I requested the police’s assistance in taking the sample.  And I simply 
      assumed – I certainly would not have objected, this would have been part 
      of the police investigation of the suspect and they would have been entitled 
      to the blood sample.  I would never have requested that any portion be given 
      to me. …</p>

  </span> Mr. Breen spoke to the officers at the desk about the availability of 
  the necessary personnel and material to take a blood sample from his client.  
  He also repeated his request to speak to Staff Sergeant McDermott.  The officers 
  at the desk were not helpful, and Mr. Breen decided to take the initiative and 
  arrange for someone to attend at the police station to take the blood sample.  
  After several fruitless calls to hospitals, Mr. Breen spoke to Mr. Fleming, 
  a partner in the Rosen, Fleming law firm, and Mr. Fleming made arrangements 
  to attend at the police station with a nurse.  They arrived between 10:30 and 
  11:00 p.m. </p>

  </span> Staff Sergeant McDermott completed his interviews at about 9:30 p.m.  
  He became aware that Mr. Breen was waiting to see him and went to speak with 
  Mr. Breen.  Mr. Breen indicated he wanted to take a sample of the appellant’s 
  blood.  There was considerable dispute between Mr. Breen and Staff Sergeant 
  McDermott as to what was said in this conversation.  Mr. Breen said that Staff 
  Sergeant McDermott made it clear that he was not interested in co-operating 
  with the defence.  Staff Sergeant McDermott said that he did not know what to 
  do as he had never had a request like this.  He testified that he was interested 
  in getting a sample for comparative purposes if any sample was taken from the 
  appellant, and given the obvious security concerns, he was not prepared to take 
  the appellant to a hospital for the purposes of taking a sample.  </p>

  </span> As it was a Friday night, it took Staff Sergeant McDermott some time 
  to locate Mr. Culver, the Senior Crown Attorney.  He spoke with Mr. Culver at 
  about 10:30 p.m.  Mr. Culver advised Staff Sergeant McDermott that he should 
  permit the sample to be taken, but should take the position that any sample 
  taken must be shared with the Crown.  </p>

  </span> Mr. Breen and Staff Sergeant McDermott discussed the nurse’s qualifications, 
  the means by which the blood sample would be taken, and the suitability of the 
  receptacle that Mr. Breen planned to use for the urine sample.  Staff Sergeant 
  McDermott told Mr. Breen that further to his discussions with Mr. Culver, it 
  was his position that the police should receive a portion of any blood sample 
  taken from the appellant.  There was no discussion as to what use, if any, the 
  police might make of that sample.</p>

  himself.  As he put it:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It was only when I was put in the position that I had to take the sample

  </span> Staff Sergeant McDermott remained concerned about the way the nurse 
  proposed to draw the sample from the appellant.  She was going to use an ordinary 
  syringe and not equipment specifically adopted for drawing blood samples.  The 
  appellant was an intravenous drug user and Staff Sergeant McDermott was concerned 
  about the safety of those involved in taking the sample.  The nurse was prepared 
  to take the sample with the equipment she had.  </p>

  </span> Staff Sergeant McDermott spoke to Mr. Culver for a second time at about 
  11:15 p.m.  Mr. Culver told him to let the nurse go ahead and take the sample.  
  Staff Sergeant McDermott also raised the question of the urine sample which 
  Mr. Breen had first mentioned about fifteen minutes earlier.  Mr. Culver said

  </span> Staff Sergeant McDermott advised Mr. Breen that he had made arrangements 
  to have the appropriate equipment picked up by the police at a nearby hospital 
  so that the nurse could take the blood samples at the police station.  Mr. Breen 
  became upset and accused Staff Sergeant McDermott of stalling.  Mr.  Breen spoke 
  to Mr. Rosen and told him that he did not think the police were going to co-operate.  
  Mr. Rosen agreed with this assessment and, with Mr. Rosen’s concurrence, Mr. 
  Breen left the police station at 11:27 p.m.  The nurse and Mr. Fleming followed.  
  No blood sample was ever taken.  </p>

  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… And I can tell you that frustration had a lot to do with it as well.  
      This was a Friday night and I had been sitting at the Division for four 
      hours and I’m no further ahead than I was when I first made the request.  
      And quite simply, my patience had run out.  And I wasn’t prepared to wait 
      any longer.  <u>My view of the situation was that I was being obstructed

  </span> Mr. Breen was convinced that Staff Sergeant McDermott was not prepared 
  to provide any assistance to the defence and that he would continue to obstruct 
  the taking of any blood sample until the results of that sample could not assist 
  the defence but might assist the prosecution.  Neither Mr. Breen nor Staff Sergeant 
  McDermott knew whether a blood sample taken more than 12 hours after the event 
  would assist in determining the level of drugs in the appellant’s blood at the 
  time of the shootings.  They also did not know what effect further delay would 
  have on the value of any samples.  Mr. Breen proceeded on the reasonable assumption 
  that the longer the delay, the less use the sample would be to the defence.

  </span> The Crown called Dr. Mayers, a toxicologist and pharmacologist.  He 
  testified that if a person had last ingested cocaine and/or heroin some 12 hours 
  earlier, he would not expect to find cocaine or heroin in that person’s blood 
  system, even if that person had ingested high quality cocaine or heroin in large 
  amounts.  He did indicate that a blood sample taken 12 hours after ingestion 
  may well reveal a substance called benzoylecgonine, a derivative of cocaine 
  which would indicate that the person had taken cocaine in the previous 24 to 
  48 hours.  The presence of benzoylecgonine would not provide any assistance 
  as to when the cocaine was taken, or the level of cocaine in the person’s system 
  at a specific point in time.  Dr. Mayers further testified that for forensic 
  purposes there would be very little difference in a sample taken 12 hours after 
  a person’s last ingestion of cocaine and a sample taken 14 hours after the last 
  ingestion.</p>

  </span> The trial judge held that the appellant’s rights under s. 7, and his 
  right to make full answer and defence under s. 11(d) placed an obligation on 
  the police to permit access to the appellant for the purposes of obtaining a 
  blood or urine sample.  The trial judge described the obligation in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is a obligation on the part of the police – as an emanation of the 
      Crown – in my opinion, <u>to permit reasonable access to an in-custody accused 
      in response to a timely, genuine and reasonable request by defence counsel, 
      for purposes of allowing blood or urine samples to be taken</u> of the accused 
      where the taking of such samples is necessary to collect and preserve evidence 
      of a disappearing nature and where that evidence might reasonably bear on 
      an issue at trial and be relevant to enable the accused to make full answer 
      and defence to the charges which he or she is facing.  The request must 
      be founded on something more than mere speculation and must have an air 
      of reality to it.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal, counsel for the Crown and the appellant accepted that the 
  Crown had the obligation described by the trial judge.  Both saw the obligation 
  as analogous to the Crown’s obligation to preserve and disclose relevant information 
  in the possession of the Crown.</p>

  </span> There does not appear to be any authority on point.  The trial judge’s 
  analysis is certainly persuasive, especially when adopted by counsel for the 
  Crown and the appellant.  Analogy to the disclosure obligation is also attractive.  
  I would prefer, however, to leave the question of the exact nature and extent, 
  if any, of the Crown’s obligation in situations like that presented here to 
  a case where it must be decided.  As I am satisfied that the trial judge correctly 
  held that there was no breach of the state’s obligation as he described it, 
  I will proceed on the assumption that the obligation as described by the trial 
  judge is rooted in the <i>Charter</i>.<a href="#_ftn2"

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant makes two arguments.  First, he argues that his rights 
  under ss. 7 and 11(d) were breached when the police took the position that the 
  defence could obtain a sample of the appellant’s blood only if the police were 
  also allowed to take a sample.  Counsel argues that by putting the appellant 
  in the position of having to give up his constitutional right to privacy and 
  his right against self-incrimination in order to exercise his right to full 
  disclosure, the state breached his s. 7 rights.  Second, and this is the argument 
  made at trial, the appellant argues that the police deliberately delayed and 
  obstructed the taking of any samples and did not, therefore, give “reasonable 
  access” to counsel for the purpose of taking those samples.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the course of making the first submission, counsel describes the 
  police as “extracting” the concession that the police could have a sample of 
  the blood if the defence was to take a sample.  Counsel also refers to Mr. Breen 
  as “reluctantly acquiescing” in this demand.  There is no evidence to support 
  these descriptions.  Indeed, the evidence is quite the contrary.  Mr. Breen 
  initially anticipated that the police would take and keep all samples that were 
  taken from the appellant.  It was only after Mr. Breen was put in the position 
  of making the arrangements to obtain the sample that he took the position that 
  the police should not receive any part of the sample.  He did not base his claim 
  on any notion of his client’s right to privacy or his client’s right against 
  self-incrimination, but rather on the basis that if the police did not want 
  to assist in arranging for the taking of the samples, they should not share 
  in the fruits of Mr. Breen’s labour.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When Staff Sergeant McDermott told Mr. Breen at about 11:00 p.m. that 
  it was the position of the Crown that the police should receive a sample, Mr. 
  Breen initially refused but then quickly telephoned Mr. Rosen.  Mr. Rosen was 
  clearly in charge.  It was his decision to make.  In Mr. Breen’s own words, 
  Mr. Rosen said “Sure, let the police have a sample”.  There is no suggestion 
  of any reluctance on the part of Mr. Rosen to share the sample.  No doubt, he 
  saw the potential value to the defence of permitting the police to take a sample 
  of the blood.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no evidence that experienced counsel who were acting for the 
  appellant on the evening of his arrest were bargaining away any constitutional 
  rights that the appellant might have.  By allowing the police to take a sample, 
  counsel were certainly not making any concession as to what the police could 
  do with that sample or what use the Crown could make of that sample in proceedings 
  against the appellant.  It is quite wrong to equate the police taking of a sample, 
  with any concession with respect to the appellant’s right not to incriminate 
  himself, or his privacy rights.  I would think that any attempt to use the sample 
  as anything other than a control sample would have met strenuous objection.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial record offers no support for the claim that the appellant 
  was put in the position of having to give up certain constitutional rights in 
  order to assert his right to obtain the desired sample.  The appellant had several 
  lawyers protecting his constitutional rights during the discussions about obtaining 
  a sample of his blood and/or urine.  Nothing suggests that any of these lawyers 
  saw the position taken by the police as somehow a demand that the appellant 
  give up constitutional rights.  That interpretation appears for the first time 
  on appeal.  This argument fails for lack of an evidentiary basis.</p>

line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I should not be taken as determining what entitlement, if any, the police 
  might have to insist on acquiring a sample from an accused in custody as a condition 
  to allowing the defence to take a sample.  It is arguable that reasonable access 
  includes concerns with respect to the integrity of any sample taken and that 
  the taking of a “control” sample properly addresses those concerns.  I leave 
  that issue for another day. </p>

line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second argument made on appeal is premised on the claim that the 
  police placed “unreasonable obstacles” in the way of the defence obtaining the 
  samples and that the police “deliberately and repeatedly” blocked counsel’s 
  efforts to secure those samples.  This argument runs afoul of the findings of 
  fact made by the trial judge.  He was not prepared to find that the police deliberately 
  or intentionally obstructed counsel.  He was also not prepared to accept that 
  the security and safety concerns expressed by Staff Sergeant McDermott were 
  part of a scheme to obstruct the taking of a sample in a timely fashion.</p>

  </span> The trial judge viewed this as a situation in which all involved were 
  acting in good faith, but were uncertain as to what to do given the novelty 
  of the situation.  This uncertainty led to delays.  The trial judge did not, 
  however, equate these delays with bad faith or obstruction on the part of the 
  police.</p>

  </span> The trial judge made several important factual findings, all of which 
  are reasonable and cannot be disturbed in this court.  He found:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Staff Sergeant McDermott became aware of Mr. Breen’s request at about 9:30 
      p.m.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Mr. Breen’s request presented a new situation that had not been encountered 
      before by anyone involved.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      The police had legitimate security concerns arising out of any suggestion 
      that the appellant be taken out of the police station for the purpose of 
      obtaining the samples.  The police did not have the facilities for taking 
      a blood sample at the station.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      The nurse arrived with Mr. Fleming sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m.  
      Prior to her arrival, Mr. Breen was not in a position to take a blood sample 
      had he been given access to his client.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      After the nurse arrived, Staff Sergeant McDermott and Mr. Breen had further 
      discussions about the suitability of the receptacle for taking the urine 
      sample and any dangers associated with taking the blood sample.  The trial 
      judge referred to this as a “debate”.  </p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Mr. Breen left the police station shortly after 11:27 p.m., upon being told 
      that equipment was coming from a nearby hospital to permit the taking of 
      the blood sample.</p>

  </span> Although the trial judge did not make an express finding as to the <i>bona 
  fides</i> of the position taken by Staff Sergeant McDermott after the nurse 
  arrived, it is implicit in his findings that Staff Sergeant McDermott was not 
  deliberately obstructing the taking of the blood samples, but had legitimate 
  concerns.  It is also implicit in his findings that Staff Sergeant McDermott 
  anticipated that the proper equipment would arrive in a few moments and that 
  the blood samples would be taken at that time.  While the trial judge recognized 
  that Mr. Breen had good reason to be frustrated with the course of events that 
  evening, it should be noted that Mr. Breen left the police station within an 
  hour of first being in a position to take a sample of his client’s blood.  Whatever 
  the police did or did not do (short of providing someone to take the blood sample), 
  no sample could have been taken before between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. when the 
  nurse arrived.  </p>

  </span> Lastly, counsel submitted that the trial judge erred by requiring that 
  the appellant demonstrate serious prejudice to the ability to make full answer 
  and defence as a precondition to establishing a breach of the <i>Charter</i>.  
  Counsel submitted that prejudice goes to remedy and not to the existence of 
  a breach.  The demonstration of prejudice to the ability to make full answer 
  and defence may or may not be a precondition to establishing a breach of s. 
  7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The significance of prejudice to establishing a breach 
  of s. 7 will depend on the nature of the breach alleged:  <i>R. v. F.C.B.</i> 
  (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 540 at 547-48 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada refused September 28, 2000;  <i>R. v. La</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Bero</i> (2000), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 557 (Ont. 
  C.A.).</p>

line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After reviewing relevant authorities, the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am not satisfied, however, on the evidence on this application that there 
      has been a s. 7 or s. 11(d) violation of Mr. Varga’s <i>Charter</i> right 
      to make full answer and defence.  <u>In any event, even if it could be said 
      on the evidence that such a violation has taken place,</u> the circumstances 
      here do not justify the imposition of the extraordinary remedy of a stay 
      of proceedings…  [Emphasis added.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The finding that the appellant had not established a violation of ss. 
  7 or 11(d), in my view, is a finding that the appellant had not shown that there 
  was a failure to provide “reasonable access”.  The failure to gain access before 
  about 11:30 p.m. was the result of a number of circumstances which, while they 
  prevented the taking of a sample, did not amount to the denial of reasonable 
  access by the police.  The failure to obtain access after 11:30 p.m. was the 
  product of Mr. Breen’s frustration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The passage from the trial judge’s reasons quoted above in paragraph 
  64 makes it clear that the trial judge found no breach of the appellant’s rights.  
  He then said “in any event” that he would not grant a stay of proceedings because 
  of the absence of any prejudice.  The trial judge’s reasons do not support the 
  contention that he misunderstood the significance of prejudice to the appellant 
  in the determination of whether the appellant’s rights under ss. 7 or 11(d) 
  were infringed.<a

<p class=headingtitle>B:  The Admissibility of the 1986 Stabbing By Spence</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Spence was a lifetime criminal.  The jury heard evidence of his general 
  reputation for violence and evidence of specific acts of violence that he had 
  told the appellant about in the course of their friendship.  The defence also 
  sought to introduce evidence of seven other specific acts of violence by Spence 
  in the 11 years prior to the shootings.  The trial judge admitted evidence of 
  some of these incidents and excluded evidence of others.  The appellant challenges 
  the ruling as it relates to evidence of one of the incidents excluded by the 
  trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defence wished to lead evidence from one Dinardo that in 1986, when 
  he was in jail with Mr. Spence, he saw Spence drug and stab an inmate.  Spence 
  believed that the inmate had cheated him in a drug transaction.  At trial, counsel 
  disavowed any knowledge by the appellant of this specific incident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel submitted that the evidence was admissible to support the appellant’s 
  claim that Spence had a propensity to act in a violent manner, particularly 
  in connection with the drug business and was, therefore, more likely to have 
  been the aggressor during the events which led to the shootings. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge referred to the relevant authorities noting that he 
  was required to balance the potential probative value against the danger that 
  the jury might conclude that Mr. Spence, because of his bad character, did not 
  merit the protection of the law.  The trial judge excluded the 1986 incident 
  as being “too remote in time” to carry sufficient probative value.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The admissibility of the deceased’s propensity for violence in homicide 
  cases where self-defence is raised is now well established:  <i>R. v. Scopelliti</i> 
  (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.).  The risk inherent in the evidence is 
  also well known.  Attacks on the character of the deceased are often easy to 
  make and risk the conclusion that it is a defence to a murder charge to show 
  that the deceased’s demise was a civic improvement.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The admissibility of this evidence was a close call and the trial judge’s 
  balancing of the probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence is entitled 
  to deference.  I agree with his assessment that the evidence had relatively 
  little probative value.  The incident occurred some nine years earlier and was 
  quite different from the incident giving rise to these charges.  It did, however, 
  have some similarity to the events as described by the appellant, although I 
  think counsel’s suggestion that the 1986 event was “strikingly similar” to the 
  events described by the appellant is an overstatement.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the potential probative value of the evidence was not great, I 
  cannot agree with the trial judge’s assessment of the risk of prejudice inherent 
  in the admission of the evidence.  I see virtually no risk of prejudice.  Without 
  this evidence, the jury had heard a great deal about Mr. Spence’s disposition 
  for violence and his prior involvement in all kinds of mayhem.  Indeed, Crown 
  counsel in his closing address said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>But I am not here carrying a torch for Christopher Spence.  <u>Christopher 
      Spence is a man who lived outside the law and deserved everything he got 
      and visited a lot of hardships on peaceful, law-abiding people in this community.</u> 
      …  </p>
    <p>But, Mr. Spence, by and large, was no good. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence of the 1986 incident would only have confirmed what the 
  jury already knew about Mr. Spence.  He was a dangerous criminal.  I do not 
  think there was any chance that the jury would have used that piece of evidence, 
  as opposed to the masses of other evidence they did hear, to improperly conclude 
  that Mr. Spence, because of his background, was not entitled to the protection 
  of the law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The admission of evidence of the 1986 incident would not have appreciably 
  added to the length or complexity of the trial.  Mr. Dinardo, who would have 
  testified about the 1986 incident, was going to testify in any event about other 
  acts of misconduct by Mr. Spence.  I also do not understand the Crown to suggest 
  that had the trial judge admitted evidence of the 1986 incident, there would 
  have been a need for a “mini trial” into the merits of that allegation against 
  Mr. Spence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence had limited potential probative value, but had virtually 
  no potential prejudicial effect.  On balance, and recognizing that defence evidence 
  should be excluded only where its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs 
  its probative value, I think the evidence should have been admitted.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> My analysis supporting the admissibility of this evidence, however, 
  turns in favour of the Crown when the <i>curative proviso</i> is considered.  
  For the very reasons that I think the trial judge should have admitted this 
  evidence I also conclude that its admission would have had absolutely no effect 
  on the result.  The problem with the appellant’s claim of self-defence was not 
  a shortage of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Spence was a violent man.  The 
  appellant’s difficulty was that, even on his own evidence, there was virtually 
  no indication that he had any cause to believe that he had to shoot Mr. Spence 
  to save himself.  On the appellant’s own evidence, Mr. Spence had dropped the 
  lethal weapon (the needle), turned away from the appellant and was standing 
  at the kitchen sink with his back to the appellant.  According to the appellant, 
  he acted in self-defence because he thought Mr. Spence might reach for a knife 
  near the kitchen sink.  The appellant was standing some distance from Mr. Spence, 
  was armed with a loaded handgun and had ready access to a door leading out of 
  the apartment. </p>

line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have no hesitation in concluding that evidence that Spence had been 
  involved in yet another act of violence some nine years earlier would have had 
  no effect on the jury’s assessment of the appellant’s self-defence claim.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>C:  The Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is yet another appeal in which the court must determine whether 
  a reasonable doubt instruction delivered prior to the decision in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> 
  (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) is in substantial compliance with the principles 
  set down in<i> R. v. Lifchus, supra</i>.  There are two errors in the reasonable 
  doubt instruction.  The trial judge told the jury that reasonable doubt had 
  “an ordinary natural meaning” and was not “some legal term having special meaning”.  
  The trial judge also failed to instruct the jury that proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt required more than proof of probable guilt and required proof that was 
  much closer to proof of certainty than to proof of probable guilt. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These two defects appear in many pre-<i>Lifchus</i> instructions and 
  have been the subject of many decisions.  Those decisions were recently reviewed 
  in <i>R. v. Feeley</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 3359 at paras. 32-33 (C.A.).  I do not 
  propose to review them again.  It is sufficient to say that the presence of 
  these two errors does not compel reversal.  As with all instructions, the reasonable 
  doubt instruction must be considered in its entirety and in the context of the 
  particular case.  Substantial compliance with the principles enunciated in <i>R. 
  v. Lifchus, supra</i>, is measured by reference to the overall effect of the 
  instruction.  As Iacobucci J. put it in <i>R. v. Russell</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
  731 at 743:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> 
      principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of that 
      decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge, language that will 
      likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts recommended in <i>Lifchus</i>, 
      is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment call on whether the 
      deficiencies in the charge fall below the <i>Lifchus</i> standards such 
      as to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict and 
      lead to the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On my review of the entire charge, I am satisfied that the jury would 
  have understood the significance of the reasonable doubt standard and that it 
  placed a heavy burden on the Crown.  The initial reasonable doubt instruction 
  fills some 2 1/2 pages of transcript.  The importance of that concept is stressed.  
  The jury was also told that a reasonable doubt may arise from a conflict in 
  the evidence or the absence of evidence.  The trial judge went on to say:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Furthermore, though, <u>reasonable doubt may arise because you are unable 
      to determine the credibility or reliability of particular witnesses in relation 
      to essential matters.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Placed in the context of the rest of this charge, I think the jury would 
  have understood this to be an indication that a reasonable doubt existed if 
  the jury was uncertain as to the reliability of evidence going to an essential 
  element of the offence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some further assistance as to the meaning of reasonable doubt was provided 
  in the course of instructing the jury on expert witnesses.  The trial judge 
  told the jury that in so far as expert evidence favoured the defence, the jury 
  could rely on it if they were satisfied that the evidence on which it was based 
  was true, or if they had a reasonable doubt as to whether it was true or false.  
  He went on to say:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is only when you find that the evidentiary basis is false that you must 
      not consider the opinion of an expert witness which favours the accused 
      on an essential matter.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

line-height:normal'> [84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> From this instruction, I think the jury would understand that the concept 
  of reasonable doubt embraced anything short of an express finding that evidence 
  was false.  In other words, uncertainty as to the truth of evidence which assisted 
  the defence on an essential feature equalled the existence of a reasonable doubt.</p>

  </span> Lastly, the trial judge instructed the jury in accordance with <i>R. 
  v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  From that instruction, the 
  jury would clearly understand that the case was not to be decided by choosing 
  between competing versions of the relevant events, but that a reasonable doubt 
  could exist even if the defence evidence was rejected as false.  I think the 
  approach mandated in <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, discourages decisions based 
  on probabilities.</p>

  </span> The verdicts also provide some insight into the jury’s understanding 
  of the heavy burden placed on the Crown.  The case against the appellant was 
  very strong.  On the totality of the evidence, and in particular the physical 
  evidence, the appellant’s self-defence claim was very weak.  His claim that 
  he was so impaired that he could not have intended the consequences of what 
  he did was belied by his detailed description of the events leading up to and 
  during the shootings.  Despite the strength of the Crown’s case, the jury acquitted 
  the appellant on two of the three main charges.  These acquittals suggest to 
  me that this jury held the Crown to a very high standard.</p>

  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to 
  the burden of proof as it applied to self-defence.  He argues that the jury 
  was told that the appellant had the initial burden of satisfying the jury as 
  to the facts relied on to support the self-defence claim.  It was only after 
  those initial facts were established to the jury’s “satisfaction” that the burden 
  moved to the Crown.</p>

  </span> I have reviewed the extracts from the trial judge’s instruction relied 
  on by the appellant in his factum.  His interpretation of those extracts is 
  a strained, if not tortured one.  The trial judge repeatedly told the jury that 
  the Crown had the burden of proof throughout.  He told the jury expressly on 
  no less than seven occasions that the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the defence of self-defence was unavailable.  Reference to two of 
  the extracts will suffice:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In as much as the defence of self-defence is raised for your consideration 
      in this case, even if it has been shown to you that Mr. Varga would otherwise 
      be guilty, before he can be convicted you must also be satisfied with the 
      exclusion of any reasonable doubt that he was not acting in self-defence 
      in according to the law.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>You must be satisfied, once the defence of self-defence under section 34(2) 
      of the <i>Criminal Code</i> has been raised, as it has here, the Crown must 
      prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence is unavailable to Mr. Varga 
      because the evidence supporting the defence is either untrue or insufficient 
      with respect to at least one essential element of the defence.  …  Subsection

  </span> I agree with the Crown’s submission that there is a readily available 
  reasonable explanation for the jury’s verdicts.  Whatever doubt the jury may 
  have had concerning the appellant’s state of mind when he shot Mr. Hooper and 
  Mr. Spence, it was open to them to conclude that when he turned his attention 
  to Ms. Suzana, who as far as he knew had just witnessed him shoot and kill two 
  persons, the appellant made a decision to eliminate Ms. Suzana.  Unlike Mr. 
  Spence and Mr. Hooper, the appellant had no reason to be angry with or fear 
  Ms. Suzana.  She was dangerous to him only as a witness to what he had just 
  done.  I think a reasonable jury could have concluded that the appellant made 
  a quick decision to eliminate the potential witness and fired into Ms. Suzana’s 
  head as she sat or knelt on the floor in front of him.  That is attempted murder.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant submits that the sentence of life imprisonment 
  imposed on the attempted murder charge is beyond the appropriate range.  He 
  submits that a sentence of life imprisonment on a charge of attempted murder 
  is reserved for cases of “stark horror”, or cases in which the offender can 
  be characterized as “the worst offender”.  While acknowledging his criminal 
  past and the seriousness of this offence, counsel submits that it is not a case 
  of “stark horror” and that the appellant is not in the “worst offender” category.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that the fitness of the sentence imposed depends on whether 
  it fits into one of the two categories described by the appellant.  The fitness 
  of the sentence imposed in this case cannot be considered in isolation from 
  the other offences that occurred at the same time.  The appellant attempted 
  to murder Ms. Suzana immediately after he shot two other people in her presence.  
  As the trial judge put it, “she was a helpless bystander who happened to be 
  in the way”.  In my view, the fact that the attempted murder arose out of the 
  commission of other serious offences is a significantly aggravating factor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is also significant that the slight tilt of Ms. Suzana’s head was 
  literally the difference between a murder and an attempted murder.  The appellant 
  fired at Ms. Suzana’s head from close range fully intending to kill her.  He 
  stands convicted of attempted murder rather than murder by pure luck.  His culpability 
  is hardly distinguishable from that of a murderer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge described the appellant’s lifestyle as that of a “seasoned, 
  deliberate and professional criminal”.  I agree.  The appellant had been released 
  from the penitentiary only about 3 months before the shootings.  He immediately 
  resumed his criminal activities.  His habitual possession of a loaded handgun, 
  his prior convictions for robbery and his conduct on this occasion are testimony 
  to his willingness to resort to violence to further his criminal endeavours.  
  The trial judge saw little hope for rehabilitation.  Again, I agree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s reasons for sentence are a model of thoroughness and 
  reflect a considered assessment of the applicable principles of sentencing.  
  Those reasons reveal no error in principle and the sentence imposed is not manifestly 
  beyond the appropriate range.  I would not vary the sentence.</p>

    “reasonable access” standard described by the trial judge, counsel for the 
    appellant at one point in his factum suggested that counsel had a right to 
    “unconditional access” to an accused in custody.  While I need not come to 
    any firm conclusion as to the access rights of counsel, I have no doubt that 
    they cannot be “unconditional”.  If an accused is lawfully in the custody 
    of the police, the police have an obligation to ensure the security and safety 
    of the prisoner and anyone who may come in contact with the prisoner.  Any 
    right counsel has to access to an accused in custody must co-exist with those 
    obligations and be tempered by them.  </p>

    outset of the trial.  This court has repeatedly indicated that unless the 
    appropriateness of a stay is manifest at the outset of the proceedings, a 
    trial judge should reserve on motions such as this until after the evidence 
    has been heard.  The trial judge is in a much better position to assess prejudice 
    at the end of the evidence.  It would have been better for the trial judge 
    to follow that course.  I see no prejudice, however, to the appellant by the 
    timing of the ruling and none was suggested in argument.</p>
