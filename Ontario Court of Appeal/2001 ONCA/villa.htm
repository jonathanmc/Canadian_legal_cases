style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This is a motion under s. 110 of the <i>Courts 
    of Justice Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43 to transfer four appeals to 
    the Divisional Court.  The issue underlying this motion is whether appeals 
    under the <i>Construction Lien Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30 are to be brought 
    in this court or in the Divisional Court.  For the reasons that follow, it 
    is my view that an appeal involving only proceedings under the <i>Construction 
    Lien Act</i> is to be brought in the Divisional Court.  Accordingly, I would 
    grant the motion and transfer the appeals and cross-appeals by the respondents 
    to the Divisional Court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This motion has its origin in a motion for 
    directions that I heard in December of last year.  At that time, counsel were 
    seeking a way to have a number of appeals and cross-appeals heard at the same 
    time in the same court.  The goal was a laudable one, being an attempt to 
    save expense and avoid conflicting results.  In the result, I held that as 
    a single judge I had no jurisdiction to give the directions because it appeared 
    to me that this court had no jurisdiction to deal with any of the appeals 
    and cross-appeals.  I invited counsel to bring a motion before a panel of 
    this court to determine the jurisdictional issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appeals and cross-appeals arise out of 
    judgments delivered by Hoilett J. in respect of claims based on the <i>Construction 
    Lien Act</i>.  The trial before Hoilett J. concerned four proceedings.  Two 
    proceedings were brought by the respondent Villa Verde L.M. Masonry Ltd.  
    One of Villa Verde’s proceedings concerned the validity of a lien claim under 
    Part III of the Act.  The other proceeding concerned allegations of breach 
    of trust principally founded in Part II of the Act.  The other two proceedings 
    were brought by Kasanova Masonry Ltd. and Midnight Masonry Ltd.  These proceedings 
    concern only a breach of trust and not lien claims.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Section 50(2) of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i> 
    provides that “a trust claim shall not be joined with a lien claim but may 
    be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction”.  Nevertheless, Master 
    Peterson ordered that all four proceedings be “… consolidated, or heard at 
    the same time, or heard one immediately after the other at Toronto, subject 
    to the discretion of the Trial Judge …”.  Counsel informed us that this is 
    not an unusual order, at least in Toronto.  To comply with s. 50(2), evidence 
    was first heard on Villa Verde’s lien action and then evidence was called 
    with respect to the breach of trust claims.  Hoilett J. issued one set of 
    reasons dealing with all of the claims.  There are three judgments, one for 
    each plaintiff.  The judgment in the Villa Verde proceedings deals with the 
    lien and trust claims.  The plaintiffs obtained almost complete success.  
    The cross-appeals concern the trial judge’s determination that one of the 
    individuals, Stanley Leibel, was not liable for breach of trust.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The principal reason for this motion is that 
    counsel were of the view that the Act provides different appeal routes for 
    the lien and trust claims.  It appears that traditionally, appeals concerning 
    lien claims under Part III have gone to the Divisional Court while appeals 
    concerning trust claims under Part II have come to this court.  The Act contains 
    its own appeal provision.  Section 71(1) provides as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Divisional Court from 
      a judgment or an order on a motion to oppose confirmation of a report under 
      this Act.</span></div>
  </blockquote>

<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As a result, the trust fund claims were appealed 
    to this court, while the lien action was appealed to the Divisional Court.  
    Out of an abundance of caution, the appellants also appealed the lien action 
    to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In my view, s. 71(1) of the Act applies to 
    appeals concerning lien claims under Part III as well as appeals concerning 
    trust claims under Part II of the Act.  I can see no basis for giving the 
    word “judgment” a restrictive meaning so that it relates only to a judgment 
    on a lien claim.  There is nothing in the <i>Construction Lien Act</i> that 
    suggests such an unusual interpretation.  The decision of this court in <i>Bird 
    Construction Co. v. C.S. Yachts Ltd.</i> (1990), 37 C.L.R. 225 is of some 
    assistance in resolving this issue.  The issue in <i>Bird Construction </i>arose 
    out of an <i>ex parte </i>order under the <i>Construction Lien Act, 1983</i>, 
    S.O. 1983 declaring that the plaintiff’s claim for a lien had expired, vacating 
    the certificate of action and dismissing the action. The plaintiff moved before 
    West J. to set aside the <i>ex parte</i> order.  He dismissed the motion and 
    confirmed the earlier order.  This court held that although this was a final 
    order, the appeal lay to the Divisional Court under s. 73(1) of the 1983 Act, 
    which is identical to s. 71(1) of the current Act.  The court held, at p. 
    227, that the order of West J. “constitutes a judgment under the Act, notwithstanding 
    the fact that it is referred to as an order, and notwithstanding the fact 
    that it was made without a trial having taken place”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The court went on to hold that the reasons 
    of Arnup J.A. in <i>Durall Construction Ltd. v. W.A. McDougall Ltd.</i> (1979), 
    25 O.R. (2d) 371 (Ont. C.A.) at 373-74, interpreting the word “judgment” in 
    the former <i>Mechanics Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 267, s. 43, could apply 
    to the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>.  Arnup J.A. held as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><u><span
lang=EN-US>In our view the word “judgment” in s. 43(1) of the <i>Mechanics Lien 
      Act</i> applies to any decision by the appropriate Judge or Master by which 
      the rights of a party to the mechanics’ lien proceedings are finally disposed 
      of</span></u><span
lang=EN-US>, and that the matter is not to be tested by the name which is given 
      to that disposition nor by the terminology within it … the substance of 
      the disposition sought to be appealed is what governs.  [Emphasis added.]</span></div>

<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The court in <i>Bird Construction</i> further 
    held that the appeal provision in the Act, being a provision under a special 
    act dealing with construction liens, takes precedence over the appeal provisions 
    in the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, which is a general act dealing with appeals 
    from the final order of superior court judge.  The appeal therefore lay to 
    the Divisional Court.  Admittedly, the decision in <i>Bird Construction</i> 
    concerned a lien claim, not a trust claim.  However, it is my view that the 
    broad interpretation of “judgment” adopted in that case should apply to judgments 
    arising out of trust claims.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In his very helpful argument, Mr. Christie 
    suggested that the reason appeals concerning trust claims have traditionally 
    come to this court is that they are often joined with non-statutory causes 
    of actions.  Thus, this court may have taken jurisdiction under s. 6(2) of 
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  Section 6(2) provides that the Court of 
    Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal that lies to the Divisional 
    Court “if an appeal in the same proceeding lies to and is taken to the Court 
    of Appeal”.  All counsel were satisfied that s. 6(2) had no application to 
    these proceedings. Hence, it is clear that the appeals in this case should 
    therefore be transferred to the Divisional Court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>There is also a cross-appeal 
    in the Villa Verde matter against the trial judge’s decision that Stanley 
    Leibel was not personally liable under the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>.  
    As I read the notice of cross-appeal, the only issue raised concerns the application 
    of s. 13 of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>.  Accordingly, the cross-appeal 
    also lies to the Divisional Court.  At trial, it appears that the plaintiffs 
    also relied on the <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
    c. B.16.  However, as counsel conceded, to the extent that an issue arises 
    under that Act, the appeal route also lies to the Divisional Court in accordance 
    with s. 255 of that Act.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the cross-appeal 
    should be transferred to the Divisional Court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>In their factum, the respondents 
    suggest that this court could take jurisdiction in the lien and trust claims 
    by constituting itself as the Divisional Court as was done in <i>McCorkell 
    v. Ontario Lottery Corp.</i> (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).  However, this 
    is rarely done.  It is an option that is generally only resorted to where 
    the jurisdictional issue is noticed after the appeal has been argued and is 
    done to save the parties the expense and inconvenience of having to reargue 
    the appeal.  I can see no reason for adopting such a procedure in this case.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, I would grant the motion and transfer 
    the appeals and cross-appeal to the Divisional Court.  There will be no order 
    for costs of this motion.  At the hearing, counsel sought directions from 
    this court concerning preparation of the appeal and expediting the appeal.  
    Since this court has no jurisdiction to deal with the appeals, application 
    for those directions will have to be made in the Divisional Court.</span></p>
