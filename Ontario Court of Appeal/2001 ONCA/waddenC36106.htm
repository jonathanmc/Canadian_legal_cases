<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Sandra Wadden 
  and King Optical Group Inc. (“Braddock Optical”) appeal from an order of a Superior 
  Court judge dated January 18, 2001, upholding convictions entered and sentences 
  imposed by an Ontario Court judge on November 15, 1999 and December 13, 1999 
  respectively, on charges laid under ss. 27(1), 27(2), 40(1), and 42(1) of the 
  <i>Regulated Health Professions Act, </i>1991,<i> </i>S.O. 1991, c. 18, as amended 
  (<i>RHPA</i>), and s. 77(1) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. P. 33 (<i>POA</i>). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. Wadden was 
  convicted of performing the controlled act of dispensing eye glasses for vision 
  or eye problems in the course of providing health care services to an individual 
  without being a member authorized by a health professions act, to perform the 
  controlled act. Braddock Optical was convicted on the basis of being Ms. Wadden’s 
  employer. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The issues on 
  appeal are whether the retail sale of prescription eye glasses falls within 
  the scope of “providing health care services to an individual”, and what constitutes 
  the proper definition of “dispensing” prescription eye glasses under the <i>RHPA</i>. 
  A specific issue arises concerning whether “risk of harm” plays any role in 
  the definition of these concepts.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       While working 
  at Braddock Optical on February 6, 13 and 19, 1997, Ms. Wadden served and sold 
  a pair of prescription bifocal eye glasses to a Mr. Barker. Ms. Wadden was the 
  only employee working during the times in question. Mr. Barker is a private 
  investigator hired by the College of Opticians of Ontario (the “College”). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. Wadden was 
  a registered optician for eye glasses in Nova Scotia. Following a move to Ontario, 
  she chose not to pursue the four-year program required for her to register here.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       In making a finding 
  of guilt against Ms. Wadden, the trial judge noted that the <i>RHPA </i>does 
  not define “dispensing”. After hearing expert evidence he found that dispensing 
  means “the preparation, adaptation and delivery of eye glasses, … to a person.” 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The trial judge 
  listed the activities performed by Ms. Wadden as part of serving Mr. Barker 
  and selling eye glasses to him. These activities included: greeting the customer, 
  showing him frames, commenting on their appearance, discussing bifocals, determining 
  whether the customer wanted bifocals with lines, discussing lens materials and 
  coatings, taking facial measurements, including the distance between his cornea 
  and the centre of his nose, asking the customer to read with the glasses, and 
  adjusting the arm piece and fit. He found that “each of the acts of Ms. Wadden 
  constituted dispensing” and that they “fit within the definition” that he had 
  stated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Of note, the trial 
  judge stated that he did “not accept the submission that dispensing is not part 
  of prescribing” and that there was “sufficient evidence to establish beyond 
  a reasonable doubt a risk of harm in the dispensing of eye glasses to adults”. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The judge hearing 
  the original appeal under the <i>POA </i>made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The findings of the trial judge were reasonable and supported by the evidence. 
      Further, I find no fault with his application of the law. </p>
    <p>He found that an unauthorized person was performing controlled acts, namely 
      “dispensing”, contrary to s. 27(2)(a).</p>
    <p>He accepted that such activity constituted a risk of harm to the public, 
      pursuant to evidence presented.</p>
    <p>He did not apply the standard of care set out in s. 30 to the prohibitions 
      set out in s. 27.</p>
    <p>He was correct to ignore s. 30 because, despite the lack of clarity in 
      the section with respect to its application, s. 30 is a so called “basket” 
      clause which applies to situations not contemplated or specified in s. 27. 
    </p>
    <p>A review of the information from committee hearings and Hansard prior to 
      the enactment of the legislation leads one to the conclusion that the Legislators 
      considered that a risk of harm was implicit in the prohibited acts specified 
      in s. 27 with which I agree.</p>
    <p>The penalties were well within the reasonable discretion of the Trial Judge.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The term “health care services” is not defined in the <i>RHPA</i>. The 
  appellants point out that many appropriately trained, but unlicensed individuals 
  perform consultative, measuring, fitting, and clerical duties in optometrist’s 
  and ophthalmologist’s offices but are not liable to conviction because their 
  acts are delegated by a regulated profession that permits delegation. They also 
  point out that over-the-counter reading glasses are sold in drug, hardware, 
  book, and department stores across Canada. Consumers simply choose a pair of 
  glasses that suits their needs without assistance from a health care professional. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Consumers have the ability to choose how much to spend when purchasing 
  eye glasses based on a variety of choices including the style of frames, lens 
  type, lens coatings, and ultimately, where and from whom to buy the product. 
  The appellants submit that the sale of eye glasses to visually mature individuals 
  is a retail function that does not meet a common sense definition of the provision 
  of “health care services”. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the alternative, the appellants say that the only aspect of “dispensing” 
  prescription eye glasses to adults that constitutes a health care service is 
  the final verification by an optician that the product delivered corresponds 
  with the prescription that was given. The appellants say that there was no evidence 
  presented to demonstrate that Ms. Wadden undertook the “verification aspect” 
  of dispensing. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although neither the trial judge nor the Provincial Appeals court judge 
  specifically alluded to the issue of whether dispensing prescription eye glasses 
  to an adult constitutes “providing a health care service to an individual”, 
  I am not persuaded that either judge erred in failing to do so. </p>

  </span> The origins of the <i>RHPA</i> lie in the Health Professions Legislative 
  Review,<i> Striking a New Balance: A Blueprint for the Regulation of Ontario’s 
  Health Professions </i>(Toronto: The Review, 1989), generally referred to as 
  the Schwartz Report. The Executive Summary to that report includes the following 
  comments:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Review’s mandate was to make recommendations to the Minister in the 
      form of draft legislation, with respect to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>-which health professions should be regulated;</p>
        <p>-updating and reforming the Health Disciplines Act; [and]</p>
        <p>-devising a new structure for all legislation governing the health  
          professions</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Through professional regulation<i> the nature and quality of health care 
      services can be regulated.</i> Professional regulation is aimed at advancing 
      the public interest, not the interests of the professions. The Review’s 
      recommendations are aimed at advancing the public interest in four ways:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>-Protecting the public, to the extent possible, from unqualified, incompetent 
          and unfit health care providers.</p>
        <p>-Developing mechanisms to encourage the provision of high quality care.</p>
        <p>-Permitting the public to exercise freedom of choice of health care 
          provider within a range of safe options.</p>
        <p>-Promoting evolution in the roles played by individual professions 
          and flexibility in how individual professionals can be utilized, so 
          that health services are delivered with maximum efficiency. [emphasis 
          added]</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Review recommends that a uniform or omnibus Health Professions Procedural 
      Code be enacted and that the Code be coupled with an individual Professional 
      Act for every profession … to be regulated.</p>

  </span> As noted in the executive summary of the Schwartz Report the very purpose 
  of the <i>RHPA</i> is to regulate the provision of health care services. “Opticianry” 
  is designated as a self-governing <i>health care</i> profession by virtue of 
  Schedule 1 to the <i>RHPA</i>. The services Ms. Wadden provided to Mr. Barker 
  are clearly within the scope of practice of opticianry, namely the provision, 
  fitting and adjustment of eye glasses. By definition Ms. Wadden was providing 
  health care services to Mr. Barker when she sold him a pair of prescription 
  eye glasses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Did the Provincial Appeals 
  Court Judge and the Trial Judge Err in Defining Dispensing?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants submit that the trial judge erred by failing to define 
  the controlled act of dispensing eye glasses in terms of risk of harm; by finding 
  that dispensing is part of prescribing; by finding that dispensing eye glasses 
  to a person of visual maturity presents a risk of harm; and by failing to define 
  the controlled act of dispensing within the spirit and intent of the <i>RHPA</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants’ first and fourth submissions rest on the premise that 
  the purpose and intent of the <i>RHPA</i> is to move away from a restrictive 
  predecessor regulatory scheme, which they say created professional monopolies 
  by prohibiting unlicensed persons from performing activities that fell within 
  the “scope of practice” of a particular profession. The appellants submit that 
  the purpose and intent of the <i>RHPA</i> is to restrict unlicensed persons 
  from performing only those health care activities that are associated with risk 
  of harm. Unlicensed persons are no longer restricted from activities based on 
  a profession’s scope of practice under the <i>RHPA</i>. Rather, they are prohibited 
  only from performing the “controlled acts” listed in s. 27(2), and are subject 
  to the “basket clause” prohibition set out in s. 30. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants accordingly submit that before determining whether a 
  particular activity falls within the purview of a controlled act, the court 
  should assess the risk of harm associated with that activity. Moreover, the 
  standard of risk that should inform the definition, interpretation, and threshold 
  of the controlled acts listed in s. 27(2) is that set out in s. 30. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I reject this submission. I agree that one purpose of the <i>RHPA</i> 
  is to limit the health care activities that unlicensed persons are prohibited 
  from performing to those specific activities associated with a risk of harm. 
  In my view, however, a primary purpose of the <i>RHPA</i> is to protect the 
  public from risk. Section 27(2) does not delegate identification of the level 
  of risk to be protected to the court. Rather, the Legislature signalled its 
  intent as to the level of risk to be protected by listing the prohibited activities 
  that constitute controlled acts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Again, I adopt the views of Laskin J.A., as set out in <i>M.F. v. Sutherland, 
  supra,</i> at pages 306-7, concerning the appropriate approach to interpretation 
  of the legislation:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>A basic principle of statutory interpretation is that the court should 
      adopt the ordinary meaning of a legislative provision absent a good reason 
      to reject it. The ordinary meaning is presumed to be the intended or most 
      appropriate meaning unless the context, or the purpose and scheme of the 
      legislation, or the consequences of adopting the ordinary meaning suggest 
      otherwise. Professor Ruth Sullivan, who edited the third edition of <i>Driedger 
      on the Construction of Statutes</i>, sets out the presumption in favour 
      of the ordinary meaning:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span> [2] </span></a></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p> 1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It is presumed 
          that the ordinary meaning of a legislative text is the intended or most 
          appropriate meaning. In the absence of a reason to reject it, the ordinary 
          meaning prevails.</p>
        <p> 2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Even where 
          the ordinary meaning of a legislative text appears to be clear, the 
          courts must consider the purpose and scheme of the legislation, and 
          the consequences of adopting this meaning. They must take into account 
          all relevant indicators of legislative meaning.</p>
        <p> 3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In light 
          of these additional considerations, the court may adopt an interpretation 
          in which the ordinary meaning is modified or rejected. That interpretation, 
          however, must be plausible; that is, it must be one the words are reasonably 
          capable of bearing.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see nothing in the language of the <i>RHPA</i> that indicates that, 
  in interpreting the meaning of a particular controlled act, courts are to engage 
  in a risk analysis. Rather, the plain meaning of the words, and any meaning 
  that may be commonly understood in the respective professions, defines the scope 
  of a controlled act and determines the level of risk to be protected. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here the trial judge heard expert evidence as to the meaning of dispensing.  
  He defined the term in a manner consistent with that evidence, dictionary definitions 
  and the definition of dispensing as it appeared in predecessor legislation. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For example, the defence expert optician agreed that dispensing an optical 
  prescription for eye glasses would include: “selection, designing, measuring, 
  manufacturing, verification, fitting/delivery”.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> “Ophthalmic dispensing” was formerly defined in s. 1 of the <i>Ophthalmic 
  Dispensers Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.43 as the:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (a)<span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no error in the definition of dispensing adopted by the trial 
  judge. However, I add that I do not view the words chosen by him as exclusive 
  or all encompassing. Further, I wish to clarify that I do not equate the term 
  “preparation” with “fabrication”. Rather, I view its meaning as “all actions 
  necessary to be performed prior to adaptation and delivery”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I reject the appellants submission that “risk of harm” should be 
  assessed before determining whether particular activities fall within the purview 
  of a controlled act or should inform the definition of dispensing, it is unnecessary 
  to deal with whether the trial and Provincial Appeals court judges erred in 
  finding that dispensing eye glasses to a person of visual maturity presents 
  a risk of harm. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree that the trial judge overstated his conclusion when he said 
  of the activities performed by Ms. Wadden: “[e]ach act was an act of dispensing”. 
  I observe, however, that dispensing may be a single act or part of a continuum 
  of activities. Carried out in isolation, activities such as commenting on the 
  appearance of frames, and receiving payment would not in and of themselves constitute 
  dispensing. Nevertheless, I find no error in the trial judge’s overall finding 
  of guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge made an obvious error when he said,  “I do not accept 
  the submission that dispensing is not part of prescribing.” Each of the terms 
  “dispensing” and “prescribing” clearly forms a distinct part of the activity 
  prohibited by s. 27(2) 9. I am not however persuaded that this error impacts 
  in any way on the validity of the trial judge’s other conclusions. </p>
