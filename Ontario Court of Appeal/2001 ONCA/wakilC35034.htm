<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Milton A. Cadsby dated September 
  16, 1998.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As Crown counsel indicates in his factum, this was a case of welfare 
  fraud by non-disclosure.  It is common ground that the appellant did not disclose 
  to welfare authorities that he was receiving a loan from his cousin to make 
  the monthly payments on a vehicle he had purchased.  It is also common ground 
  that disclosure of this loan to the welfare authorities would have reduced the 
  appellant’s welfare entitlement by some $20,000 over the relevant time period.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant first applied for welfare in March 1992.  He indicated 
  that he had no income, revenue, earnings, or support, and no other financial 
  resources to which he was entitled.  He declared that he owned a car.  A month 
  later, the appellant’s cousin began to lend the appellant money needed to make 
  the monthly payments on the car.  It would seem that the cousin in fact made 
  the payments, or at least most of them, directly to the finance company.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In September 1993, the appellant was required to make a new application 
  for welfare.  He did not disclose that he still owned the vehicle.  In response 
  to a question about income, earnings, revenue, support or other financial resources 
  to which he was entitled, the appellant did not disclose the loan from his cousin.  
  None of the questions put to the appellant specifically referred to loan advances 
  made to the appellant or to monies being paid on the appellant’s behalf to his 
  creditors.  Nor did the case workers specifically ask the appellant about any 
  loans he may be receiving at the time of his application.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown argued that the appellant knew that the questions put to him 
  were directed to disclosure of any and all sources from which the appellant 
  was receiving money, and that the appellant understood that he was required 
  to disclose the loan, but chose deliberately not to disclose it because he knew 
  disclosure would affect the amount of welfare received.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, the defence argued that there was no obligation to disclose 
  the loan until September 1993, and that even after the regulation was introduced 
  to clarify the requirement to disclose the loan, a reasonable person would not 
  have understood from the questions posed on the relevant forms that he or she 
  was required to disclose the existence of the loan.  This argument was made 
  in support of the position that the non-disclosure did not amount to a dishonest 
  act and, therefore, could not be a “fraudulent means” within the meaning of 
  s. 380 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The defence also argued that even if a 
  reasonable person would have understood that there was an obligation to disclose 
  the loan, the appellant, in part because of his relative lack of commercial 
  sophistication, and in part because of his unfamiliarity with the English language, 
  did not understand that the questions referred to the loan made to him by his 
  cousin.  This argument was made in support of the contention that the appellant 
  did not knowingly fail to disclose material information and, therefore, did 
  not have the <i>mens rea</i> required for fraud.  The defence relied on the 
  appellant’s evidence and the absence of any reference to loan advances in the 
  questions posed by the welfare authorities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge appears to have merged 
  the two issues raised by the defence into a single issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Defence counsel submits that the regulation changes the meaning of the 
      word “loan” as a layman would understand it, in the sense of a loan being 
      regarded as income and that the Defendant ought not to be expected to know 
      that.</p>
    <p>I don’t think the Court can make up a special rule for this Defendant or 
      any other prospective defendant – or any other recipient would be a better 
      way of putting it, of welfare.</p>
    <p>I can’t say he’s not fluent in English or he doesn’t seem to be a very 
      bright individual so he’s excused for not knowing about it.</p>
    <p>The General Welfare Assistance Act is for the assistance of needy people 
      in the community.  The regulations deal with entitlement of payment under 
      the Act.</p>
    <p>In this case this man was receiving assistance for five years.  A young 
      man.  He couldn’t secure employment for five years.  So that he received 
      a very substantial amount of money from the community to support himself 
      and his wife.</p>
    <p>The distribution of this money must be under regulation, which must be 
      adhered to.  So I don’t think it’s an answer to this allegation, which is 
      one of fraud by non-disclosure, to say that he’s not expected to know that 
      a loan is considered income under the Act.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>While I’ve said that I thought he was a person of fairly low intellect, 
      I don’t believe a Court can approach the matter on that basis and treat 
      one welfare recipient different than the other and certainly unless there’s 
      very compelling reasons, which there isn’t in this case.</p>
    <p>He didn’t answer the questions that he should have answered about his motor 
      vehicle and the financing of it when a reasonable person seeking this kind 
      of support from the community would know he had to do it.</p>
    <p>He decided he was going to hang onto the car, hang onto the ownership of 
      the car by this arrangement with his cousin and keep quiet about it as far 
      as the welfare assistance program was concerned.  That constitutes fraud.</p>
    <p>He made a mistake.  Had he been honest and upfront, he wouldn’t have been 
      in the position he’s in now.</p>
    <p>In any event, I’m satisfied that the non-disclosure was intended to hide 
      his actual financial position from the Municipality for the purpose of receiving 
      the welfare assistance that he was receiving, and I find him guilty of the 
      offence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the last three paragraphs referred to above indicate that the 
  non-disclosure of the loan was deliberate and knowing, they follow immediately 
  upon an analysis in which the trial judge excluded from his consideration personal 
  factors that were potentially very important to the determination of the appellant’s 
  state of mind.  Considering the reasons in their totality, we must conclude 
  that the trial judge failed to consider the question of <i>mens rea</i> separate 
  and apart from that of the <i>actus reus</i>.  He failed to determine whether 
  on the totality of the evidence the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that this appellant knew that the loan made to him by his cousin had to be disclosed 
  to the welfare authorities.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did find that the appellant knowingly failed to disclose 
  his continued ownership of the motor vehicle  That finding was certainly open 
  to him on the evidence.  The finding that the appellant lied to the welfare 
  authorities about the car was certainly relevant to his credibility and relevant 
  to the question whether he knowingly failed to disclose the loan as well.  The 
  two questions were not, however, one in the same and the finding that he knowingly 
  lied to the welfare authorities concerning the ownership of the vehicle, standing 
  alone, does not support a conviction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the appeal must be allowed.  As there was evidence to support 
  a conviction, a new trial must be ordered.  In ordering a new trial, we observe 
  that the ultimate determination of whether a new trial should be held is, of 
  course, up to the Crown.  It may well be that given the passage of time and 
  the nature of the evidence, that the Crown will choose to expend its resources 
  in other places, particularly if it can recover the over payments in some other 
  way.</p>
