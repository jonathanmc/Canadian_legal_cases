    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal arises out of an intended class 
    proceeding under the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>,<i> 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, 
    c. 6, which remains to be certified.  On April 13, 1987, Wendy Ward-Price 
    (“the appellant”) entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with Mariners 
    Haven Inc. (“Mariners”) for the purchase of a condominium unit.  The agreement 
    required that the appellant pay the entire purchase price of $340,000 prior 
    to taking possession of the unit, but made no provision for the payment of 
    interest on her deposit.  Mariners placed the deposit into a trust account 
    and insured the funds with the Ontario New Home Warranty Program and the Mortgage 
    Insurance Company of Canada.  Subsequently, Mariners paid the deposit funds 
    to William H. Kaufman Inc. (“WHK”) in partial repayment of a building loan.  
    From January 1988 to December 31, 1990, contemporaneous with most of the closings, 
    Mariners made loan repayments to WHK exceeding $12,000,000.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant took early possession of her 
    unit on July 15, 1988.  By declaration registered on June 27, 1989, the condominium 
    was registered as Simcoe Condominium Corporation No. 94.  The final closing 
    took place on August 16, 1989, at which time the appellant became the registered 
    owner of her unit.  Interest payable on her deposit, as required by s. 53(3) 
    of the Act, was not calculated on the statement of adjustments and was not 
    paid.  This action was brought to recover the interest payable on her deposit, 
    as well as on the deposits paid by the other members of the purchaser class.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition to Mariners, the defendants are 
    William H. Kaufman, Stuart Snyder and WHK.  At the relevant time, Mr. Kaufman 
    and Mr. Snyder were directors, officers and shareholders of Mariners and WHK, 
    as well as directors, officers and shareholders of corporations which controlled, 
    directly or indirectly, Mariners and WHK.  It is alleged, in the alternative, 
    that they were recipients of material benefits from Mariners which are answerable 
    to the appellant’s claim.  Mariners is without assets and the action against 
    WHK has been stayed pursuant to s. 69.1 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her statement of claim the appellant seeks 
    a deposit interest entitlement of $36,761.50.  Her claim against Mr. Kaufman 
    and Mr. Snyder is founded on the allegation that s. 53(1) of the <i>Condominium 
    Act</i> imposes a statutory trust on the interest payable on all money received 
    by Mariners on account of the purchase price and that Mariner’s was in breach 
    of trust in failing to pay interest on that money.  The appellant alleges 
    that if she and the other purchasers had been credited with interest on closing 
    or had been paid interest, WHK would have received less money from Mariners 
    toward the repayment of its loans.  She alleges that Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Snyder 
    knowingly assisted Mariners in its breach of trust and knowingly received 
    trust funds flowing from the breach of trust.  She alleges that WHK was a 
    knowing recipient of trust money.  Hence, the appellant claims that she is 
    entitled to an equitable tracing of the monies that were paid to WHK by Mariners.</span></p>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>The third party law firm submits that 
      although Mariners had an obligation pursuant to s. 53(1) of the Act to hold 
      the deposits in trust, that obligation ceased when Mariners obtained the 
      prescribed security through the insurance.  It is their position that the 
      delivery to the purchasers of the insurance permitted the moneys held in 
      trust to then be released and that the trust created by s. 53(1) thereby 
      ceased to exist.  The third party submits that the obligation to pay interest 
      under s. 53(3) is not a trust obligation.  Accordingly, the third party 
      submits there is no genuine breach of trust issue for trial.</span></div>

    analysis of the purpose of s. 53 and the obligations which the section imposes 
    on a developer:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>The underlying policy of s. 53 is to 
      protect consumer purchasers who generally are not in equal bargaining positions 
      with developers.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><i><span lang=EN-US><br>
      Section 53(1) provides for the creation of a trust by statute.  Moneys paid 
      towards the purchase price are to be held in the requisite trust account 
      “until” one of the two events in s. 53(1)(a) and (b) occurs.</span></i><span lang=EN-US>  
      Disposition of the trust moneys may be made to the developer at closing, 
      upon completion of the developer’s obligations under the purchase contract: 
      s. <br>
      53(1)(a).  However, if the developer was unable to close the transaction, 
      the purchaser would be entitled to the return of trust moneys.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      The developer is entitled to the interest that has been earned on the money 
      in the trust account: s. 53(4).  However, this entitlement is subject to 
      the stipulations imposed by s. 53(2) and (3).</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      Section 53(2) protects a purchaser who is entitled to the return of moneys 
      paid by requiring the developer to pay interest at the prescribed rate on 
      those moneys.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      Section 53(3) <i>imposes an interest obligation upon the developer</i> when 
      the purchaser enters into possession of the unit before a final closing 
      and a deed or transfer acceptable for registration is delivered to the purchaser.

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In concluding that s. 53(3) imposes a debt 
    obligation with respect to interest payable on purchase monies paid by purchasers, 
    rather than a trust obligation, the motion judge considered the reasons of 
    Adams J. in <i>Counsel Holding Canada Ltd. v. Chanel Club Ltd.</i> (1997), 
    33 O.R. (3d) 285 (Gen. Div.) aff’d. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 319 (C.A.) and the

      (at p. 296). </span></div>

    in <i>Ackland</i>, which dealt with a developer’s obligation under s. 53(3) 
    to pay interest on all funds received by it on account of the purchase price 
    of a unit, where a purchaser enters into possession or occupation of the unit 
    before closing.  The issue in <i>Ackland</i> was the proper rate of interest 
    payable by the developer on the funds as stipulated by s. 33 of Regulation 
    121.  Cumming J. observed that the developer in <i>Ackland</i> was obliged 
    by s. 53(3) to pay the purchaser interest during the period of interim occupancy.

      of a trustee </i>and it is with this particular aspect of the relationship 
      only that we are concerned . . . <i>this fiduciary relationship is of direct

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Plaintiff’s counsel in the case at hand 
      submits that <i>Ackland</i> is authority for his submission that s. 53(3) 
      <i>in itself</i> creates or recognizes a trust with respect to the interest 
      payable to the purchaser under that provision.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      I do not agree with this submission as to the decision in <i>Ackland</i> 
      which is, of course, binding on this court.  In my view, Morden A.C.J.O.’s 
      quoted statement recognizes the statutory trust which is clearly created 
      by s. 53(1).  The corpus of the moneys held in trust pursuant to s. 53(1) 
      belongs beneficially to the purchaser, and not the developer, until one 
      of the two circumstances contemplated by s. 53(1) occurs and terminates 
      the trust.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      A trust involves a fiduciary relationship and imposes duties upon the trustee.  
      This fiduciary relationship is relevant “in interpreting the scope of the 
      obligation to pay interest on the money held in trust”: <i>Ackland</i>, 
      at p. 107.  In interpreting the Regulation as to the prescribed rate intended 
      to apply to s. 53(3), the statutory trust created by s. 53(1) provides an 
      instructive backdrop.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      The result in <i>Ackland</i> is logical and fair, particularly when the 
      declarant can earn interest on the corpus of the trust at a higher rate 
      than the rate which the developer in <i>Ackland</i> proposed to pay to the 
      purchaser.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      In my view, <i>Ackland</i> is not authority for the plaintiff’s assertion 
      that s. 53(3) creates<i> a trust</i> with respect to the interest entitlement.  
      It is only s. 53(1) that creates a trust.  The Court of Appeal in <i>Ackland</i> 
      held that in interpreting the Regulations to determine the proper prescribed 
      interest rate for the purpose of applying s. 53(3), the statutory trust 
      created by s. 53(1) is relevant.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      In the case at hand, the trust created by s. 53(1) was terminated by reason  
      of s. 53(1)(b) upon the purchase and delivery of the “prescribed security” 
      through the deposit receipts.  This was done prior to the interim occupancy 
      by the purchasers and before the developer became obligated to pay interest 
      during the occupancy period prior to final closing.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, and I so find, the obligation to pay interest under s. 
      53(3) is not a trust obligation.  Rather, it is a debt obligation created 
      by statute.</span></div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Thus, the overall scheme of s. 53 provides 
      that upon the termination of the trust created by s. 53(1) through the delivery 
      of the prescribed security (and the release of the trust moneys to the developer), 
      there is insurance in place to protect the purchaser in the event of a claim 
      for interest under s. 53(3).</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US><br>
      For the reasons given, in my view, there is no trust obligation under s. 
      53(3).  Since there is no trust obligation, there is no genuine issue for 
      trial with respect to breach of trust.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge erred in interpreting 
    s. 53(3) as creating a debt obligation, and not a trust obligation, in respect 
    of the interest payable by a developer under that subsection.  I have no doubt 
    that s. 53(3) constitutes a developer as a debtor of the purchaser in respect 
    to interest payable by the developer on purchase money while the purchaser 
    is in interim occupancy.  However, as I will explain, that does not extinguish 
    the statutory trust imposed by s. 53(1) on “all money received by . . . a 
    proposed declarant from a purchaser on account of a sale or agreement of purchase 
    and sale” of a unit.  This includes a trust imposed on a developer on the 
    interest payable on that money under s. 53(3).  In my opinion, this conclusion 
    is supported by the reasons of Morden A.C.J.O. in this court’s decision in 
    <i>Ackland</i>.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this action, the appellant seeks to vindicate 
    her property right in the interest payable to her on money held in trust for 
    her by the developer.  She intends to establish that the respondents are in 
    receipt of property, or its traceable proceeds, which belongs beneficially 
    to her.  It is, therefore, necessary to consider in more detail the appellant’s 
    claim and the legal principles on which she relies.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Stated simply, the appellant submits that when 
    the developer failed to pay her interest on her purchase money as required 
    by s. 53(3) for the time that she was in interim occupancy of her unit, the 
    developer breached the trust imposed on the purchase money by s. 53(1).  Central 
    to this submission is the claim is that interest payable on the purchase money 
    is trust property because the purchase money is trust property; in failing 
    to pay interest, the developer therefore misappropriated trust property.  
    The appellant’s prime remedy for this breach of trust is against the developer 
    personally for compensation for the loss to the trust resulting from the failure 
    to pay interest.  However, as the developer is financially unable to provide 
    compensation, as the beneficiary of the trust the appellant asserts a proprietary 
    remedy to make good the loss.  By seeking to recover the misappropriated trust 
    property from the respondents, the appellant seeks restitution from the respondents 
    on the ground that property in which she has a right of ownership can be followed 
    or traced into their hands.  See D.W.M. Waters, <i>Law of Trusts in Canada</i>, 
    2nd ed., (Toronto: Carswell, 1984), at p. 1033 <i>et seq.</i>; R. M. Goode,

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Generally, the appellant’s claim is based on 
    her equitable proprietary interest in identified property.  However, it is 
    helpful to identify her interest more precisely.  She has an absolute equitable 
    interest in the purchase money by virtue of the statutory trust imposed by 
    s. 53(1) and, by virtue of s. 53(3), she has an equitable interest in the 
    interest payable on that money while she was in interim occupancy of her unit.  
    This case does not involve any question of constructive or resulting trusts.  
    The only trust in issue is the express statutory trust created by s. 53(1).  
    Although it may be argued that this trust lacks, in some respects, the three 
    certainties of intention, object and subject-matter, this does not effect 
    its essential character as a trust.  As McLachlin J. pointed out in <i>British 
    Columbia v. Henfrey Samson Blair Ltd.</i> (1989), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 726 (S.C.C.) 
    at 742: “The provinces may define ‘trust’ as </span><span lang=EN-US

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Reading s. 53 in its entirety, depending on 
    the circumstances, the appellant, as purchaser, is entitled to equitable proprietary 
    interests in the purchase money and interest thereon.  Had the transaction 
    been terminated as a result of the developer’s default, the appellant would 
    have had an equitable proprietary interest in the purchase money, as well 
    as in the interest payable thereon by virtue of s. 53(2).  However, because 
    the transaction closed after the appellant was in interim occupancy, the developer 
    obtained an equitable interest in the purchase money while, by virtue of s. 
    53(3), the appellant acquired an equitable proprietary interest in the interest 
    payable on that money while she was in interim occupancy.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is the appellant’s position that her equitable 
    proprietary interest arising from the statutory trust are enforceable against 
    whomever for the time being holds the property.  On the authority of <i>Ministry 
    of Health v. Simpson, supra</i>, the appellant asserts that if, as a result 
    of tracing, it can be determined that the interest monies have come into the 
    possession of the respondents in circumstances in which the law permits her 
    to obtain recovery, she has an absolute proprietary interest in such monies.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, should the developer, as trustee, 
    breach that trust by making wrongful use of the funds, it makes sense to interpret 
    s. 53(3) both in the context of the entire section and in conformity with 
    the proprietary remedy available to the purchaser.  Given that the beneficiary 
    of a trust has the right to trace assets that have been wrongfully distributed, 
    and given that the tracing includes any interest which the assets may have 
    earned, it follows that a trust imposed by statute, or a trust deed, on the 
    assets of a trust necessarily constitutes a trust imposed on the interest.  
    This is particularly true in this case, where by statute the trustee must 
    account to the beneficiary for the interest.  The legislature is presumed 
    to know the remedy for breach of trust and to have drafted s. 53 in accordance 
    with that remedy.  See F. Bennion, <i>Statutory Interpretation</i>, (Toronto: 
    Butterworths, 1997) at pp. 827-830.  Therefore, s. 53(3) should be interpreted 
    to conform with the proprietary remedy available to the purchaser should the 
    developer breach the trust imposed on the purchase money by s. 53(1).</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In interpreting s. 53, the nature and purpose 
    of the <i>Condominium Act</i> is also helpful.  It is well recognized that 
    the Act is consumer protection legislation.  The trust created by s. 53(1) 
    is for the protection of purchasers.  Subsections (2) and (3) further protect 
    purchasers by ensuring, in the circumstances provided for, that they receive 
    interest on their deposits.  As the motion judge recognized at p. 791, it 
    has been held, including by this court in <i>Ackland</i> at p. 105, that the 
    purpose of s. 53(3) “is to provide an incentive to the developer to register 
    the condominium corporation and transfer title to the purchaser of the condominium 
    unit as soon as possible after the purchaser has taken occupancy”.  Applying 
    a purposive approach to the interpretation of s. 53(3) therefore provides 
    further support for my view that s. 53(3) is to be interpreted to give effect 
    to the trust created by s. 53(1).</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I understand the reasons of the motion judge, 
    he adopted the view of Adams J. in <i>Counsel,</i> that the obligation of 
    the developer to retain the purchase money in a trust account comes to an 
    end upon the delivery to the purchaser of the prescribed security referred 
    to in s. 53(1)(b).  I do not take issue with this interpretation of s. 53(1)(b).  
    It makes good commercial sense to interpret s. 53(1)(b) as providing that 
    once security is received by a purchaser, the amount of purchase monies covered 
    by the security can be removed from the trust account by the developer.  I 
    agree with Adams J.’s conclusion at p. 295 that “[t]he purpose of the [prescribed 
    security] is to permit a vendor to release deposit funds from trust”.  Reading 
    this statement in the context of his reasons, Adams J. meant that the developer 
    could remove from the statutory trust account the amount corresponding to 
    the coverage provided by the insurance.  However, it is my view that the provision 
    of security under s. 53(1)(b) does not terminate the trust obligation imposed 
    on the developer by s. 53(1)  on the <i>entire</i> amount of purchase monies 
    it receives from a purchaser. Such an interpretation would defeat the purpose 
    of the statutory trust imposed by the legislation.  That trust is imposed 
    on the entirety of the purchase monies, including the interest payable on 
    the purchaser monies pursuant to subsections 53(2) and (3), which the developer, 
    as trustee of the purchase monies, must pay thereon.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To be sure, s. 53(1) is not a model of legislative 
    drafting.  Nonetheless,  it should be read as affecting two objects: (1) imposing 
    a trust on the developer for the benefit of a purchaser on all money received 
    from the purchaser on account of the purchase price; and (2) requiring the 
    developer to hold the money in a separate trust account until (a) its disposition 
    to the person entitled to the money, or (b) the delivery of the prescribed 
    security to the purchaser.   While it is correct that payment of the purchase 
    money to either the developer or the purchaser under s. 53(1)(a), or the delivery 
    of security to the purchaser under s. 53(1)(b), permits the developer to remove 
    the purchase money from the separate trust account in which it must be held, 
    neither terminates the trust created by s. 53(1).  That trust remains until 
    the termination of the agreement of purchase and sale and the return of the 
    purchase money, with interest, to the purchaser under s. 53(2), or the payment 
    of the purchase money to the appropriate party under s. 53(1)(a).  While I 
    agree with the motion judge that s. 53(3) imposes a debt obligation on the 
    developer to pay interest on purchase money, because the provision of security 
    under s. 53(1)(b) does not terminate the trust, the debt obligation imposed 
    by s. 53(3) is a debt obligation to pay interest on trust funds.</span></p>

    language of either s. 53(2) or s. 53(3) which provides that the developer’s 
    obligation to pay interest on the purchase money terminates with the delivery 
    of the prescribed security under s. 53(1)(b).  This supports my opinion that 
    the entire amount of the purchase money continues to be impressed with a trust, 
    including interest payable thereon, until the interest is paid.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I find further support for my view that the 
    purchase money trust created by s. 53(1) is not terminated by s. 53(1)(b) 
    in s. 33 of Regulation 121, which is a helpful aid in interpreting s. 53(3).  
    Section 33 stipulates the rate of interest payable under subsections 53(2) 
    and (3) “on money held in trust” under subsection 53(1).  If the legislature 
    had intended for the trust to be terminated, in whole or in part, on the occurrence 
    of the circumstances contained in subsection 53(1)(a) or (b), the legislation 
    would have provided that after the prescribed security has been given to a 
    purchaser, interest is no longer payable.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it does not make commercial sense 
    to deprive the purchaser of interest on money of which he or she is the beneficial 
    owner during the time that the developer continues to have the use of it.  
    It is only on the closing of the purchase and sale or the failure of the transaction 
    to be completed as a result of the purchaser’s default that the money ceases 
    to be the property of the purchaser and becomes the property of the developer.  
    To  interpret s. 53(3) to produce the result that the statutory trust impressed 
    on the purchase money fails to extend to interest which that money has earned 
    would simply not accord with commercial reality.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A convenient way to test my interpretation 
    of s. 53(1)(b) is to ask what effect, if any, on the trust imposed on the 
    purchase money would result from the developer’s failure to hold the money 
    in a separate trust account.  The answer in my view is that it would have 
    no effect.  Because the legislation has said that the purchase money is trust 
    money, it is immaterial whether the purchase money is in fact kept separate 
    and apart from the developer’s own money: <i>cf. Re Deslauriers Construction 
    Products Ltd</i>. (1970), 13 D.L.R. (3d) 551 (Ont. C.A.).  Similarly, the 
    purchase money continues to be held in trust by the developer even when the 
    developer is entitled to remove it from a trust account upon the provision 
    of the security prescribed by s. 53(1)(b).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, to hold that the statutory trust 
    imposed on the purchase money for the purchaser’s protection is terminated 
    on the provision of security under s. 53(1)(b) would render the trust meaningless.  
    The trust is intended to create a broader range of remedies for a purchaser 
    than would be available if only a debtor-creditor relationship existed.  It 
    does this by providing the traditional remedies available to a beneficiary 
    when there has been a breach of trust.  Indeed, the trust is also intended 
    to protect the purchaser in the event of the developer’s insolvency, which 
    is the situation in this case.</span></p>

      <p><span lang=EN-US>The new account, on the facts of this case, clearly

        for the proposed declarant to register the condominium corporation and 
        transfer title to the purchaser of the condominium unit as soon as possible 
        after the purchaser has entered into occupation.  In <i>Berman v. Karleton 
        Co. Ltd.</i> (1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 176, 24 R.P.R. 8 (H.C.J.), Gray J. said

    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>The intent of the Act is clearly that the purchaser be paid interest 
        on money paid to the vendor on account of purchase price during the interim 
        occupancy period before a registrable deed or transfer is delivered.  
        The reason for doing so is to protect purchasers of proposed condominium 
        units from abuses by vendors who delay in registering declarations by 
        providing an incentive to register quickly.</span></div>

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>There is a further aspect of the provision’s 
      purpose, <i>one related to a matter of legal context.  The money for which 
      the interest is paid is held by the proposed declarant as a trustee in a 
      separate trust account.</i>  The money held in trust, belongs, beneficially, 
      to the purchaser and not to the proposed declarant.  <i>It is the most fundamental 
      duty of a trustee to administer the trust solely in the interest of the 
      beneficiary and a trustee is not permitted to profit at the expense of the 
      beneficiary</i>: see <i>Scott on Trusts</i>, 3rd ed. (1967), Vol. I at p. 
      39, and Vol. II at pp. 1297-98.  <i>I think that the trust obligation clearly 
      extends to the duty to pay interest based on the higher rate, particularly 
      where the proposed declarant may enjoy an increased personal benefit from 
      paying it on the basis of the lower rate.</i>  This legal consideration 
      is an important part of the context for determining the proper application

      <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>It seems to me to be consistent with

        rate, the higher or lower one, be determined by the amount held in trust.</span></div>

    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the trust aspect point, Keenan J. said:</span></p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>While the relationship of the developer 
        declarant and the condominium purchasers gives rise to obligations of 
        a fiduciary nature, such as holding deposits in trust, it is not <i>per 
        se</i> a fiduciary relationship.  It is primarily a contractual relationship 
        and the rights and obligations are set out in the contract.  A statutory 
        obligation is separate and while it may impose a duty on the declarant 
        for the protection of the purchaser, it does not impose a duty on the 
        declarant to extend the scope of the duty beyond that which is clearly 
        recited in the statute.</span></div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>With respect, while the basic relationship between a purchaser and 
      a proposed declarant may be contractual, <i>s. 53(1) clearly imposes on 
      the proposed declarant, with respect to the money we are concerned with 
      in this appeal, the duty of a trustee and it is with this particular aspect 
      of the relationship that we are concerned.  As I have said, this fiduciary 
      relationship is of direct relevance in interpreting the scope of the obligation 
      to pay interest on the money held in trust.</i>   [Emphasis added.]</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is clear that Morden A.C.J.O. 
    was of the opinion that the duty of a developer imposed by s. 53(3) to pay 
    interest on the purchase money of which the developer is a trustee is the 
    duty of a trustee.  I am entirely satisfied that this conclusion was not <i>obiter 
    dictum</i>.  It is clear from the final sentence of the passage quoted above 
    that his conclusion that the combined effect of subsections 53(1) and (3) 
    is to impose a trust duty on a developer was a necessary finding in the interpretation 
    of s. 33.  Indeed, one of the reasons why Morden A.C.J.O. held that the developer 
    was required to pay interest at the higher statutory rate was because it was 
    required to pay interest on trust monies under s. 33.  Even though it is not 
    indicated whether s. 53(1)(b) security had been provided, I do not believe 
    that the provision of security would have affected the result reached by Morden 
    A.C.J.O. as the interest was payable on trust monies.  It was part of the 
    developer’s obligation as trustee of the purchase monies to pay interest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In referring to Morden A.C.J.O.’s reasons in  
    <i>Ackland</i> quoted earlier, the motion judge reproduced only the penultimate 
    sentence of the first paragraph in the above passage and part of the final 
    paragraph thereof.  It appears that he was of the view that the developer’s 
    duty as trustee to pay interest was terminated when it provided the appellant 
    with the approved security referred to in s. 53(1)(b).  As I have explained, 
    the provision of the security did not affect the statutory trust that was 
    impressed on the purchase money paid by the appellant.  The<i> Condominium 
    Act</i> constituted the developer the trustee of the money for the benefit 
    of the purchaser.  The trust impressed on the money continued whether the 
    money remained in a trust account or was, in effect, replaced by a prescribed 
    form of security.  As s. 53(1) states, the trust if for the benefit of “the 
    person entitled thereto in respect of the agreement” for the purchase and 
    sale of the unit.  Depending on the circumstances, “the person entitled thereto” 
    means either the developer, if the sale is completed and any interest on the 
    purchase money payable to the purchaser pursuant to s. 53(3) has been paid 
    or the sale has not been completed because of the purchaser’s default, or 
    the purchaser, if the sale has not been completed because of the developer’s 
    default and interest on the purchase money payable to the purchaser pursuant 
    to s. 53(2) has been paid.</span></p>
