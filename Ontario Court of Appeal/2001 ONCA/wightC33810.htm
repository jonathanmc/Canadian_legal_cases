      <p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. O’Flynn 
        dated February 4, 2000.</span></p>
      <h2 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span

        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Wight Milling Limited (“Wight Milling”) 
        appeals from the judgment of O’Flynn&nbsp;J. affirming the sale of surplus 
        land by the Corporation of the Village of Bloomfield (the “Village”).</span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> Prior to the sale of the land, the Village passed By-law 
        #781.  That by-law required Council to obtain an appraisal of the land, 
        then give notice to the public and request tenders.  Instead, although 
        the request for an appraisal was made, notice to the public requesting 
        tenders was given and tenders were received prior to the actual appraisal 
        being furnished to the Village.  It is conceded that the Village acted 
        in good faith throughout.<span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'></span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The appellant requested a review of the sale pursuant to 
        s. 193(5) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  Section 193(5) states:</p>
      <p class=HeadingQuote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)  The manner in which the council 
        or local board carries out the sale of its property, if consistent with 
        the procedures by-law and this section, is not open to question or review 
        by any court if the council may lawfully sell the property, the purchaser 
        may lawfully buy it and the council acted in good faith.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> O’Flynn J. held that the error in procedure was of a purely 
        technical nature and not fatal to the process respecting the sale of the 
        land.  He held that the sequence of the procedures did not matter so long 
        as all procedures took place.  In effect, O’Flynn J. held that the actions 
        of council were consistent with the by-law.  Alternatively, he exercised 
        his discretion on review and, since the error was procedural in the circumstances 
        of this case, decided not to set aside the sale of the land. </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> We agree with the trial judge that, in the circumstances 
        of this case, the order in which the procedures required by the by-law 
        did not matter.  All required procedures did take place and the sale must 
        be upheld.<span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'></span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The appellant also submits that the sale is flawed because 
        the appraisal was for the land only, whereas the sale is for the land 
        and chattels.  This submission was also not raised in the pleadings although 
        submissions were made in argument.  Although the municipality obtained 
        an appraisal for the land only, both bidders were told to tender for both 
        the land and chattels.  There is no statutory authority requiring an appraisal 
        for the sale of chattels.  It is purely speculative to suggest that the 
        true value of the chattels reduced the value of the land to a price below 
        the appraised value.  What evidence there is, is to the contrary.  We 
        see no merit in this ground of appeal.<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;
'></span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appeal is therefore dismissed. </span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The Village raises a further issue by way of “cross-appeal”.  
        The trial judge awarded the Village the costs of keeping up the interest 
        on the mortgage on the property to the date of trial.  The Village requests 
        that interest accrued on the mortgage on the property continue to the 
        closing of the sale.  That request is granted. <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'></span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> Costs of the appeal are on a party-and-party basis to the 
        Village.  No costs with respect to the cross-appeal. </p>
