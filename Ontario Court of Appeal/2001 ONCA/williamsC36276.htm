<p>On appeal from the judgment of Judge J. Ritchie dated March 30, 2001.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge convicted the respondent of sexual assault and assault 
  with a weapon.  The summary conviction appeal court reversed and acquitted on 
  both counts.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge began his brief reasons by outlining the two charges.  
  After reviewing the evidence in summary form and addressing the central issue 
  of credibility and the burden of proof, the trial judge concluded that “the 
  Crown has proven all elements of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s failure to expressly address each count separately, 
  and each element of the offence in each count separately, does not in the circumstances 
  of this case amount to an error in law, and did not result in a miscarriage 
  of justice.  The two counts were inexorably linked so that a finding against 
  the respondent on one would almost inevitably compel a finding against him on 
  the other.  The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in law in holding 
  that the failure to expressly distinguish between the elements of the offences 
  amounted to reversible error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nor are we convinced that the trial judge’s reasons, while brief, support 
  the contention that he failed to consider each of the counts separately.  The 
  trial judge properly observed that credibility was the key issue.  Reliability 
  in the sense of the accuracy of the complainant’s evidence was not the issue.  
  It was not argued at trial that she was mistaken.  It was argued at trial that 
  she was lying.  The trial judge’s brief reasons demonstrated an appreciation 
  of the competing version of events and a recognition that the complainant’s 
  version was supported to some extent by independent confirmatory evidence.  
  His reasons leave no doubt as to why he reached the result he did.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the summary conviction appeal court judge was entitled to conduct 
  a limited assessment of the complainant’s credibility, his unexplained characterization 
  of her evidence as “so unusual and inherently improbable” is not justified on 
  this record.  No doubt, on the complainant’s version she acted foolishly and 
  was slow to appreciate the danger that she was in when she was with the respondent.  
  There is, however, nothing inherently improbable in her description of the relevant 
  events, particularly when viewed in combination with the uncontradicted evidence 
  of the 9-1-1 call and the observations of the police officer who responded to 
  that call.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed, the acquittals are 
  set aside and the convictions are restored.  The respondent has already served 
  the sentence.</p>
