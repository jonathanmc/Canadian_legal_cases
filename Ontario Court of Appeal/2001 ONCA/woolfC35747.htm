<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Mary 
  Lou Benotto dated January 3, 2001.</span></p>
<h2 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals from the order of Benotto J. finding her in contempt 
  of court and ordering her pleadings to be struck out, declaring there to be 
  no child support arrears, and directing the release of funds to the respondent 
  and awarding him costs of $25,000.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant does not contest the finding of contempt but submits that 
  the sanction ordered is overly broad.  The appellant concedes that the court 
  was entitled to strike her pleadings insofar as they relate to her claim for 
  spousal support and division of property.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits, however, that the court ought not to have struck 
  the claim for child support as this is a claim that is in the best interests 
  of the children.  The appellant also submits that the costs awarded are excessive.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At present, the appellant is receiving interim support payments for 
  the children pursuant to an order made in April 2001 and these will continue.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent submits that the children may make a direct claim for 
  support under s. 33(2) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3 and 
  that the Children’s Lawyer may be appointed as litigation guardian for the children 
  under the Rules of Civil Procedure if the court deems it desirable. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has not purged her contempt and has shown a complete disdain 
  for orders of the court.  In our opinion, the appeal from the contempt order 
  should be dismissed. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent has counter-petitioned for divorce.  We note that s.&nbsp;11(1)(b) 
  of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. (1985) c.3 as amended requires the court</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… to satisfy itself that reasonable arrangements have been made for the 
      support of any children of the marriage, having regard to the guidelines 
      and, if such arrangements have not been made to stay the granting of the 
      divorce until such arrangements are made.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;'>The respondent must therefore 
  provide financial disclosure.  The appellant may be a witness on behalf of the 
  children and give evidence respecting the husband’s income and the children’s 
  extraordinary expenses at a trial.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, in the difficult and unusual circumstances of this case, we 
  would ask that a copy of our order be served on the Children’s Lawyer forthwith 
  so that, if so minded, the Children’s Lawyer may apply for appointment as litigation 
  guardian to represent the children before the trial on the husband’s counter-petition. 
</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, we would not interfere with the order of Benotto J. respecting 
  costs.  Therefore, we dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>
