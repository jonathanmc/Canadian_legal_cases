        we are satisfied that, applying an objective standard, the proper conclusion 
        is that Working Ventures had complied with its contractual obligation. 
        Indeed, it is apparent from Cameron J.'s reasons that he  took objective 
        factors into account in upholding the reasonableness of the discretion 
        exercised by Working Ventures. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with 
        costs.</p></td>
