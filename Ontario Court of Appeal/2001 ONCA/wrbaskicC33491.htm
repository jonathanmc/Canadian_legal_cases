<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'>On appeal from the judgment of 
  Justice George Yates, sitting with a jury, dated December 17, 1999.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p><b><u>CATZMAN and DOHERTY JJ.A.</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was struck by a bus driven by the respondent Ratkowski.  
  She was walking across the street with the light and the respondent’s bus was 
  making a slow left turn across the appellant’s path.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Taking the respondents’ evidence at its very best, the court is satisfied 
  that there is no basis upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could 
  have concluded that the respondents had discharged the onus of showing that 
  Ratkowski was not negligent.  The appellant must have been crossing the street 
  when he turned into her path.  He had a duty to yield and he failed to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The majority is, however, satisfied that there is some basis upon which 
  this jury could conclude, as it did, that the appellant did not exercise the 
  caution expected of a reasonable pedestrian in the circumstances.  The fact 
  that the respondent Ratkowski failed to yield as required does not preclude 
  a finding that the appellant also failed to exercise reasonable caution for 
  her own safety in all of the circumstances.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The court is satisfied that the damages must be assessed afresh.  The 
  perverse finding by the jury with respect to the respondents’ liability does 
  not necessarily require that the damage assessment be set aside, but it does 
  give cause for concern about that award, particularly when, as here, the award 
  is low.  The jury also heard a great deal of evidence about various benefits 
  and payments that had been made to the appellant as a result of her disability 
  flowing from the accident.  None of that evidence had anything to do with the 
  jury’s task of quantifying her non-pecuniary damages.  Unfortunately, this was 
  not made clear to the jury.  Finally, the charge read as a whole was not helpful 
  to the jury.  There was no attempt to relate the evidence to the issues or to 
  clearly contrast the competing positions of the parties and the evidence on 
  which they relied.  The jury was left very much on its own.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The majority would order a new trial on the question of the appellant’s 
  contributory negligence, if any, and on the quantification of damages.  In the 
  majority’s view, that trial should take place before a judge and jury, subject 
  to any order to the contrary made in the trial court.  </p>

  </span> Although I agree with the majority that the jury’s verdict on question 
  1 was perverse, I am unable to agree that the evidence could reasonably support 
  a finding that the plaintiff, Milena Wrbaskic, was contributorily negligent.  
  In my view, the only reasonable verdict on this record is one fixing the respondent, 
  the bus driver, with 100% liability for the accident.  In so concluding, I rely 
  on the following considerations:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
      appellant Milena was 80% through the intersection on a green light when 
      she was hit by the bus; </p>
    <p> 2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
      respondent driver had a mandatory duty to yield under s. 140(1) of the <i>Highway 
      Traffic Act</i>, a duty he admitted that he breached by pleading guilty 
      to a contravention of the section;</p>
    <p> 3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
      respondent driver had to wait some 20 seconds even to make his left turn;  
      and</p>
    <p> 4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
      defence led no evidence about where the appellant Milena was when the bus 
      driver first saw her.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with my colleagues that the appellants should have a new trial 
  on damages.  I would, however, order that this trial take place before a judge 
  alone.</p>
