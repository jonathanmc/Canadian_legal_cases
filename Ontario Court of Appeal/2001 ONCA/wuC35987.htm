  </span></span> The respondent was convicted of possession of contraband tobacco 
  contrary to s. 240(1) of the <i>Excise Act</i>, R.S. 1985, c. E-14.  Parliament 
  has prescribed a minimum fine for this offence.  The trial judge imposed the 
  minimum fine, in this case $9,600, gave the appellant no time to pay the fine, 
  and imposed a 75-day conditional sentence in default of payment.  The Crown’s 
  summary conviction appeal against the sentence was dismissed.  The Crown seeks 
  leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals the sentence on the ground 
  that a conditional sentence is not available in default of payment of a fine.</p>

  </span></span> After a three-day trial, the respondent was convicted of possessing 
  300 cartons of contraband tobacco contrary to the <i>Excise Act</i>, s. 240(1).  
  The trial judge sentenced the respondent to the minimum fine calculated pursuant 
  to s. 240(1.1) and totalling $9,600.  Although no evidence was called at the 
  sentencing stage concerning the respondent’s ability to pay the fine, the trial 
  judge found that the respondent did not have sufficient means to pay it.  The 
  respondent had testified during the trial that he was unemployed due to an injury, 
  that he received $965.00 a month in benefits, and that he was responsible for 
  the support of his sixteen year-old daughter.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated that but 
  for the minimum fine, he would have imposed a suspended sentence.  The respondent, 
  he noted, was “a first offender having been involved in very minimal behaviour.”  
  However, in view of the statutory minimum fine, the trial judge held that he 
  had no option but to impose a fine, stating that “that is Parliament’s wish 
  and I have to give effect to that wish.”  The trial judge explicitly regretted 
  the fact that Ontario did not make provision for offenders to “work off” fines 
  and observed that even if he did impose a short custodial sentence, it was likely 
  that the respondent would be released “within a matter of days” due to the limited 
  availability of custodial resources.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge concluded that given the circumstances of the 
  offence and the offender, a custodial sentence was not required and that a conditional 
  sentence would be the appropriate penalty.  The respondent, he held, was not 
  a danger to the community.  On the other hand, the trial judge felt that the 
  sentence should reflect the fact that the community was “bedevilled” by smuggling, 
  an activity arising from a “criminal undercurrent which attacks our respect 
  for law and order and which attacks the community itself.”  The trial judge 
  noted that “a conditional sentence with appropriate, severe conditions is a 
  significant deterrent and denunciatory penalty”, echoing the words of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61.  Accordingly, the 
  trial judge imposed the mandatory fine but gave the respondent no time to pay.  
  In default of payment, the trial judge imposed a 75-day conditional sentence 
  that included house arrest between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. subject 
  to narrowly defined exceptions for employment, medical care or religious observance.</p>

  </span></span> The Quebec Court of Appeal has considered the use of conditional 
  sentences in default of mandatory minimum fines in three recent decisions.  
  In <i>R. v. Giroux</i> (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 67, the accused was convicted 
  of offences under the <i>Customs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2<sup>nd</sup> 
  Supp.) and under the <i>Excise Act</i>.  The mandatory minimum fine of $369,620 
  was imposed and in default of payment, the accused was sentenced to 18 months’ 
  imprisonment followed by another six months less a day. The Court allowed a 
  sentence appeal and substituted a conditional sentence pursuant to which the 
  appellant would serve the sentence of imprisonment in default of payment in 
  the community under relatively strict conditions.  The Court observed at p. 
  73 that “while providing for substantial fines, [the legislation] did not provide 
  for minimum sentences in default of payment of those fines.”  The Court held 
  that a conditional sentence was appropriate as the appellant, who had no criminal 
  record, was “a small cog in the operation” and there appeared to be little danger 
  that he would re-offend.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Quebec Court of Appeal revisited the issue in <i>R c. Savard</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>.  There, the accused was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, 
  together with the minimum fine of $967,919.  The accused was given 12 months’ 
  to pay the fine, and in default of payment, was sentenced to an additional 20 
  months imprisonment.  He appealed the sentence, arguing that both the 18-month 
  term of imprisonment and the 20-month term in default of payment should be changed 
  to a conditional sentence.  The appeal was allowed, and given the circumstances 
  of the appellant, the Court substituted a conditional sentence for the 18-month 
  term of imprisonment and set aside the period of imprisonment in default of 
  payment of the fine.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>Savard</span></i> qualified the availability 
  of conditional sentences in default of payment of a fine.  Proulx J.A., writing 
  for the Court, referred to a long line of authority holding that where a fine 
  is imposed, the fine is the punishment, not the sentence of imprisonment in 
  default of payment which merely serves as a mode of enforcement of the fine: 
  see <i>Regimbald v. Chong Chow</i> (1925), 38 Que. K.B. 440; <i>R. v. Steeves</i> 
  (1914), 24 C.C.C. 183 (N.B.C.A.); <i>R. v. Tomlinson</i> (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 
  97 (B.C.S.C.).  It followed, held Proulx J.A., that when a court imposes a term 
  of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine, it does not actually impose 
  a “sentence of imprisonment” within the meaning of s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>, and accordingly the court does not have the option of imposing a conditional 
  sentence as an alternative to imprisonment.  Proulx J.A. thus stated at p. 161 
  that </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[q]uand le législateur prévoit … une amende minimale, soit-elle exagérée 
      ou non et au-delà les moyens du contrevenant, le tribunal doit considérer 
      le délai de paiement, les modalités et, les cas échéant, la clause d’emprisonnement 
      à défaut de paiement.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1]

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>Savard</span></i> distinguished, however, 
  between two classes of conditional sentences in default of payment of a fine: 
  those where the offender is given time to pay the fine and those where the offender 
  is given no time to pay.  Proulx J.A. observed that s. 734.7(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> allows for “immediate committal” of an offender in default of payment 
  of a fine where no time is given to pay the fine, provided that the court states 
  its reasons for immediate commital.  Proulx J.A. noted that the court’s reasons 
  for preferring immediate committal were significant, since they directly affected 
  the character of the sentence imposed.  In particular, he stated at p. 159 that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>dans la hypothèse où … il apparaîtrait au tribunal que l’inculpé ne pourrait 
      pas acquitter l’amende considérable imposée, il serait difficile de considérer 
      que l’imprisonnement ordonné à défaut de paiement soit « <i>une mesure incitative 
      de paiement </i>»: dans la réalité des choses, cet imprisonnement constituterait

  the <i>Criminal Code </i>had to be considered.  As Proulx J.A. stated at p.

  </span></span> In this province, the availability of conditional sentences in 
  default of payment of fines was considered by Blenus Wright J. in <i>R. v. Lettroy</i> 
  (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 517.  The accused pleaded guilty to income tax evasion.  
  He was fined $218,678, an amount equivalent to the tax evaded, more than the 
  minimum fine but less than the maximum stipulated by s. 239(1) of the <i>Income 
  Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.).  He was given no time 
  to pay and sentenced to 12 months in default of payment, to be served conditionally, 
  together with 12 months probation.  The Crown appealed on the ground that the 
  accused should have been given time to pay and that a conditional sentence was 
  not available for a term of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine.  Blenus 
  Wright J. allowed the Crown's appeal on the ground (at p. 520) that  “[b]y giving 
  no time to pay the fine the judge effectively wiped out the mandatory fine provisions” 
  of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>.</p>

  sentence was not available:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The term of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine is made with reference 
      to the future and in relation to the possibility that the fine will not 
      be paid.  The imprisonment in default of payment of the fine does not relate 
      to the conviction for the offence of tax evasion but relates to the failure 
      to pay the sentence of a fine.  Therefore, in my view the imprisonment in 
      default of payment of the fine was not part of the sentence.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Blenus Wright J. allowed the Crown’s appeal, 
  but in view of the respondent’s lack of means to pay the fine, he substituted 
  a reduced fine of 50% of the amount of tax evaded, gave the respondent a year 
  to pay the fine, and set aside the term of imprisonment in default, expressly 
  noting that the Crown should be left to its civil remedies to collect the fine 
  if it were not paid. </span></p>

  </span></span> In my view, in the circumstances of the present case, the trial 
  judge did have the discretion to impose a conditional sentence in default of 
  payment of the mandatory minimum fine.  I would adopt the analysis of the Quebec 
  Court of Appeal that it is legally possible to impose a conditional sentence 
  in default of payment of a fine where the offender is given no time to pay. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the Quebec Court of Appeal that there is a difference 
  between imposing an immediate sentence of imprisonment in default of payment 
  of a fine with no time to pay the fine, and imposing a conditional sentence 
  in default of payment where the offender is given time to pay.  Where no time 
  is given to pay the fine, the court has determined, then and there, that the 
  appropriate sanction for the offender's conduct is either immediate payment 
  or immediate imprisonment.  As the legal and practical effect of the sentence 
  is to send the offender directly to jail, it seems to me that the court is imposing 
  a sentence of imprisonment and I see no reason in law to eliminate the possibility 
  of ordering that the sentence be served in the community pursuant to the terms 
  of s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As well as being supportable in law, this analysis also has the 
  practical advantage of affording judges a desirable measure of flexibility to 
  arrive at an appropriate sentence.  The circumstances of the present case prove 
  the point.  The trial judge concluded that in view of his limited means, the 
  respondent was unable to pay the required fine.  The trial judge also concluded 
  that given the respondent’s minimal level of involvement in smuggling and his 
  personal circumstances, a sentence of incarceration was not appropriate.  The 
  trial judge was required to impose a fine, but he was not required to impose 
  a term of imprisonment in default of payment as s. 240(4) of the <i>Excise Act</i> 
  is discretionary.  The imposition of a fine of $9,600 that could not and would 
  not be paid would amount to a hollow sentence that would fail to adequately 
  sanction the respondent's wrongful conduct.  The imposition of a conditional 
  sentence in default of immediate payment of the fine allowed the trial judge 
  to arrive at a sentence that respected the letter of the law, was closely tailored 
  to the circumstances of the offender, and gave appropriate emphasis to the goals 
  of deterrence and retribution. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would, however, add the following caveat.  I agree with the 
  views expressed by Blenus Wright J. in <i>Lettroy</i> to the following extent.  
  First, it is well established that ordinarily, a convicted party should be given 
  time to pay a fine.  The circumstances in which no time is given to pay a fine 
  are bound to be exceptional.  Second, sentencing judges should avoid dispositions 
  that in effect evade Parliament's direction that for certain offences, mandatory 
  fines must be imposed.  It hardly needs to be said that sentencing judges must 
  respect the will of Parliament.  If a sentencing judge were to impose a fine, 
  give no time to pay and impose a conditional sentence in default of payment 
  as a means of avoiding the impact of the mandatory fine, such a sentence would 
  amount to an improper exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.  Where 
  it is doubtful that the mandatory fine will be paid, and where the circumstances 
  of the offence or the offender do not justify a period of imprisonment in default, 
  imposition of the fine with time to pay and without a period of imprisonment 
  in default will often be the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For the reasons I have given, I cannot accept the appellant's 
  submission that the sentence imposed here effectively defeated Parliament's 
  intention that a minimum fine be imposed.  In my view, the trial judge did his 
  best to impose a sentence that appropriately sanctioned the respondent's wrongful 
  conduct in keeping with the statutory scheme and applicable legal principles 
  and in a manner consistent with the respondent's level of criminal involvement 
  and personal circumstances. </p>

  </span></span> Finally, I note that s. s. 734 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, providing 
  for the calculation of the term of imprisonment to be imposed in default of 
  payment of a fine, has no application to the circumstances of this case.  Accordingly, 
  I do not address here the relevance or applicability of conditional sentences 
  under that scheme, leaving that question to another day when the issue does 
  arise.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)  the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable 
      by a minimum term of imprisonment;</p>
    <p>(2)  the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;</p>

'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is the second of these prerequisites which is germane to this 
  appeal.  That requirement flows directly from the words of s. 742.1(a).  A conditional 
  sentence is only available where the court “imposes a sentence of imprisonment 
  of less than two years”.</p>

'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 742.1(a) sets the standard by which those offenders who 
  are not candidates for a conditional sentence are identified:  <i>R. v. Proulx, 
  supra</i>, at pp. 96-98.  Offenders for whom imprisonment is an inappropriate 
  punishment and offenders for whom a penitentiary term is an appropriate punishment 
  are not eligible for conditional sentences.  Offenders who fall between these 
  two categories, that is, offenders for whom a term of imprisonment of less than 
  two years is an appropriate punishment are candidates for a conditional sentence.  
  If the offender is eligible for a conditional sentence, the court must go on 
  to determine, according to s. 742.1(b), whether a conditional sentence should 
  be imposed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In <i>R. v. Proulx, supra</i>, at p. 98, the 
  Chief Justice referred to the drawing of the distinction between offenders who 
  were eligible for a conditional sentence and those who were not eligible as 
  a “preliminary determination” to be made upon a consideration of the fundamental 
  purpose and principles of sentencing to the extent necessary to “narrow the 
  range of sentence” by placing the offender in one of the three categories described 
  above.</span></p>

'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When the “preliminary determination” described by the Chief Justice 
  is made in this case, the respondent falls into one of the categories of offenders 
  for whom a conditional sentence is not available.  The trial judge found, and 
  it is not challenged on appeal, that imprisonment was not an appropriate punishment.  
  He indicated that but for the minimum fine, he would have imposed a suspended 
  sentence.  Once the trial judge decided that a minimum fine was the appropriate 
  sentence and that imprisonment was an inappropriate disposition, s. 742.1 was 
  no longer a sentencing option.  </p>

  </span></span> I cannot agree that the imposition of a term of imprisonment 
  in default of payment of a fine is the same thing as the imposition of a term 
  of imprisonment as a sanction for the commission of an offence.  Imprisonment 
  as punishment for the commission of an offence is appropriate only where a blending 
  of the principles of sentencing to achieve the fundamental purpose of sentencing 
  described in s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> compels the conclusion that 
  imprisonment is the correct sanction.  Imprisonment imposed for failure to pay 
  a fine is not determined by reference to those principles of sentencing or the 
  fundamental purpose of sentencing, but rather by reference to the need to enforce 
  payment of the monetary penalty imposed by the court.  It has long been recognized 
  that imprisonment in default of payment of a fine is not punishment for the 
  offence, but is a means of enforcing the punishment which is the fine:  <i>R. 
  c. Savard</i> (2000), 38 C.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 152 at paras. 19, 36 (Que. C.A.);  
  <i>R. v. Lettroy</i> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 517 at 522 (Ont. S.C.J.);  <i>R. v. 
  Tomlinson</i> (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 97 at 98 (B.C.S.C.);  <i>Regimbald v. Chong 
  Chow</i> (1925), 38 Que. K.B. 440 at 445 (K.B.).</p>

'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The enforcement nature of a term of imprisonment imposed for 
  non-payment of a fine is made clear by several provisions of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  Sections 734(4) and 734(5) provide that the period of incarceration 
  to be served for default in payment of a fine is determined by the unpaid amount 
  of the fine.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a>  Section 734.7 provides 
  that except where no time is allowed to pay a fine, the offender should be imprisoned 
  for non-payment of the fine only where the other enforcement mechanisms set 
  out in the <i>Criminal Code</i> (s. 734.5, s. 734.6) are inappropriate, or the 
  offender has refused without reasonable excuse to pay the fine.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span> [5] </span></a>  Section 734.8 directs that an offender who has 
  been imprisoned for not paying a fine may have that term of imprisonment reduced 
  or eliminated entirely by paying part or all of the fine.  Finally, s. 787(2) 
  and s. 809 recognize that imprisonment may be imposed for non-payment of monetary 
  orders other than fines (eg. costs).  Clearly, imprisonment in these circumstances 
  has nothing to do with sentencing the offender for an offence and everything 
  to do with enforcing court orders.</p>

  </span></span> The enforcement purpose behind the imposition of a jail term 
  for non-payment of a fine does not change depending on whether the offender 
  is given time to pay the fine.  In either situation, the punishment deemed appropriate 
  for the offence is the fine.  Where no time is given to pay the fine, that is 
  because it is deemed appropriate to enforce immediate payment of the fine with 
  the threat of a jail term.  Because imprisonment is a means of enforcing the 
  fine and not an alternative sanction for the commission of the crime, it is 
  wrong in principle to impose a default prison term with no time to pay the fine 
  absent proof that an offender has the ability to pay the fine immediately:  
  <i>R. v. Natrall</i> (1972), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 390 at 397 (B.C.C.A.);  <i>R. v. 
  Zink</i> (1992), 13 B.C.A.C. 241 (C.A.).</p>

  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent referred to s. 732 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> in support of her submission that a sentence of imprisonment in default 
  of payment of a fine is still “a sentence of imprisonment” and, therefore, one 
  for which a conditional sentence may be imposed under s. 742.1.  Section 732 
  provides for intermittent sentences and reads in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Where the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of ninety days or less

  in default of payment of a fine or otherwise” in s. 732 and the absence of that 
  phrase in s. 742.1(a) supports the conclusion that conditional sentences are 
  not available when imprisonment is imposed for failure to pay a fine.</span></p>

  judges “a desired measure of flexibility to arrive at an appropriate sentence”.  
  I agree wholeheartedly that flexibility is important when judges are trying 
  to tailor a sentence to the offence and the offender.  With respect, however, 
  I think that my colleague’s interpretation of s. 742.1 will lead to inappropriate 
  sentences.  </p>

  </span></span> A conditional sentence is a term of imprisonment, albeit one 
  which is served in the community.  Most offenders who are subject to a conditional 
  sentence undergo substantial deprivation of their liberty.  The relatively recent 
  overhaul of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions relating to fines recognizes 
  that as a matter of principle imprisonment for non-payment of fines should be 
  used as a last resort, or where there is no reasonable excuse for non-payment.  
  Parliament envisioned resort to imprisonment primarily, if not exclusively, 
  in situations where the offender who had defaulted on payment had the means 
  to pay.  The slamming of the jail door was seen as an incentive to make the 
  offender who had the means to pay the fine do so.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I think the principle that limits resort to imprisonment as a 
  means of enforcing fines has equal application to imprisonment served in custody 
  or in the community.  In either case, the offender should not suffer a deprivation 
  of his or her liberty for non-payment of a fine except where other enforcement 
  techniques are inappropriate or the offender has wilfully refused to pay the 
  fine.  As I see it, the real danger in reading s. 742.1 to permit conditional 
  sentences for non-payment of fines is that trial judges will resort to conditional 
  sentences in circumstances where they would not impose a custodial term of imprisonment 
  for non-payment of fines.  This will result in unwarranted reliance on imprisonment

  </span></span> This case provides an example of the inappropriate use of imprisonment 
  to enforce the payment of a fine.  The trial judge was satisfied that the crime 
  committed by the respondent did not call for imprisonment.  He was also satisfied 
  that the respondent did not have the ability to pay the minimum fine.  Despite 
  these two findings, the trial judge imposed a conditional sentence, which included 
  a “house arrest” provision, for non-payment of the fine and required that the 
  fine be paid immediately.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span> [6] 
  </span></a>  By doing so, he effectively imposed a term of imprisonment, albeit 
  within the community, not as punishment for the crime, but because the respondent 
  did not pay a fine that he was unable to pay.  I think it is just as much an 
  error in principle to impose a conditional sentence in these circumstances as 
  it would have been to impose a custodial sentence.  Both amount to deprivation 
  of liberty, not as a fit sanction for the offence committed, but because the 
  offender is unable to pay a fine.  Economic imprisonment whether in jail or 
  in the community is offensive to the present provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  relating to fines.  The judge’s interpretation of s. 742.1 led him to impose 
  an inappropriate sentence in this case.  I do not think he would have imposed 
  a custodial term of imprisonment had that been the only imprisonment option 
  open to him.  </p>

  </span></span> The absence of any reference to imprisonment upon default of 
  payment of the fine in s. 742.1 is consistent with Parliament’s determination 
  that imprisonment should not be used as a means of enforcing fines save in very 
  limited circumstances.  In those limited circumstances, custodial imprisonment 
  is better suited to achieve the enforcement purpose than non-custodial imprisonment.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge was faced with a difficult sentencing problem.  
  As he observed, his difficulty stemmed in large measure from the absence of 
  any approved fine option programs in Ontario.  Those programs permit an offender 
  to discharge his fine obligation by performing work in programs authorized by 
  the Lieutenant Governor in Council and are clearly aimed at offenders of limited 
  means for whom a fine is the appropriate disposition:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, 
  s. 736.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the absence of a fine option program, the trial judge had 
  two options.  He could have declined to make any order for imprisonment upon 
  default of payment of the fine and left it to the Crown to enforce the fine 
  through other enforcement mechanisms available to it.  This is an appropriate 
  disposition where there is no realistic possibility that an offender can pay 
  the appropriate fine within a reasonable time:  <i>R. v. Natrall, supra</i>, 
  at pp. 397-98.<a

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge also could have imposed a term of imprisonment 
  upon default of payment of the fine, but allowed the respondent a reasonable 
  time to pay that fine.  Had he chosen this option, the trial judge could have 
  provided that certain modest minimum payments were to be made within the allotted 
  time:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 734.1.  If the fine was not paid in the allotted 
  time, the trial judge could have considered an application to extend the time 
  for payment:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 734.3.  If the respondent did not seek 
  an extension and defaulted on the payment of the fine, the trial judge would 
  then have had to determine whether to issue a warrant for the committal of the 
  respondent.  In making that decision, he would have looked at s. 734.7 which 
  makes imprisonment the enforcement mechanism of last resort.  If the respondent 
  had made genuine efforts to pay as much of the fine as he reasonably could and 
  was not able to pay the remainder of the fine, imprisonment would be an inappropriate 
  order under s. 734.7.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the sentencing proceedings, the trial judge did not make any 
  specific inquiry into the respondent’s ability to pay the minimum fine.  On 
  appeal, the Crown counsel argued that the evidence did not support the conclusion 
  that the respondent was unable to pay the fine.  While a more detailed inquiry 
  into the respondent’s financial means would have been helpful, the evidence 
  at trial did establish that the respondent had a very limited income and was 
  raising a teenaged daughter.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As the conditional sentence has been served, I do not think that 
  anything would be gained at this late juncture by a more detailed inquiry into 
  the respondent’s ability to pay the fine.  Justice is best served by accepting 
  the trial judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not have the ability to 
  pay the fine in the reasonably foreseeable future.  Considered in that light, 
  there should have been no order for imprisonment upon default of payment of 
  the fine.  I would vary the sentence by deleting the term of imprisonment imposed 
  on default.  The Crown may resort to the other enforcement mechanisms available 
  to it to try to collect the fine.  </p>

    imposed under the <i>Excise Act</i> because that <i>Act</i> provides for a 
    maximum term of imprisonment upon default of payment of the fine:  See s. 
    734(8).  However, I think it is helpful to look at these sections as informing 
    the enforcement purpose underlying the imposition of imprisonment upon failure
