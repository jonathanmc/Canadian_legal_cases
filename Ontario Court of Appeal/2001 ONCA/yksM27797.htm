<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The events preceding this motion are set out in our endorsement of July 
  18, 2001.  The intervener, the Globe and Mail, seeks access to the sealed affidavit 
  for the purposes of determining whether a challenge to the sealing order should 
  be made.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Jacobsen proposes that access should be limited to himself and Sylvia 
  Stead, the executive editor of the Globe and Mail.  Mr. Jacobsen indicates that 
  he will share the contents of the affidavit with Ms. Stead only to the extent 
  necessary to permit her to make an informed decision as to whether the Globe 
  and Mail should challenge the sealing order.  Mr. Jacobsen and Ms. Stead have 
  both undertaken to maintain the confidentiality of the material in the affidavit.  
  The <i>bona fides</i> of their undertakings is not questioned.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Jacobsen’s proposal is an attractive one.  The public has a right 
  to know what goes on in its courtrooms and, in particular, in this case why 
  a conviction for a serious criminal offence has been set aside at the behest 
  of the federal Crown as a miscarriage of justice.  It is acknowledged that the 
  public right to know is not absolute and must yield on occasion to other rights.  
  It is crucial, however, that any limit on the openness of court proceedings 
  be subject to the fullest scrutiny possible.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are satisfied, however, that this motion must be dismissed for three 
  reasons. First, as a result of this application, the Crown has now specified 
  with some particularity the nature of the confidentiality claim which gave rise 
  to the sealing order.  Crown counsel has stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The sealed affidavit also contains confidential information pertaining 
      to an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is nothing before us to suggest that the criminal investigation 
  is not still ongoing, and certainly we would have expected to have been advised 
  by the Crown if the investigation was no longer extant.  We cannot envision 
  anything that Mr. Jacobsen might learn from the affidavit that would realistically 
  put him in a position to challenge the basis relied on by the Crown for the 
  sealing order.  We cannot say that there is no possibility that access to Mr. 
  Jacobsen and his client would not enable him to mount a challenge to the order, 
  however, we can say that the possibility of being able to mount such a challenge 
  is remote given the basis upon which the claim is made.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, any disclosure of the information outside the ranks of those 
  involved in and responsible for the ongoing criminal investigation carries the 
  risk of disclosure that could compromise that investigation.  We are not concerned 
  with deliberate or even inadvertent disclosure of the actual contents of the 
  affidavit.  We are concerned with more indirect forms of disclosure or other 
  conduct flowing from the knowledge of the contents of the affidavit which could 
  compromise the investigation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the sealing order is temporary and as matters presently stand, 
  will expire in three months.  We are conscious that any delay in disclosure 
  compromises the public’s right to know what is going on in its courts.  Where, 
  however, other competing important interests are engaged and those interests 
  can be fully protected by a relatively short ban on access to information produced 
  in court, it is a significant consideration that the public right is delayed 
  and not totally sacrificed in favour of the other interests.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion for access to the sealed affidavit is denied.  This is not 
  an appropriate case for costs.</p>
