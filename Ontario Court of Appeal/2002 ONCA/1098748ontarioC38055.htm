<h1 class="h1">COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO<br>
</h1>
<p>RE: 1098748 ONTARIO LIMITED (Applicant)(Appellant) &#150;and&#150; LOBLAWS 
  INC. (Respondent)(Respondent in Appeal) </p>
<p>BEFORE: MORDEN, LABROSSE and MacPHERSON JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL: Peter H. Griffin and Matthew Peter Sammon, for the appellants</p>
<p> Robert J. Potts and Roger J. Horst, for the respondents</p>
<p>HEARD: October 18, 2002</p>
<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Sandra Chapnik dated March 27, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by 1098748 Ontario Limited (&#147;the Landlord&#148;) 
  from two judgments of Justice Chapnik.</p>
<p>[2] The first judgment granted the respondent&#146;s application for a declaration 
  that, under its lease, it is unreasonable for the Landlord to refuse to consent 
  to the respondent&#146;s food supermarket&#146;s change of name and banner in 
  the Agincourt Mall from &#147;Loblaws&#148; to &#147;No Frills.&#148; The judgment 
  also declared that the Landlord is being unreasonable in refusing to allow Loblaws 
  to make the renovations for the proposed change of name and banner, and to temporarily 
  close down the store while doing so. </p>
<p>[3] The second judgment dismissed the Landlord&#146;s cross-application for 
  a declaration that it was entitled to withhold arbitrarily its consent to a 
  sublease to a franchisee. </p>
<p>[4] The Landlord also appeals the order of the application judge refusing to 
  re-open the application in light of new evidence. </p>
<p>[5] In 1977, Loblaws entered into a lease agreement with the Landlord&#146;s 
  predecessor for a term, including renewals, of about fifty years. Loblaws is 
  an anchor tenant operating a traditional full-line Loblaws supermarket in the 
  Landlord&#146;s Agincourt Mall. Loblaws is seeking to change the banner and 
  name of the store from &#147;Loblaws&#148; to &#147;No Frills Discount Supermarket.&#148; 
  The Landlord has refused to consent to the change. </p>
<p>[6] There are five grounds of appeal. It is submitted that the judge:</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">(1) Erred in the interpretation of the use provisions 
  of the lease &#150; section 6.0;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">(2) Failed to consider the economic impact of conversion 
  upon the mall;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">(3) Erred in her interpretation of the continuous operation 
  provisions in the lease &#150; sections 6.02 and 6.03;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">(4) Failed to grant the Landlord a declaration that 
  it was entitled to withhold consent arbitrarily to the franchising of the store; 
  and</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">(5) Failed to re-open the application of the parties 
  to receive new evidence. </p>
<p> Issue 1: Did the judge err in her interpretation of the use provisions of 
  the lease?</p>
<p>[7] In her detailed reasons for decision, the judge made the following findings 
  at paragraphs 32, 33, 34 and 37:</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">[32] Even accepting that the differences between a full-line 
  Loblaws and the proposed limited-line No Frills store amount to a change in 
  style and philosophy, however, the real question is do they differ sufficiently 
  to change the use of the business of a supermarket for the sale of food and 
  other non-food items, as is carried on by the tenant in a majority of its similar 
  stores in shopping centres in Ontario and as contemplated in section 6.01 of 
  the lease?</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">[33] Despite the differences in style and philosophy, 
  I find that the overriding and distinguishing feature of both Loblaws and No 
  Frills is that they are banners for a food supermarket dedicated to the sale 
  of food and other non-food items. When asked whether it was his position that 
  No Frills is a banner for a food supermarket, Mr. Winter, [the Landlord&#146;s 
  expert witness, responded,] &#147;It is a banner, yes, for a food supermarket. 
  Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">[34] Based on the material before me, I conclude that 
  the change in the offering and presentation of food distribution intended by 
  the tenant through its name and banner change is not a change in the nature 
  of a different or other food supermarket than is carried on by the majority 
  of Loblaws&#146; other stores. The name No Frills is ordinarily identified with 
  the sale of food and some non-food items as is the case with other Loblaws banners 
  and supermarkets. Indeed, the Loblaws store in the mall already uses the No 
  Frills colours - yellow and white. Moreover, the proposed change is consistent 
  with the operations of other retailers in the mall and the surrounding trade 
  area. I find that the proposed change of banner is a permitted use under the 
  terms of the lease. </p>
<p class="judgmentindent">. . . . .</p>
<p>[37] As a result, I can find no reasonable objection to the proposed change 
  of banner or name. Loblaws has satisfied its onus to establish that the landlord 
  has unreasonably withheld its consent to the change of name and banner of the 
  subject premises from Loblaws to No Frills. No reasonable person would withhold 
  consent to the proposed change in light of all of the circumstances and commercial 
  realities in this case.</p>
<p>[8] With respect to this issue, the judge stated the law correctly, reviewed 
  the relevant evidence, and made findings that are supported by the evidence. 
  In the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Housen v. Nikolaisen 
  (2002), 211 D.L.R. 4th 577 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci and Major JJ., speaking for the 
  majority, said in para. 24:</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">&#133;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">We take the above comments of McLachlin J. [in Toneguzzo-Norvell 
  (Guardian ad litem of) v. Burnaby Hospital [1994] 1 S.C.R. 114 at 121-122] to 
  mean that, although the same high standard of deference applies to the entire 
  range of factual determinations made by the trial judge, where a factual finding 
  is grounded in an assessment of credibility of a witness, the overwhelming advantage 
  of the trial judge in this area must be acknowledged. This does not, however, 
  imply that there is a lower standard of review where witness credibility is 
  not in issue, or that there are not numerous policy reasons supporting deference 
  to all factual conclusions of the trial judge. In our view, this is made clear 
  by the emphasized portion of the above passage. The essential point is that 
  making a factual conclusion, of any kind, is inextricably linked with assigning 
  weight to evidence, and thus attracts a deferential standard of review. </p>
<p>[9] Although the evidence in this case consists of a written record and affidavits, 
  the factual conclusions of the judge attract a deferential standard of review. 
  We do not think that Chapnik J. erred in her interpretation of the use provisions 
  of the lease. </p>
<p> Issue 2: Did the judge fail to consider the economic impact of conversion 
  upon the mall?</p>
<p>[10] As the judge found no change of use within the meaning of the lease provisions, 
  she considered it unnecessary to determine the potential effect or impact of 
  the change from Loblaws to No Frills on the mall. </p>
<p>[11] However, she did consider the evidence on economic impact. She noted that 
  much of the projections proffered by the Landlord on economic impact was highly 
  speculative. She also observed that the Landlord&#146;s own expert agreed that 
  it was not inappropriate for any of the mall&#146;s current retailers to be 
  in the same mall as No Frills. She concluded that the change of name and banner 
  was consistent with the market realities.</p>
<p>[12] Once again, we see no error in her disposition of this issue. </p>
<p> Issue 3: Did the judge err in her interpretation of the continuous operation 
  provisions of the lease?</p>
<p>[13] In changing to a No Frills store, Loblaws plans to invest $2 million to 
  upgrade the store, $200,000 of which is to be used directly for building construction. 
  The store would have to be closed for 6&frac12; to 7 weeks. The Landlord sought 
  a declaration that Loblaws is obliged to conduct the business of a supermarket 
  on the whole of the leased premises continuously and that any cessation of operations 
  would be a breach of Loblaws&#146; 50-year lease. </p>
<p>[14] On this issue, the judge stated at para. 40 of her reasons:</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">&#133;</p>
<p class="judgmentindent">[40] I agree with the tenant that it is ludicrous to 
  believe that closing the store for between 6&frac12; to 7 weeks where there 
  is a 50-year lease, for the purpose of making renovations and improvements to 
  the premises or using part of the premises for this purpose, would contravene 
  the intent and meaning of the continuous use clause in the lease. I can find 
  no reasonable grounds for the landlord to withhold its written approval of the 
  tenant&#146;s proposed renovation of the premises. The landlord&#146;s request 
  for a declaration to that effect is denied.</p>
<p>[15] Looking at the lease in its entirety, and in light of the evidence relating 
  to this issue, we are of the view that her conclusion to refuse the landlord&#146;s 
  request is reasonable in the circumstances. In relation to this issue, the landlord 
  also alleges a technical breach of the terms of the lease on the failure of 
  Loblaws to submit plans for renovations prior to the commencing of its application. 
  Whatever deficiencies may have existed at that time have been remedied by the 
  extensive material produced on the application and during cross-examination. 
  We would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> Issue 4: Did the judge err in not granting the Landlord a declaration that 
  it was entitled to withhold consent to the franchising of the store arbitrarily?</p>
<p>[16] The landlord sought a declaration that it could arbitrarily prevent Loblaws 
  from operating a No Frills store on the premises through a franchisee. The landlord 
  insists that the potential future franchising of the food supermarket was a 
  relevant issue before the judge (and on the appeal) even though Loblaws has 
  withdrawn the component of its application seeking a declaration regarding whether 
  a franchisee could operate the store. </p>
<p>[17] As Loblaws withdrew its application, we see no error in the exercise of 
  the judge&#146;s discretion to not deal with this issue. </p>
<p> Issue 5: Did the judge err in not re-opening the application to hear new evidence?</p>
<p>[18] After the judge delivered her reasons, the landlord brought a motion to 
  re-open the hearing to introduce new evidence that Loblaws had apparently failed 
  to disclose. More specifically, the Landlord alleged that Loblaws had not made 
  full disclosure of the status of its dealings with a franchisee for its proposed 
  No Frills store. </p>
<p>[19] The judge reviewed the proposed evidence and concluded that it did not 
  meet the test for the admission of new evidence as set out in this court&#146;s 
  decision in DeGroote v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (1999), 121 O.A.C. 
  327 at para. 3, aff&#146;g [1998] O.J. No. 1696 (Gen. Div.). The evidence did 
  not meet the requirement that the nature of the evidence would have affected 
  or altered the ultimate decision of the application or cross-application. Furthermore, 
  that evidence could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>
<p>[20] The judge gave cogent reasons for her conclusions and we see no basis 
  to interfere with the exercise of her discretion. </p>
<p>[21] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $31,000.00 including disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
