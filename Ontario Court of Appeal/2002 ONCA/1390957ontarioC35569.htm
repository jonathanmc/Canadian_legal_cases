<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice Bonnie L. Croll dated 
  December 12, 2000.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This appeal from an order of Croll&nbsp;J. concerns the interpretation 
  of a provision of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13 that permits 
  an owner to convey the remaining part of a parcel of land where the other part 
  or parts of the parcel have been the subject of a consent by the Committee of 
  Adjustment.  The appellant and respondent in this appeal are the purchaser and 
  vendor respectively of the remaining part of the parcel.  The purchaser argues 
  that because of the order in which the vendor’s predecessor in title dealt with 
  the parts of the parcel of land, the vendor did not have a valid title to the 
  part.  The purchaser therefore submits that it was entitled to repudiate the 
  transaction and to the return of the deposit.  Croll J. dismissed the purchaser’s 
  application for a declaration that the vendor was in breach of the agreement 
  of purchase and sale for failing to comply with the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Her 
  reasons are now reported at (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 635.  For the reasons that 
  follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The agreement of purchase and sale between the appellant and 
  the respondent concerned part of a parcel of land in the Town of Richmond Hill.  
  I will refer to it in these reasons as Part 1.  The respondent Valerie Acchione 
  acquired Part 1 in the following circumstances.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent’s predecessor in title is Bridget Orfi.  She owned 
  Parts 1 and the abutting lands, which I will refer to as Parts 2 and 3.  On 
  December 10, 1992, the Committee of Adjustment of the Town of Richmond Hill 
  gave its consent to a conveyance of Parts 2 and 3.  On March&nbsp;7, 1995, an 
  official provided a Certificate of Official certifying this consent.  Under 
  s.&nbsp;53(43) of the Act that consent lapsed at the expiration of two years 
  from the date the certificate was given “if the transaction in respect of which 
  the consent was given is not carried out within the two-year period”.  On January 
  23, 1996, Ms. Orfi executed a transfer of Parts 2 and 3 (the consented part) 
  to herself, purportedly to effect a severance of the parcel.  As I understand 
  it, the purpose of this transaction was to ensure that Ms. Orfi would be able 
  to transfer Parts 2 and 3 although she still held the abutting lands after the 
  expiration of the two-year period.  See S.H. Troister,<i> The Law of Subdivision 
  Control in Ontario</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1994), at&nbsp;262-64.  On February 
  27, 1996, Ms. Orfi executed a transfer of Part 1 (the remaining part) to the 
  respondent Ms. Acchione.  The appellant submits that this transaction violated 
  the Act and that the respondent therefore did not acquire title to Part&nbsp;1.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In May 2000, the respondent and the appellant entered into an 
  agreement of purchase and sale in respect of Part 1.  The transaction was to 
  close on July 26, 2000.  On June 30, 2000, the appellant’s solicitor submitted 
  a number of requisitions to the respondent’s solicitor.  The solicitor stated 
  his opinion that the transfer from Orfi to the respondent was invalid and therefore 
  required on or before closing that the Transfer be stamped with the consent 
  of the Committee of Adjustment.  The respondent’s solicitor was unable to satisfy 
  the appellant that the consent was not necessary.  There was a flurry of correspondence 
  between the lawyers in the days before the closing.  In the end, the appellant’s 
  solicitor took the view that the respondent was in anticipatory breach of the 
  Agreement of Purchase and Sale as she could not convey good and marketable title 
  on the closing date.  He therefore required the return of the deposit with interest.  
  The respondent refused and this litigation ensued.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A number of other events occurred after closing in which the 
  respondent’s solicitor attempted to extend the closing date and remedy the alleged 
  defect in title.  They are the subject of pending or proposed litigation between 
  the parties and nothing in these reasons is intended to dispose of any issue 
  other than the <i>Planning Act</i> question that was decided by Croll J.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE PROBLEM</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While I will set out the applicable provisions of the Act below, 
  the problem raised by this appeal can be stated in simple and general terms.  
  Section 50 of the Act prohibits any person from conveying land except in certain 
  circumstances.  The exceptions in issue in this case are the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)            The person does not own abutting land [(3)(b)];</p>
    <p>(ii)            The person has a consent from the Committee of Adjustment 
      [(3)(f)];</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant says that neither exception applies here because 
  when Orfi conveyed Part 1 to Acchione she still owned abutting land (Parts 2 
  and 3).  The consent exception does not apply because the consent was for the 
  conveyance of Parts 2 and 3, not Part 1.  In the result, s. 50(21) of the Act 
  applies.  Section 50(21) provides that a conveyance made in contravention of 
  the section does not create or convey an interest in land.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent says that the Orfi to Acchione conveyance did 
  not violate s. 50 and relies upon s. 50(6).  That subsection provides that the 
  remaining part of a parcel (here Part 1) may be conveyed before the parts subject 
  to the consent (Parts 2 and 3) are conveyed, provided that the remaining part 
  is conveyed before the consent lapses.  In this case, the Orfi to Acchione conveyance 
  occurred well before the consent to convey Parts 2 and 3 lapsed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that s. 50(6) is no answer because when 
  Ms.&nbsp;Orfi conveyed Parts 2 and 3 to herself, this exhausted s. 50(6).  The 
  applications judge was of the view that the appellant’s interpretation and application 
  of s. 50(6) would lead to an absurd result.  She held that the provision could 
  be interpreted in a manner that avoided this absurdity and avoided the alleged 
  violation of the Act.  She held that s. 50(6) is permissive, that the remaining 
  part “may” not “must” be conveyed before the consented to part.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>The Law of Subdivision Control in Ontario</i>, <i>supra, 
  </i>at p. 175, the author states that it was a “classic question” whether an 
  owner who obtained a consent to convey parcel A while intending to retain abutting 
  Parcel B could rely on the consent to convey parcel B for which no consent was 
  given.  Section 50(6) resolves the issue and permits the owner of the remaining 
  land to convey parcel B, provided that the consent has not lapsed.  Where the 
  planning authority has given its consent to severance by allowing the conveyance 
  of one of two parcels, it makes no sense to require that the conveyances take 
  place in any particular order, provided that the severance is effected before 
  the consent expires.  Nevertheless, as Troister points out at pp. 175-6 the 
  subsection is “fraught with practical problems” and “has not been well-drafted”.  
  This case presents one of these problems.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Unless the case falls within the terms of s. 50(6), the prohibition 
  in s. 50(3) and (21) applies.  Ms. Orfi’s attempt to convey the remaining part 
  while she retained abutting land would be a conveyance in contravention of the 
  section.  In my view, s. 50(6) cannot apply.  The critical part of the subsection 
  is the following:  “the whole of the remaining part may be conveyed or otherwise 
  dealt with <i>before</i> the other part or parts are conveyed or otherwise dealt 
  with”.  As the applications judge observed, this subsection is permissive.  
  The owner is not required to convey the remaining part before the consented 
  to part, but s. 50(6), by its terms, only applies where the remaining part is 
  conveyed <i>before</i> the consented to part.  In this case, the remaining part 
  was conveyed <i>after</i> the conveyance by Orfi to herself of the consented 
  part.  Subject to the possible application of s. 50(12), with which I will deal 
  with shortly, no other exception in s. 50 is relied upon to permit the conveyance 
  of the remaining part while Orfi held the abutting land.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Re Baker et al. and Belleville Collectors Market Ltd.</i> 
  (1987), 60 O.R. (2d) 157 (Dist. Ct.), Lally D.C.J. reached the same conclusion.  
  <i>Baker</i> was an application under the <i>Vendors and Purchasers Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1980, c. 520.  The facts were identical to the facts in this case.  With 
  considerable reluctance, Lally D.C.J. concluded that the provision was clear 
  and applied only where the proposed conveyance of the remaining part is made 
  before the conveyance of the consented part.  He concluded his reasons at p. 
  160 with this comment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I reserved on this matter hoping that s. 49(6) [now s. 50(6)] could 
      be interpreted in such a manner that the requisition has been satisfactorily 
      answered. <u>However, in order to do so I would have to ignore that the 
      Legislature has stated that s. 49(6) is applicable only where the conveyance 
      of the part without the consent takes place before the property which has 
      the consent is conveyed or otherwise dealt with. I cannot intepret it in 
      any way other than the interpretation that [counsel for the purchaser] suggests, 
      since the language is clear and unambiguous.</u></span></p>
    <p>The fact that I do not fully understand the reason for the insertion of 
      the words in s. 49(6), “before the other part or parts are conveyed or otherwise 
      dealt with”, and feel that their application in this instance works an injustice 
      to the vendor, does not provide sufficient reason to hold that the requisition 
      is invalid.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

      Sullivan, <i>Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i> (3rd ed. 1994) 
      (hereinafter “<i>Construction of Statutes</i>”); Pierre-André Côté, <i>The 
      Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1991)), Elmer Driedger 
      in <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the 
      approach upon which I prefer to rely.&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognizes that statutory 
      interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
      p. 87 he states:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Today there is only one principle or approach, 
          namely, <u>the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context 
          and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme 
          of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliamen</u></span><u><span lang=EN-US>t</span></u>.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no mystery to the ordinary meaning of the word “before”.  
  To adopt the interpretation favoured by the respondent would require the court 
  to ignore the word or interpret it as bearing its ordinary meaning and its antonym.  
  In other words, the court would have to interpret “before” as meaning “before 
  or after”.  The provision cannot fairly bear such an interpretation.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 10 of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. I.11 
  instructs the court to adopt “<span style='color:black'>such fair, large and 
  liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of 
  the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit”</span>.  
  But it is one thing for the court to adopt an interpretation that takes into 
  account the object or intention of the legislature and the context in which 
  the words are used.  It is quite another to ignore the plain meaning of an ordinary 
  English word and interpret it as if it means the opposite of what it says. </p>

  </span></span> Giving “before” its plain and ordinary meaning does no great 
  harm to the scheme of the legislation and does not undermine the policy behind 
  the legislation.  It simply means that s. 50(6) does not cover all cases where 
  the conveyance would not cause any mischief.  That, however, must be a matter 
  for the Legislature.  That said, the Legislature could hardly be blamed for 
  failing to anticipate that an owner would deprive herself of the benefit of 
  the provision by making a conveyance to herself, a result that could so easily 
  have been avoided had the owner simply conveyed the consented part to a nominee.  
  See Troister<i> supra</i> at p. 275.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent made one further submission to avoid 
  the effect of the plain meaning of s. 50(6).  He submitted that a transfer by 
  an owner to herself was not a “conveyance” within the meaning of the subsection.  
  Thus, he argued that s. 50(6) could still apply when Orfi made the subsequent 
  transfer of the remaining part to the respondent.  In my view, the provisions 
  of the <i>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34 are 
  a complete answer to that submission.  Section 1 of that Act defines “conveyance” 
  in the widest terms to include:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>an assignment, appointment, lease, settlement, and other assurance, 
      made by deed, on a sale, mortgage, demise, or settlement of any property 
      or on any other dealing with or for any property and “convey” has a meaning 
      corresponding with that of conveyance</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 41 of the Act authorizes the very transaction that occurred 
  in this case in terms indicating that it is a conveyance.  Marginally headed 
  “Conveyance of property to self”, it provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>41.            <span
style='color:black'>A person may convey property to or vest property in the person 
      in like manner as the person could have conveyed the property to or vested 
      the property in another person.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In their factum, counsel for the respondent submitted that s. 
  50(12) of the Act applied.  That subsection provides that where a parcel of 
  land has been conveyed with consent, s. 50(3) does not apply to subsequent conveyances 
  or other transactions “involving the identical parcel of land”.  The respondent 
  relies upon <i>Re Allin and Harvey et al.</i> (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 798 (Dist. 
  Ct.).  In my view, subs. (12) can apply only to conveyances of the consented 
  part, being the “identical parcel of land”.  In the present case, the consented 
  part is Parts 2 and 3, not Part 1, the land that is the subject of the agreement 
  of purchase and sale between the parties to this appeal.  I prefer the reasoning 
  of Leitch J. in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Barletta</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 3013 
  (Gen. Div.), which held that a conveyance of the abutting parcel is not a conveyance 
  of or other transaction involving the identical parcel of land.</p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and grant a declaration 
  that the conveyance from Orfi to Acchione violated s. 50 of the <i>Planning 
  Act</i>.  Croll J. ordered that there be no costs of the application before 
  her, and I would not disturb that order.  In this court, however, the appellant 
  is entitled to its costs of the appeal.</p>

    note that Troister <i>supra</i> at p. 178 agreed that the court’s conclusion 
    in <i>Baker</i> “seems to be a correct interpretation of subs. (6)”, even 
    if a different interpretation might have led to a more practical result.  
    As he notes at 275, “it seems ludicrous to require the owner of two abutting 
    parcels to be able to deal in all ways with the previously consented parcel 
    and be restricted in all ways from dealing with the abutting unconsented parcel”.</p>
