  </span> This appeal is from the dismissal of a motion brought pursuant to rule 
  21.01(3) to have an action dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff has no 
  capacity to commence or continue the action. The legal issue concerns the application 
  of s. 21 of the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, to the 
  facts of a real estate transaction. The appellants are the vendor company and 
  individuals associated with it. The purchaser under the agreement of purchase 
  and sale was “Raymond Stern in trust for a company to be incorporated and not 
  in his personal capacity”. When the vendor repudiated the contract, Stern accepted 
  the repudiation and then incorporated the plaintiff to pursue damages. The motions 
  judge, in reasons reported at [2001] O.J. No. 334, held that the plaintiff had 
  status to pursue the action.</p>

  </span> A brief chronology of the real estate transaction follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>October 14, 1999</u> – 1310210 Ontario Inc. entered into an agreement 
      to sell land to “Raymond Stern in trust for a company to be incorporated 
      and not in his personal capacity” for $4.7 million with a deposit of $3,000. 
      Ninety days was given for the purchaser to waive certain itemized conditions 
      whereupon a further deposit of $27,000 was to be paid. Failure to waive 
      conditions within the prescribed time would render the agreement null and 
      void. Closing was fixed for April 16, 2000. </p>
    <p><u>December 27, 1999</u> – “Raymond Stern in trust for a company to be 
      incorporated and not in his personal capacity” signed an amending agreement 
      extending the time for waiver of conditions and closing for one month. </p>
    <p><u>December 31, 1999</u> – The amending agreement was signed on behalf 
      of the vendor by David Cohen, one of the two officers of the vendor who 
      had signed the original agreement.</p>
    <p><u>January 15, 2000</u> – David Cohen passed away.</p>
    <p><u>February 11, 2000</u> – In a letter to the purchaser’s solicitor, the 
      vendor’s solicitor asserted that the amending agreement was null and void 
      because, as Stern knew, it was never signed by authorized officers. The 
      letter also stated that since the original waiver period had expired, the 
      agreement of purchase and sale was terminated.</p>
    <p><u>March 1, 2000</u> – Solicitor for “Raymond Stern in trust for a company 
      to be incorporated and not in his personal capacity” wrote the vendor’s 
      solicitor asserting an unlawful repudiation, his client’s acceptance of 
      the repudiation, and his intent to pursue a claim for damages.</p>
    <p><u>March 15, 2000</u> – Plaintiff company was incorporated.</p>
    <p><u>March 22, 2000</u> – Raymond Stern purported to assign his rights under 
      the contract to the plaintiff company.</p>

  </span> The question for the court is whether the respondent, 1394918 Ontario 
  Ltd., has an assertable cause of action against 1310210 Ontario Inc. The answer 
  depends on whether the respondent has effectively adopted the contract under 
  s. 21 of the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>. The claims against the individual 
  appellants for conspiracy would fall if the respondent lacked status to seek 
  damages, but are not otherwise before this court for consideration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 21 reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>            21.—(1) Except as provided in this section, a person who enters 
      into an oral or written contract in the name of or on behalf of a corporation 
      before it comes into existence is personally bound by the contract and is 
      entitled to the benefits thereof.</p>
    <p>            (2)  A corporation may, within a reasonable time after it comes 
      into existence, by any action or conduct signifying its intention to be 
      bound thereby, adopt an oral or written contract made before it came into 
      existence in its name or on its behalf, and upon such adoption,</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> (a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the corporation is bound 
        by the contract and is entitled to the benefits thereof as if the corporation 
        had been in existence at the date of the contract and had been a party 
        thereto; and</p>
      <p> (b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> a person who purported to 
        act in the name of or on behalf of the corporation ceases, except as provided 
        in subsection (3), to be bound by or entitled to the benefits of the contract.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>            (3)  Except as provided in subsection (4), whether or not an 
      oral or written contract made before the coming into existence of a corporation 
      is adopted by the corporation, a party to the contract may apply to a court 
      for an order fixing obligations under the contract as joint or joint and 
      several or apportioning liability between the corporation and the person 
      who purported to act in the name of or on behalf of the corporation, and, 
      upon such application, the court may make any order it thinks fit.</p>
    <p>            (4)  If expressly so provided in the oral or written contract 
      referred to in subsection (1), a person who purported to act in the name 
      of or on behalf of the corporation before it came into existence is not 
      in any event bound by the contract or entitled to the benefits thereof.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is the third occasion this court has had to deal with s. 21 of 
  the Act. <i>Sherwood Design Services</i> <i>Inc. v. 872935 Ontario Ltd.</i> 
  (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 576 (C.A.) and <i>Szecket v Huang</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 
  400 (C.A.) recite the history of difficulty the common law experienced in dealing 
  with incorporated companies that were to be inserted into contracts and make 
  it clear that s. 21 was intended to replace the common law. As such, that section 
  should be read on its own terms and in an interpretative context of the purpose 
  it was intended to fulfil. The statutory scheme for pre-incorporation contracts 
  throws off the confusion of the common law and shouldn’t be thwarted to that 
  end by concern, for instance, that a common law contract requires two parties 
  with co-existent liabilities. If s. 21 calls for liability absent those features 
  then those liabilities must flow and the “contract” referred to must be treated 
  as a statutory creation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Commercial business concerns inform s. 21. The section is clearly directed 
  at meeting the needs of a party who wishes, and has negotiated for, liability 
  to be assumed by an as yet unincorporated corporation. In the circumstances 
  described in s. 21(1), the promoter is personally bound by the contract and 
  entitled to its benefits. Either party can sue on the other’s breach. After 
  incorporation and notice of intention to adopt, s. 21(2) provides that the corporation 
  is bound and entitled to the benefits retroactively to the date the agreement 
  was signed. Thus, the corporation can be liable for any breach on the promoter’s 
  part and can sue on any breach by the third party, regardless of when the breach 
  occurred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Contracts under s. 21(4) differ from those under s. 21(1) in a few important 
  ways. The wording of the subsection is awkward but its meaning can be restated 
  as follows. If a promoter enters into an oral or written contract on behalf 
  of a corporation to be incorporated and that oral or written contract expressly 
  provides that the promoter is not bound by the contract or entitled to the benefits 
  thereof, then the promoter is not in any event bound by or entitled to the benefits 
  of the contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 21(2) applies to a s. 21(4) contract and the position of the 
  corporation after adoption is identical whether or not the promoter was personally 
  bound before adoption.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The timeline of obligations under a s. 21(4) contract is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Prior 
      to incorporation and adoption, the promoter is not personally bound or entitled 
      to benefits of the contract. He might be described as a functionary, performing 
      such duties as assuring that any necessary inspections of property or title 
      are pursued, that deadlines are met, and defaults avoided which might excuse 
      the third party from the obligations. At the same time, the corporation 
      does not exist or has not adopted the contract and thus is not bound by 
      it or entitled to its benefits. There is an entity called a “contract” under 
      the statute, but no one is entitled to sue for its breach. That is not to 
      say that ongoing obligations can be ignored. I would term this a nascent 
      contract, its enforceability being suspended.</p>
    <p> 2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After 
      incorporation and indication of intention to adopt, the corporation is both 
      bound by and entitled to the benefits of the contract. One feature of the 
      statutory scheme that is unknown to the common law is that, after adoption, 
      the corporation is entitled retroactively as if it had been in existence 
      at the time the contract arose. Thus, the corporation can be liable for 
      any breach on the promoter’s part that occurred prior to adoption and can 
      sue on any breach by the third party regardless of when it occurred.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants argue that prior to adoption the s. 21(4) contract is 
  a revocable offer, citing the British Columbia Court of Appeal holding in <i>Heinhuis 
  v. Blacksheep Charters Ltd. </i>(1987), 46 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 67 at 72. 
  That is a common law decision and, as indicated above, should in my view be 
  resisted in giving meaning to this self-contained legislation which seeks to 
  move beyond the common law. Revocable offers are well known to the common law 
  and any analogy to them would not explain the retroactive enforceability of 
  this statutory “contract”. <i>Szecket, supra,</i> established that common law 
  contract principles should not be reintroduced into the analysis of s. 21 and 
  rejected the two-stage approach in <i>Westcom Radio Group Ltd</i>.<i> v. MacIsaac</i> 
  (1989), 70 O.R. (2d) 591, whereby the court first established that there was 
  a valid contract at common law and only then applied the statutory rules. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The next step is to take this understanding of s. 21(4) and apply it 
  to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The recital of the name of the purchaser as “Raymond Stern in trust 
  for a company to be incorporated and not in his personal capacity” is unaffected 
  by the reference  to a trust. There is nothing to be held in trust because Stern 
  cannot benefit from the agreement and there is no beneficiary. It is no different 
  in effect than if it read “on behalf of” rather than “in trust for.”  It is 
  an agreement that fits squarely into s. 21(4).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The agreement is for a sale at a price of $4.7 million dollars with 
  a deposit of $3,000 and a further deposit of $27,000 upon waiver of conditions. 
  The major condition was inspection of the property by the purchaser and was 
  to be waived within 90 days or the agreement became null and void. This was 
  effectively an option for ninety days because the vendor had no security except 
  the small initial deposit and no agreement that could be enforced. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The agreement either was or was not extended for one month by the amending 
  agreement of December 31, 1999. I must assume that the amending agreement was 
  valid and that the vendor’s letter of February 11, 2000 was a wrongful repudiation 
  coming one day before the expiry of the extended waiver period. It is alleged 
  that  Stern intended to waive the conditions. On March 1, 2000 the solicitor 
  for the purchaser wrote the vendor’s solicitor, informing him of his client’s 
  acceptance of the repudiation and intention to commence an action for damages. 
  Two weeks later, the respondent company was incorporated and on March 22<sup>nd</sup> 
  Raymond Stern in trust, etc., purported to assign the agreement to the numbered 
  company. This action was commenced the following day in the name of the numbered 
  company.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In electing to accept the repudiation, Stern was performing as what 
  I have termed a functionary, just as he was when he sought out an extension 
  agreement. Section&nbsp;21(4) of the Act can only work if someone is responsible 
  for carrying the contract forward pending incorporation of the corporate party. 
  However, I disagree with the motions judge’s finding that the assignment was 
  effective. By the very terms of s. 21(4), Stern had no entitlement to the benefits 
  of the contract and thus had nothing to assign.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The entitlement of the corporation must depend upon its adoption of 
  the contract, if there was anything left to adopt. I am satisfied that the institution 
  of the action was an indication of intention to adopt the contract and it remains 
  to determine if the agreement had life at the time the action was commenced.</p>

  </span> The appellants take the position that there can be no adoption under 
  s. 21(2) following the letter of March 1, 2000 accepting the repudiation and 
  thus terminating the contract. Because s. 21 gives little guidance on the question 
  of whether accepted repudiation terminates the contract, I think it useful to 
  look to the common law on this point.</p>

  </span> Some support for the appellants’ view would appear to come out of <i>Moschi 
  v. Lep Air Services Ltd.</i>, [1973] A.C. 331 at 345 (H.L.), where Lord Reid 
  stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> I cannot agree that after accepted repudiation the contractual obligations 
      still exist as obligations. For the breach of any contract the normal remedy 
      is damages in money …. So it appears to me that when a <i>contract is brought 
      to an end by repudiation accepted </i>by the other party <i>all the obligations 
      in the contract come to an end</i> and they are replaced by operation of 
      law by an obligation to pay money damages. [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to Lord Reid, then, an accepted repudiation has the effect 
  of ending the contract and ending all obligations under the contract. This description 
  of the effect of an accepted repudiation seems inconsistent with the continued 
  existence of the contract. And if the contract ceases to exist upon the acceptance 
  of repudiation, then how could the newly incorporated company adopt the contract 
  after that point in time?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent takes the position that a “contract” can be adopted under 
  s. 21(2) after accepted repudiation. Although Lord Reid’s speech in<i> Lep Air 
  Services</i> appears to support the appellants’ position that the contract does 
  not exist to be adopted after accepted repudiation, Lord Diplock’s speech in 
  that case appears to support the respondent’s view. About the defaulting party’s 
  obligations upon acceptance of repudiation, Lord Diplock had this to say at 
  p. 350:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>But for his primary obligations there is substituted by operation of law 
      a secondary obligation to pay to the other party a sum of money to compensate 
      him for the loss he has sustained as a result of the failure to perform 
      the primary obligations. This secondary obligation is just as much an obligation 
      arising from the contract as are the primary obligations that it replaces.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Similarly, the position in Canada is that contractual obligations continue 
  to exist after accepted repudiation. In <i>Guarantee Co. of North America v. 
  Gordon Capital Corp.</i> (1999), 39 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 100 at 115, the 
  Supreme Court of Canada found as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Contrary to rescission, which allows the rescinding party to treat the 
      contract as if it were void <i>ab initio</i>, the effect of a repudiation 
      depends on the election made by the non-repudiating party. If that party 
      treats the contract as still being in full force and effect, the contract 
      “‘remains in being for the future on both sides. Each [party] has a right 
      to sue for damages for<i> past or future breaches</i>’” (emphasis in original): 
      <i>Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston’s Law of Contract </i>(12<sup>th</sup> 
      ed. 1991), by M.P. Furmston at p. 541. If, however, the non-repudiating 
      party accepts the repudiation, the contract is terminated, and the parties 
      are discharged from future obligations. Rights and obligations that have 
      already matured are not extinguished. Furmston, <i>supra, </i>at pp. 543-44.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the Court does say that accepted repudiation “terminates” the 
  contract, the context reveals that only future obligations under the contract 
  are extinguished. Accrued obligations under the contract continue to exist, 
  at least in the form of a secondary obligation to pay damages. To the extent 
  that there remain in existence contractual obligations, it cannot be said that 
  the contract ceases to exist.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further support for this view is found in <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 
  28<sup>th</sup> ed. (1999) at pp. 1219-20:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…although sometimes the innocent party is referred to as “rescinding” the 
      contract and the contract as being “terminated” by the breach, it is clear 
      that the contract is not rescinded <i>ab initio</i> nor is it extinguished 
      by the breach. The innocent party, or, in some cases, both parties, are 
      excused from further performance of their primary obligations under the 
      contract; but there is then substituted for the primary obligations of the 
      party in default a secondary obligation to pay monetary compensation for 
      his non-performance.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts,</i> 4<sup>th</sup> ed. 
  (1999) at p. 460, “repudiation puts an end to the contract in the sense that 
  it releases the innocent party from the duty of further performance, but it 
  does not abrogate the whole contract – the innocent party can sue for damages.” 
  Similarly, Fridman, <i>The Law of Contract in Canada</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. 
  (1999) at p. 654, has written that “Repudiation does not ‘end’ a contract: it 
  terminates future further performance by <i>either</i> side …” [Emphasis in 
  original].</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further, and returning from the common law to this statutory “contract”, 
  s. 21(2)(a) provides that the corporation is entitled to all the benefits as 
  if it had been in existence at the date of the contract. The common law authorities 
  cited above did not have before them this new breed of legislated “contract”. 
  There were two parties to those contracts and the aggrieved party could always 
  sue for damages, whatever the significance of termination might be. In the instant 
  case, if the purchaser had been in existence at the outset, or at any time before 
  March 1, 2000, it could have sued for damages. The company would be denied “all 
  the benefits of the contract” if disentitled to sue in these circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One curious feature of s. 21 deserves mention. The issues in this case 
  arose because of the long time span between execution of the agreement and adoption 
  by the corporation by the institution of this action. The legislation requires 
  adoption by the company “within a reasonable time after it comes into existence” 
  rather than a reasonable time after execution of the agreement. It is difficult 
  to see a rationale for this provision but protection can presumably be provided 
  by a suitably worded condition in the agreement.</p>
