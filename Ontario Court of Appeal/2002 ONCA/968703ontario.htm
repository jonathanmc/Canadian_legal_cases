  </span></span> Spencer Vernon is an elderly gentleman in his 80s who, for several 
  decades, operated a gravel pit and processing plant in the township of Oro, 
  in the County of Simcoe.  He is the sole director and shareholder of the appellate 
  corporations, York Sand and Gravel Limited and Marketplace Equipment Limited, 
  hereafter referred to as the Vernon companies.  968703 Ontario Limited, carrying 
  on business as Headline Industries (Headline), is an auctioneering firm specializing

  </span> In June 1995, the Vernon companies entered into an agreement, amended 
  on August 1, 1995, for the sale of goods by the Vernon companies through an 
  auction to be conducted by Headline.  The parties agreed:</p>

  </span> The auction occurred on August 23 and 24, 1995.  In breach of the contract, 
  Headline did not deposit a substantial amount of money, over $100,000, from 
  the auction into the joint bank account.  At about the end of August 1995, the 
  Vernon Companies refused Headline entry on their lands to sell the remaining 
  assets.  Headline sued for damages for loss of profit on account of the Vernon 
  companies refusal to allow it to sell the remaining assets.  Vernon counterclaimed 
  against Headline and Wilson personally.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The main issue on this appeal is whether Vernon, on behalf of the Vernon 
  companies, was entitled to refuse Headline access to his remaining goods, to 
  terminate the contract and to be released from any future obligations.  A secondary 
  issue is whether this was an appropriate case in which to make an award of punitive 
  or exemplary damages.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span></span> Ernest Wilson admitted that there was a certain level of 
      trust in these arrangements.  As auctioneer for Headline it was within Wilsons 
      discretion to determine when to drop the hammer and accept a bid.<span lang=EN-US

      </span></span> It was implicit in the dealings between Headline and the 
      Vernon Companies that they deal fairly with each other.  The auction was 
      to be conducted in good faith and the sales proceeds were to be properly 
      accounted for.</p>

      </span></span> Wilson put himself in a conflict of interest with Vernon 
      by causing Headline to sell assets to three companies controlled by Wilson 
      with a view to making a profit for himself.  He kept all of this secret 
      from Vernon and the Vernon Companies, though in the end Headline was unable 
      to sell the assets at a higher price than that at which they were purchased.</p>

      to persuade Stephen Lehmann of Francoz Metals to pay him or Headline cash 
      for every fourth load of Vernon Companies scrap metal in return for being 
      given the right to remove all scrap metals.  Ernest Wilson raised the 
      issue with Francoz, and never reported the discussions to Vernon. </p>

      in the face of the parties agreement and the orders to the contrary.  Although 
      the funds were paid into a joint account just before trial, Headline failed

  it was substantially insufficient to prove the value of those assets on the

  amount of $5,000.  This award was to reflect the gravity of both the contractual

  </span> The Divisional Court was of the opinion that the Vernon companies were 
  not excused from further performance of their contract with Headline.  The court 
  also held that the trial judge erred in rejecting Wilsons evidence as to the 
  value of the remaining goods.  The court stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The evidence of the value of those assets given by Ernest Wilson was not 
      challenged by cross-examination, or contradicted by other evidence.  In 
      these circumstances, although the trial judge was not obliged to accept 
      the stochastic evidence of Wilson at face value, he was not entitled for 
      the reasons given by him to reject it in its entirety.</p>
    <p>In our view, the evidence clearly established that the remaining assets 
      had some substantial value.  By preventing the plaintiff from proceeding 
      to attempt to sell those assets in accordance with the provisions of the 
      agreement between the parties, the defendants deprived the plaintiff of 
      an opportunity to receive the entirety of the proceeds of those assets up 
      to approximately $100,000 and its share of the excess beyond that.  </p>

  </span> Headlines position is that its breach of contract and breach of fiduciary 
  duty did not excuse the Vernon companies from further performance of the contract.  
  All of the money owed was eventually paid to Vernon.  Furthermore, Wilson made 
  no money on the items purchased for himself when Headline breached its fiduciary 
  duty.  It is submitted, therefore, that the trial judge erred in not accepting 
  Wilsons evidence respecting Headlines damages for loss of opportunity to sell 
  the remaining goods.  No objection was expressed to receiving the opinion evidence 
  of Wilson at trial and his evidence was not challenged on cross-examination.  
  Consequently, Headline submits that the Divisional Court decision awarding it 
  $50,000 as damages for loss of opportunity should be upheld.  In relation to 
  the award of $5,000, Headline points out that there was never a contempt order 
  made against it and submits that exemplary damages should not have been awarded.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is some ambiguity in the trial judges reasons on the issue of 
  whether the Vernon companies were excused from further performance of the contract 
  because of Headlines failure to pay a large sum of the money from the auction 
  into the joint bank account.  Under the heading, Failure to Act in Good Faith, 
  the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is not a case of anticipatory breach going to the root of the contract, 
      but rather a dispute over the application and division of proceeds of the 
      auction, failure to comply with contractual obligation for payment into 
      the trust account, and one involving the plaintiffs flouting of court orders.  
      These breaches entitle the Vernon companies to damages but do not in the 
      circumstances entitle Spencer Vernon and his companies to <i>repudiate</i> 
      the entire contract.   </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It was at this point in his reasons that the trial judge awarded damages 
  to the Vernon companies of $5,000.  Under the next heading, Contractual Accounting 
  Analysis, the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Having breached the agreement by failing to pay all funds 
      into the joint account, the plaintiff is not entitled, in my view, to the 
      value of any assets remaining.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before dealing with the merits of the parties arguments, clarification 
  of the trial judges reasons respecting his decision will be of assistance.  
  The trial judges statement that the Vernon companies were not entitled to <i>repudiate</i> 
  the entire contract is problematic.  The term <i>rescission</i>, is sometimes 
  used to indicate total abrogation of the contract with all its obligations.  
  A repudiation means that the contract is ended in the sense that the innocent 
  party is released from the duty of future performance.  The contract is not 
  totally abrogated because the innocent party can, however, sue for damages for 
  the other partys breach of its obligations before the termination.  See Waddams, 
  <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (1993), at pp. 427-28.  Having 
  regard to the reasons as a whole, I am of the opinion that the trial judge meant 
  to say that the Vernon companies were not entitled to <i>rescind </i>the entire 
  contract.  This conclusion is supported by the trial judges later holding that 
  Headlines breach of contract by failing to pay the money into the joint bank 
  account excused the Vernon companies from further performance of their obligations 
  under the contract.  Headlines breach, however, did not deprive it of the commissions 
  it had already been paid from the auction sale. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Was the trial judge correct in law to excuse Vernon from further performance 
  of the contract and did the Divisional Court err in reversing this conclusion?  
  Only a substantial, not a minor, breach of contract will excuse the innocent 
  party from continued performance of a contract:  <i>Robson v. Thorne, Ernst 
  &amp; Whinney </i>(1999), 127 O.A.C. 215 (C.A.); <i>Bayer Aktiengesellschaft 
  v. Apotex Inc. </i>(1998), 113 O.A.C. 1 (C.A.).   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are several factors that provide guidance in determining whether 
  or not a breach is a substantial breach justifying future non-performance of 
  the innocent partys obligations.  They are: (a) the ratio of the partys obligation 
  not performed to the obligation as a whole; (b) the seriousness of the breach 
  to the innocent party; (c) the likelihood of repetition of the breach; (d) the 
  seriousness of the consequences of the breach; and (e) the relationship of the 
  part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation.  See Waddams, <i>supra</i>,<i> 
  </i>at pp. 401-02. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Without getting into an exact ratio, Headlines failure to deposit in 
  excess of $100,000 into the joint bank account was significant in relation to 
  the entire obligation under the contract.  The seriousness of the breach in 
  this instance, however, cannot be addressed strictly in monetary terms.  Headline 
  did not cure its breach within a few days.  Instead, refusing to comply with 
  court orders, and refusing to account until over two years had passed, it repeated 
  or continued the breach of contract.  This failure was in itself sufficient 
  to justify Vernons refusal to perform the rest of the contract.  Headlines 
  failure to deposit the money into the joint bank account justified Vernons 
  refusal to go ahead and put more assets into cash that might disappear.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> During this time, Vernon discovered that Wilson had caused Headline 
  to breach its fiduciary duty as agent.  In conducting the auction, Wilson had 
  caused Headline to sell some of the Vernon companies goods to Wilsons companies 
  below their appraised value.  Wilsons breach of trust meant that the Vernon 
  companies could not trust Headline to sell the remaining goods, including scrap 
  metal, following the auction.  That Vernon could not trust Wilson was confirmed 
  by Wilsons attempt to have Stephen Lehmann of Francoz Metals pay Headline alone 
  for every fourth load of scrap metal in order to remove it.  Vernon is entitled 
  to rely on this after-discovered breach of fiduciary duty as a further basis 
  to excuse it from future performance under the contract.  See <i>Raso v. Dionigi 
  </i>(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 580 (Ont. C.A.), and particularly <i>Parker v. McKenna 
  </i>(1874), L.R. 10 Ch. App. 96, cited therein at pp. 587-88. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, the Divisional Court therefore erred in not holding that 
  Vernon and his companies were excused from further performance under the contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A further argument made by counsel for Vernon is that the agreement 
  to sell the remaining goods at a mutually agreed price to Headline, failing 
  which they would remain the property of Vernon, is too vague to enforce.  It 
  is an agreement to make an agreement.  This argument does not appear to have 
  been made at trial.  The statement of defence simply says that the plaintiffs 
  damages are ill-defined and remote and does not specifically plead that this 
  portion of the contract is unenforceable as being too vague.  While the submission 
  may have merit, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to address 
  it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It follows from my conclusion that I would set aside the award of damages 
  made by the Divisional Court in the amount of $50,000.  Were it not for my conclusion 
  on liability, I would not interfere with the Divisional Courts assessment of 
  the amount of damages.  Wilson was an auctioneer in the business of selling 
  the type of goods in question.  He had the practical experience that enabled 
  him to give an opinion as to the value of the remaining goods, his opinion was 
  not challenged, and the Divisional Court applied a healthy discount for contingencies 
  to the estimate. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I now turn to the issue of whether the Divisional Court was correct 
  in setting aside the $5,000 awarded by the trial judge.  Although the trial 
  judge did not specifically say so, it would appear that the award was an award 
  of punitive damages because no general damages were proved by Vernon.  Before 
  an award of punitive damages may be made three requirements must be met.  First, 
  the conduct in question must disregard the rights of others to such an extent 
  that it deserves public censure.  Second, the person seeking punitive damages 
  must establish that the wrongdoer committed an independent actionable wrong 
  apart from the breach of contract.  Third, the award must serve a rational purpose 
  such as punishing the wrongdoer and deterring others.  See <i>Vorvis v. Insurance 
  Corp. of British </i>Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 at pp. 1104-1110; <i>Hill 
  v. The Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at pp. 1208-9; 
  <i>Gerula v. Flores</i> (1995), 83 O.A.C. 128 at paras. 58-59; <i>Marshall v. 
  Watson Wyatt &amp; Co.</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 84 (C.A.) at paras. 44 and 45.  
  In <i>Gerula</i>,<i> supra</i>, this court commented: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The purpose of an award of punitive damages is to demonstrate to the offender 
      that the law will not tolerate conduct that wilfully disregards the rights 
      of others: <i>Warner v. Arsenault</i> (1982), 53 N.S.R. (2d)146; 109 A.P.R. 
      146 (C.A.) at 152, cited with approval by McIntyre, J. in <i> Vorvis</i>, 
      <i>supra</i>, at p. 1108.  Punitive damages do not focus on the injury to 
      the plaintiff but on the disregard for his or her rights.  It is the outrageous 
      conduct of the defendant that is the focus: see<i> Vorvis</i>,<i> supra</i>, 
      at p. 1106<i>.  </i>Punitive damages survive as a mark of public censure 
      for egregious conduct. (footnote omitted.)</p>
    <p>Text books and the authorities use a variety of terminology to describe 
      the conduct that will result in an award of punitive damages.  For example, 
      in <i>Vorvis</i>,<i> supra</i>, at pp. 1107-1108, McIntyre J., in describing 
      the type of conduct that is deserving of punishment by an award of punitive 
      damages, referred to the harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious 
      nature of the conduct.  In characterizing the defendants conduct in <i> Vorvis</i>,<i> 
      supra</i>,<i> </i>McIntyre J. was not suggesting that all of the adjectives 
      he recited must be applicable to the conduct in question before punitive 
      damages can be awarded    or that the list is an all inclusive one.  He 
      stated at p. 1108:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;'>I do not suggest that I have exhausted the adjectives which could describe 
          the conduct capable of characterizing a punitive award, but in any case 
          where such an award is made the conduct must be extreme in its nature 
          and such that by any reasonable standard it is deserving of full condemnation 
          and punishment.</span></p>
      </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Should the conduct in this case give rise to punitive damages?  In my 
  opinion, this case bears some similarity to <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. W. Got 
  &amp; Associates Electrical Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1999] 3 S.C.R. 408.  In that case, 
  McLachlin and Bastarache JJ., on behalf of the Court, held that the Bank had 
  breached its contract with the borrower.  The Bank failed to give the borrower 
  reasonable notice of its intention to enforce its security, and reasonable time 
  to pay.  The Bank also moved <i>ex parte </i>for the appointment of a receiver.  
  After the receiver was appointed, it was found that the affidavit of the Banks 
  officer, filed in support of the motion, failed to meet the duty of candour 
  and utmost good faith required of such motions.  The Court held it was within 
  the trial judges discretion to make an award of punitive damages, although 
  disagreement was expressed with some of the factors the trial judge gave in 
  support of the award.  The Banks conduct was found to be an affront to the 
  administration of justice and did not have to rise to the level of fraud, malicious 
  prosecution, or abuse of process before an award of exemplary damages could 
  be made.  In upholding the award, the Court also made reference to the cumulative 
  effect of the conduct.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, the conduct of Headline is at the level of attempted fraud.  Headline 
  took advantage of its position of auctioneer by knocking down the price of 
  goods to Wilsons companies without telling Vernon.  Headlines conduct was, 
  as described by the trial judge, arbitrary and high handed.  It was illegal 
  in the sense that it was contrary to three court orders.  This conduct, for 
  which no explanation was offered, displays not only complete disregard for the 
  nature of Headlines relationship with Vernon, but also for the administration 
  of justice itself.  It was within the trial judges discretion to find that 
  Headlines conduct deserved condemnation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second requirement for an award of punitive damages, that the conduct 
  be independent of the breach of contract, is met by Headlines abuse of its 
  position and breach of fiduciary duty.  In  <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>, [1992] 
  2 S.C.R. 226,<i> </i>La Forest J., who gave the decision on behalf of the majority, 
  held that Ms. Norbergs consent to engage in sex with Dr. Wynrib in return for 
  drugs was not a true consent and violated the doctor-patient relationship.  
  McLachlin J., with whom LHeureux-Dubé J. concurred, held that the doctor-patient 
  relationship shared the hallmarks of a fiduciary relationship as defined by 
  Wilson J. in <i>Frame v. Smith</i>,<i> </i>[1987] 2 S.C.R. 99.  The duties of 
  loyalty, good faith, and avoidance of a conflict of duty and self-interest were 
  all present in the doctor-patient relationship and Dr. Wynrib breached those 
  duties.  Both La Forest and McLachlin JJ. agreed that punitive damages were 
  appropriate because the doctor had abused his position.  In <i>K.M. v. H.M.</i>,<i> 
  </i>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 at para. 106, the Court built on its decision <i>Norberg</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>and held that punitive damages were available for breach 
  of fiduciary duty<i>.</i> </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third requirement that punitive damages serve a rational purpose 
  is also present.  Society has an interest in ensuring that the power of agents 
  and auctioneers not be used in corrupt ways and that court orders not be disregarded.  
  The conduct of Headline is deserving of punishment and public censure.  No other 
  damages have been awarded. </p>
