    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;This appeal arises from the judgment of Spence 
    J. dealing with the distribution of the assets of the appellant 1149056 Ontario

    controlled the Manager.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The respondent

    assets of the Manager consisted of&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;shares 
    and warrants in SiGEM Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge agreed with the respondent and 
  gave judgment in its favour.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal raises  two main issues: a) whether the judgment should 
  be set aside because the trial judge had pre-tried the case; and b) the proper 
  allocation of the SiGEM shares and warrants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the first issue, we find that it is totally devoid 
  of merit.  Having pre-tried the case, the trial judge agreed to try the case 
  only with the explicit  agreement of counsel for the appellants and respondent.    
  Counsel for the appellants clearly waived any objections that the pre-trial 
  judge not sit as the trial judge.  The appellants do not allege any prejudice.  
  In all of the circumstances, it would not be &quot;just&quot; to permit the 
  appellants to hold out rule 50.04 to overturn a judgment unfavourable to them 
  .</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The  evidence which was submitted on the hearing of the appeal 
  does not qualify as fresh evidence and  does not advance the appellants' argument. 
  The motion for leave to admit it is dismissed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the second issue, the trial judge rejected the appellants' 
  argument that the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding had been superseded by an 
  implied agreement to distribute the SiGEM shares according to the shareholdings 
  in the Manager and an explicit oral compensation agreement to give all the warrants 
  to the appellant Peak Hospitality Corp. by way of compensation for its management.  
  Rather, the trial judge found on the evidence that there was an arrangement 
  that the SiGEM shares were to be issued to the creditors and investors in the 
  Manager in proportion to the amounts owed to them.  He found that there was 
  no agreement to commit the warrants to compensate Peak Hospitality Corp. He 
  concluded that the respondent's entitlement to the SiGEM shares and warrants 
  was in the proportion to its shareholder loans at the time of distribution. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge ordered that the shares and proceeds wrongfully 
  received by the appellants be returned to the respondent and the Manager and 
  ordered damages in respect of the exercised warrants. He determined the liability 
  of the various appellants consistent  with the broad powers granted under the 
  <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the findings of the trial judge are well supported 
  by the evidence.  We particularly note the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) At the relevant time, Roter and Gordon who ran the Manager on a day-to-day 
      basis, were aware that the Manager had no assets other than the SiGEM shares 
      and warrants and no prospect of future income;</p>
    <p>2)  There was no resolution of the Board of the Manager or formal   meeting 
      authorizing the distributions;</p>
    <p>3) No documentation placed in evidence supports the appellants' position; 
      and </p>
    <p>4) Most importantly, the findings of the trial judge are essentially based 
      on  his preference to the evidence adduced in support of the respondent’s 
      position.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellants acknowledged that there was a basis 
  for the trial judge’s imposition of liability on Roter, Gordon and Peak Hospitality, 
  but argued that there was no basis for the imposition of liability on Peak Equity.  
  We do not agree.  The trial judge specifically grounded his imposition of liability 
  on sec. 248(3) of the <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i> which, as he 
  noted, expressly contemplates orders being made against persons other than the 
  manager.  He found it “fit”, to use the term found in the introductory words 
  of that subsection, to extend his judgment to Gordon, Roter, Peak Equity and 
  Peak Hospitality.  Having regard to the intimate connection of these four defendants 
  and to their interlocking shareholdings, we find that he made no error in casting 
  the net to include them all.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  We fix the costs of the 
  appeal in the sum of $10,000 plus disbursements plus G.S.T. </p>
