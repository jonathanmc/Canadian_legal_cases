  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The issue in this appeal is the measurement 
  of damages for a government’s breach of a contract to purchase a restrictive 
  covenant from landowners. </span></p>
<p class=MsoMessageHeader style='

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1995, the NDP government of Ontario initiated the $20 million 
  Niagara Tender Fruit Lands Program to assist the economically fragile tender 
  fruit industry and to protect tender fruit lands in the Niagara region. To achieve 
  this goal, land that was uniquely able to produce tender fruit was to be protected 
  by a restrictive covenant under an agreement between landowners and the Agricultural 
  Research Institute of Ontario (the ARIO) on behalf of the province of Ontario. 
  Under the terms of the restrictive covenant, landowners and future owners were 
  prohibited from doing anything that would “significantly impair or interfere 
  with the agricultural capability of the land as tender fruit land”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The restrictive covenant was to be registered on title, binding 
  on subsequent purchasers, and was to run with the land.  The covenant also provided 
  that if the property were expropriated or injuriously affected, and if the ARIO 
  was not directly eligible for compensation, the ARIO was entitled to compensation 
  from the landowners.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The agreement provided landowners with compensation in return 
  for giving up the unrestricted right to use and dispose of their land.  The 
  compensation was explained in an appraisal report and was to be determined by 
  a formula based on agricultural considerations and the possibility of conversion 
  of the land to non-agricultural uses. The author of the appraisal report described 
  the method for valuing the restrictive covenant as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>We are estimating the market value of a restrictive 
      covenant or value in exchange of a partial taking</span></i><span lang=EN-US>. 
      [Emphasis in original]</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>To value a partial taking the real property is first valued 
      as a whole before the taking, then again valued after the taking. <i>The 
      difference in value before and after is the value of the taking or the value 
      of a right or easement, the taken portion</i>. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Based on the appraisal report, the value of 
  the restrictive covenant for regions covered by the Niagara Tender Fruit Lands 
  Program was estimated to be in the range of $3,800 to $10,400 per acre.</span></p>

  </span></span> The landowners in this appeal, Karen Campbell-High and Daniel 
  Dean High (the Highs)  applied, were accepted, and entered into a contract whereby 
  they agreed to accept $239,674 in exchange for giving the ARIO a restrictive 
  covenant over their land. This total was based on a valuation of the Highs’ 
  land as being in the range of $6,800 to $10,400  per acre.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The transaction was scheduled to close on June 
  15, 1995, but was extended on consent to July 13, 1995 and then to July 27, 
  1995.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before the transaction closed, a provincial election was held, 
  resulting in a change in government.  On July 13, 1995, the newly elected Progressive 
  Conservative government cancelled the Niagara Tender Fruit Lands Program.  The 
  ARIO advised the Highs in writing that it would not be closing the transaction.</p>

lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On February 9, 1996, the Highs commenced an action against the 
  ARIO and the Crown, claiming damages for breach of contract as well as special, 
  punitive, and aggravated damages.  They moved for partial summary judgment on 
  the issue of liability.  The motion was unopposed. On April 16, 1998, Lofchik 
  J. granted the Highs a declaration that the Crown had breached and repudiated 
  the contract. Pursuant to a provision in the contract, he directed that damages 
  be determined by an arbitrator.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On November 9, 1999, the arbitrator, the Honourable 
  J. R. Barr, Q.C., released an interim award addressing the Highs’ entitlement 
  to the purchase price under the contract. He concluded that the Highs were entitled 
  to $239,674, the full price under the contract, and directed that they give 
  the promised restrictive covenant to the Crown. </span></p>

  This award addressed the Highs’ entitlement to interest incurred because of 
  the Crown’s breach of contract, legal costs incurred in anticipation of closing, 
  aggravated damages, punitive damages, and costs.  The arbitrator awarded the 
  Highs:</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The arbitrator dismissed the claim for punitive 
  damages on the basis that the Crown and the ARIO’s conduct, while high-handed 
  and cavalier, did not meet the threshold of maliciousness required for such 
  damages.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown sought leave from the Superior Court

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On February 2, 2001, Justice Gravely granted 
  leave, but dismissed the appeal on the merits. He varied the arbitrator’s awards, 
  however, by deleting the requirement that the Highs provide the restrictive 
  covenant. On April 19, 2001, this court granted the Crown and the ARIO leave 
  to appeal Justice Gravely’s order. </span></p>

  </span></span> On appeal, the Crown and the ARIO argued that the correct test 
  for measuring damages in this case is to determine what the Highs lost when 
  the ARIO failed to close the transaction.  Although the Highs lost the proceeds 
  they would have received in exchange for the restrictive covenant, they still 
  have their land unencumbered by the restrictive covenant, and therefore suffered 
  no damages.  The appellants therefore assert that awarding the Highs the full 
  purchase price under the contract amounted to double compensation.</p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Highs, on the other hand, argued that Gravely J. applied 
  the correct legal test in assessing their damages, namely, to place the injured 
  party, so far as reasonably possible, in the monetary position he or she would 
  have been in if the contract had been fulfilled.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The arbitrator found that the Highs were entitled

  he concluded would put them in the position they would have been in if the contract 
  had been fulfilled: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [T]here was a contract, and it was repudiated.  [The Highs] are entitled

      no agreement.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>To accept [the Highs’] argument would mean that 
      a purchaser under a valid contract of sale could decide at any time prior 
      to closing that he did not want to go through with the purchase and repudiate 
      it at his whim.  His response to the Vendor’s claim would be “You still 
      have your land.  You have lost nothing, except your out-of-pocket expenses”.  
      This would mean that all contracts of sale of land would be contingent upon 
      the Purchaser continuing to be willing to buy up to the minute of closing.  
      In my view, this is not the law.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The arbitrator also rejected the argument that 
  if the Highs were entitled to the full purchase price under the contract, the 
  Crown and the ARIO were entitled to a set-off equal to the value of the covenant, 
  since the Highs had the benefit of not having to encumber their land with the 
  restrictive covenant. The arbitrator found that the restrictive covenant had 
  no market value, and therefore there could be no set-off: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The agreed figure of $239,674.00 is precise.  The value of [the Highs’] 
      covenant is far from clear. …  [T]he statement that the appraisal is “estimating 
      the market value” suffers from one very serious difficulty.  There is no 
      market.  [The Highs] are not in the position of being able to put their 
      restrictive covenant on the open market.  It would be of no conceivable 
      interest to any person other than the provincial government.  I am not aware 
      of any instance in which a covenant such as the one in question has ever 
      been valued before. …  I think it is clear that the value of the restrictive 
      covenant on the open market is zero.  No one would buy it. … The one thing 
      we are certain about is that the parties agreed to a payment of $239,674.00.  
      This is a firm figure.  It is the figure that [the Highs] agreed to pay 
      under a contract which they have repudiated without legal justification.  
      Payment of this amount would not be a “windfall” but would be payment of 
      a legally assumed obligation.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown and the ARIO also argued that giving the Highs the 
  full purchase price under the contract would constitute double compensation. 
  The arbitrator agreed that receiving the funds without having to give the restrictive 
  covenant would amount to double compensation.  He therefore ordered that the 
  Highs tender the restrictive covenant originally bargained for:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . .[T]here is force in the argument that for [the Highs] to be relieved 
      of their obligation to furnish the restrictive covenant and to be paid for 
      furnishing it, constitutes double payment.  [The Crown] says the purchase 
      price in such circumstances would be a “windfall” and that [the Highs] cannot 
      have both their property and the purchase price.</p>
    <p align="center">…</p>
    <p>…  [The Crown and the ARIO’s] further point is that to<i> </i>give [the 
      Highs] the entire purchase price without [the Highs] giving the restrictive 
      covenant is not equitable.  It would be double compensation.  They would 
      then be in a better position after the breach than they would have been 
      if the contract had been carried out. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On appeal to the Superior Court of Justice, 
  the Court addressed two issues: whether the arbitrator applied the correct legal 
  test for assessing the damages; and whether it was open to the arbitrator to 
  make an order equivalent to specific performance when the statement of claim 
  and reference order referred only to damages.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the first issue, relying on <i>100 Main Street Ltd. v. W.B. 
  Sullivan Construction Ltd. </i>(1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 401, Gravely J. held that 
  the measurement of a landowner’s loss is the difference between the purchase 
  price and the market value of the property.  The market value is generally determined 
  by resale, and the landowner must mitigate his or her damages by obtaining the 
  best possible resale terms.  However, since resale of the restrictive covenant 
  was not feasible in this case, the covenant had no market value and the Highs 
  were therefore unable to mitigate their damages.  As a result, the Court concluded 
  that they were entitled to the full purchase price under the contract:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…Under those circumstances, there is nothing the [Highs] could do to mitigate 
      the damages they suffered as a result of the loss of their bargain.  They 
      have always been ready, willing and able to close the transaction.  That 
      they may be no worse off now than before the agreement was entered into 
      is irrelevant.  While there would appear to be an element of unfairness 
      in the owners receiving the full purchase price when their farm is now not 
      diminished in value, as it might have been by the registering of the covenant, 
      there is no other way consistent with principle to measure the loss of the 
      value of their bargain.  The [Highs] are not required to sell their farm 
      to try and mitigate their damages or to produce evidence of its before-and-after 
      market value.  Their agreement was to sell a covenant, not the farm.  Furthermore, 
      as the Arbitrator found, the whole point of the transaction for the owners 
      was to pay down their debt and remain tender fruit farmers forever.  From 
      their perspective, therefore, the negative impact of a registration of the 
      restrictive covenant may not have been very significant.  There was no evidence 
      called by the [Crown] about the ultimate effect on the financial welfare 
      of [the Highs] of the presence or absence of the registration.  Conceivably, 
      future zoning or other government regulation could even render the registration 
      of the covenant of little consequence. </p>
    <p><span>            </span>In my view, the Arbitrator was correct in finding 
      that the owners were entitled to be paid damages equivalent to the full 
      purchase price.</p>

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;Liability is not an issue in this appeal. 
    The only issue is damages. In particular, the issue is whether the Highs were 
    entitled to $239,674, the full purchase price of the restrictive covenant, 
    in addition to $59,500 for consequential interest costs. With great respect, 
    they were not entitled to the full purchase price of the covenant in my view 
    for the following reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is a fundamental principle of damages in contract law that 
  the innocent party to a breach of contract is entitled to compensation for the 
  loss of his or her expectation interests.  In S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Damages</i>, 
  2d ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 1991) at para. 5.10, the principle is articulated 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the most significant of all economic interests is the benefit of 
      a favourable contract.  A person who has made a good bargain is treated 
      by the law for many purposes as one who has a present right, the value of 
      which is measured by the value of the promised performance.  The primary 
      manifestation of this approach is reflected in the measure of damages for 
      breach of contract; the contract breaker is bound to make good the loss 
      caused by the breach, a loss measured by the value of the performance promised.  
      The notion of an enforceable contract as a present valuable right affects 
      many other branches of the law where the measure of damages naturally reflects 
      the primary measure for breach of contract.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The principle that an innocent party to a breach of contract 
  is entitled to compensation for lost expectation interests means that the party 
  should, insofar as is reasonably possible, be placed in the monetary position 
  he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed.  As the Privy 
  Council held in <i>Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.</i>, [1911] A.C. 301 (P.C.) 
  at 307: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[I]t is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach 
      of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, 
      be placed in the same position as he would have been in if the contract 
      had been performed ... That is a ruling principle.  It is a just principle.  
    </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The measurement of damages in contracts for the purchase and 
  sale of interests in land flows from these general principles.  In <i>100 Main 
  Street</i> <i>Ltd.,</i> which dealt with a contract for the purchase and sale 
  of land,<i> </i>Morden J.A. began his analysis by observing at pp. 414-415 that 
  “[t]he most general principle relating to the assessment of the damages is that 
  the plaintiff is entitled to be put in the position it would have been in if 
  the contract had been performed, so far as money can do it”.  He held that in 
  a contract for the purchase and sale of land, the vendor is entitled to the 
  contract price less the market value of the land. He also concluded, at pp. 
  422-423, that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>... The basic principle is that the onus is on the plaintiff to prove its 
      damages on a reasonable preponderance of credible evidence. Its damages 
      are that sum of money which would put it in the same position as if the 
      defendant had performed. The well-established method for determining this 
      is to give the difference between the contract price and the market value. 
      <i>It is basic that the plaintiff cannot have the contract price and the 
      land.  </i>Thus, I do not think that the plaintiff has proven its case by 
      merely proving the contract price and then the defendant’s breach, in the 
      expectation that he will recover the full price unless the defendant proves 
      that “the property could be sold to someone else without loss to the plaintiff”. 
      [Emphasis added]</p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The question remains, however, whether these classic principles 
  for assessing damages should be varied when the government is one of the contracting 
  parties. In my view, they should not. In <i>Wells v. Newfoundland</i>, [1999] 
  3 S.C.R. 199, the Supreme Court of Canada held that a member of the Public Utilities 
  Board was entitled to damages after the government of Newfoundland abolished 
  his position under the <i>Public</i> <i>Utilities</i> <i>Act</i>.  In the course 
  of his reasons, Justice Major made the following relevant observations at pp. 
  216, 218-219, 221:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>. . . [T]here is no question that the Government of Newfoundland 
      had the authority to restructure or eliminate the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
      is a crucial distinction, however, between the Crown legislatively avoiding 
      a contract, and altogether escaping the legal consequences of doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;While 
      the legislature may have the extraordinary power of passing a law to specifically 
      deny compensation to an aggrieved individual with whom it has broken an 
      agreement, clear and explicit statutory language would be required to extinguish 
      existing rights previously conferred on that party.</span></p>

      P. W. Hogg, in <i>Liability of the Crown</i> (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 171-72, 
      where he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>I acknowledge the possibility that, on rare occasions, 
        the Crown may feel compelled by considerations of public policy to break 
        a contractual undertaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no doctrines of executive 
        necessity, the ordinary law of contract would apply, and would require 
        the Crown to negotiate with the other party for a variation or release, 
        or to pay damages for its breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is surely 
        the right result.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides compensation for the injured

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>But although the general principles for assessing 
  damages in breach of contract cases should be applied where the government is 
  one of the contracting parties, that does not mean that courts should ignore 
  how uniquely disconcerting a contract breach is when it is the state that breaks 
  a bargain with one of its citizens. The government occupies a unique – and uniquely 
  powerful – role in its relationship with the public. This power imbalance, in 
  turn, creates a duty on the government to act in a way that enhances public 
  confidence in reliable fairness from the government.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Governments owe, and their citizens expect to receive, the benefit 
  of a duty of good faith. When governments breach their agreements with a member 
  of the public,  they do more than violate contractual obligations; they also 
  impair that person’s legitimate expectations that the state will respect and 
  comply with its legal obligations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> But in my view any opprobrium attaching to governmental breaches 
  of contractual obligations should not find expression by dislodging the underpinnings 
  of the principles relating to damages.  If there was no loss, none should be 
  attributed merely because the offending party is the government. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There are in any event existing responsive remedies 
  to which governments are vulnerable for breaches of contract for the purchase 
  and sale of interests in land that provide, in my view, the requisite disincentives. 
  They include aggravated damages, such as were awarded in this case; and punitive 
  damages, which were not. The evidence in each case will determine whether such 
  damages are justified, but the fact remains that they are available, where appropriate, 
  to sanction governmental breaches and reflect public censure.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Applying the foregoing analysis to the facts 
  in this case, I see the object of the exercise as to put the Highs, insofar 
  as is reasonably possible, in the position they would have been in had the contract 
  been performed. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I accept Justice Gravely’s observations that mitigation is not 
  a realistic option for the Highs. Clearly, no one but the government would have 
  an interest in purchasing the restrictive covenant under consideration in this 
  case.  But that, for me, does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that the 
  appropriate measure of damages is the full purchase price of the covenant. The 
  compensable expectation interest lost by the Highs cannot be assessed by looking 
  only at the value of the restrictive covenant. It must be considered along with 
  the other half of the bargain, namely, that the Highs would only get the money 
  if they gave a covenant permanently restricting the use of their land.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>If the contract had been fulfilled, the Highs 
  would have received $239,674 for giving the Crown a restrictive covenant in 
  perpetuity, preventing the land from being sold for any use other than one consistent 
  with tender fruit farming. Since the government no longer seeks such a restrictive 
  covenant, the Highs are free to dispose of their land to any interested purchaser 
  and for any legal use. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The amount to be paid for the restrictive covenant 
  was based on a formula designed to compensate landowners for the loss inherent 
  in not being able to sell or use the land for other general commercial purposes. 
  The Highs’ recovered freedom from the restricted use of their land is therefore 
  of a value comparable to the price of the restrictive covenant. While the Highs 
  lost the money they would have received in exchange for restricting their land 
  use to tender fruit farming, they gained back the unrestricted right to sell 
  their property for <i>any</i> authorized use, a financial ability approximating 
  the value of relinquishing it. They have, in short, regained exactly what they 
  would have given up had the bargain been fulfilled. In this sense, therefore, 
  there is no loss.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To permit the Highs to keep both the unencumbered 
  land and the value of the restrictive covenant amounts, in my view, to double 
  recovery. The rationale against this form of compensation was explained in V. 
  Di Castri, <i>The Law of Vendor and Purchaser</i>, vol. 2, looseleaf (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 1989) at 17-133: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While the rule against double satisfaction is one of some intricacy, its 
      rationale is that the claimant should not be permitted to receive in compensation 
      a total amount greater than the loss he has suffered.  </p>

  the contract. Had the contract been fulfilled, it is true that they would have

  in their ability to sell their land. The breach has, therefore, anomalously 
  restored their ability to sell their land freely and reversed their expectation 
  that their land use and disposal were perpetually restricted. If the Highs in 
  this case were to receive the full purchase price for encumbering their land,

  that the landowners had sustained a loss in interest charges that would not 
  have been incurred if the transaction had been completed.  In view of the evidence 
  that the interest costs would not have been sustained if the breach had not 
  occurred, this was a proper award.  The Crown acknowledges that if the consequential
