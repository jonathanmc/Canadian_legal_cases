<p class=headingNUMBER style='

  dated January 15, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 81.</p>
<p><b>LASKIN J.A.:</b></p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.            INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant Mansour Ahani is an Iranian citizen and a Convention refugee.  
  The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has concluded that he is also a 
  terrorist and a danger to the security of Canada.  She has ordered him deported 
  to Iran.  He challenged this deportation order, alleging that he will face torture 
  in Iran.  But with the dismissal of his appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  on January 11th of this year, he has exhausted all of his rights of review in 
  Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani has now filed a “communication” with the United Nations Human 
  Rights Committee (the “Committee”) for relief under the Optional Protocol<i> 
  </i>to the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>, which 
  Canada has ratified but not incorporated into its domestic law.  The Committee 
  has made an “interim measures” request, asking that Canada stay the deportation 
  order until it has considered Ahani’s communication.  The interim measures request 
  is not binding and Canada will not accede to it.  Instead, it intends to deport 
  Ahani immediately.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Therefore, after the Supreme Court’s decision, Ahani applied to the 
  Superior Court for an injunction restraining his deportation pending the Committee’s 
  consideration of his communication.  On January 15th, Dambrot J. dismissed the 
  application.  Ahani now appeals to this court.  On January 17th, Feldman J.A. 
  stayed his deportation order pending the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani makes two submissions in support of his appeal for injunctive 
  relief.  First, he submits that the principles of fundamental justice under 
  s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> guarantee him the 
  right not to be returned to Iran until the Committee has considered his communication.  
  Second, he submits that he has a legitimate expectation of not being deported 
  pending the Committee’s consideration.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents Her Majesty the Queen, the Attorney General of Canada 
  and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration have cross-appealed, asking 
  for a stay of proceedings on the ground that Dambrot J. should not have assumed 
  jurisdiction but instead should have deferred to the Federal Court.  For the 
  reasons that follow, I would dismiss both Ahani’s appeal and the respondents’ 
  cross-appeal.  I would, however, grant Ahani’s alternative request for a stay 
  pending his intended application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of 
  Canada.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>            1.            <u>The Deportation Proceedings</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani is now 37 years old.  He came to Canada from Iran in October 1991 
  and was declared a Convention refugee in April 1992.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Soon after Ahani’s arrival in Canada, CSIS (the Canadian Security Intelligence 
  Service) suspected that he was a terrorist and a trained assassin.  CSIS believed 
  that Ahani was a member of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence Security (“MOIS”), 
  which sponsors a wide range of terrorist activities, including the assassination 
  of political dissidents around the world, and that he had received specialized 
  military training from MOIS.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because the government believed Ahani was a terrorist, it took steps 
  to deport him.  In doing so, it followed the four-step deportation procedure 
  held to be constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Suresh 
  v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2002 S.C.C. 1, released 
  concurrently with its decision in <i>Ahani</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In June 1993, after receiving a report from CSIS, the Solicitor General 
  and Minister of Citizenship and Immigration filed a security certificate under 
  s. 40.1 of the <i>Immigration Act</i>.  This was the first step in the proceedings 
  to deport Ahani.  The certificate claimed that Ahani should be removed from 
  Canada because he is a member of a terrorist organization and has engaged in 
  or will engage in terrorism.  On the issuance of the certificate, Ahani was 
  arrested and detained in custody, where he has remained to this day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Once the security certificate was filed, the second step required the 
  Federal Court to determine whether the certificate was reasonable.  The designated 
  judge, Denault J., heard evidence from CSIS that Ahani was a threat to the author 
  Salmon Rushdie when he had visited Toronto, and to other dissidents in Canada.    
  CSIS also led evidence to show that, while in Europe in 1992, Ahani had participated 
  in a plot to assassinate an Iranian dissident.  Denault J. concluded that “most 
  if not all the facts sustaining the Service’s allegations against the Respondent 
  were established”.  He rejected Ahani’s evidence as not being credible.  Denault 
  J. thus concluded that the certificate was reasonable.  His decision could not 
  be appealed or judicially reviewed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Federal government then took the third step in the deportation proceedings.  
  It held a deportation hearing.  An immigration adjudicator found Ahani to be 
  inadmissible to Canada because reasonable grounds existed to believe that he 
  was a member of a terrorist organization and that he had engaged in or would 
  engage in terrorism.  On April 28, 1998, he was ordered deported.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Minister then took the fourth and final step in the deportation 
  proceedings against Ahani.  She told him that she intended to issue an opinion 
  under s.&nbsp;53(1)(b) of the Act that he “constitutes a danger to the security 
  of Canada”.  He was notified of the case against him and given an opportunity 
  to make written submissions.  Ahani did make submissions denying that he was 
  an assassin and claiming that he would be at risk of torture in Iran for having 
  made a refugee claim and for having disclosed information to Canadian authorities 
  about his work with MOIS.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Minister, however, rejected his submissions.  On August 12, 1998, 
  she issued a danger opinion under s. 53(1)(b).  She held that his deportation 
  to Iran would only expose him to a “minimal risk” of harm and that the danger 
  to the security of Canada outweighed this minimal risk.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani challenged the Minister’s decision and asked for a new deportation 
  hearing.  McGillis J. of the Federal Court found ample evidence to support the 
  Minister’s opinion that Ahani constituted a danger to the security of Canada.  
  She dismissed his application for judicial review, which had included a challenge 
  to the constitutionality of the deportation proceedings.  Ahani’s appeals to 
  the Federal Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court of Canada were also 
  dismissed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In dismissing Ahani’s appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada made four 
  important findings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> (i) On any standard of review, the Minister’s opinion that Ahani was a 
      danger to the security of Canada was amply supported by the evidence;</p>
    <p> (ii) The Minister’s decision that Ahani would be exposed to a minimal 
      risk of harm in Iran was “unassailable”;</p>
    <p> (iii) Ahani “has not cleared the evidentiary threshold required to access 
      the s. 7 protection guaranteed by the [<i>Charter</i>]”; and</p>
    <p> (iv) Ahani was accorded procedural fairness consistent with the principles 
      of fundamental justice in s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3.            <u>Ahani’s Communication to the United Nations Human Rights 
    Committee</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having exhausted his remedies in Canada, Ahani has now sought relief 
  in an international forum.  He has petitioned the Committee under the Optional 
  Protocol<i> </i>to the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>.  
  Although Canada is a party to the Covenant and to the Protocol, it has not incorporated 
  either into its domestic law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nonetheless, under Article 1 of the Protocol, each state party to the 
  Covenant that has also signed the Protocol has agreed, by doing so, to recognize 
  the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from 
  individuals claiming that the state party has violated their rights under the 
  Covenant.  Article 2 of the Protocol expressly permits individuals who claim 
  their rights under the Covenant have been violated and who have exhausted all 
  available domestic remedies to submit a written communication to the Committee 
  for consideration.  Ahani has submitted a written communication.  He maintains 
  that his deportation to Iran will violate his right to life, will subject him 
  to torture or to cruel inhuman treatment or punishment and to arbitrary detention, 
  and will deny him a fair trial, all contrary to the Covenant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Committee’s rules of procedure contain an interim measures provision 
  – Rule 86 – permitting the Committee to express to a party state its view that 
  interim measures may be desirable pending the Committee’s consideration of an 
  individual’s communication.  An interim measures request does not imply a determination 
  of the merits of a communication, but is made to avoid irreparable damage to 
  the victim of an alleged violation of the Covenant.  Here, the Committee has 
  invoked Rule 86 and has requested that Canada not deport Ahani until it has 
  had an opportunity to consider his allegations, “in particular those that relate 
  to torture, other inhuman treatment or even death as a consequence of the deportation”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada has refused the Committee’s request.  Ahani therefore applied 
  for an injunction to prevent his deportation until the Committee has considered 
  his communication.  In dismissing Ahani’s application, Dambrot J. held that 
  “if there is a right protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> not to have the 
  outcome of any pending appellate or other legal process preempted by executive 
  action, it does not extend to an analogous legal process such as a petition 
  to an international body whose advice is not binding domestically”.  He also 
  held that the Optional Protocol did not create any “legitimate expectation not 
  to be deported pending consideration of a communication by the Committee”.  
  He concluded that Ahani has no right to remain in Canada pending consideration 
  of his petitition.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>C.            DISCUSSION</h4>
<p><b>            </b>1.  <u>Did Dambrot J. err in assuming jurisdiction?</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before dealing with Ahani’s submissions, I shall deal briefly with the 
  cross-appeal.  The respondents acknowledge that a provincial superior court 
  and the Federal Court have concurrent jurisdiction on constitutional issues 
  concerning the application and enforcement of the provisions of the <i>Immigration 
  Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nonetheless, the respondents submit that the provincial superior court 
  should decline jurisdiction in immigration matters in recognition of the Federal 
  Court’s expertise in this area of the law.  Dambrot J. assumed jurisdiction, 
  concluding that Ahani’s application raised no immigration issues, but constitutional 
  issues over which the Federal Court had no greater expertise than provincial 
  superior courts.  I agree with his conclusion.  Therefore, I would dismiss the 
  respondents’ cross-appeal.</p>
<p>            2.  <u>Did Dambrot J. err in dismissing Ahani’s application for 
  an injunction?</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I should say at the outset that I agree with the result reached by Dambrot 
  J. and generally with his reasons.  In these reasons, I will focus on the additional 
  points on which I rely to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(a)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><u>Does s. 7 of the 
      <i>Charter</i> guarantee Ahani the right to remain in Canada until the Committee 
      has considered his communication?<o:p></o:p></u></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style=' &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0pt;text-indent:0pt;line-height:normal'> 
  [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani’s argument for an injunction rests mainly on s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, 
  which states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>7.</b>  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 
      person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with 
      the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>Ahani’s submissions focus on the principles 
  of fundamental justice.  But these principles are not engaged unless Ahani first 
  demonstrates a deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person.  According 
  to the respondents, the Supreme Court’s decision shows that Ahani’s s. 7 rights 
  are not threatened.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Certainly Ahani’s mere removal from Canada does not establish a deprivation.  
  Convention refugees and other non-citizens of Canada do not have an unqualified 
  constitutional right to remain in this country.  See <i>Chiarelli v. Canada 
  (Minister of Employment and Immigration),</i> [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711.  To trigger 
  the principles of fundamental justice, Ahani must show a potential risk of serious 
  harm if he is deported to Iran.  But the Supreme Court of Canada has found the 
  Minister’s opinion that he faces only a minimal risk of harm “unassailable”.  
  The Supreme Court, therefore, concluded that Ahani had “not cleared the evidentiary 
  threshold required to access … s. 7 protection”.  I interpret this conclusion 
  to mean that Ahani had not shown a potential risk of deprivation to his life, 
  liberty or security of the person.   Thus, the respondents contend that Ahani’s 
  communication to the Committee is premised on a collateral attack on the Supreme 
  Court’s decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani’s answer is that the Supreme Court dealt only with his return 
  to torture, that his communication to the Committee is more broadly based, and 
  that his status as a Convention refugee – which Canada has never sought to revoke 
  – shows a potential deprivation of his right to security of the person sufficient 
  to permit him to rely on the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani’s communication  to the Committee rests on a fear of inhuman treatment, 
  or even death, as well as on a fear of torture.  Still, one might reasonably 
  read the Supreme Court’s finding that he will be exposed to a minimal risk of 
  “harm” to include all these forms of punishment.  Moreover, the Committee’s 
  decisions show that it will not evaluate the facts and evidence in a particular 
  case.  That evaluation, according to the Committee, should be left to the domestic 
  courts.  See Communication No. 215/1986 and Communication No. 485/1991.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> But even accepting a broad reading of the Supreme Court’s finding, Ahani 
  is still a Convention refugee.  This court must therefore recognize that he 
  still has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Iran.  That is enough 
  to trigger his s. 7 rights.  See <i>Singh v. Canada (Minister of Employment 
  and Immigration)</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177.  Thus, I will accept Ahani’s position 
  and assume that he has demonstrated that his return to Iran will threaten to 
  deprive him of his right to security of the person under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  
  In my view, however, even if Ahani’s s. 7 rights are at stake, no principle 
  of fundamental justice entitles him to remain in Canada until his communication 
  is considered by the Committee.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani contends that the principles of fundamental justice include the 
  right to remain in Canada until his international law remedies have been exhausted.  
  Thus, he argues that Canada will violate the principles of fundamental justice 
  if it does not accede to the interim measures request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In support of his position, Ahani makes one main submission.  He submits 
  that once Canada grants an individual right, as it did by signing the Covenant 
  and the Protocol, it must ensure a fair process and an effective remedy.  Deporting 
  Ahani to Iran while the Committee is considering his communication denies him 
  procedural fairness and an effective remedy.  A domestic injunction, according 
  to Ahani, is required to preserve an effective remedy in international law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani acknowledges that he cannot point to any caselaw supporting his 
  position.  But he asks us to rely on the now well-established principles that 
  <i>Charter</i> protections are to be read generously, that the content of procedural 
  fairness is greater the more vital the interest at stake, and that Canada’s 
  international human rights commitments are an indicator, even an important indicator, 
  of the scope of the principles of fundamental justice.  I am not troubled by 
  the absence of any supporting caselaw for there is never any precedent until 
  something is done for the first time.  And I can readily accept the broad interpretative 
  principles on which Ahani relies.  In my view, however,  they do not assist 
  him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The content of the principles of fundamental justice can only be determined 
  by balancing individual and state interests.  Here, Ahani’s interest is reflected 
  in the opportunity to seek the Committee’s views on whether Canada’s treatment 
  of him breached the covenant.  Canada’s interest is reflected in two undisputed 
  facts – two facts that show what Ahani seeks is not a principle of fundamental 
  justice.  The first fact is that Canada has never incorporated either the Covenant 
  or the Protocol into Canadian law by implementing legislation.  Absent implementing 
  legislation, neither has any legal effect in Canada.  Of course, Canada’s international 
  human rights commitments may still inform the content of the principles of fundamental 
  justice under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  But Ahani is not merely asking this 
  court to interpret s. 7 in a way that is consistent with international human 
  rights norms.  Instead, he seeks to use s. 7 to enforce Canada’s international 
  commitments in a domestic court.  This he cannot do.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A further answer to Ahani’s submission is found in the nature of Canada’s 
  international commitment under the Covenant and the Protocol.  The nature of 
  that commitment is the second undisputed fact.  In signing the Protocol, Canada 
  did not agree to be bound by the final views of the Committee, nor did it even 
  agree that it would stay its own domestic proceedings until the Committee gave 
  its views.  In other words, neither the Committee’s views nor its interim measures 
  requests are binding on Canada as a matter of international law, much less as 
  a matter of domestic law.  The party states that ratified the Covenant and the 
  Optional Protocol turned their minds to the question of whether they should 
  agree to be bound by the Committee’s views, or whether they should at least 
  agree to refrain from taking any action against an individual who had sought 
  the Committee’s views until they were known.  They decided as a matter of policy 
  that they should not, leaving each party state, on a case by case basis, free 
  to accept or reject the Committee’s final views, and equally free to accede 
  to or not accede to an interim measures request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To give effect to Ahani’s position, however, would convert a non-binding 
  request in a Protocol, which has never been part of Canadian law, into a binding 
  obligation enforceable in Canada by a Canadian court, and more, into a constitutional 
  principle of fundamental justice.  Respectfully, I find that an untenable result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principle that international treaties and conventions not incorporated 
  into Canadian law have no domestic legal consequences has been affirmed by a 
  long line of authority in the Supreme Court of Canada.  For example, in <i>Capital 
  Cities Communications Inc., Taft Broadcasting Co. and WBEN, Inc. v. Canadian 
  Radio Television Commission</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 141, the court considered the 
  effect of the Inter-American Radiocommunications Convention of 1937, which Canada 
  had ratified but not incorporated into its domestic law.  Writing for a majority 
  of the court, Laskin C.J.C. held, at p. 173, “[t]here would be no domestic, 
  internal consequences unless they arose from implementing legislation giving 
  the Convention a legal effect within Canada”.  And more recently in <i>Baker 
  v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 
  at 861, the full court agreed with L’Heureux-Dubé J. that “[i]nternational treaties 
  and conventions are not part of Canadian law unless they have been implemented 
  by statute”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, that both the Committee’s final views and its interim measures 
  requests are not binding or enforceable in international law is evident from 
  the wording of the Protocol and the Committee’s Rule 86, from the Committee’s 
  own pronouncements, from the opinions of recognized international law scholars 
  and from caselaw.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Both the Protocol and Rule 86 use permissive language and neither has 
  an enforcement mechanism.  Under Article 5.4 of the Protocol, the Committee 
  does not decide on an individual’s communication.  Instead, “[t]he Committee 
  shall forward its <u>views</u> to the State Party concerned and to the individual” 
  [Emphasis added].   Rule 86 similarly provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Committee may, prior to forwarding its view on the communication to 
      the State party concerned, inform that State of its views as to whether 
      interim measures may be desirable to avoid irreparable damage to the victim 
      of the alleged violation.  In doing so, the Committee shall inform the State 
      party concerned that such expression of its views on interim measures does 
      not imply a determination on the merit of the communication.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The international community has agreed to binding obligations in other 
  treaties.  But in the Covenant and the Protocol, it made a policy decision to 
  do otherwise.  David Kretzmer, a member of the Human Rights Commission, put 
  it this way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The treaty system reflects the weakness of the international system.  The 
      fact that the Optional Protocol does not state that the Human Rights Committee’s 
      views under the Protocol are legally binding, and that there are no enforcement 
      mechanisms, was a clear policy decision by the international community.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>See Kretzmer, “Commentary on Complaint 
  Processes by Human Rights Committee and Torture Committee Members: The Human 
  Rights Committee”, <i>The UN Human Rights Treaty System in the 21st Century</i>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Committee itself has said that its “decisions” are not binding:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is useful to note that the Committee is neither a court nor a body with 
      a quasi-judicial mandate, like the organs created under another international 
      Human Rights instrument, the European Convention on Human Rights (i.e., 
      The European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human 
      Rights).  Still, the Committee applies the provisions of the Covenant and 
      of the Optional Protocol in a judicial spirit and, performs functions similar 
      to those of the European Commission of Human Rights, in as much as the consideration 
      of applications from individuals is concerned.  Its decisions on the merits 
      (of a communication) are, in principle, comparable to the reports of the 
      European Commission, non-binding recommendations.  The two systems differ, 
      however, in that the Optional Protocol does not provide explicitly for friendly 
      settlement between the parties, and, more importantly, in that the Committee 
      has no power to hand down binding decisions as does the European Court of 
      Human Rights.  States parties to the Optional Protocol endeavour to observe 
      the Committee’s views, but in case of non-compliance the Optional Protocol 
      does not provide for an enforcement mechanism or for sanctions.</p>

  text on the United Nations Convention against Torture states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The implementation organ created under the <i>International Covenant on 
      Civil and Political Rights</i> is the Human Rights Committee, composed of 
      eighteen persons chosen by the States Parties.  This Committee, established 
      in 1976, should not be confused with the UN Commission on Human Rights, 
      established in 1946 by the ECOSOC and composed of States.  The Human Rights 
      Committee, too, is competent to consider complaints of States and of individuals, 
      but cannot issue binding decisions.</p>

  </span> Ahani thus has no basis in domestic law and no basis in international 
  law to ask a Canadian court to prevent his deportation.  His right to remain 
  in Canada ended with the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision.  And, as the Supreme 
  Court of Canada found, throughout the entire deportation proceedings he was 
  accorded full procedural fairness consistent with the dictates of fundamental 
  justice in s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He is not entitled to any more than 
  that.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By signing the Protocol, Canada did provide an individual like Ahani 
  an opportunity to seek the Committee’s views.  But it qualified that right in 
  two important ways. In any given case, Canada first reserved the right to reject 
  the Committee’s views, and second reserved the right to enforce its own laws 
  before the Committee gave its views.  In deporting Ahani, Canada is acting consistently 
  with the terms under which it signed the Protocol.  It is not denying Ahani 
  procedural fairness or depriving him of any remedy to which he is entitled.  
  Even under the Protocol, Ahani has no right to remain in Canada until the Committee 
  gives its views.  He can therefore hardly claim that the principles of fundamental 
  justice give him that right.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani tries to buttress his position with three other arguments.  First, 
  he acknowledges that the views of the Committee under Article 5.4 of the Protocol 
  are not binding but argues that the process should be allowed to run its course.  
  The Committee’s views have moral suasion and Canada should have the benefit 
  of them.  I accept that the Committee’s views have persuasive value, though 
  they are not binding.  The evidence before this court suggests that Canada has 
  always abided by the Committee’s views.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> But Ahani’s position is inconsistent.  In acknowledging that the Committee’s 
  final views are not binding, he fails to take into account that the party states 
  did not agree to await the Committee’s views before enforcing their own laws.  
  In asking that the process run its course he glosses over the non-binding nature 
  of an interim measures request.  And in submitting that the process should run 
  its course and a Canadian court should give effect to that submission by granting 
  an injunction, Ahani seeks to turn a request by an international body – and 
  it is only a request – into a constitutional obligation enforceable domestically 
  in the provincial superior court.  He cannot have it both ways.  If Canada is 
  free not to accept the Committee’s views, it is also free not to accede to an 
  interim measures request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Next, Ahani argues that by agreeing to a procedure it can choose to 
  follow at its whim, Canada is not acting in good faith and, indeed, is acting 
  contrary to its many pronouncements on the importance of international human 
  rights.  Ahani relies on Article 26 of the Vienna Convention, which provides 
  that “every treaty in force is binding upon parties to it and must be performed 
  by them in good faith”.  He contends that if Canada does not wish to comply 
  with the Protocol, then it should denounce it, as it has the right to do under 
  Article 12, instead of arbitrarily frustrating the process that it ratified.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On its face the argument that Canada will not be acting in good faith 
  by deporting Ahani now is difficult to support.  In deporting him, Canada will 
  be enforcing its own laws and the decision of its highest court.  It will be 
  doing nothing more than it is entitled to do under the terms of the Protocol.  
  Moreover, Canada’s domestic statutory regime for deporting Convention refugees 
  itself embodies a willingness to comply with international human rights standards.  
  The Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Suresh, supra, </i>adds to the statutory 
  protections by incorporating <i>Charter</i> protections, in part drawn from 
  international human rights instruments.  Ahani has had the full benefit of both 
  these statutory and <i>Charter</i> protections.  Thus, the Government of Canada 
  would have every reason to hold a good faith belief that deporting Ahani now 
  would not breach its obligations under the Covenant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If, however, Canada has not acted in good faith, then it may justifiably 
  be open to public criticism.  If it falls short of the laudable goal of a full 
  commitment to human rights conventions and treaties, other states may take it 
  to task.  But the principles of fundamental justice lie in the basic tenets 
  of our legal system.  They are found in the domain of the judiciary, the guardian 
  of the justice system.  What Ahani complains about is a matter for the court 
  of public or international opinion, not for a court of law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At bottom, this case demonstrates the difference between the proper 
  role of the executive and the proper role of the judiciary.  Judges are not 
  competent to assess whether Canada is acting in bad faith by rejecting the Committee’s 
  interim measures request and instead deporting Ahani immediately.  Canada has 
  many international obligations to balance, not the least of which, in the wake 
  of what occurred last September 11th, is to ensure that it does not become a 
  safe haven for terrorists.  See Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, 
  GA Res. 49/60, 9 December 1994; and Security Council Resolution 7158, 28 September 
  2001.  If the court grants relief that in effect turns a non-binding provision 
  in an international treaty into a constitutional obligation enforceable in a 
  Canadian court, Canada may be wary of signing a similar human rights instrument 
  in the future.  That would hardly be desirable.  Yes, Canada could denounce 
  the Protocol, but who is to say that that result would be preferable to remaining 
  a party to the Protocol and deciding case by case whether to hold off enforcing 
  its own laws until the Committee has given its views?  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These are all considerations that lie within the executive’s expertise 
  in foreign relations.  Courts have no expertise in these matters, and in my 
  respectful opinion, have no business intruding into them.  Canada agreed to 
  sign an international covenant and protocol that was not binding.  It chose 
  not to make these instruments part of its domestic law.  It is not for the courts, 
  under the guise of procedural fairness, to read in an enforceable constitutional 
  obligation and commit Canada to a process that admittedly could take years, 
  thus frustrating this country’s wish to enforce its own laws by deporting a 
  terrorist to a country where he will face at best a minimal risk of harm.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, Ahani argues that we should follow the recent line of authority 
  from the Privy Council in death penalty cases out of the Caribbean.  Of this 
  line of authority, the most important judgment for Ahani is the majority speech 
  of Lord Millett in <i>Thomas v. Baptiste</i> (1999), 3 W.L.R. 249.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In that case, two men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death 
  in Trinidad and Tobago.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago had ratified 
  the <i>International Covenant and Civil and Political Rights</i> and acceded 
  to the Optional Protocol.  The government had also ratified the <i>American 
  Convention on Human Rights</i>, which had established two bodies, the Inter-American 
  Commission on Human Rights (the “Commission”) and its judicial organ the Inter-American 
  Court of Human Rights (“IACHR”).  The Commission can receive petitions from 
  individuals complaining of violations of the Convention and make reports and 
  recommendations to a ratifying state.  The IACHR can make binding rulings on 
  the interpretation or application of the Convention.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the Government of Trinidad and Tobago delayed in carrying out the 
  death sentences of the two appellants, they petitioned the Commission alleging 
  that their human rights had been violated.  The IACHR made orders requiring 
  the government to refrain from carrying out the death sentences pending the 
  determination of the appellants’ petitions.  In defiance of these orders, the 
  Government of Trinidad and Tobago proposed to execute the appellants.  They 
  therefore sought relief in the courts.  Their case went to the Judicial Committee 
  of the Privy Council, where a majority stayed the executions pending the Commission’s 
  decision on the petitions and the government’s consideration of any ruling of 
  the IACHR or report from the Commission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Two key differences between <i>Thomas</i> and this case are immediately 
  apparent.  In <i>Thomas</i>, the two appellants had been sentenced to death; 
  here, Ahani is to be returned to a country where he faces only a minimal risk 
  of harm.  Had Ahani faced the death penalty in Iran, different constitutional 
  considerations may well have come into play in the Canadian court proceedings.  
  See <i>United States of America v. Burns</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283.  Moreover, 
  in <i>Thomas</i>, the two appellants petitioned the Inter-American Commission 
  not the Committee, and unlike Ahani, had the benefit of orders of the IACHR.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nonetheless, Ahani takes comfort in some of the reasoning of Lord Millett.  
  In <i>Thomas</i>, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago argued – as the Attorney 
  General of Canada has argued here – that because the Convention was not incorporated 
  into domestic law and because the Commission could make recommendations only, 
  Trinidad and Tobago had no legal obligation to wait for the Commission to consider 
  the appellants’ petition.  Lord Millett rejected this argument.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> He recognized, at p. 260, “the constitutional importance of the principle 
  that international conventions do not alter domestic law except to the extent 
  that they are incorporated into domestic law by legislation”.  But he held, 
  <i>ibid.</i>, that the due process clause in the Constitution of Trinidad and 
  Tobago “includes the right of a condemned man to be allowed to complete any 
  appellate or analogous legal process that is capable of resulting in a reduction 
  or commutation of his sentence before the process is rendered nugatory by executive 
  action”.  And he concluded at pp. 260-61 with this enigmatic paragraph, which 
  is fundamental to his decision, and on which Ahani relies:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In their Lordships’ view, however, the applicants’ claim does not infringe 
      the principle which the government invoke.  The right for which they contend 
      is not the particular right to petition the commission or even to complete 
      the particular process which they initiated when they lodged their petitions.  
      It is the general right accorded to all litigants not to have the outcome 
      of any pending appellate or other legal process pre-empted by executive 
      action.  This general right is not created by the Convention; it is accorded 
      by the common law and affirmed by section 4(<i>a</i>) of the Constitution.  
      The applicants are not seeking to enforce the terms of an unincorporated 
      treaty, but a provision of the domestic law of Trinidad and Tobago contained 
      in the Constitution.  <i>By ratifying a treaty which provides for individual 
      access to an international body, the government made that process for the 
      time being part of the domestic criminal justice system and thereby temporarily 
      at least extended the scope of the due process clause in the Constitution</i>.  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I confess to having difficulty understanding the reasoning in this paragraph, 
  and especially in the last sentence.  On the face of it, Lord Millett’s reasoning 
  conflicts directly with well-established Canadian law.  To repeat, Lord Millett 
  says that “[b]y ratifying a treaty which provides for individual access to an 
  international body, the government made that process for the time being part 
  of the domestic criminal justice system and thereby temporarily at least extended 
  the scope of the due process clause in the Constitution”.  That is not our law.  
  In Canada, mere ratification of a treaty, without incorporating legislation, 
  cannot make the international process part of our domestic criminal justice 
  system.  For that reason alone, I do not consider that <i>Thomas</i> assists 
  Ahani’s position.  Moreover, I prefer the dissenting reasons of Lord Goff, which 
  are more in line with our own law.  Lord Goff said, at p. 270:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This conclusion will disappoint those who contend for the application of 
      unincorporated international human rights conventions in municipal legal 
      proceedings so that such rights will be <i>directly</i> enforced in national 
      courts as if they were rights existing in municipal law.  The widest possible 
      adoption of humane standards is undoubtedly to be aspired to.  But it is 
      not properly to be achieved by subverting the Constitutions of states nor 
      by a clear misuse of legal concepts and terminology; indeed, the furthering 
      of human rights depends upon confirming and upholding the rule of law.  
      Suppose that an international treaty declares certain conduct to be criminal 
      wherever committed (and such examples exist), unless and until the legislature 
      of a state party to the treaty has passed a law making such conduct criminal 
      under its municipal law, it would be contrary to due process (and in the 
      Republic, contrary to section 4 of the Constitution) for the executive of 
      the state to deprive any individual of his life, liberty or property on 
      the basis of the international treaty.  It would be a clear breach of that 
      individual’s constitutional rights.  An unincorporated treaty cannot make 
      something due process: nor can such a treaty make something not due process 
      unless some separate principle of municipal law makes it so.  [Emphasis

  [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The doctrine of legitimate expectations can affect the content of the 
  duty of procedural fairness or impose procedural fairness requirements where 
  none would otherwise exist.  The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the 
  doctrine in three cases – <i>Old St. Boniface Residents Assn. Inc. v. Winnipeg 
  (City)</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1170, <i>Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)</i>, 
  [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525 and <i>Baker, supra </i>– though it did not give effect 
  to the doctrine in any of them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The doctrine is limited.  It is a doctrine of procedural fairness only. 
  It creates no substantive rights.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, Ahani invokes the doctrine of legitimate expectations to support 
  his contention that procedural fairness requires Canada not to deport him until 
  the Committee has considered his communication.  His reliance on the doctrine 
  is unusual in this sense: typically individuals resort to legitimate expectations 
  to obtain greater procedural fairness – greater  participatory rights – from 
  the administrative decision maker.  But Ahani does not seek more procedural 
  fairness from the Committee.  He is content with the fairness of the Committee’s 
  procedures.  Instead, he tries to use the doctrine of legitimate expectations 
  to impose procedural requirements on the other party to the dispute, Canada.  
  Even if he can overcome this obstacle, he faces two other hurdles, either of 
  which show that he can have no legitimate expectation of remaining in Canada 
  pending the Committee’s consideration of his communication.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, nothing in Canada’s past practice with interim measures requests 
  or in its dealings with Ahani could give rise to a legitimate expectation that 
  it would permit Ahani to remain in the country until the Committee considers 
  his communication.  At its root, the doctrine of legitimate expectations protects 
  people’s reasonable expectations in their dealings with government.  In other 
  words, it protects participatory expectations derived from consistent patterns 
  of previous behaviour or from an undertaking given to an aggrieved party.  See 
  Mullan<i>, Administrative Law</i> (2001), at pp. 177-78.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada, however, as Ahani acknowledges, has no consistent practice of 
  acceding to interim measures requests.  In some cases it has; in others it has 
  not.  In the only other case concerning a terrorist – Tejinder Pal Singh – Canada 
  did not accede to an interim measures request from the United Nations Committee 
  Against Torture.  Canada concluded that its international obligation to ensure 
  it did not become a safe haven for terrorists required Singh’s immediate removal.  
  Thus, Canada’s past practice does not assist Ahani.  Nor has Canada made any 
  undertaking to Ahani that would permit him to legitimately expect that he could 
  remain in Canada pending the Committee’s deliberations.  Instead, it has sent 
  the opposite message.  It intends to deport him immediately.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ahani can have no legitimate expectation of remaining in Canada for 
  a second reason.  What he seeks is not only procedural fairness but a substantive 
  right.  He seeks the substantive right to remain in Canada until the Committee 
  delivers its views, a process that could take years.  But the law in Canada 
  is clear: the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not create substantive 
  rights.  For either of these two reasons, I would not give effect to Ahani’s 
  claim for an injunction based on legitimate expectations.  I would therefore 
  dismiss his appeal.</p>

  permits this court to order a stay pending the filing of a motion for leave 
  in the Supreme Court and I would exercise that jurisdiction in this case.  Ahani 
  has raised an important issue, and one on which the panel is divided.  His counsel 
  Ms. Jackman has undertaken to file a motion for leave to appeal promptly.  Ahani 
  remains in custody.  If he is deported to Iran immediately after this court’s 
  decision, his leave motion to the Supreme Court of Canada will be rendered moot.</p>

  </span> All these considerations favour granting a stay.  I would stay Ahani’s

  permit Ahani to file his motion for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In April 1992, the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board 
  found that the appellant, an Iranian national, is a Convention Refugee.  This 
  means that he is a person who <span style='color:black'>by reason of a well-founded 
  fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in 
  a particular social group or political opinion</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

  to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality.  In June 1993, 
  two Ministers of the Federal Crown filed a security certificate in the Federal 
  Court alleging, in effect, that the appellant is a terrorist or a member of 
  a terrorist organization.  The appellant has been detained in jail since that 
  time—a period of almost nine years.  During that time, the appellant has resisted 
  the attempts by the federal government to remove him from Canada to Iran. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has now exhausted all of his domestic remedies.  However, 
  the federal government holds out to him one last tantalizing hope.  In 1976, 
  the federal government<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> 
  ratified the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</i>  As 
  a result, in the words of article 2, the federal government agreed to “respect 
  and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction 
  the rights recognized in the present Covenant”.  This is a binding obligation.  
  The federal government has undertaken to perform this Covenant in good faith.  
  It has also undertaken not to invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification 
  for failure to perform.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  The appellant alleges 
  that the process by which the federal government has come to be in a position 
  to remove him to Iran is flawed and does not accord with the Covenant.  The 
  federal government says that it has acted in accordance with the laws of Canada 
  and points out that the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the procedures 
  undertaken in the appellant’s case accord with the guarantees in the <i>Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  However, no Canadian court is competent 
  to pass upon the question of whether our procedure comports with the obligations 
  set out in the Covenant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is a body with the expertise to pass on that question.  The Covenant 
  established the Human Rights Committee.  In 1976, at the same time that it ratified 
  the Covenant, Canada ratified the <i>First Optional Protocol to the International 
  Covenant</i>.  In the words of article 1 of the Protocol, the federal government 
  bound itself to recognize the competence of the Committee to “receive and consider 
  communications from individuals subject to its jurisdiction who claim to be 
  victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the rights set forth in 
  the Covenant”.  In accordance with article 2 of the Protocol an individual, 
  such as the appellant, may only submit a communication for consideration by 
  the Committee after he has exhausted his domestic remedies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant is now at that stage.  He has exhausted his domestic remedies 
  all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  He does not want to return to Iran, where he 
  fears persecution, until the Committee considers his communication and in the 
  arcane language of the Protocol forwards its “views” to Canada.  He hopes that 
  the Committee will accept his submission that the process leading to his removal 
  does not comport with the obligations in the Covenant and that the federal government 
  will reconsider the decision to remove him.  In the past, Canada and the provinces 
  have changed legislation because of the views of the Committee.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
  [4] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the federal government has committed itself to these binding 
  obligations and has held out to the appellant and others like him the right 
  to communicate with the Committee, it has decided to deport the appellant to 
  Iran now.  It does not want to wait for the Committee to make its decision.  
  The respondents offer both legal and policy justifications for this stance.  
  On the legal side, they invoke the established principle that international 
  conventions are not binding in Canada unless they have been specifically incorporated 
  into Canadian law.  The Covenant, while ratified, has never been incorporated 
  into Canadian domestic law and therefore does not create legal obligations enforceable 
  in Canada.  They point out that the views of the Committee are not legally binding 
  on Canada, in the sense that Canada is not required to change its laws or its 
  practices to conform to those views.  They also take the position that the government 
  is not legally bound to wait for the Committee’s views.  Thus, since the Covenant 
  and the Protocol create no binding obligations in Canada, the appellant has 
  no right, enforceable in a Canadian court, to remain in Canada while the international 
  process takes its course.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the policy side, the respondents submit that allowing the appellant 
  to remain in Canada conflicts with Canada’s international obligation to fight 
  terrorism.  They point to the post September 11<sup>th</sup> resolution of the 
  United Nations Security Council that called upon all states to:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Ensure, in conformity with international law, that refugee 
      status is not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of 
      terrorist acts, and that claims of political motivation are not recognized 
      as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists…</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents are also concerned about the delay.  They suggest that 
  the Committee has a history of taking many years to communicate its views.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have found the submissions of the federal government unconvincing.  
  In my view, the removal of the appellant at this time to Iran, a place where 
  he, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board, has a well-founded fear 
  of persecution, is contrary to s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and 
  Freedoms</i>.  I would grant an injunction to prevent his removal at this time.  
  Because of the urgency of the matter, I can only set out my reasons in summary 
  form.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='line-height:200%'><b><span lang=EN-US>Life, liberty

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span

  </span> There is no ordinary domestic legislation now standing in the way of 
  the appellant’s removal to Iran.  Although he is a Convention Refugee, Canadian 
  law permits his deportation under certain conditions and the Supreme Court of 
  Canada has found that those conditions have been fulfilled.  If the appellant 
  is to remain in Canada any longer, it will only be because he can establish 
  that his removal would violate his rights under the <i>Charter</i>.  In accordance 
  with s. 32(1)(a), the government of Canada is bound by the <i>Charter</i> and 
  the courts have the power to grant to the appellant a remedy against the government 
  if he can establish a violation of his rights.  The appellant relies upon the 
  fundamental justice guarantee in s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Section 7 provides 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person 
      and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles 
      of fundamental justice.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The right to fundamental justice is not a free standing one.  The appellant 
  must first show that his right to life, liberty or security of the person is 
  implicated by the proposed government action.  Counsel for the respondents submits 
  that the Supreme Court of Canada has conclusively determined that the appellant’s 
  removal to Iran does not violate his right to life, liberty or security of the 
  person.  He relies upon the following statement from para. 2 of the decision 
  of the Supreme Court in the appellant’s case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Applying the analytical framework set out in <i>Suresh</i> [<i>Suresh v. 
      Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2002 SCC 1] to the 
      facts of this case, <u>we conclude that Ahani has not cleared the evidentiary 
      threshold required to access the s. 7 protection guaranteed by the <i>Canadian 
      Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i></u>.  As found in <i>Suresh</i>, the 
      provisions allowing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to deport 
      a refugee for membership in a terrorist organization do not unjustifiably 
      infringe <i>Charter</i> rights of freedom of expression and association.  
      In this case, unlike <i>Suresh</i>, the Minister provided adequate procedural 
      protections.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the respondent’s submission overstates the effect of the 
  decision of the Supreme Court.  In <i>Suresh</i>, at para. 76, the Supreme Court 
  held that barring extraordinary circumstances, “deportation to torture will 
  generally violate the principles of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of 
  the <i>Charter</i>.”  The court went on to hold in para. 77 that in exercising 
  the discretion under the <i>Immigration Act</i>, the Minister must balance the 
  relevant factors and that to comport with s. 7 the Minister should “generally 
  decline to deport refugees where on the evidence there is a substantial risk 
  of torture”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue before the Supreme Court in the appellant’s case was whether 
  there was a reasonable basis for the Minister’s finding that the appellant did 
  not face a substantial risk of torture.  According to paras. 20 and 21 of the 
  reasons of the Supreme Court, the Minister based her decision on a report from 
  an analyst with the Case Management Branch of the Department of Citizenship 
  and Immigration.  The analyst concluded that the “serious risk to Canadian security 
  was outweighed against the minimal risk of harm to Ahani if returned to Iran”.  
  The Supreme Court concluded in para. 22 that the Minister applied the proper 
  principles and took into account the relevant factors and that there was no 
  basis to interfere with her decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To summarize, the Supreme Court did not find that the appellant’s right 
  to life liberty or security of the person was not implicated by the proposed 
  deportation to Iran.  Rather, the court found that the decision to deport conformed 
  to the principles of fundamental justice because the Minister had balanced, 
  as she was entitled to do, the risk that the appellant would be tortured against 
  the risk to Canadian society.  There would have been no need to engage in this 
  balancing exercise if the appellant did not face any risk to his life, liberty 
  or security of the person.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That the appellant does face a risk to his security of the person was 
  conclusively determined in April 1992 when the Refugee Division of the Immigration 
  and Refugee Board found the appellant to be a Convention Refugee.  The federal 
  government has never moved to set aside that finding.  In <i>Singh v. Canada 
  (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i> (1985), 17 D.L.R. (4th) 422 (S.C.C.) 
  at 460, a case concerning persons seeking Convention Refugee status, Wilson 
  J. held that security of the person “must encompass freedom from the threat 
  of physical punishment or suffering as well as freedom from such punishment 
  itself”.  She also held that the right not to be deprived of security of the 
  person is implicated even when the threat of physical punishment or suffering 
  comes from a foreign state.  Those rights are implicated when there is only 
  a potential threat:  <i>United States of America v. Burns </i>(2001), 151 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 126.</p>

  </span> The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the legislation and the procedure

  23 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at 309, Lamer J. described the source of the principles 
  of fundamental justice as being in the “basic tenets and principles, not only 
  of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal system”.  
  He then noted at page 310 the evolutionary process as the courts discover those 
  principles:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Whether any given principle may be said to be a principle 
      of fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7 will rest upon an analysis

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, where the legislature has established a statutory right 
  to review a decision that could affect the security of the person, it is a principle 
  of fundamental justice that the state cannot unreasonably frustrate that right.  
  As Lord Millett said in <i>Thomas v. Baptiste</i>, [1999] 3 W.L.R. 249 (J.C.P.C.) 
  at 261:  “the right to be allowed to complete a current appellate or other legal 
  process without having it rendered nugatory by executive action before it is 
  completed is part of the fundamental concept of due process”.  I do not say 
  that the right of effective review is absolute.  Time and again, most recently 
  in <i>Suresh</i>, the Supreme Court has pointed out the need to balance various 
  interests in defining the principles of fundamental justice.  For example, the 
  state interest in protecting the public may require that steps be taken that 
  will render the right of review nugatory for all practical purposes.  Thus, 
  there is no automatic right to bail pending appeal even if in the result the 
  offender may have served the entire sentence before the appeal can be heard.  
  See:  <i>R. v. Farinacci</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.).  I also 
  do not hold that this right necessarily imposes positive obligations on the 
  state to make the statutory right of review effective, by for example supplying 
  counsel, transcripts access to legal sources and so on.  Those difficult questions 
  involving allocation of scarce resources are not raised in this case.  See <i>R. 
  v. Robinson</i> (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 452 (Alta. C.A.), <i>R. v. Johal</i> 
  (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (B.C.C.A.) and <i>New Brunswick (Minister of Health

      of life, liberty or security of the person must accord, in order to withstand 
      constitutional scrutiny, is not an easy task. A mere common law rule does 
      not suffice to constitute a principle of fundamental justice, rather, as 
      the term implies, <u>principles upon which there is some consensus that 
      they are vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice are required</u>. 
      Principles of fundamental justice must not, however, be so broad as to be 
      no more than vague generalizations about what our society considers to be 
      ethical or moral. <u>They must be capable of being identified with some 
      precision and applied to situations in a manner which yields an understandable 
      result. They must also, in my view, be legal principles.</u>  [Emphasis

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principle that I have described easily meets these criteria, at 
  least when applied in the domestic context.  It would offend our societal notion 
  of justice to allow the government to frustrate a statutory procedure for review 
  without some reasonable justification.  This principle can be applied in a manner 
  that yields understandable results.  Indeed, appellate courts do so daily in 
  considering applications for bail pending appeal.  Finally, it is a legal principle.  
  It is not some vague generalization based only upon notions of ethics or morality.  
  It is based on the same principle that animated such decisions as <i>R. v. Morgentaler</i> 
  (1988), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at 476, where Dickson C.J.C. held that as 
  a matter of fundamental justice, “when Parliament creates a defence to a criminal 
  charge, the defence should not be illusory or so difficult to attain as to be 
  practically illusory”.  Similarly, when Parliament enacts a process for review 
  of decisions that deprive individuals of their liberty or security of the person, 
  the state cannot, without reason, act to render that right of review illusory 
  or practically illusory.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5]

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this principle of fundamental justice, although derived 
  from a statutory right of review, can be applied by analogy to the process permitted 
  by the Covenant and the Protocol.  That is to say, individuals within Canada 
  facing a deprivation of their right to life, liberty or security of the person 
  have a right under s.7 of the <i>Charter</i>, within reason, to have their petition 
  reviewed by the Human Rights Committee free from any executive action that would 
  render this review nugatory.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Application of this principle to the process created by the Covenant 
  and the Protocol requires a brief examination of the constitutional principles 
  surrounding the treaty making power.  In the Anglo-Canadian system, the power 
  to enter into and ratify international treaties such as the Covenant and the 
  Protocol is an exercise of one of the prerogatives of the Crown.  Parliament 
  “plays no necessary role in the making of treaties”:  Hogg, <i>Constitutional 
  Law of Canada</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed, looseleaf. (1997), at para. 11.3(c).  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An aspect of the government’s argument that the appellant has no right 
  to await the decision of the Committee is the principle that international conventions 
  are not binding in Canada unless they have been specifically incorporated into 
  Canadian law.  However, this principle is to protect Parliament and the people 
  of Canada from executive action.  Lord Hoffman explained the principle in <i>Higgs 
  v. Minister of National Security</i>, [2000] 2 W.L.R. 1368 (P.C.) at para. 13:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>The rule that treaties cannot alter the law of the land is but one facet 
      of the more general principle that the Crown cannot change the law by the 
      exercise of its powers under the prerogative.  This was the great principle 
      which was settled by the Civil War and the Glorious Revolution in the seventeenth 
      century.</u><span>  </span>And on no point were the claims of the prerogative 
      more resented in those times than in relation to the establishment of courts 
      having jurisdiction in domestic law.  There have been no prerogative courts 
      in England since the abolition of Star Chamber and High Commission.  But 
      the objection to a prerogative court must be equally strong whether it is 
      created by the Crown alone or as an international court by the Crown in 
      conjunction with other sovereign states.  In neither case is there power 
      to give it any jurisdiction in domestic law.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, however, the government seeks to invoke the non-binding principle 
  to shield the executive from the consequences of its voluntary decision to enter 
  into and therefore be bound by the Covenant and the Protocol.  In <i>Tangiora 
  v. Wellington District Legal Services Committee</i>, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 240 (P.C.) 
  at p. 246 Lord Millett described the nature of a state’s relationship with the 
  Committee where, like New Zealand in that case, the state has signed the Optional 
  Protocol:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[The Committee] is not an organ of a sovereign state but the creation of 
      an international convention.  Its jurisdiction over state parties is consensual.  
      <u>By signing the Optional Protocol New Zealand submitted to its jurisdiction, 
      and can be said to have conferred jurisdiction upon it.</u>  But it did 
      not cede to it its own sovereign power of adjudication over the inhabitations 
      of New Zealand.  The Human Rights Committee does not exercise the adjudicative 
      functions of New Zealand, but its own independent jurisdiction derived from 
      an international instrument and the submission of State parties.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> So too by signing the Protocol the federal government has conferred 
  jurisdiction upon the Committee.  In my view, the non-binding principle goes 
  only so far as to affirm that the Covenant and the Protocol do not create rights 
  in the appellant that can be enforced in a domestic court.  But, the appellant 
  does not seek such an application of the Covenant and the Protocol.  The appellant 
  does not claim that the views of the Committee about our process for removing 
  him would create legal rights that could be enforced in a domestic court.  He 
  claims only the limited procedural right to reasonable access to the Committee, 
  upon which the federal government has conferred jurisdiction.  He submits that 
  the government having held out this right of review, however limited and non-binding, 
  should not be entitled to render it practically illusory by returning him to 
  Iran before he has had a reasonable opportunity to access it.  I agree with 
  that submission and that it is a principle of fundamental justice that individuals 
  in Canada have fair access to the process in the Protocol.  By deporting the 
  appellant to Iran, the government will deprive the appellant of this opportunity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I accept that the application of this principle is more difficult in 
  this context because of the difficulty for a Canadian court to assess the merits 
  of a communication to the Committee.  However, I think there is a generally 
  held consensus in Canada that in the human rights context an individual whose 
  security is at stake should within reason be given the opportunity to access 
  remedies at the international level, and that necessarily the executive should 
  not unreasonably frustrate the individual’s attempt to do so.  I think this 
  is particularly so where the individual seeks access to a body of the stature 
  of the Committee.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a>  
  Lord Millett described the Committee in these terms in <i>Tangiora </i>at pp. 
  244-45:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is true that its views are not binding on the state party concerned, 
      which is free to criticize them and may refuse to implement them.  Nevertheless, 
      as, Professor Tomuschat has observed, <u>a state party may find it hard 
      to reject such findings when they are based on orderly proceedings during 
      which the state party has had a proper opportunity to present its case.  
      The views of the Human Rights Committee acquire authority from the standing 
      of its members and their judicial qualities of impartiality, objectivity 
      and restraint.</u>  Moreover, there is much force in the provisional view 
      of Thomas J. that its functions are adjudicative.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I recognize that there may be no international consensus that governments 
  that have ratified the Optional Protocol must await the views of the Committee.  
  But I do not see this as an obstacle to recognizing this principle of fundamental 
  justice under the <i>Charter</i>.  In <i>Rodriguez</i> at p. 66, Sopinka J. 
  cautioned against relying upon a purely historical review for discerning the 
  principles of fundamental justice:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is not sufficient, however, merely to conduct a historical review and 
      conclude that because neither Parliament nor the various medical associations 
      had ever expressed a view that assisted suicide should be decriminalized, 
      that to prohibit it could not be said to be contrary to the principles of 
      fundamental justice. Such an approach would be problematic for two reasons. 
      <u>First, a strictly historical analysis will always lead to the conclusion, 
      in a case such as this, that the deprivation is in accordance with fundamental 
      justice, as the legislation will not have kept apace with advances in medical 
      technology. Secondly, such reasoning is somewhat circular, in that it relies 
      on the continuing existence of the prohibition to find the prohibition to 
      be fundamentally just</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to Sopinka J., the way to avoid these problems is “not to 
  avoid the historical analysis, but to make sure that one is looking not just 
  at the existence of the practice itself … but at the rationale behind that practice 
  and the principles which underlie it.”  I have attempted to do this in summary 
  form in this part of these reasons.  I have explained why the principle that 
  international conventions are not binding in Canada unless they have been specifically 
  incorporated into Canadian law is not a convincing rationale for limiting review 
  of executive action.  The principle that I would recognize here is based upon 
  a simple principle of justice that where there is a right there should be a 
  remedy, a principle enshrined in the <i>Charter </i>and international conventions.  
  See for example <i>R. v. Mills</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 508-9 
  per Lamer J. dissenting on other grounds and <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario In</i>c., 
  2001 SCC 81 at para. 20.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, there is some authority for this principle of fundamental 
  justice.  In a series of cases, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
  has held that, at least in capital cases, states subject to a constitutionally 
  enshrined due process clause may be obliged to await the decision of international 
  bodies such as the Human Rights Committee.  Admittedly, those cases most often 
  concern the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American 
  Court of Human Rights established by the <i>American Convention on Human Rights 
  1969</i>.  I also recognize that the structure established by the American Convention 
  is somewhat different in that the Inter-American Court (but not the Commission) 
  can in some fashion issue rulings that are binding under international law.  
  However, I do not read those cases as turning on this peculiar aspect of the 
  American Convention.  The same reasoning has been applied where the petition 
  is to the Human Rights Committee and where the country, such as Jamaica, has 
  not recognized the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court, only the Commission.  
  See in particular <i>Lewis v. Attorney-General of Jamaica,</i> [2000] 3 W.L.R. 
  1785 (J.C.P.C.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The basis for recognizing a due process right in these circumstances 
  is based on more fundamental principles of due process.  I find particularly 
  attractive the dissenting speech of Lord Nicholls in <i>Briggs v. Baptiste</i>, 
  <span style='color:black'>[2000] 2 A.C. 40</span> (J.C.P.C.) at para. 47, where 
  he said that he could not accept that “the law of Trinidad and Tobago is so 
  foreshortened that the courts of Trinidad and Tobago must stand by, powerless 
  to act, while Briggs is executed.  By acceding to the Convention, Trinidad and 
  Tobago intended to confer benefits on its citizens.  The benefits were intended 
  to be real, not illusory.  The Inter-American system of human rights was not 
  intended to be a hollow sham or, for those under sentence of death, a cruel 
  charade.”  In the same case, Lord Millett speaking for the majority at para. 
  42 described the effect of the earlier decision of the Judicial Committee [the 
  Board] in <i>Thomas v. Baptiste</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In that case there was an outstanding dispute of fact which remained to 
      be investigated by the Commission and if necessary decided by the Court, 
      viz. whether the defendants had had a fair trial. If the Court were to rule 
      that the trial had not been fair and to order that the conviction be quashed, 
      <u>the State would be at liberty as a matter of domestic law to ignore the 
      order and carry out the sentence</u>, but it is very difficult to believe 
      that it would have done so. Trinidad and Tobago is a modern democracy which 
      operates under the rule of law and is sensitive to its international obligations. 
      <u>By granting the stay in question the Board ensured that the defendants 
      would obtain that to which they were entitled under the Constitution, the 
      right to pursue their outstanding complaints to the point where a favourable 
      determination was capable of leading to the quashing of their convictions 
      or the commutation of their sentences</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I should say that I do not necessarily subscribe to all the reasons 
  of the Judicial Committee in these cases.  Like Dambrot J., I find some of the 
  reasoning strained.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] </span></a>  
  I refer to these cases simply as an indication that countries with legal systems 
  like ours have found that due process requires that individuals be given the

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  want to briefly comment on the policy arguments made by counsel for the respondent.  
  As I said, counsel for the respondent submits that allowing the appellant to 
  remain in Canada conflicts with its international obligation to fight terrorism.  
  He drew the court’s attention to the post September 11<sup>th</sup> resolution 
  of the United Nations Security Council that called upon all states to:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ensure, <u>in conformity with international law</u>, that refugee status 
      is not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist 
      acts, and that claims of political motivation are not recognized as grounds 
      for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists… [Emphasis 
      added.]<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span> [8] </span></a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  see nothing inconsistent with according the appellant access to the Committee 
  and Canada complying with its international obligations.  Canada is not harbouring 
  terrorists or setting itself up as a haven for terrorists.  The appellant has 
  been in jail for over eight years.  He seeks the views of a Committee established 
  in accordance with a United Nations Covenant.  If Canada is concerned that the 
  Optional Protocol will be used as a vehicle to shield terrorists, it can denounce 
  the Protocol.  It did not have to ratify the Protocol and many nations, such 
  as the United States of America and the United Kingdom, have not done so.  I 
  agree with counsel for Amnesty International that the Committee is well positioned 
  to balance the competing values in protecting Convention Refugees and the international 
  obligation to eradicate terrorism.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Counsel 
  for the respondents also seemed to imply that Canada ratified the Covenant and 
  the Protocol because they created no enforceable obligations.  He referred to 
  an article by D. Kretzmer, “Commentary on Complaint Processes by Human Rights 
  Committee and Torture Committee Members: The Human Rights Committee” in A.E. 
  Bayefsky, <i>The UN Human Rights Treaty System in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</i> 
  (2000), at p. 164 where the author wrote:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

      provided that there was no really effective enforcement mechanism to make

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Counsel 
  argues that if this court were to allow the appellant to wait in Canada for 
  the Committee’s views, this would enforce an obligation Canada did not really 
  intend to honour and affect the common understanding of the non-enforceable 
  nature of international treaties.  I have already explained why I do not think 
  this is the effect of the protection sought by the appellant.  I also find it 
  difficult to accept that the federal government ratified the treaty because 
  it knew it could not be made to comply with its binding obligations.  This would 
  undermine the good faith obligation inherent in ratifying treaties. In any event, 
  I am supported in my view that policy considerations do not stand in the way 
  of this result by the statements by the Government of Canada such as the following, 
  which seem to run contrary to counsel’s submissions before us:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr Speaker, may I just add that our becoming party to these extremely important 
      international human rights instruments will enable us to play a more active

  As McLachlin J. said in <i>Cunningham v. Canada</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 492 
  (S.C.C.) at 499:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The principles of fundamental justice are concerned not only with the interest 
      of the person who claims his liberty has been limited, but with the protection 
      of society.  Fundamental justice requires that a fair balance be struck 
      between these interests, both substantively and procedurally….</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  test for granting an interlocutory injunction can, by way of analogy, provide 
  a sufficiently nuanced approach to meet the interests of both the applicant 
  and the state.  That test requires the court first to make a preliminary assessment 
  of the merits of the case to ensure that there is a serious question to be tried. 
  Secondly, the court must determine whether the applicant would suffer irreparable 
  harm if the application were refused. Finally, an assessment must be made as 
  to which of the parties would suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal 
  of the remedy pending a decision on the merits.  See <i>RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. 
  Canada (Attorney General)</i> (1994), 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.) at 400.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While 
  domestic courts have no jurisdiction to interpret international conventions, 
  I think that it is open to a court to make at least some preliminary assessment 
  of the claim if for no other reason than to screen out the obviously frivolous 
  claims.  For example, if the Committee had in identical circumstances given 
  its view that the Canadian process complies with the Covenant, I would think 
  it unlikely a court would find there was a serious question involved.  I note 
  that in this case, however, the Human Rights Committee has accepted the appellant’s 
  communication and in accordance with its own rules has asked Canada to refrain 
  from deporting the appellant until the Committee has had an opportunity to consider 
  his allegations.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Further, 
  this principle of fundamental justice may only be enforced in cases where the 
  individual’s life, liberty or security of the person interests are implicated, 
  as in the case of a Convention Refugee.  The right to pursue the international 
  remedy is not a means for delaying deportation in less serious cases.  As well, 
  it may be that the government can show in a particular case that the balance 
  of convenience favours removal as where the applicant poses an unacceptable 
  risk to public security even where, as in this case, he or she is being held 
  in custody.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally, 
  I would not foreclose the possibility that the government might be able to show 
  that the Committee process will result in such an intolerable delay that the 
  balance of convenience favours deportation.  I would think, however, that would 
  be an unusual case.  Here the domestic procedures have occupied over eight years 
  and the appellant has remained in custody throughout.  Canada can hardly complain 
  about some delay at the Committee level when it is a condition of invoking that 
  jurisdiction that all domestic remedies have been exhausted.</p>

  J. held that the appellant had no right to remain in Canada pending disposition 
  of his communication by the Committee.  He therefore did not consider application 
  of the test for granting an injunction.  I think it only fair to give the government 
  the opportunity to show that in the particular circumstances the appellant has 
  not established that, for example, the balance of convenience favours his remaining 
  in Canada.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the 
  Superior Court of Justice for a hearing in accordance with these reasons.  The 
  appellant will remain in custody pending this hearing in accordance with s. 
  40.1 of the <i>Immigration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2.  In accordance with 
  s. 50(1)(a), the removal order will not be executed pending the hearing in the 
  Superior Court of Justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  wish to conclude these reasons with this note. In <i>Secretary for the Home 
  Department v. Rehman</i>, [2002] 1 All E.R. 122 (H.C.) at 142, Lord Hoffman 
  pointed out that the events of September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2001 are a reminder 
  that “in matters of national security the cost of failure can be high”. He also 
  stated that decisions on security measures, with serious potential results for 
  the community “require a legitimacy which can be conferred only by entrusting 
  them to persons responsible to the community through the democratic process.” 
  The judicial arm of government must respect the decisions of the executive in 
  those matters.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  these reasons, I have accorded to the appellant a procedural right that the 
  executive arm of government held out to him. That right is a narrow one. It 
  does not entitle him to any particular result either from the Human Rights Committee 
  or the government once it receives the views of the Committee. Moreover, as 
  I have said, it is a right that must be balanced against other interests, including 
  national security. But, the courts in their commendable effort to support the 
  government’s defence of this and other countries from terrorism must bear in 
  mind the words of Justice Frankfurter in <i>McNabb v. U.S.,</i> 318 U.S. 332 
  (1942) at 347, which were adopted for this country by Lamer J. in <i>Reference 
  Re Section 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act</i> at p. 310: “the history of liberty 
  has largely been the history of observance of procedural safeguards.”  </p>

    terms of the constitutions of the nations involved.  Thus, the Constitution 
    of Trinidad and Tobago affirms the right of the individual to life, liberty, 
    security of the person and enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived 
    thereof “except by due process <u>of law</u>”. [Emphasis added.]  This led 
    the majority of the Judicial Committee in <i>Thomas v. Baptiste</i> at para. 
    26 to characterize the applicant’s right in these terms:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>By ratifying a treaty which provides 
    for individual access to an international body, the Government made the process 
    for the time being part of the domestic criminal justice system and thereby 
    temporarily at least extended the scope of the due process clause in the Constitution.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>The dissenting judgment delivered by Lord Goff and 
    Lord Hobhouse relies upon the limitation implied by the use of the term “law” 
    as essentially referring to the “law of the land” or domestic/municipal law.  
    See especially paras. 58 and 61.   Section 7 of the <i>Charter</i> is broader 
    and refers to principles of fundamental justice.</p>
