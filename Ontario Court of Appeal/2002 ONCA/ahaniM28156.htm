  <span>      </span>The appellant is a Convention refugee who is the subject 
  of a deportation order. He has exhausted all of his rights of appeal, including 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada, which dismissed his appeal on January 11, 2002. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed in its ruling that there was no basis 
  to interfere with the two findings of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration: 
  (1) that the appellant constitutes a danger to the security of Canada; and (2) 
  that if deported to Iran, his country of origin, he faces only a minimal risk 
  of torture. The court also concluded that “the process accorded to Ahani was 
  consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Faced with imminent deportation to Iran, the appellant initiated 
  a proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court seeking an injunction to prevent 
  the execution of the deportation order pending a determination of his petition 
  to the United Nations Human Rights Committee as to whether Canada is in breach 
  of its international obligations under the <i>International Covenant on Civil 
  and Political Rights.</i> The injunction was sought pursuant to ss. 7 and 24(1) 
  of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. The petition to the U.N. Committee 
  was filed on January 10, 2002 in anticipation of the receipt of the decision 
  of the Supreme Court the following day, and the possibility (which did materialize), 
  that the appellant would lose his appeal and be subject to imminent deportation 
  from Canada.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In the Superior Court the respondent submitted that the Superior 
  Court and the Federal Court shared concurrent jurisdiction over constitutional 
  issues raised in the context of the <i>Immigration Act</i>, but that the Superior 
  Court should defer to the Federal Court expertise in such matters. Dambrot J. 
  decided to assume jurisdiction in the matter, but dismissed the motion on the 
  merits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to this court and 
  brought this motion on short notice, seeking an interim stay of the deportation 
  order pending the hearing of the appeal. In order to accommodate the procedure, 
  the respondent has undertaken that the appellant’s deportation will be delayed 
  until Saturday, January 19, 2002.</p>

  <span>      </span>The appellant concedes that the stay being sought is not 
  a stay of the order appealed from under Rule 63.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil 
  Procedure</i>. Rather, it is a stay of  the deportation order itself. I am satisfied 
  that the court has jurisdiction to issue such a stay pursuant to s. 134(2) of 
  the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, if the criteria of the section are met. That 
  subsection provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 134(2)  On motion, a court to which a motion for leave to appeal is 
      made or to which an appeal is taken may make any interim order that is considered 
      just to prevent prejudice to a party pending the appeal.</p>

  history of the case of <i>Reza v. The Queen</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394 at 399 
  was an order made by Galligan J.A. staying the deportation order itself, pending

  <i>Charter </i>proceeding wherein he sought injunctive relief from execution 
  of that deportation order.  </p>

  <span>      </span>The background facts are set out in the Reasons of Dambrot 
  J. and I reproduce them here:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span>            </span>Mansour Ahani is a citizen of Iran. He arrived 
      in Canada on October 14, 1991, and immediately claimed protection as a Convention 
      refugee. On April 1, 1992, the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee 
      Board found him to be a Convention refugee.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On June 17, 1993 a security certificate signed 
      by the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
      pursuant to s. 40.1 of the <i>Immigration Act</i> was filed in the Federal 
      Court of Canada. In the certificate, the Ministers certified that they were 
      of the opinion that the applicant was a member of an inadmissible class 
      specified in the anti-terrorism provisions of the <i>Act</i>. In brief, 
      it is alleged that Ahani is or was a member of the Iranian Security Service, 
      which is a terrorist organization. The applicant was arrested pursuant to 
      this certificate, and has been in custody ever since.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On April 17, 1998, Denault J. determined pursuant 
      to s. 40.1 of the <i>Immigration Act</i> that the decision of the Ministers 
      to issue the certificate was reasonable.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On April 28, 1998, an adjudicator determined that 
      the applicant was a member of the inadmissible class alleged by the Ministers, 
      and ordered him deported from Canada. He has remained in Canada since then 
      as  a result of injunctions preventing his removal while legal proceedings 
      were pending.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On August 12, 1998, the Minister of Citizenship 
      and Immigration issued her opinion, under s. 53(1)(b) of the <i>Act</i>, 
      that the applicant constitutes a danger to the security of Canada, and that 
      he faced only a minimal risk of torture in Iran. These findings enable the 
      Minister to return the applicant, a Convention refugee, to the very country 
      from which he sought refuge.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On June 15, 1999, an application for judicial 
      review of the Minister’s decision, and an action raising similar issues 
      was dismissed by McGillis J.. On January 18, 2000, an appeal to the Federal 
      Court of Appeal was dismissed. On January 11, 2002, a further appeal to 
      the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>In its judgment, the Supreme Court concluded that 
      on any standard of review, even correctness, there was no basis to interfere 
      with the Minister’s findings. The Court also concluded that the procedural 
      process accorded to Ahani was consistent with the principles of fundamental 
      justice. In short the Supreme Court concluded that the deportation of the 
      applicant to Iran will not violate his rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>… On January 10, 2002, the applicant forwarded 
      a preliminary petition to the United Nations Human Rights Committee claiming 
      that Canada is in violation of various articles of the <i>International 
      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i> relating to the fairness of his 
      trial, the right to be free from torture and arbitrary detention. The applicant 
      asked the Committee to consider his petition under the <i>Optional Protocol 
      to  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</i> Accompanying 
      this petition was a request to the Committee for “interim measures”, specifically 
      a request that the Committee in turn request of Canada that it not remove 
      the applicant to Iran until the Committee has had an opportunity to consider 
      his petition, should the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada fail.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>On January 11, 2002, the Commission advised the 
      applicant that Canada had been requested, in the event that the Supreme 
      Court’s decision expected to be delivered on January 11, 2002 were to allow 
      the deportation of Ahani, to refrain from deporting Ahani until the Committee 
      has an opportunity to consider the allegations, particularly those that 
      relate to torture, other inhuman treatment or even death as a consequence 
      of the deportation. Canada has advised the applicant, and this Court, that 
      it does not propose to honour this request.</p>

lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The issue, as framed by Dambrot J. is, does the appellant 
  have a constitutional right as a principle of fundamental justice guaranteed 
  by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, not to be removed from Canada until his petition 
  to the United Nations Human Rights Committee has been considered and finally 
  reported on. Dambrot J. held that there is no such right and therefore declined 
  the injunction. At this level, in order to obtain a stay, the appellant need 
  only show that there is a serious issue to be tried.</p>

  </span></span> It is agreed that Canada has ratified the <i>International Covenant 
  on Civil and Political Rights </i> which recognizes certain rights of all peoples 
  and obliges State Parties to in effect ensure that the rights are effective 
  within those states. The <i>International Covenant</i> also establishes the 
  Human Rights Committee. Canada has also acceded to the <i>Optional Protocol 
  to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i> which provides 
  a process whereby persons who claim to be victims of violations of a right contained 
  in the <i>Covenant</i> may seek the assistance of the Human Rights Committee 
  after exhausting all available domestic remedies. The Committee’s jurisdiction 
  is to consider what it receives from the complainant and from the State Party, 
  then: “The Committee shall forward its views to the State Party concerned and 
  to the individual.” </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Committee operates with <i>Rules of Procedure</i>. 
  Rule 86 gives the Committee the authority, upon the request of the complainant, 
  to ask the State Party to take “interim measures” to protect the status quo 
  pending the determination of the matter by the Committee. Rule 86 provides:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Committee may, prior to forwarding its views on the 
      communication to the State party concerned, inform that State of its views 
      as to whether interim measures may be desirable to avoid irreparable damage 
      to the victim of the alleged violation. In doing so the Committee shall 
      inform the State party concerned that such expression of its views on interim 
      measures does not imply a determination on the merits of the communication.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The <i>Protocol</i> by its own terms, does not 
  impose an obligation on a State Party either to accept or act on the views of 
  the Committee or to accede to a request for interim measures pending the Committee’s 
  consideration of a matter submitted to it.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is a well-established rule that international 
  treaties and conventions must be enacted by legislation in order to be binding 
  and enforceable by domestic courts within Canada. Therefore, although Canada 
  has ratified and acceded to the <i>Covenant</i> and <i>Protocol</i> respectively, 
  because it has not enacted legislation implementing them as part of our law, 
  they are not part of the law of Canada and are not binding in Canada: <i>Baker 
  v. Canada</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at 861; <i>Suresh v. Canada</i>, 2002 SCC

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The basis for the argument that nevertheless, 
  constitutional rights have somehow been created by Canada’s ratification and 
  accession to these international conventions flows from a recent line of cases 
  from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, beginning with <i>Thomas v. 
  Baptiste, </i>[2000] 2 A.C. 1. That case was decided by the Privy Council on 
  appeal from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago 
  had ratified the <i>Covenant</i> and acceded to the <i>Protocol</i>. Trinidad 
  and Tobago had also ratified the <i>American Convention on Human Rights 1969</i>, 
  which established the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American 
  Court of Human Rights. By ratifying the <i>Convention</i>, the state recognized 
  the Inter-American Commission’s competence to entertain petitions from individuals 
  claiming violations of the <i>American Convention</i> and to make reports and 
  recommendations, and the compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court 
  to give binding rulings on the interpretation and application of the <i>Convention</i>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant Thomas had been convicted of murder 
  and sentenced to death. He lodged a petition with the Inter-American Commission 
  alleging violations of his rights. The Commission had not responded by the time 
  the government’s Advisory Committee on the Power of Pardon met to consider a 
  reprieve. No reprieve was given. The Inter- American Court made an order requiring 
  the government to refrain from carrying out the death sentence pending its determination 
  of the petitions. The government was prepared to defy the order and proceed 
  with the death sentence. The appellant’s motion was for an order that it would 
  be unlawful for the State to carry out his death sentence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The constitution of Trinidad and Tobago contains 
  a “due process of law” clause. The Privy Council held that the clause gives 
  constitutional protection to the concept of procedural fairness and includes 
  “the right of a condemned man to be allowed to complete any appellate or analogous 
  legal process that is capable of resulting in a reduction or commutation of 
  his sentence before the process is rendered nugatory by executive action.” (para. 
  24) The contention of the appellant was that his constitutional right to due 
  process would be infringed if he were executed before the petitions were ruled 
  on and the rulings of the Inter-American Commission and the Inter-American Court 
  considered by the government authorities. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Privy Council recognized that international 
  conventions do not alter domestic law unless incorporated by legislation. However, 
  it held that the appellant was not seeking to enforce a treaty which had not 
  been incorporated into domestic law, but rather the due process clause of the 
  constitution. The Privy Council concluded at paras. 26 and 29:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>By ratifying a treaty which provides for individual access 
      to an international body, the Government made that process for the time 
      being part of the domestic criminal justice system and thereby temporarily 
      at least extended the scope of the due process clause in the Constitution. 
      </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='line-height:normal'>And:    </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The due process clause must therefore be broadly interpreted. 
      It does not guarantee the particular forms of legal procedure existing when 
      the Constitution came into force; the content of the clause is not immutably 
      fixed at that date. But the right to be allowed to complete a current appellate 
      or other legal process without having it rendered nugatory by executive 
      action before it is completed is part of the fundamental concept of due 
      process. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The submission of the appellant in this case 
  is that similarly, by ratifying the <i>Convention</i> and acceding to the <i>Protocol</i>, 
  which provide for individual access to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, 
  Canada has made access to the procedures under the <i>Protocol</i> and the right 
  to complete those procedures before executive action (deportation) makes them 
  nugatory, part of the s. 7 <i>Charter</i> right to fundamental justice. As a 
  result, Canada is obliged under the <i>Charter</i> to accede to the request 
  for interim measures that the appellant not be deported pending the report of 
  the Committee.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dambrot J. rejected the Privy Council’s legal 
  analysis. In his view, it is tantamount to incorporating an international treaty 
  into domestic law without legislation. Dambrot J. may be correct in his rejection 
  of the Privy council’s analysis. However, the fact that there is a line of cases 
  (see <i>Briggs v. Baptiste</i>, [2000] 2 A.C. 40; <i>Higgs v. Minister of National 
  Security</i>, [2000] 2 W.L.R. 1368; and <i>Lewis v. Jamaica (Attorney General)</i>, 
  [2000] 3 W.L.R. 1785) which follows this analysis can certainly be the basis 
  to establish that for the purpose of this motion there is a serious legal issue 
  to be tried.<i></i></span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dambrot J., however, referred to a further reason 
  for rejecting the concept that the procedure of petitioning the Human Rights 
  Committee constitutes part of the <i>Charter </i>right to fundamental justice:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I am grateful not to have to consider this issue in the 
      context of the death penalty, but in my opinion, if there is a right protected 
      by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> not to have the outcome of any pending appellate 
      or other legal process preempted by executive action, it does not extend 
      to an analogous process such as a petition to an international body whose 
      advice is not binding domestically. (para. 21)</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This second issue identified  by Dambrot J. also greatly concerned 
  the Privy Council in <i>Thomas</i>. The Privy Council saw much force in the 
  government’s argument that because it was not bound to take account of the Inter-American 
  Commission’s report when considering a reprieve, there could be no legal right 
  to complete a process which leads only to such a report. However, the Privy 
  Council’s answer was that the Commission could refer the petition to the Inter-American 
  Court which could make binding rulings quashing the conviction or commuting 
  the sentence. That aspect of the process therefore did create a constitutional 
  right to due process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the concerns expressed by Dambrot J. and by the 
  Privy Council as to how one can have a constitutional right to complete a process 
  which does not provide for an enforceable remedy. Ms. Jackman submitted to the 
  court that Canada has a record of complying with reports from the Committee 
  if the process is completed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> Therefore although there is no enforceable remedy, one can be 
  confident that Canada will accord a remedy voluntarily. Even if this is so, 
  it is difficult to formulate an analysis which leads to the conclusion that 
  Canada has created a constitutional right to a process which will result only 
  in a purely voluntary remedy. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Jackman also concedes that Canada sometimes 
  accedes to the interim measures requests and sometimes it does not. As Dambrot 
  J. found, there can be no legitimate expectation based on Canada’s record, that 
  there would be no deportation pending consideration of a petition by the Committee. 
  This is also evidence that Canada did not ratify the <i>Covenant</i> and accede 
  to the <i>Protocol</i> with the understanding that it was thereby creating any 
  binding procedural processes associated with those instruments.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION ON THE “SERIOUS QUESTION 
  TO BE TRIED” TEST</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On this motion, my role is not to finally decide 
  the merits of the legal issue, but only whether there is a serious issue to 
  be tried on the appeal. In <i>RJR Macdonald</i>, the </span><span lang=EN-US>Supreme 
  Court set a fairly low threshold for this test on a <i>Charter</i> claim. The 
  court stated at p. 337:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span>            </span>What then are the indicators of “a serious question 
      to be tried”? There are no specific requirements which must be met in order 
      to satisfy this test. The threshold is a low one. The judge on the application 
      must make a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. The decision 
      of a lower court judge on the merits of the <i>Charter</i> claim is a relevant 
      but not necessarily conclusive indication that the issues raised in an appeal 
      are serious: see <i>Metropolitan Stores, supra,</i> at p. 150. Similarly, 
      a decision by an appellate court to grant leave on the merits indicates 
      that serious questions are raised, but a refusal of leave in a case which 
      raises the same issues cannot automatically be taken as an indication of 
      the lack of strength of the merits.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>Once satisfied that the application is neither 
      vexatious nor frivolous, the motions judge should proceed to consider the 
      second and third tests, even if of the opinion that the plaintiff is unlikely 
      to succeed at trial. A prolonged examination of the merits is generally 
      neither necessary nor desirable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25] <span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span>The appellant raises an issue based on 
  a line of cases from the Privy Council. It is questionable whether the principle, 
  even if it is correct or applicable and acceptable in the Canadian context, 
  extends to a situation such as the one before this court given that the so-called 
  appeal process before the Human Rights Committee can lead only to a non-binding 
  report to the government of Canada. However, I would not say, based on the materials 
  placed before the court on the motion, that the application is frivolous or 
  vexatious. <br>
  <br>
  [26]<span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span> Counsel for the respondent also suggested 
  that the application amounts to a collateral attack on the recent decision of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada. This appearance is created because of the clear 
  overlap of the rights protected by the U.N. Covenant ratified by Canada and 
  the rights enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the fact that 
  the Supreme Court has ruled that the appellant has received the benefit of those 
  rights. However, the application relates at this stage not to the underlying 
  substantive rights, but to a procedure provided in the U.N. Protocol, which 
  procedure could only be invoked after the appellant had exhausted his rights 
  in the domestic courts. It is the status and extent of entitlement to the U.N. 
  procedure that is the issue raised in the application.<br>
  <br>
  [27] <span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span>Without commenting on the ultimate success 
  of the appeal, in my view the test of whether there is a serious issue to be 
  tried has been met.</p>
<p><b>BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE AND IRREPARABLE HARM</b><br>
  <br>
  [28] <span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span>I am satisfied that because the appellant 
  will be deported unless this court orders a stay, the balance of convenience 
  favours the appellant. Counsel raised with the court the issue that the appellant 
  remains a danger to Canada even though he is in jail because he (and Mr. Suresh) 
  made phone calls out of the country from jail. I assume that if these calls 
  were improper, measures have now been taken to ensure that no further calls 
  will be made. The appellant has been in custody in Canada for over 8 years and 
  will remain in custody. Both counsel have agreed to be ready to argue the appeal 
  within the next two weeks, and the court will make arrangements to accommodate 
  a hearing within that time frame. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that 
  the balance of convenience favours the appellant.</p>
<p>[29]<span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span> With respect to irreparable harm, the 
  appellant says he fears torture and, his counsel says, even execution if he 
  is deported. The decision of the Supreme Court confirms findings made in this 
  country that his risk of being subjected to torture in Iran is minimal. I do 
  not deal with irreparable harm on the basis of that issue. <br>
  <br>
  [30]<span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span> The issue is whether the appellant will 
  suffer irreparable harm if he is deported before his appeal is heard by this 
  court. Since the remedy sought by this proceeding is an injunction preventing 
  the appellant from being deported pending receipt by the government of the report 
  from the Human Rights Committee, his immediate deportation will in effect end 
  this proceeding. In that sense, he will suffer irreparable consequences if he 
  is deported.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>[31] <span
lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US></span>The appellant has met the three branches 
  of the test for a stay of his deportation pending appeal. I am also satisfied 
  that for the purposes of s. 134(2) of the Courts of Justice Act, it is appropriate 
  to grant the stay as otherwise the appellant will suffer prejudice pending the 
  hearing of the appeal. An order will therefore issue that the effect of the 
  deportation order against the appellant is stayed pending the appeal of this 
  matter to a panel of this court, which appeal is to be expedited and heard during 
  the week of January 28, 2002. Counsel are requested to make arrangements to 
  meet with me in order to fix a timetable for the exchange and delivery of materials 
  for the appeal.<br>
