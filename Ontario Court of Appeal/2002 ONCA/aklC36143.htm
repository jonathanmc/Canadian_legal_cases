<p><b>On appeal from the conviction on December 15, 2000, imposed by Justice Lynn

  D. Ratushny on January 22, 2001.</b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>This was a very brief trial and a factual scenario 
  that would be very easy for the jury to understand. In these circumstances a 
  brief charge was appropriate and the failure of defence counsel to make any 
  objections is of very real significance on appeal. We are satisfied that the 
  sundry bits of evidence of post event conduct would simply be applied by the 
  jury as parts of the entire body of evidence. Defence counsel was also apparently 
  satisfied. It was perhaps a benefit to the defence to avoid a recitation by 
  the trial judge of the alternative misdeeds the accused may have been pursuing 
  if, as contended for, he had explained to the jury the appropriate use of evidence 
  of post-event conduct. Similarly, the evidence of the expert was straightforward 
  in describing the drug associated with amnesia. Linking the drug to sexual assault 
  experiences, while technically inappropriate, is really saying no more than 
  a jury would naturally infer from the facts of this case; that is, the association 
  between the use of a drug known to cause unconsciousness and amnesia and the 
  alleged assault.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We see no merit in the other matters raised 
  by counsel and the appeal is dismissed. The appeal against sentence was essentially 
  based on the dismissal of one or more of the charges on the appeal. In the event, 
  leave to appeal sentence is denied.</span></p>
