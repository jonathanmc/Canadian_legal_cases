style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On December 7, 1999, the appellant appeared in Youth Court for trial 
  on an information charging him with sexual assault, touching for a sexual purpose, 
  and inviting a person under 14 years of age to touch him for a sexual purpose. 
  All three counts arose from a single encounter with the complainant, S.C., on 
  January 27, 1999.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was found guilty on all counts. Counts two and three were 
  stayed pursuant to the rule in <i>Kienapple</i>. On February 9, 2000 the appellant 
  was ordered to serve three months in secure custody followed by a 20-month period 
  of probation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals against both conviction and disposition. For the 
  reasons that follow, I would dismiss his appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The charges relate to an allegation that the appellant fondled the complainant 
  after school in a neighbour’s garage. The complainant was 13 years old at the 
  time. She gave evidence that for a period of time during the preceding summer 
  she and the appellant had been seeing each other, although they were not girlfriend 
  and boyfriend. In his evidence the appellant acknowledged having kissed the 
  complainant but maintained that he had done so at her invitation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant challenges his conviction on two bases. First, he says 
  that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in three ways. Second, he seeks 
  to tender fresh evidence of what he says is a prior inconsistent statement made 
  by the complainant. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In arguing misapprehension of the evidence, the appellant says that 
  the trial judge erred in treating the appellant’s acknowledgement that he was 
  wearing boxer shorts on January 27, 1999 as confirming the complainant’s evidence. 
  I disagree. The complainant testified that during the encounter the appellant 
  pulled down his pants and boxer shorts. It was January and the appellant testified 
  that he was wearing a winter coat. In these circumstances, it was quite open 
  to the trial judge to conclude that the fact that the appellant was indeed wearing 
  boxer shorts that day strengthened his belief that the complainant was telling 
  the truth. This conclusion is not undermined by the fact that the appellant 
  and the complainant had had a prior relationship. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Then the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  the evidence of the appellant’s mother was of no help since it related to matters 
  extraneous to those he had to decide. The appellant says that her evidence supported 
  the conclusion that the complainant had falsely accused the appellant of theft 
  of money from the complainant’s home the previous summer. I do not agree. The 
  mother’s testimony was that the complainant had confirmed to her that the complainant 
  had accused the appellant of stealing money. At trial, the complainant maintained 
  in her own testimony that the appellant had done so, something which the appellant 
  denied. The mother’s evidence did not support the conclusion that the complainant’s 
  accusation was false and did not detract from the complainant’s evidence. The 
  trial judge did not err in saying that he found it unhelpful in resolving the 
  essential issue of credibility between the complainant and the appellant. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the appellant says that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  the complainant’s discipline problems at home played no role in the case before 
  him. Again I disagree. The complainant’s problems at home could not be said 
  to provide her with any motive to report a fabricated complaint. To the contrary, 
  by reporting as she did, the complainant revealed that she had voluntarily gone 
  to the neighbour’s house when according to family rules she was supposed to 
  be at home.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I therefore find no merit in the appellant’s assertion that the trial 
  judge misapprehended the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fresh evidence that the appellant seeks to introduce in this court 
  is of J.R., a friend of the complainant. That evidence is that after hearing 
  a rumour that the appellant had raped the complainant, J.R. telephoned the complainant 
  to ask her about it and was told that it hadn’t happened. J.R. understood this 
  to mean only that the appellant had not raped the complainant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the proposed fresh evidence does not meet the test in <i>R. 
  v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. In particular, even if believed, this evidence 
  could not be expected to have affected the result. At trial, the complainant 
  did not claim that the appellant had raped her. The sexual assault she described 
  did not involve sexual intercourse at all. Evidence of the complainant’s prior 
  denial of rape would not have affected the outcome. Thus, this ground of appeal 
  also fails.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As to the disposition made by the trial judge, the appellant challenges 
  the custodial sentence in particular. In my view, it reflects no error in principle 
  and is not unfit. The trial judge took account of the appellant’s age, his potential 
  for rehabilitation, and the absence of a prior record. Particularly in light 
  of the appellant’s persistence in pursuing the attack in an open garage, exposed 
  to the public, the coercion he used on the complainant, his taunting of her 
  after the fact and the great harm the event has inflicted on her life, it was 
  open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant posed a sufficient danger 
  that deterrence and denunciation required a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Therefore I would dismiss the appeal from conviction. I would give leave 
  to appeal from disposition but would dismiss that appeal as well.</p>
