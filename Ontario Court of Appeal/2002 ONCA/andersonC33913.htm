<p>On appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice J. Bryan Shaughnessy, sitting 
  with a jury, on February 23, 2000.</p>
<p><b>CRONK J.A.:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Two issues arise on this appeal: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> whether 
      the admission into evidence of personal journals made by the respondent 
      prior to his detention or arrest, as part of the Crown’s case-in-chief, 
      would offend the right to remain silent, the principle against self-incrimination, 
      and the right to a fair trial contrary to ss. 7, 11(c) and 11(d) of the 
      <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>; and </p>
    <p> (2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> whether 
      the Crown’s decision not to call evidence subsequent to the exclusion of 
      the journals, resulting in the respondent’s acquittal on all charges, precludes 
      a new trial on the basis of abuse of process.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the result of a <i>Charter </i>application by the respondent at trial, 
  the trial judge directed that the respondent’s journals be excluded from evidence 
  as part of the Crown’s case-in-chief on the basis that their admission would 
  offend ss. 7, 11(c) and 11(d) of the <i>Charter.</i>  He further held that the 
  Crown could use the journals to cross-examine the respondent if he chose to 
  testify at the trial.  In consequence of the trial judge’s ruling, Crown counsel 
  elected to call no evidence at the trial.  This led to the respondent’s acquittal 
  on multiple charges under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Crown appeals that 
  decision, and seeks an order setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new 
  trial.</p>
<h4>A.            HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In August of 1996, the respondent was charged with sexual assault causing 
  bodily harm, forcible confinement, assault with a weapon, possession of a weapon 
  dangerous to the public peace and two counts of threatening death, contrary 
  to the <i> Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent appeared before the Ontario Court of Justice (General 
  Division) in Whitby, Ontario in mid-January 1997, on an indictment including 
  the six counts comprising the charges in this case.  After numerous court appearances, 
  jury selection commenced on February 22, 1999.  The jury did not hear evidence, 
  an adjournment was granted and, for reasons not apparent on the record before 
  this court, the jury was dismissed on March 1, 1999.  On March 8, 1999, a second 
  trial commenced and some evidence was called before a new jury.  For reasons 
  also not apparent on the record before this court, the second trial ended in 
  a mistrial on March 12, 1999, when the complainant was under cross-examination.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown gave no indication to the respondent in either of the first 
  two trials that it intended to introduce his journals as part of the Crown’s 
  case-in-chief, or that it regarded the journals as critical to its case against 
  the respondent.  Prior to commencement of the first trial, however, Crown counsel 
  had reserved its right to use the journals to cross-examine the respondent, 
  if he chose to testify.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following the mistrial in the second trial, a further pre-trial was 
  proposed.  By letter dated March 14, 1999, Crown counsel informed the respondent’s 
  trial counsel of the Crown’s willingness to participate in the suggested pre-trial 
  and stated that if the case was not resolved through the pre-trial, the Crown 
  might rely on the journals as part of its case at trial.  When no resolution 
  was achieved following a pre-trial held on April 1, 1999, a third trial commenced 
  before Justice Shaughnessy on February 21, 2000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> No communication between counsel regarding the journals occurred between 
  April 1, 1999 and February 21, 2000.  At the outset of the third trial, Crown 
  counsel indicated his intention to refer to the journals during his opening 
  address to the jury and to use the journals as part of the Crown’s case-in-chief.  
  This led to the ruling by the trial judge that the journals were inadmissible 
  as part of the Crown’s case-in-chief.  As described above, acquittals on all 
  counts followed.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.        THE JOURNALS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent was arrested when the police came to his home to execute 
  a search warrant.  The journals were seized shortly thereafter, pursuant to 
  the search warrant.  The journals cover a period of several years, encompassing 
  the time frame relating to the charges against the respondent.  They comprise 
  approximately 500 to 1,000 pages of handwritten notes in various notebooks.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The parties agree that the respondent’s journal entries at issue contain 
  both exculpatory and inculpatory statements.  At least in part, therefore, they 
  are self-incriminatory in nature.  At trial, in expressing his reasons for deciding 
  not to call any evidence in the case, Crown counsel (not Crown counsel on this 
  appeal) stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Having carefully considered the evidence which does exist and granted 
      there is still some evidence remaining, the Crown is still of the view that 
      those journals were essential to the Crown’s case.  That the case as it 
      now stands would not be such as to require [the respondent] to ever testify, 
      the journals are not – would not be of any use to the Crown.  Another way 
      to put it is that the evidence would not meet minimal standard. (sic).  
      As a result then the Crown will not be calling any evidence in this trial.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While in the past the Crown had considered conducting this trial without 
      relying on these journals, clearly the complainant’s response in cross-examination 
      and the complainant’s current demeanour now force the Crown -- I shouldn’t 
      say force, but now put the Crown in a position where the defence, it would 
      be extremely unlikely that there would be any defence called and in the 
      public interest both considering the time the jury would spend here, the 
      time [the] court would spend in session dealing with this case, and more 
      importantly in the eyes of the Crown, the time the complainant would have 
      to go through another rigorous intrusive cross-examination with regard to 
      the most intimate details of her life in a situation where essential evidence 
      is not available to the Crown is simply not fair to that complainant.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>C.            EXCLUSION OF THE JOURNALS FROM THE CROWN’S 
  CASE-IN-CHIEF</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent’s journals were generated prior to any police investigation, 
  detention or arrest.  He does not contest that the statements made in the journals 
  are voluntary and the issue of voluntariness is not raised on this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Similarly, the respondent does not challenge the validity of the search 
  warrant used to effect seizure of the journals, or the manner of its execution, 
  and no breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter </i>is alleged.  The issue of whether 
  a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches to the journals, and any consequences 
  thereof, was not argued by the respondent at the third trial or on this appeal.  
  Crown counsel submits, rightly in my view, that had the respondent sought to 
  have the journals excluded from evidence on the basis of an asserted privacy 
  interest protected under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, the resulting record in 
  this case may well have been different.  At a minimum, had the argument been 
  raised at trial, the trial judge would have been required to address the issue.  
  If a new trial is ordered in this case, as requested by the Crown, any issues 
  concerning the respondent’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> in relation 
  to the journals would remain alive.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this appeal the respondent argues that the use of the journals as 
  proposed by the Crown would violate his right to silence under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  and the principle against self-incrimination embodied within ss. 7 and 11(c) 
  of the <i>Charter</i>.  He further argues that the underlying purpose of the 
  Crown’s suggested use of the journals is to compel him to testify at trial and, 
  consequently, the admission of the journals would undermine the right to a fair 
  trial protected under s.&nbsp;11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Sections 7, 11(c) and (d) of the <i>Charter</i> provide:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>7.  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person 
      and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles 
      of fundamental justice.</p>
    <p>11. Any person charged with an offence has the right</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>(c) not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person 
      in respect of the offence;</p>
    <p>(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair 
      and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is undisputed that a principle against self-incrimination exists 
  in Canadian law and is embodied in s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>as a principle 
  of fundamental justice.   It has been described as an overarching or core principle 
  within the Canadian justice system from which various common law and <i>Charter 
  </i>rules emanate (<i>R. v. White</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.), 
  at 274-275, per Iacobucci J.).<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>   The principle 
  is “closely concerned with the right to silence of a person in jeopardy in the 
  criminal process”, a right also protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>(<i>R. 
  v. Hebert</i> (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), at 33, per McLachlin J. (as 
  she then was)).  More particularly, at 34</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… the measure of the right to silence may be postulated to reside in the 
      notion that a person whose liberty is placed in jeopardy by the criminal 
      process cannot be required to give evidence against himself or herself, 
      but rather has the right to choose whether to speak or to remain silent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Residual protections against self-incrimination are afforded through 
  s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  These residual protections are both specific and 
  “contextually sensitive” (<i>White</i>, at 276, per Iacobucci J.).  In other 
  words, “the parameters of the right to liberty can be affected by the context 
  in which the right is asserted” (<i>White</i>, at 275-276, per Iacobucci J., 
  referring to <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, at 257, per Lamer C.J.).  
  Further, the principle against self-incrimination is not absolute.  It may “mean 
  different things, at different times, in different contexts” (<i>R. v. R.J.S.</i>, 
  [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, at paras. 104 and 107, per Iacobucci J., writing for four 
  justices).  This requires a contextual analysis of the circumstances in each 
  case where the principle is invoked, to determine on the facts whether the principle 
  is actually engaged (<i>White, </i>at 276, per Iacobucci J. and <i>R. v. Fitzpatrick</i>, 
  [1995] 4 S.C.R. 154, at para. 25, per La&nbsp;Forest&nbsp;J.).  In addition, 
  the principle is embodied in several specific procedural protections under the 
  <i>Charter</i>, including the right to non-compellability in s. 11(c).  In <i>White</i>, 
  Iacobucci J., at 274, described the procedural protection afforded by s. 11(c) 
  as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The constitutionally protected right to silence is triggered when an 
  accused in a criminal proceeding is “subject to the coercive powers of the state 
  through his or her detention” (<i>R. v. Broyles</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308 
  (S.C.C.), at 317, per Iacobucci J. for the court; <i>Hebert</i>, at 41, per 
  McLachlin J.), or when an adversarial relationship arises between an individual 
  and the state (<i>R. v. R.J.S., </i>at para. 266, per L’Heureux-Dubé J).  This 
  flows from the purpose of the right to silence which has been described as:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… to limit the use of the coercive power of the state to force an individual 
      to incriminate himself or herself; it is not to prevent individuals from 
      incriminating themselves <i>per se</i>.  Accordingly, if the person to whom 
      the impugned remarks is made is not an agent of the state, there will be 
      no violation of the right to silence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>(<i>Broyles</i>, at 318, per Iacobucci 
  J.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, the journals were created by the respondent prior to any 
  involvement of the state or its agents.  The journals were not made as a result 
  of statutory compulsion or a regulatory scheme to which the respondent was subject 
  (as discussed in <i>White</i> and <i>Fitzpatrick</i>) or after detention or 
  arrest (as discussed in <i>Hebert</i>).  Thus, the statements in the journals 
  were not made as a result of coercion by the state, nor was there an adversarial 
  relationship between the respondent and the state at the time the statements 
  were made.  The context of this case, therefore, is distinct from that at issue 
  in <i>White</i>, <i>Fitzpatrick</i> and <i>Hebert</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The statements contained in the journals were not elicited by the authorities; 
  rather, they are writings lawfully seized by the authorities.  The issue, then, 
  is whether the use of the journals at trial during the Crown’s case-in-chief 
  would offend the principle against self-incrimination and the right to silence.  
  The trial judge found that it would, by rendering it more likely, or even probable, 
  that such use of the journals by the Crown would compel the respondent to testify 
  to explain the statements in the journals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, I do not agree.  As stated by Crown counsel in his written 
  submissions on this appeal:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… this ruling confuses the principle of non-compellability with the legitimate 
      tactical decision by an accused as to whether to testify.  Other types of 
      evidence such as out of court statements to witnesses, voluntary confessions 
      to police or physical evidence also put the accused in the position of deciding 
      how to explain or refute the evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fact that the Crown’s case against the respondent might be stronger 
  after admission into evidence of extracts from the journals does not create 
  a legal compulsion to testify contrary to s. 11 of the <i>Charter</i>.  If the 
  respondent chooses to testify, he does so on a tactical basis flowing from his 
  assessment of the overall strength of the Crown’s case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>R. v. Darrach</i> (2000), 191 D.L.R. (4th) 539 (S.C.C.) confirmed 
  that the tactical obligation to testify felt by an accused does not constitute 
  a legal obligation or compulsion to testify (see also <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 
  30 O.A.C. 184, at 198). In <i>Darrach</i>, Gonthier J. stated, at paras. 48 
  and 49:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The distinction between tactical and legal compulsion is consistent with 
      the definition of a compellable witness as “one who may be forced by means 
      of a subpoena to give evidence in court under the threat of contempt proceedings” 
      (J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and A.W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> 
      (2nd ed. 1999), at para. 13.46. …</p>
    <p>… Coercion to testify violates the principle against self-incrimination, 
      but as Lamer C.J. defined it, “[c]oercion … means the denial of free and 
      informed consent” (<i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229 at p. 249, 89 
      C.C.C. (3d) 353, 114 D.L.R. (4th) 645, cited in <i>White, supra</i>, at

  </span> The decision whether to testify at trial remains open to the respondent 
  upon completion of the Crown’s case.  Free and informed consent exists if the 
  respondent elects to testify at trial in order to exculpate himself.  As stated 
  by Gonthier J. in <i>Darrach</i>, at paras. 49 and 50, “He knows that he is 
  not required to do so” and, further:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Where there is neither a legal obligation nor an evidentiary burden on 
      the accused, the mere tactical pressure on the accused to participate in 
      the trial does not offend the principle against self-incrimination (s. 11(c)) 
      or the right to a fair trial (s. 11(d)).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If the respondent chooses to testify following the use of his journals 
  by the Crown in its case-in-chief, he does so from his desire to raise a reasonable 
  doubt about the Crown’s case.  This is neither a burden of proof, nor compelled 
  testimony.  It follows, in my view, that none of the right to silence, the related 
  principle against self-incrimination, or the fair hearing guarantees of s. 11(d) 
  of the<i> Charter</i>, operates to prevent admission into evidence of relevant 
  extracts from the respondent’s journals as part of the Crown’s case-in-chief.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This does not mean that the relevancy of the journal extracts is to 
  be presumed.  That is a matter to be determined by the trial judge.  The Crown 
  is not relieved of its burdens to prove all of the elements of each alleged 
  offence and to satisfy the court that the journals are relevant and otherwise 
  admissible.  In consequence, trial fairness is preserved.  A fair trial as protected 
  by s. 11(d) is one “that does justice to all the parties” (<i>Darrach,</i> at 
  para. 70, per Gonthier J.).</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'><b>D.            ABUSE OF PROCESS</b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent also argues that even if the journals were excluded from 
  evidence improperly at trial, the Crown’s subsequent decision not to call any 
  evidence precludes it from seeking a new trial in the circumstances of this 
  case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As conceded by the respondent, the Crown retains a prosecutorial discretion 
  over the conduct of its cases which, absent an abuse of process, attracts a 
  high degree of deference.  As indicated in <i>R. v. Power</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), at 10, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., “… courts should be careful before 
  they attempt to ‘second-guess’ the prosecutor’s motives where he or she makes 
  a decision”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The test to support a stay of criminal proceedings based on abuse of 
  process is an onerous one.  The power to stay such proceedings can only be exercised 
  in the “clearest of cases” or the “most exceptional circumstances” (<i>Power</i>, 
  at 8, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.; <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at paras. 
  10 and 25, per Dickson C.J.); and <i>R. v. Keyowski </i>(1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 
  481 (S.C.C.), at 482, per Wilson J.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Power</i>, L’Heureux-Dubé J. indicated that there must be “overwhelming 
  evidence” that the proceedings at issue are “unfair to the point that they are 
  contrary to the interest of justice” to support a stay on the basis of abuse 
  of process (at 10).  She further stated, at 10:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Where there is conspicuous evidence of improper motives or of bad faith 
      or of an act so wrong that it violates the conscience of the community, 
      such that it would genuinely be unfair and indecent to proceed, then, and 
      only then, should courts intervene to prevent an abuse of process which 
      could bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Cases of this 
      nature will be extremely rare.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In asserting abuse of process the respondent relies on the fact that 
  in the first two trials, the Crown expressed no intention to rely on the journals 
  as part of its case-in-chief.  It follows, it is said, that the journals were 
  not “essential” to the Crown’s case and that this lack of evidentiary value 
  demonstrates an underlying intention by the Crown, in electing not to call any 
  evidence, to circumvent the rule against interlocutory appeals in criminal proceedings 
  by seeking to appeal the trial judge’s adverse evidentiary ruling.  This argument, 
  in my view, cannot succeed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the record before this court, there is no suggestion of any impropriety 
  by the Crown leading to the termination of the first trial and the declaration 
  of a mistrial at the second trial.  While the Crown had not indicated an intention 
  in advance of those trials to seek to rely on the respondent’s journals, apart 
  from their potential use in cross-examination of the respondent should he choose 
  to testify, Crown counsel provided clear advance notice to the respondent of 
  the potential use of the journals by the Crown as part of its case-in-chief 
  at the third trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown is entitled prior to the commencement of any criminal trial 
  to assess the evidence to be relied upon by it during the trial, based on the 
  circumstances then prevailing.  The fact that the Crown found it unnecessary 
  or inadvisable to seek to rely on the journals as part of its case-in-chief 
  during the first two trials, does not mean that the importance of the journals 
  to the Crown’s case remained the same at the commencement of the third trial, 
  or that the Crown was precluded from reassessing their importance at the time 
  of the third trial based on the strength of the available evidence against the 
  respondent and the circumstances which then prevailed.  An assessment of the 
  significance of the journals, or the need for their use, by the Crown in 2000 
  different from the assessments made by the Crown in 1999, does not establish 
  bad faith or improper motive on the part of the Crown.  Moreover, a conclusion 
  by the Crown at the third trial that the case against the respondent would not 
  meet the criminal standard of proof without the use of the journals, is a conclusion 
  which, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, may support the decision 
  not to call any evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the third trial, Crown counsel asserted that the journals were “essential” 
  to the Crown’s case.  On this appeal, as set out in his written submissions, 
  it is Crown counsel’s position that the journals “… potentially corroborate 
  part of the complaint and may have a positive effect on the general credibility 
  of the witness”.  For the reasons set out above, the fact that Crown counsel 
  on this appeal takes a view of the evidentiary significance of the journals 
  different from that taken by the Crown at the third trial does not derogate 
  from the good faith of the Crown, or constitute evidence of improper motive 
  by the Crown, at the time of the third trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Power</i>,<i> </i>the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that 
  an appellate court might find abuse of process in a case where the Crown declines 
  to continue a trial, despite sufficient evidence on which to base a verdict, 
  for the sole purpose of obtaining an interlocutory appeal on an adverse ruling.  
  Although the respondent alleges that this applies to this case, on the record 
  before this court it cannot be concluded that without the use of the journals 
  there was sufficient evidence at the time of the third trial to support a conviction.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, therefore, there is no “conspicuous” or “overwhelming” evidence 
  in this case of improper motive or bad faith by the Crown, or “of an act so 
  wrong that it violates the conscience of the community”, as contemplated in 
  <i>Power</i>, sufficient to establish an abuse of process warranting intervention 
  by this court.  This is not one of those extremely rare cases in which the power 
  to intervene to prevent an abuse of process should be exercised.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As established by the majority decision in <i>Power</i>, absent an abuse 
  of process warranting such intervention, this court has no discretion to refuse 
  to order a new trial on a Crown appeal where a reversible error of law is found 
  in the trial judge’s decision.</p>
<h4>E.            CONCLUSION</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, in my view, the appeal must be allowed.  I would allow 
  the appeal under s. 686(4)(b)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, set aside the 
  acquittals entered by the trial judge, and order a new trial.</p>
