  </span> The statutory and regulatory framework lying behind this appeal is complex 
  but the conflict between the parties can be understood without reference to 
  the legislative details. Pfizer Canada Inc<i>.</i> (Pfizer) sells a drug product 
  called Zoloft licensed by the Minister of Health (Health Canada) for treatment 
  of depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Its patent 
  for the first application, depression, has expired and its patent for the second 
  two uses has some time to run. Apotex Inc. (Apotex) wishes to take advantage 
  of the opening provided by the expired patent and, with that in mind, has developed 
  a generic product called Apo-Sertraline, which, to the satisfaction of Health 
  Canada, is the therapeutic equivalent of Zoloft. Sertraline is one of many drugs 
  that cannot be legally sold without a Notice of Compliance (NOC) from Health 
  Canada. Pfizer holds a NOC for the three above-named applications. Since Health 
  Canada guides itself by existing patents in granting NOCs, the one issued to 
  Apotex was restricted to a single use  the treatment of depression.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moving to the provincial level of control, we find legislation and regulations 
  governing the interchangeability of drugs dispensed in pharmacies. The Ontario 
  Ministry of Health (Health Ontario) issues to pharmacists a Formulary of interchangeable 
  drugs and their prices. The pharmacist must substitute the lowest price interchangeable 
  drug in the Formulary for any other listed drug unless the prescription denotes 
  no substitution. The lowest priced drug also sets the amount of reimbursement 
  to the pharmacist if the drug is dispensed to selected categories of customers 
  such as senior citizens.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex sought provincial approval to including Apo-Sertraline on the 
  Formulary as interchangeable with Zoloft and without reference to limitations 
  on its use. It was placed on the Formulary but with an asterisk limiting its 
  use to treatment for depression. This is apparently the only drug on the Formulary 
  with a limited use designation. This limitation has markedly reduced the expected 
  sales of Apo-Sertraline because prescriptions do not normally contain any indication 
  by the doctor of the diagnosis and pharmacists are left uncertain as to their 
  legal position both in dispensing and obtaining reimbursements. In most cases 
  it is impractical to contact doctors in a timely manner for further information. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is against this backdrop that Apotex applied to the Divisional Court 
  for judicial review, claiming that the Minister and the Lieutenant Governor 
  in Council exceeded their jurisdiction in giving consideration to the use of 
  the drug rather than, as directed by the relevant legislation, to the interchangeability 
  of one product for another.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Pfizer applied for a declaration supporting the validity of the limited 
  designation or, in the alternative, that Apo-Sertraline should not be designated 
  interchangeable for any purpose. The Ontario Pharmacists Association gained 
  intervener status and took a position supporting Apotex. ODriscoll J. heard 
  both applications as a single judge of the Divisional Court dealing with a matter 
  of urgency. For reasons found at (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 166, he 
  determined that the Minister and the Lieutenant Governor in Council acted within 
  their jurisdiction in determining that Apo-Sertraline should be interchangeable 
  with Zoloft only for the treatment of depression. Orders were made on those 
  terms in both applications and Apotex appeals by way of leave granted by this 
  court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are a variety of federal and provincial statutory provisions and 
  regulations that relate to the process of approving of drugs for sale, all of 
  which are referred to in the reasons of ODriscoll J. I shall confine my references 
  to the core provisions bearing directly on the jurisdictional issues raised 
  by the appeals.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Sertraline drugs are among those the sale of which is prohibited under 
  the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F.27. The regulations under that 
  Act permit advertising and sales if, after submission, a NOC is issued. Apo-Sertraline 
  met all the requirements for being deemed interchangeable with Zoloft and received 
  a limited NOC only because the regulations require Health Canada to protect 
  existing patent rights, in this case, Pfizers patents covering use of Zoloft 
  for obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex takes no issue with Health Canadas NOC limiting Apo-Sertraline 
  to sales for use as an anti-depressant. Its argument is with the provincial 
  authorities whose jurisdiction does not extend to protecting patent rights and 
  whose proper concern should be directed to safety and cost saving in the provision 
  of therapeutic drugs. The Apotex argument continues to the effect that its product 
  has been proven to be interchangeable with Zoloft for all purposes and that 
  it has no intention to sell the drug to pharmacies as anything more than an 
  anti-depressant. Patent protection, it is argued, should not be allowed to drive 
  the narrower provincial concern and jurisdiction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span

  </span> The operative provision of the <i>Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing 
  Fee Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.23 (<i>DIDFA</i>) is s. 14(1), which reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>14. (1) The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations,</p>
    <p>(a)             prescribing conditions to be met by products or by manufacturers 
      of products in order to be designated as interchangeable with other products;</p>
    <p>(b)            designating a product as interchangeable with one or more 
      other products where the Lieutenant Governor in Council considers it advisable 
      in the public interest to do so, but a product shall not be designated as 
      interchangeable with another product if,</p>
    <p> (i)            it does not contain a drug or drugs in the same amounts 
      of the same active ingredients in the same dosage form as the other product, 
      or</p>
    <p> (ii)  the product or its manufacturer has not met the conditions described 
      in clause (a);</p>
    <p>(c)            prescribing conditions to be met for a product to continue 
      to be designated as interchangeable;</p>
    <p>(d)            prescribing circumstances in which persons may charge more 
      than their usual and customary dispensing fees.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The regulations passed pursuant to this power include conditions that 
  must be met by an applicant to the Minister for ultimate inclusion in the Formulary. 
  Section 6(1) of Regulation 935 reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>6. (1)            It is a condition for each strength and dosage form of 
      a drug product to be designated as interchangeable with other products that 
      the manufacturer of the drug product submit to the Minister,</p>
    <p>(a)            evidence that Health Canada has approved the product for 
      sale in Canada, a copy of the products drug notification form issued by 
      Health Canada and, subject to subsection (2), a copy of the product monograph 
      approved by Health Canada;</p>
    <p align="center"> </p>
    <p>(d)            the proposed drug benefit price of the product; </p>
    <p>(e)             evidence that the manufacturer is able to supply the product 
      at the proposed drug benefit price in a quantity sufficient to meet the 
      anticipated demand for the product;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Ministry reviews the application and makes a recommendation to the 
  Lieutenant Governor in Council for a regulation designating a product as interchangeable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants argument is that the <i>DIDFA</i> focuses entirely on 
  the interchangeability of equivalent products, and it is an excess of jurisdiction 
  to restrict the designation by reference to use. It is said that the province 
  is enforcing Health Canada and Patent regulations under the guise of administering 
  a statute devoted to containing the cost of drug products. Other arguments were 
  put as to fairness, arbitrariness, and consideration of irrelevant matters, 
  but they all come back to whether there was jurisdiction to limit the designation 
  to accord with the federal NOC.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with ODriscoll J. that there was clear jurisdiction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The condition set out in s. 6(1)(a) of the regulation provides that 
  the product must be approved for sale in Canada. Apo-Sertraline started off 
  as a drug which, without approval, it would have been illegal to offer for sale 
  in Canada. NOC gave it no more than legality for sale for a single use  depression. 
  It is not a question of enforcing patents. Nor is it a question of equivalence 
  for therapeutic use for three disorders. If this drug is sold to treat obsessive-complusive 
  disorder or panic disorder it is an illegal sale and a breach of the federal 
  <i>Food and Drug Act. </i>In my view it falls well within the purpose and ambit 
  of the <i>DIDFA</i> to assure that the Formulary for interchangeable drugs lists 
  only those drugs that are legal to sell and identifies those drugs that are 
  of limited legality. The appellant did not seek to strike down the condition 
  found in s. 6(1)(a) and simply argued that its product was approved for sale 
  by Health Canada and thus met the terms of the condition. I cannot accept that 
  narrow and overly literal reading of the condition. Health Canadas NOC is the 
  indicator of legality for sale in s. 6(1)(a), and it makes no sense to read 
  the condition as compelling the Minister to ignore a limiting feature to legality 
  for sale.</p>

  </span> ODriscoll J. also relied on condition 6(1)(d-1) [now 6(1)(d) and (e)] 
  to support his conclusions. I do not find it necessary to go beyond condition 
  6(1)(a). ODriscoll J. applied a test of reasonableness to his review of the 
  acts of the Minister and Lieutenant Governor in Council. In my view it is not 
  necessary to debate that issue. On a standard of correctness there is sufficient 
  authority under the statute and regulations to justify the change to the Formulary 
  and the indication of limitation of uses.</p>

  </span> The present legislative format is not satisfactory; pharmacists are 
  uncertain and at risk of selling an illegal drug. Further, the existing situation 
  deprives patients of the lower cost generic if pharmacists hold back because 
  of uncertainty. The province loses money if senior citizens and others entitled 
  to drug benefits receive the higher cost drug, and the pharmacist is reimbursed 
  on that basis. The problem may be isolated but is not small. Evidence before 
  the court suggests $22 million annual sales of these drugs and that 88% is for 
  treatment of depression. A solution should be found but this court cannot provide 
  it. </p>

  to be paid by Apotex. Under the new rules, effective January 1, 2002, this court 
  must fix the costs. The respondents shall submit bills of costs on the partial 
  indemnity scale, citing hours of preparation and other information provided 
  in the rules, and the appellant shall have 7 days to respond thereto.</p>
