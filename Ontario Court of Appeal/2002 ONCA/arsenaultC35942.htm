  </span></span> The issue in this appeal is whether a claim for bad faith damages 
  arising out of an insurer’s termination of no-fault accident benefits is subject 
  to the two-year limitation period set out in s. 281(5) of the <i>Insurance Act, 
  </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended.<a href="#_ftn1"

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Evelyn Arsenault, was injured 
  in a motor vehicle accident on May&nbsp;1, 1993. She was 54 years old at the 
  time of the accident, and had been employed as a receptionist/secretary at a 
  medical centre.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The insurer responsible for the payment of her statutory accident 
  benefits was Dumfries Mutual Insurance Company. Pursuant to its obligations 
  as set out in the <i>Statutory Benefits Schedule - Accidents Before January 
  1, 1994</i>,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> 
  the insurer paid weekly benefits of $405.52 to Ms. Arsenault until September 
  30, 1995.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Early in 1994, Ms. Arsenault’s family doctor suggested that she 
  could probably work part-time by the end of February, 1994. On her return from 
  a two-week holiday in Florida, Ms. Arsenault informed her rehabilitation counsellor 
  that her condition had deteriorated due to depression.  Consequently, the insurer 
  arranged for a medical assessment in April, 1994, the result of which was a 
  diagnosis that maximum medical recovery – and a return to part-time employment 
  – would be possible with the assistance of anti-depressant medication and, if 
  desired, psychiatric assistance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, arrangements were made for Ms. Arsenault to begin 
  working two hours daily with her former employer starting June 21, 1994.  Since 
  the employer had already hired another employee to do Ms. Arsenault’s job, the 
  insurer agreed that there would be no cost to the employer and that it would 
  continue paying weekly income benefits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>By August 16, 1994, Ms. Arsenault was working 
  five days a week for five hours daily. Her family doctor referred her for psychological 
  counselling and advised her to decrease her hours and days of work.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>By the time she left for a 3-4 week holiday 
  in Florida in January, 1995, Ms.&nbsp;Arsenault was working four hours daily 
  for two days a week. Both her family doctor and the insurer’s doctor recommended 
  on her return from Florida that she expand her work schedule. Ms. Arsenault 
  agreed to these recommendations, along with a referral to a psychiatrist, in 
  April, 1995.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>By mid-May, however, Ms. Arsenault was not complying 
  with either the proposed home-based exercise program or the graduated return-to-work 
  schedule. A new rehabilitation plan was therefore entered into in June, 1995. 
  This amended plan too was not followed by Ms. Arsenault. Another doctor, arranged 
  by the insurer, diagnosed Ms.&nbsp;Arsenault on August 31, 1995 as suffering 
  from chronic pain syndrome and depression, but agreed with all the other medical 
  assessments that she was able to return to work. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The insurer notified Ms. Arsenault on September 
  8, 1995 that her weekly benefits would be discontinued. Around September 30, 
  1995, the payment of these benefits was terminated.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In June 1996, Ms. Arsenault applied for mediation under s. 280 
  of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, disputing the termination of her weekly benefits. 
  The mediation, conducted between August 12 and September 19, 1996, was unsuccessful.  
  Ms. Arsenault took no further legal steps until she commenced an action on June 
  13, 2000, claiming damages for the insurer’s “bad faith” conduct in prematurely 
  terminating her weekly benefits.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After all the pleadings had been filed, the 
  insurer brought a motion under Rule 21.01(1)(a) for a determination of the following 
  question of law raised in the Statement of Defence and for an order striking 
  all paragraphs of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim referable to the claim 
  for bad faith damages on the ground that the claim was statute-barred by s.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On February 14, 2001, Justice B. Wright granted 
  the relief requested. For the following reasons, I agree with his order.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The dispute resolution scheme in the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i> is found in ss. 279 - 283. Section 279(1) states that any disputes in 
  respect of any insured person’s entitlement to, or amount of, no-fault benefits 
  are to be resolved in accordance with ss. 280 to 283. Section 280(1) provides 
  that either the insured or the insurer may refer any such dispute to a mediator. 
  If, and only if, mediation is unsuccessful, ss. 281(1) and (2) permit the insured 
  either to bring a proceeding in court or to refer the mater to arbitration. 
  Under s.&nbsp;281(5), court or arbitration proceedings must be brought within 
  two years of the insurer’s refusal to pay the benefit claimed.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the insurer terminated the weekly benefits on September 
  30, 1995. A plain reading of s. 281(5) yields the conclusion that court proceedings 
  should have been commenced within two years of this triggering event.  Ms.&nbsp;Arsenault, 
  however, did not start her action until almost five years had elapsed since 
  the insurer’s refusal to continue paying benefits. She argues that this court’s 
  decision in <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Company</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 641 
  (C.A.)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> entitles 
  her to bring a separate action for damages resulting from the insurer’s bad 
  faith conduct, and that the limitation period for this cause of action is six 
  years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 279(1) is a mandatory provision for the resolution of 
  disputes “<i>in respect of </i>any insured person’s entitlement to no-fault 
  benefits or<i> in respect of </i>the amount of no- fault benefits to which an 
  insured person is entitled”.  [Emphasis added.]  There is no option for an insured 
  but to proceed in accordance with the scheme outlined in ss. 280 to 283 if the 
  dispute is in respect of entitlement issues.   Section 281(5) states that a 
  proceeding in a court or an arbitration “<i>in respect of </i>no-fault benefits” 
  must be commenced within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the benefits 
  claimed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Nowegijick v. The Queen et al.</i> (1983), 
  144 D.L.R. (3d) 193 at 200 (S.C.C.), Dickson J. attributed the “widest possible 
  scope” to the words “in respect of”:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The phrase “in respect of” is probably the widest of any 
      expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although Justice Dickson was dealing with language in the <i>Income 
  Tax Act</i>, in my view, his observation is generic and equally applicable to 
  the relevant <i>Insurance Act</i> provisions in this case.    That means that 
  any and all disputes about an insurer’s refusal to pay no-fault benefits, including 
  disputes which allege the insurer’s bad faith in connection with that refusal, 
  must be brought within two years of the refusal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that 
  there can be an independent claim for bad faith conduct in respect of the insurer’s 
  refusal to pay or continue to pay no-fault benefits. In order to establish such 
  a claim, the appellant would first have to establish that the insurer’s termination 
  of her benefits was improper. Such a claim must comply with the requirements 
  outlined in ss. 280-283 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, one of which is the two 
  year limitation period for the institution of proceedings to determine this 
  question. The appellant cannot, by the device of a claim for bad faith damages, 
  extend threefold the length of that termination period.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If I am wrong in concluding that bad faith claims in connection 
  with no-fault benefits refusals are subject to the procedures and time limits 
  set out in ss. 280 to 283 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, I am nonetheless of the 
  view, based on the pleadings, that this appellant’s claim is not an independent, 
  actionable wrong, but is in fact exactly the kind of dispute over no-fault benefits 
  entitlements contemplated by the dispute resolution scheme in the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i>.  The allegation is that the insurer ought not to have terminated Ms. 
  Arsenault’s benefits when it did.  This is the issue she attempted, unsuccessfully, 
  to resolve through mediation. She then had the choice of either starting a court 
  action or filing an application for the appointment of an arbitrator under s. 
  282 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>. Moreover, had the dispute been arbitrated, 
  it was open to the arbitrator under s. 282(10), if it was found that the insurer 
  had “unreasonably withheld or delayed payments”, to award an additional lump 
  sum.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Rather than proceeding with either court action or arbitration, 
  Ms. Arsenault took no further steps for a number of years.  When she did, she 
  brought an action that was, on its face, clearly “in respect of” the insurer’s 
  refusal of further no-fault benefits.  It was therefore an action that, under 
  s.&nbsp;281(5),<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a> had to be started 
  no later than two years after that refusal. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ms. Arsenault’s characterization of the insurer’s 
  refusal as bad faith conduct is merely an attempt to circumvent the mandatory 
  requirements of the dispute resolution scheme in the <i>Insurance Act</i> through 
  the guise of linguistic reformulation. Her allegations, distilled, are that 
  the refusal was inappropriate in the circumstances, the very </span>issue contemplated 
  for resolution under the scheme, and a  claim that is clearly subject to the 
  two year limitation period set out in s. 281(5).</p>
