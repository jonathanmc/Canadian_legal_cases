    of Justice John H. Brockenshire dated October 11, 2000.</span></b></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This proceeding was certified as a class action on October 26, 1999.  
    The respondent is the representative plaintiff for the class.  Like those 
    he represents, Mr.&nbsp;Authorson is a disabled war veteran whose pension 
    was administered for him by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs (the 
    “DVA”) because he was incapable of doing so himself.  The appellant, the federal 
    Crown, acknowledges that during the years it administered these funds, the 
    DVA neither invested them nor accrued interest on them.  In this action, the 
    respondent seeks a declaration that this shortcoming is a breach of the fiduciary 
    duty owed by the Crown to him and the other members of the class.  Ultimately, 
    the respondent seeks compensation as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This proceeding is being case managed by Brockenshire J. and, by agreement 
    of the parties, has been divided into four parts.  They are: liability during 
    the lives of the veterans; liability to the veterans’ estates and beneficiaries 
    after their deaths; damages assessment regarding live veterans; and damages 
    assessment regarding veterans’ estates and their beneficiaries.  These appeals 
    deal only with the first of those parts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On September 13, 2000, following certification and partial discoveries, 
    Brockenshire J. dismissed the appellant’s challenge to the jurisdiction of 
    the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to entertain this action.  He found 
    nothing in this case that would invoke the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal 
    Court of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant and the respondent then each proceeded with motions 
    for summary judgment dealing with the Crown’s liability to those veterans 
    who are still alive and to deceased veterans up to the date of their deaths.  
    The appellant’s motion sought dismissal of the action.  The respondent’s motion 
    sought summary judgment on a number of specific issues, before proceeding 
    with the remaining questions in the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On October 11, 2000 Brockenshire J. dismissed the appellant’s motion 
    and granted the respondent’s motion.  He issued reasons for judgment (reported 
    at (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 221 (S.C.J.)) declaring at pp. 255-56 that:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>
      <p>(a)       The class members had a property interest in their pensions 
        administered by the DVA; that the Crown was a fiduciary to the class members 
        while their funds were being administered by the DVA; and that the Crown 
        breached its fiduciary duty by failing to invest or pay interest on these 
        funds.</p>
      <p>(b)       Section 9 of the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</i>, 
        R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 is not a bar to this action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1>(c)       Section 5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans 
      Affairs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1 also is not a bar because it is rendered 
      inoperative as against these claims by the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, 
      S.C. 1960, c. 44.</div>
  </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On January 10 and June 29, 2001, Brockenshire J. issued orders fixing 
    the costs of the summary judgment motions. He awarded the respondent costs 
    on a solicitor&#8209;client basis and fixed those costs at $668,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Having obtained leave to appeal the dismissal of its own motion for 
    summary judgment, the appellant appeals from the orders of September 13, and 
    October 11, 2000 and from the orders as to costs.  It argues that Brockenshire 
    J. erred in</p>
</div>

        and Proceedings Act</i>;</p>
      <p>(d)       finding that s. 5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs 
        Act</i> did not bar this action;<i></i></p>

    </span> For the reasons that follow we agree with each of the conclusions 
    reached by Brockenshire J.  We would therefore dismiss these appeals.  Before 
    turning to these issues in turn, it is helpful to provide an outline of the 
    relevant facts.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>THE FACTS</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Since the First World War, the Government of Canada has recognized 
    an obligation to provide pensions and allowances to its war veterans who suffered 
    harm as a consequence of their service to their country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> These pensions and allowances may be described generally as being 
    on account of disability, treatment or indigence.  In some cases, for a variety 
    of reasons, the recipients of these pensions were not capable of administering 
    the funds they received.  To meet this contingency, Parliament enacted legislation 
    and regulations to provide for these funds to be administered on their behalf.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In some cases relatives, friends or the Public Trustee provided the 
    administration.  In others the administration was by the federal government.  
    The issue in these proceedings is whether the federal government is liable 
    to the respondent for its failure to invest or pay interest on the respondent’s 
    money in the government's hands for administration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Over the years, these payments have taken a number of different forms, 
    each one authorized by a particular piece of legislation.  Three of these 
    are at stake in this litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, since 1915, the <i>Pension Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 c. P-6 and 
    its predecessor regulations and legislation (<i>e.g.</i>, Orders in Council 
    P.C. Nos. 289 and 867 (April 29, 1915)) have provided disability pensions 
    to war veterans who were either physically or mentally disabled as a result 
    of service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, since 1918, the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i>, 
    R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1 and its predecessors (<i>e.g.</i>, S.C. 1918, c. 42), 
    and the regulations made thereunder, have provided for monetary allowances 
    to veterans receiving active medical treatment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Third, since 1930, the <i>War Veterans Allowance Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, 
    c. W-3 and its predecessors (<i>e.g.</i>, S.C. 1930, c. 48) have provided 
    income supplements to indigent veterans who served in a theatre of war.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In each case, the governing legislation or regulations established 
    a board or agency to determine the entitlement of a war veteran to a pension 
    or allowance and the quantum of that entitlement.  Typical of these provisions 
    is s. 2 of the <i>Pension Amendment Act</i>, S.C. 1939, c. 32, which was in 
    effect when Mr. Authorson was awarded his disability pension.  That section 
    gave these and a number of related tasks to the Canadian Pension Commission 
    (the “Pension Commission”) using the following language:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>“… the Commission shall have full and unrestricted power 
      and authority and exclusive jurisdiction to deal with and adjudicate upon 
      all matters and questions relating to the award, increase, decrease, suspension 
      or cancellation of any pension under this Act … and effect shall be given 
      by the Department [of Veterans Affairs] and the Comptroller of the Treasury 
      to the decisions of the Commission … .”</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For all three kinds of payments (the disability pension, the treatment 
    allowance and the income supplement) the governing legislation or regulations 
    made provision for the designation of an administrator to manage these funds 
    for a pensioner who was incapable of properly managing them for himself.  
    A typical provision is s. 13 of the <i>Pension Amendment Act</i>, S.C. 1946, 
    c. 62, which was in effect when Mr. Authorson’s disability pension was placed 
    under administration in 1950.  It allowed the Pension Commission to designate 
    itself or the DVA or a private citizen as the administrator.  That section 
    reads as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>When a pensioner appears to be incapable of expending 
      or is not expending the pension in a proper manner or is not maintaining 
      the members of his family to whom he owes the duty of maintenance, or, in 
      the discretion of the Commission, when a retroactive pension is awarded 
      or a pensioner is receiving treatment or care from the Department [of Veterans 
      Affairs], the Commission may direct that the pension be administered for 
      the benefit of the pensioner and/or the members of his family by the Commission 
      or the Department or by some person selected by the Commission.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Thus, where the war veteran was incapable of properly managing his 
    pension or allowance, the responsible board or agency could designate itself 
    or the DVA or a private citizen such as a family member to administer the 
    pension for the benefit of the veteran.  In many cases the designated administrator 
    was the DVA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This class action is brought on behalf of those veterans whose pensions 
    and allowances were administered for them by the DVA because they were incapable 
    of doing it for themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The affidavit material filed by the appellant (particularly the affidavit 
    of Robert Robinson, the DVA’s Director of Financial Policy Planning and Systems) 
    described what would happen in the typical situation where the DVA was named 
    as administrator.  When that happened, the DVA would receive a direction to 
    change the name on future cheques from the pensioner to the name of the newly 
    appointed administrator.  Where the DVA was to be the administrator, the direction 
    would name a position held by a public official within the DVA as the payee 
    and that official would then be responsible for the administration of that 
    pension.  The cheques received by the official would be deposited in an account 
    in the name of the Receiver General at a chartered bank.  The funds thus received 
    would be shown for accounting purposes as being in a special purpose account 
    in the name of the veteran, held within the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The administrator would make payments out of this account as necessary 
    to meet the financial needs of the veteran, most often after seeking permission 
    to do so from the relevant board or agency.  However, where the veteran had 
    few such needs because, for example, he remained in hospital where his needs 
    were largely met, there would be few payments out of the account and it would 
    accumulate to a significant size.  If the veteran recovered to the point of 
    being capable of handling his own money, the funds held to his credit would 
    be turned over to him and future cheques would then be paid directly to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When an incapable veteran acquired funds from some other source such 
    as an inheritance, those “guardianship” funds were often added to this special 
    purpose account and were then administered in the same way.  For example, 
    Order in Council P.C. 2161 (December 18, 1924) provided as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>The Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment [later 
      the DVA] is authorized to receive from any department of the Government 
      of Canada or any Provincial Government, or any person, any properties or 
      monies held or payable on behalf of any persons or any properties or monies 
      held or payable on behalf of the dependents of any such persons, whenever 
      such persons are being or have been cared for under the provisions of the 
      Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment Act, either by medical treatment 
      or training.  Such authority shall extend to any case where the person cared 
      for is on the strength of the Department for medical treatment or training 
      or has died while on the strength of the Department or having completed 
      treatment or training has been discharged therefrom.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=No style='line-height:normal'>By Order in Council P.C. 1198 (July 12, 
    1928) s. 5, this authority was extended to authorize the Department to hold 
    and “dispose of such properties or moneys … as may be deemed expedient” or 
    to “dispose of such properties or moneys to the estate of such person if deceased.”  
    In 1954, the Deputy Minister [of Veterans Affairs] was further explicitly 
    authorized to pay interest on these funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant acknowledges that while the DVA administered these various 
    funds for these war veterans the funds were neither invested nor credited 
    with interest.  It appears that there were some 10,000 of these special purpose 
    accounts being administered by the DVA in the 1970s and 1980s.  This number 
    has now dwindled to some 1,000.  It also appears that a significant percentage 
    of the accounts contain substantial sums, often ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.  
    Figures like these led counsel for the respondent to estimate before Brockenshire

    be in the $1 billion range.</p>

    </span> As we will describe in more detail later in these reasons, Brockenshire 
    J. found that the material before him indicated that from the 1970s onward, 
    group after group of federal bureaucrats looked at the “problem” of non-payment 
    of interest on the funds being administered for veterans by the DVA.  For 
    example, in 1986 the Auditor General reported extensively on the question 
    of “veterans’ trust accounts”, the DVA’s failure to invest or pay interest 
    on them, and the possible exposure to legal action as a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Then in 1990, the appellant decided to commence the payment of interest 
    on the special purpose accounts being administered by the DVA.  It also decided 
    to prohibit any claim for interest on such funds prior to January 1, 1990.  
    The first of these two decisions was effected by the approval of the Minister 
    of Finance, in the form of a letter from the Deputy Minister of Finance, to 
    the Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs, of the payment of interest pursuant 
    to s. 21(2) of the <i>Financial Administration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11.  
    The second decision was effected by the enactment of s. 5.1(4) to the <i>Department 
    of Veterans Affairs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1.  It reads as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><b>(4)       </b>No claim shall be made after this subsection 
      comes into force for or on account of interest on moneys held or administered

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Mr. Authorson’s own experience provides an example of how all this 
    worked out in practice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> He was born in Bancroft, Ontario on April 14, 1914.  He enlisted in 
    the Canadian Armed Forces on September 18, 1939.  While on active military 
    service, he became disabled from combat-related mental illness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> He was initially placed in a mental hospital in England, then in St. 
    Anne’s Hospital in Sainte-Anne de Bellevue, Quebec.  He was subsequently transferred 
    to London Ontario, first to Westminster Hospital, and finally to Victoria 
    Hospital where he remained as a diagnosed schizophrenic.  Medical records 
    indicate that he received a pre-frontal lobotomy while he was under treatment 
    in London.  He never married or had children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In 1944, the Pension Commission determined that though his disability 
    was pre-enlistment, it was aggravated during service in a theatre of actual 
    war.  The extent of his pensionable disability was finally determined following 
    a medical examination in 1950 with the result that he was awarded a full pension.  
    At the same time, the DVA was appointed to administer his pension because 
    he was incapable of doing so himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Over the next 40 years, Mr. Authorson received a regular pension except 
    for the periods of time when he received a treatment allowance while receiving 
    medical treatment.  The DVA held the funds from both sources and administered 
    these funds for him, together with the personal “guardianship” funds that 
    he acquired during that period of time.  From time to time it sought authority 
    from the Pension Commission to release funds for Mr. Authorson’s incidental 
    expenses and his occasional holiday travels.  However, up to 1990 the funds 
    held by the DVA were not invested nor did they accrue interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In 1991, Mr. Authorson’s physician certified to the DVA that Mr. Authorson 
    had become competent to manage his own financial affairs and the administration 
    of his funds was terminated.  The DVA returned to him the principal amount 
    it was holding for him together with an interest payment for 1990. The DVA’s 
    financial statements show that during its administration for Mr. Authorson 
    the DVA accumulated pension and treatment allowance funds in the amount of 
    $117,916 and personal funds in the amount of $166,248.74.  None of these funds 
    was invested or earned interest until January 1, 1990.  Thus Mr. Authorson 
    is representative of the class defined by the certification order in this 
    action, namely those awarded a pension or allowance under any of the three 
    Acts who had their funds administered by the DVA without that administrator 
    either investing those funds or paying interest on them.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The essence of the claim is that this failure is a breach of fiduciary 
    duty by the appellant.  Brockenshire J. determined that this claim succeeds.  
    In this court the appellant mounts various challenges to that determination 
    and to those we now turn.</p>

    to hear this case is not discussed in the motions judge’s reasons because 
    it was dealt with as a preliminary motion to stay.  That motion was heard

    </span> The appellant argues that because the relief sought includes claims 
    for declarations with respect to the DVA, and because the DVA is a “federal 
    board, commission or other tribunal”, the Federal Court (Trial Division) has 
    exclusive jurisdiction to hear the claim by virtue of section 18(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Brockenshire J. dismissed the Crown’s motion for a stay.  In doing 
    so, he held that the action is not one for judicial review of the acts or 
    omissions of the Pension Commission (which was abolished by statute in 1995) 
    or of the DVA.  Rather, he held that the action is a claim for equitable relief 
    as against the Crown itself for breach of its duty, fiduciary or otherwise, 
    to invest the money it was administering for the benefit of disabled veterans 
    or in the alternative, to pay interest on that money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> We agree with that conclusion. The claim does not arise from the acts 
    or omission of any board, commission or other tribunal but from the alleged 
    neglect of the Crown itself.  The claim does not seek administrative law remedies.  
    That being the case, there can be no objection to the claim being heard in 
    the Superior Court of Ontario.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>THE FIDUCIARY DUTY ISSUE</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When the DVA is directed to administer the pension of a veteran who 
    cannot manage his funds for himself, what is the nature of that relationship?  
    Is it, as the appellant argues, a matter of public law that is beyond the 
    scope of private law remedies? Or as the respondent contends, does the administrator 
    owe a fiduciary duty to the veteran?  If the latter, does that fiduciary duty 
    extend to the obligation to invest or accrue interest on the funds being administered?  
    The motions judge addressed the questions by first determining that once a 
    veteran is awarded a pension or an allowance, the resulting payments constitute 
    property in which the veteran has a legal and/or equitable interest.  This 
    is so whether the cheques were issued to the veteran or to the administrator 
    on his behalf.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> He then went on to decide that the principles laid down in <i>Guerin 
    v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335, applied to take this case out of the 
    public law realm of “political trust” and to place a fiduciary duty on the 
    Crown which is required by statute to administer the pension for the benefit 
    of the veteran.  Referring to the relevant statutory language, Brockenshire 
    J. put his conclusion this way, at p. 234: </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>These words themselves create a fiduciary obligation between 
      the administrator and the pensioner and/or his family and dependants.  I 
      have concluded that the veterans were beneficially entitled to the pensions 
      and allowances granted to them.  I therefore find that the Crown, in undertaking 
      to administer those funds on behalf of veterans and their dependants, became 
      at least a fiduciary, subject to the obligations imposed upon individuals 
      in that capacity by the law of equity.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Finally, he concluded that the duty on a fiduciary administering funds 
    for another is no different than the obligation of a trustee in the same circumstances, 
    namely, to invest or accrue interest on those funds.  He found that this obligation 
    is not diminished by the legislation regulating the Consolidated Revenue Fund 
    into which the DVA placed the funds under its administration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Before turning to the appellant’s challenges to these findings we 
    can dispose of two uncontroversial matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, the appellant does not seek to distinguish between the DVA 
    and the Crown.  Nor could it do so.  The DVA is an emanation of the Crown 
    and any fiduciary obligation that rests on it as administrator rests on the 
    Crown of which it is a part.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, the appellant does not seriously contest the finding of Brockenshire 
    J. that the veteran has a property interest in the funds under administration.  
    We agree with this conclusion.  Once the veteran’s entitlement to a pension 
    is determined under the relevant legislation, the payments made to him are 
    his.  If the payment of his pension is made to an administrator to manage 
    for his benefit, the veteran retains at least a beneficial interest in the 
    funds under administration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Certainly the popular understanding of the situation was that pension 
    payments were the property of the veteran.  By way of example, Mr. W.F. Nickle, 
    a Unionist (Government) member of the House of Commons Special Committee that 
    drafted the first <i>Pension Act</i>, said in the House of Commons on June 
    27, 1919, in responding to a statement of Mr. Daniel D. McKenzie, the (Acting) 
    Leader of the Opposition:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>If a man gets his pension it is his property, and we should not follow 
        him and insist upon his going to Sunday School, or take it from him if 
        he gets intoxicated.  </p>

    </span> This popular understanding is echoed in the comments of Mr. Allan 
    Solomon, then chairman of the Pension Commission, before the House of Commons 
    Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs in 1979, during a discussion of the 
    nature of funds under administration:</p>

    which the Crown argues preclude funds under administration from becoming part 
    of the veteran's estate upon his death.  By agreement of the parties, the 
    effect of these so-called “lapsing” provisions is to be adjudicated in due 
    course before Brockenshire J. and we make no comment on this issue.  Suffice

    that pension.  However, that jurisdiction is not without limits. For example, 
    once a capable veteran receives a pension payment, the Commission has nothing 
    to say about how the veteran spends it.  Its jurisdiction under this section 
    is limited to the powers specified in the section.  The issue in this action 
    is not related to the award, increase, decrease, suspension or cancellation 
    of a pension.  Rather, the precise issue is whether, once a pension has been 
    awarded and paid, the DVA as administrator has a fiduciary duty to invest 
    the veteran’s funds, which it is administering for his benefit, or to accrue 
    interest on the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Where a veteran is incapable of managing his pension, the Commission 
    has the additional jurisdiction to direct that the pension be administered 
    for his benefit by the Commission itself, the DVA or some person selected 
    by the Commission.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  Thus, the Commission determines 
    the administrator.  The administrator is then required to deal with the pension 
    for the benefit of the incapable veteran.  Where the DVA or a private citizen 
    is selected, it is they, not the Commission, who must administer the pension 
    and who have the obligation to do so for the benefit of the veteran.  Once 
    a pension is under administration, the legislation does not extend the Commission’s 
    jurisdiction to adjudicating whether or not the administrator has failed in 
    this obligation by, for example, failing to accrue interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Thus, the appellant is correct to say that the governing legislation 
    stakes out an area of exclusive administrative law jurisdiction relating to 
    veterans’ pensions.  It is wrong to say that that area extends to the question 
    of whether an appointed administrator has acted improperly in failing to invest 
    or pay interest on the funds it administered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The legislation simply does not immunize the conduct of the administrator 
    which is challenged in this lawsuit to scrutiny by the courts and private 
    law.  The appellant does not appear to contest this conclusion where the administrator 
    is a private citizen and there is no suggestion in the legislation that the 
    result should be any different where the administrator is the DVA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant’s second argument is that if there is a trust here, 
    it is at most a “political trust”, enforceable only in Parliament; it is not 
    a fiduciary obligation enforceable in the courts.  The appellant says that 
    where there is administration by the Crown of funds in the exclusive possession 
    of the Crown, and where the statutory scheme does not explicitly place a fiduciary 
    duty on the Crown, the Crown is subject only to a governmental obligation, 
    enforceable politically, but not a private law obligation enforceable in the 
    courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant relies on two leading English cases which, it argues, 
    compel the result for which it contends. The first is <i>Kinloch v. Secretary 
    of State for India in Council </i>(1882), 7 App.Cas. 619.  In that case the 
    House of Lords determined that a royal warrant that granted booty of war to 
    the Secretary of State for India “in trust” for the officers and men of certain 
    armed forces did not create a trust that was enforceable in the courts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The second case is <i>Tito v. Waddell </i>(No. 2), [1977] 3 All E.R. 
    129 (Ch. D.).  In that case the Banaban Islanders claimed that certain royalties 
    held by the Crown’s representative, the local government commissioner, as 
    a result of mining operations on their land, gave rise to trusts in their 
    favour.  These claims failed because the court found an insufficient relationship 
    between the land on which the mining operations took place and the royalties 
    to yield the conclusion that a true trust of the royalties was intended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In our view, neither of these cases dictates the result contended 
    for by the appellant in this case.  Importantly, unlike this case, in neither 
    case could it be said that the funds held by the Crown were in any sense owned 
    by those claiming that the Crown held the funds in trust for them.  Here, 
    the fact that each veteran had a property interest in the fund being administered 
    on his behalf is a clear indication that this is not a political trust.  By 
    contrast, the “political trust” cases involve not private funds, but public 
    funds or property held by the Crown, whose distribution is found to be the 
    province of the political arena, not the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Nor can these cases be said to require that the express terms of “trust” 
    or “fiduciary” appear in the relevant legislation before such an obligation 
    will be found to bind the Crown.  The seminal case of <i>Guerin</i>, <i>supra</i>, 
    demonstrates as much.  In his famous judgment in that case, Dickson J. (as 
    he then was) found that a fiduciary obligation rested on the Crown although 
    the statutory framework which was in part the source of that obligation, namely 
    the <i>Indian Act</i>, did not explicitly say so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The “political trust” cases do however sound a proper note of caution 
    that should be exercised before a court places a fiduciary obligation on the 
    Crown.  This is so because the Crown has many tasks to perform in the discharge 
    of its legislative, executive, and public administration responsibilities 
    which are governmental functions to be enforced in the political arena rather 
    than encumbered with court-imposed remedies.  Thus, the debate is about the 
    nature of a task given to the Crown by a particular statute. Professors P.W. 
    Hogg and P.J. Monahan, in <i>Liability of the Crown</i>, 3d ed. (Toronto: 
    Carswell, 2000), put it this way at p. 259: </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>What the cases show, however, is that, if the beneficiaries 
      are to avoid the catastrophe of the political trust, the statute will have 
      to provide a fairly clear indication that enforceable private rights are 
      contemplated, as opposed to merely public duties. Short of express language, 
      it is not clear what kind of indication will suffice, but the more specific 
      the descriptions of the Crown’s duties, the affected property and the class 
      of beneficiaries, the more likely it is that a true trust will be found.</div>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In <i>Tito</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 221 the court made the same point 
    by saying that:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>… the determination whether an instrument has created 
      a true trust or a trust in the higher sense [namely a political trust] is 
      a matter of construction, looking at the whole of the instrument in question, 
      its nature and effect, and I think, its context.</div>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In our view, while the “political trust” cases provide some helpful 
    guidance, they do not compel the conclusion that where the Crown administers 
    funds in its possession pursuant to a statutory scheme that does not explicitly 
    place a fiduciary duty on it, it can be sanctioned only in Parliament, but 
    not in the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant’s third argument is that <i>Guerin</i> is distinguishable 
    from this case and should not have been relied on by the motions judge.  The 
    appellant argues that the finding in that case by Dickson J., that the Crown 
    was subject to a fiduciary duty, turned on the special nature of Indian title 
    in land and the <i>sui generis</i> relationship between the Crown and native 
    people.  Without such a relationship, the argument goes, the Crown should 
    not be found to be a fiduciary but rather simply subject to a “political trust”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This argument is central to the reasoning in <i>Callie v. Canada</i>, 
    [1991] 2 F.C. 379, a case similar to this one, in which the Trial Division 
    of the Federal Court held that in <i>Guerin</i> the <i>sui generis</i> aboriginal 
    interest in land, and not the <i>Indian Act</i>, was the sole source of the 
    fiduciary duty, and since the veteran did not have a comparable interest in 
    the funds under administration, the wording of the <i>Pension Act</i> therefore 
    was not itself enough to impose a trust in favour of the veteran whose funds 
    were being administered by the DVA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In our view, this argument miscasts the reasoning of Dickson J. in 
    <i>Guerin</i>.  In relying on this argument to find no fiduciary duty on the 
    Crown we think that the court in <i>Callie</i> was incorrect.  Dickson J. 
    did not find that the sole source of the Crown’s fiduciary obligation is the 
    <i>sui generis</i> aboriginal interest in the land in question. Rather, that 
    fiduciary duty is created by the aboriginal right to the land (undoubtedly 
    a <i>sui generis</i> right), <u>together with</u> the obligations placed on 
    the Crown by the <i>Indian Act</i> in disposing of that land.  It is the combination 
    of the aboriginal interest in the land with the statutory obligations imposed 
    on the Crown in dealing with that interest which render the Crown subject 
    to the fiduciary obligation. Dickson J. put it this way at p. 376 of <i>Guerin, 
    supra</i>:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>In my view, the nature of Indian title and the framework 
      of the statutory scheme established for disposing of Indian land places 
      upon the Crown an equitable obligation, enforceable by the courts, to deal 
      with the land for the benefit of the Indians. This obligation does not amount 
      to a trust in the private law sense.  It is rather a fiduciary duty.  If, 
      however, the Crown breaches this fiduciary duty it will be liable to the 
      Indians in the same way and to the same extent as if such a trust were in 
      effect.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Moreover, there is no suggestion in <i>Guerin</i> that the Crown cannot 
    be a fiduciary. The result of <i>Guerin</i> is to the opposite effect.  At 
    p. 385, Dickson J. said:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>The mere fact, however, that it is the Crown which is 
      obligated to act on the Indians’ behalf does not of itself remove the Crown’s 
      obligation from the scope of the fiduciary principle.</div>
  </blockquote>

<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Nor is there any suggestion that the Crown can be a fiduciary only 
    in the context of the Crown and native people.  Rather, Dickson J. makes clear 
    that it is the nature of the relationship, not the specific category of actor 
    involved, that gives rise to the fiduciary duty.  In the most famous passage 
    in his reasons, he clearly describes the law of fiduciary duty as being of 
    general application, reaching the Crown no less than any other party.  That 
    passage is at p. 384 of the judgment:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>I do agree, however, that where by statute, agreement, 
      or perhaps by unilateral undertaking, one party has an obligation to act 
      for the benefit of another, and that obligation carries with it a discretionary 
      power, the party thus empowered becomes a fiduciary.  Equity will then supervise 
      the relationship by holding him to the fiduciary’s strict standard of conduct.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Over the years since <i>Guerin</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada has 
    significantly developed this area of the law.    As La Forest J. described 
    in <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, that development begins 
    with <i>Guerin</i> and the seminal passage we have just quoted.  This evolution 
    has proceeded with no suggestion that <i>Guerin</i> is to be confined to its 
    facts or to the Crown or to situations of aboriginal title.  Rather, <i>Guerin</i> 
    is treated as the foundation of this line of general jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> As that jurisprudence has developed, the Supreme Court of Canada has 
    added to the factors considered in <i>Guerin</i> as imposing a fiduciary duty, 
    namely, the undertaking of one party to act for the benefit of another and 
    the discretionary power to do so.  For example, in <i>Hodgkinson</i>, La Forest 
    J. refers in addition to whether that discretionary power can be exercised 
    unilaterally so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or political interests 
    and whether one party in the particular relationship exhibits a vulnerability.  
    These are all considerations relevant to determining whether a fiduciary relationship 
    exists. As La Forest J. said in <i>Hodgkinson</i>, at p. 409:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>In these cases, the question to ask is whether, given 
      all the surrounding circumstances, one party could reasonably have expected 
      that the other party would act in the former’s best interests with respect 
      to the subject matter at issue.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In our view, therefore, <i>Guerin</i> does not have the limited scope 
    contended for by the appellant.  It sets out principles that are relevant 
    to this case.  Brockenshire J. did not err in relying on it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Thus, in our view, the attacks mounted by the appellant on the finding 
    that the Crown is subject to a fiduciary duty all fall short.  Rather, we 
    agree with Brockenshire J. that when the Crown through the DVA is directed 
    to administer for the benefit of a veteran his funds, which he is incapable 
    of managing himself, the Crown shoulders a fiduciary obligation to that veteran.  
    The legislation that results in this administration, its nature and effect 
    and its context make this clear.  The most important considerations compelling 
    this conclusion are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The fact that it is the Crown, as administrator, that is obligated 
    to act for the benefit of the veteran does not remove the Crown’s obligation 
    from the scope of the fiduciary principle.  <i>Guerin</i> says as much.</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal;&quot;\(%5\:2\:4\:\)&quot; &quot;Authorized User&quot; 20020304T1220'> 
    (b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The funds being administered by the Crown belong to the veteran.  
    For the most part those funds originate in the veteran’s legal entitlement 
    to receive a government pension or allowance.  In some cases however, like 
    that of Mr. Authorson, the funds also include monies received by the veteran 
    from private sources. </p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The relevant legislation in each case requires that the veteran be 
    incapable of properly managing his pension. It provides that the Pension Commission 
    or its counterpart may then direct that the pension or allowance be administered 
    by such person as it selects or by the DVA and the legislation requires that 
    the administrator administer the pension for the benefit of the veteran.</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In setting up this obligation the legislative provisions make no distinction 
    between the Crown as administrator and a private citizen as administrator.  
    Both must administer the veteran’s pension for his benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The exclusive jurisdiction which the legislation gives to the Pension 
    Commission deals with the award, increase, decrease, suspension or cancellation 
    of the veteran’s pension.  The legislation also gives the Pension Commission 
    jurisdiction to direct an administration of the veteran’s funds.  Neither 
    jurisdiction extends to the issue at stake here, namely a determination of 
    whether the Crown as administrator has acted for the benefit of the veteran 
    or not.  Because it does not touch the question in issue here, this administrative 
    law structure does not insulate the Crown from the application of the fiduciary 
    principle.</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The recent decision of <i>Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia 
    (General Manager Liquor Control and Licensing Branch)</i> (2001), 204 D.L.R. 
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 33 (S.C.C.), is of no assistance to the appellant.  Unlike 
    that case, this is not one where it is sought to apply a common law rule in 
    the face of a clear statutory direction.  There is nothing in the legislative 
    provisions relevant to this case that clearly directs that the administrator 
    not accrue interest on the funds it is administering.  The common law fiduciary 
    obligation is not being applied to override a clear statutory direction.</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (g)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The nature of the relationship between the administrator and the veteran 
    carries hallmarks that clearly bring it within the fiduciary principle. By 
    statute, the administrator has the obligation to act for the benefit of the 
    veteran in administering his pension. The statute does not spell out how that 
    is to be done but leaves it to the discretion of the administrator.  In this 
    relationship the veteran exhibits the vulnerability that comes with being 
    adjudged incapable of managing his pension for himself.  He is dependent on 
    the administrator to do so for his benefit.  In the language of La Forest 
    J. quoted above, given all the surrounding circumstances, the veteran reasonably 
    could have expected that the administrator would act in his best interests 
    while administering his pension. These characteristics of the relationship 
    between the administrator and the veteran resonate as strongly where the administrator 
    is the Crown as where the administrator is a private citizen and the appellant 
    does not seriously contest that the latter falls within the scope of the fiduciary 
    principle.</p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='line-height:normal'> (h)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When it is directed to administer a veteran’s pension the essential 
    nature of the task undertaken by the Crown is clear. It must act for the benefit 
    of the veteran in managing his funds because the veteran is incapable of doing 
    so himself.  This is quintessentially the kind of act, whether done by Crown 
    or citizen, which courts have regulated using the law of fiduciary duty. This 
    task simply cannot be said to be a governmental action or obligation to be 
    regulated by Parliament or perhaps by public law.  As administrator, the Crown 
    must respond to only one imperative, that is to act for the benefit of the 
    veteran.  This is demanded by the legislation.  The Crown as administrator 
    cannot be moved by other policy considerations. It is not choosing between 
    public policy alternatives and cannot be said to be discharging a governmental 
    function or public duty.  Rather, it is undertaking a precisely defined duty 
    to a particular veteran, as the result of an individualized determination 
    of incapacity.  The essential nature of the task undertaken by the Crown as 
    administrator is thus indicative of a private right, enforceable by the veteran, 
    as opposed the performance of to a public duty by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For these reasons, we conclude that Brockenshire J. was correct in 
    finding that the Crown is a fiduciary to those veterans whose funds are being 
    administered by the DVA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> While this fiduciary relationship is trust-like, in that there is 
    a fund and a veteran who is owed a specific obligation by the Crown in connection 
    with it, we need not go on to determine whether the Crown can properly be 
    described as a trustee.  As Dickson J. said in <i>Guerin</i>,<i> supra</i>, 
    at p. 386, the law of trusts is a highly developed and specialized branch 
    of the law.  Whether this relationship of administrator and veteran meets 
    that standard is unnecessary to determine if Brockenshire J. was correct in 
    finding that the Crown’s fiduciary obligation encompasses a duty to invest 
    the funds under its administration or to accrue interest on them. To that 
    question we now turn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <i>Hodgkinson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 412-13, makes clear that the 
    precise range of duties which the law places on a fiduciary depends very much 
    on the precise circumstances of the particular relationship.  Where an individual 
    has taken on the responsibility of acting for another so as to become a fiduciary, 
    the court will require that he act consistently with his undertaking.  This 
    insures that those who may be vulnerable and who have come to reasonably expect 
    that the fiduciary will act in their best interests in a certain respect will 
    not have their expectations dashed.  In the words of La Forest J. in <i>M.(K.) 
    v. M.(H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 at p. 63, equity will impose on a fiduciary 
    a range of obligations coordinate with his undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the circumstances of this case, the Crown as administrator is directed 
    to manage the veteran’s fund for his benefit since he is incapable of doing 
    so himself.  The Crown thus undertakes to do with his money what he would 
    do for himself if he were able to.  That surely requires that the funds not 
    sit idle but rather that the Crown grow the funds by investing them or accruing 
    interest on them. Such an obligation is coordinate with the undertaking of 
    the Crown to administer the funds for the veteran’s benefit.  It is also consistent 
    with the trust-like nature of this fiduciary relationship, as we have described 
    it.  The appellant concedes that the obligation to invest or pay interest 
    on the funds held in trust for another is fundamental to the law governing 
    trustees.  In the particular circumstances of this fiduciary relationship, 
    the result should be no different.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Moreover, we can find nothing in the legislation governing the Consolidated 
    Revenue Fund that would prevent the fiduciary duty on the Crown as administrator 
    from encompassing the obligation to accrue interest on the funds it administers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The Crown accounted for the funds it administered by crediting them 
    to a special purpose account held in the name of each veteran within the Consolidated 
    Revenue Fund.  From 1951 onwards, the <i>Financial Administration Act</i> 
    explicitly allowed the payment of interest in respect of monies held in any 
    special purpose account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.  Prior to that, 
    in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, although not numerous, there 
    were clearly examples of cases where, by order-in-council, interest was allowed 
    on funds held on deposit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund for a special purpose.  
    Finally, from the very beginning, the legislative scheme relating specifically 
    to the payment of treatment allowances authorized the payment of interest 
    on them while being administered for the veteran by the DVA (see Order in 
    Council P.C. 2301 (November 21, 1919)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Hence there is nothing in the legislative framework providing for 
    these payments and their administration that would undercut the reasonable 
    expectation of the incapacitated veteran that the Crown, in administering 
    his funds in his best interests, would accrue interest on them.  In our view, 
    to have the effect of curtailing the Crown’s fiduciary duty short of this 
    obligation the legislation would have to clearly indicate that there was no 
    such obligation.  This is consistent with the fundamental principle articulated 
    by Major J. in <i>Wells v. Newfoundland</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199 at p. 218:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>[46] In a nation governed by the rule of law, we assume 
      that the government will honour its obligations unless it explicitly exercises 
      its power not to.  In the absence of a clear express intent to abrogate 
      rights and obligations – rights of the highest importance to the individual 
      – those rights remain in force.  To argue the opposite is to say that the 
      government is bound only by its whim, not its word.</div>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In summary, we find that Brockenshire J. was correct in declaring 
    both that the Crown had a fiduciary obligation to those veterans whose funds 
    were administered by the DVA and that it breached that obligation by failing 
    to invest or pay interest on the funds under its administration. </p>

    </span> Brockenshire J. dealt with those cases in the following language, 
    at pp. 236-37:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>In <i>Langille</i>, the plaintiffs’ diseased cattle were destroyed by 
        Crown agents per a statute and compensation was paid.  The plaintiffs 
        sued, claiming the compensation covered the value of the cows, but the 
        delays by the agents in getting the payment to them caused them to go 
        bankrupt, and claimed damages therefor.  Mr. Justice Stone in the Federal 
        Court of Appeal struck out the claim for general damages in the statement 
        of claim on the basis that the words “in respect of” in s. 9 are words 
        of very broad import, compensation was earlier paid in respect of “damage 
        or loss” resulting from the destruction of the animals and the purported 
        claim in the action was in respect of the same “damage or loss”.</p>
      <p><i>Vona</i> was also a case where a herd had been destroyed and compensation 
        paid.  Here too, the payment was delayed and the plaintiffs allege they 
        lost a restaurant as a result.  Madam Justice MacDonald of this court 
        applied the reasoning of Mr. Justice Stone in <i>Langille</i> and struck 
        the claim.  The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from that 
        decision.</p>
      <p><i>Sarvanis</i> was a claim by an inmate in a federal penitentiary for 
        injuries suffered while working there.  The inmate claimed for and received 
        disability benefits under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), which benefits 
        are paid out of the consolidated revenue fund.  The Federal Court of Appeal 
        noted that in the CPP claim the prisoner had identified the cause of his 
        injury as the accident, and concluded the pension had been paid out in 
        respect of the injury sustained so that a further action was barred.</p>
      <p>In <i>Arseneault</i>, the plaintiff sued the Crown and three military 
        doctors for alleged malpractice in performing back surgery on him while 
        he was in the armed forces.  The Federal Court declined jurisdiction in 
        the personal action against the three doctors and found the claim against 
        the Crown was barred as he had claimed and received a pension which was 
        directly connected to his back problem and his military service.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>In my view the words of the section are self-explanatory.  
      No proceedings lie if the pension or compensation has been or is payable 
      in respect of the death, injury, damage or loss in respect to which the 
      claim is made.  Here, the pension or compensation had been paid in respect 
      of mental or physical disability arising while in military service.  That 
      pension or allowance was in each case “in pay”.  The present claim has nothing 
      whatever to do with the original reasons for granting the pension or allowance.  
      The present claim has to do with the alleged breach of fiduciary obligation 
      in managing that money while a veteran was incapable of doing so personally.  
      I find that the claims herein are not barred by s. 9 of the <i>Crown Liability

    </span> The appellant took the same position in this court as it did below.  
    It  argued that, combined with the <i>Pension Act</i>, S.C. 1919, c. 43, the 
    Pension Commission had sole jurisdiction to adjudicate on claims for the payment 
    of interest, and that this action is an impermissible collateral attack on 
    that jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the appellant argued, s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>CLPA</i> 
    bars the action.  This argument is based upon ss. 2 and 7 of the <i>Pension 
    Act </i>of 1919.  They read as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>

    </span> The respondent’s response to this defence can be put briefly:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>(a)       Statutes which encroach upon citizens’ rights should be construed 
        strictly.  <i>Attorney General for Canada v. Hallett and Carey Ltd.</i>,<i> 
        </i>[1952] A.C. 427 at p. 450 (P.C.) per Radcliffe L.J. </p>
      <p>(b)       So construed, s. 9 of the <i>CLPA </i>has no application to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The respondent argues that by its very wording, s. 9 only applies 
    where compensation has been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or out 
    of administered funds – and that no such compensation has been paid for interest.  
    The claims being advanced are not “in respect of a claim” involving “a pension 
    or compensation that has been paid or payable out of Consolidated Revenue 
    Funds” or “out of administered funds”.  The respondent’s claim is for breach 
    of a fiduciary obligation arising out of the fact that the Crown failed to 
    invest the funds under administration in a reasonable manner.  The claim is 
    also based upon the fact that the Crown, as “trustee or fiduciary”, itself 
    benefited from the use of these funds without compensation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    he said: “The present claim has nothing whatever to do with the original reasons 
    for granting the pension or allowance.  [It] has to do with the alleged breach 
    of fiduciary obligation in managing that money while a veteran was incapable

    </span> The appellant also relies on <i>O’Connor v. Canada </i>(1995), 94 
    F.T.R. 93 (F.C.T.D.).  While a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, O’Connor 
    suffered a herniated disc while on duty and then was further injured as a 
    result of the negligence of the military doctor treating that condition.  
    O’Connor left the military and sued the Crown in the Federal Court for damages 
    arising from the doctor’s negligence.  The Crown moved to dismiss the action 
    upon the ground that, because his injury had been suffered while on military 
    service, O’Connor would be entitled to a pension and by virtue of a ss. 111 
    and 14 of the <i>Pension Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6, the Pension Commission 
    has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not O’Connor was so entitled.  
    Those sections read as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><b>111.    </b>No action or other proceeding lies against Her Majesty

    </span> The trial judge, Nadon J., accepted the Crown’s argument and dismissed 
    the action.  In his reasons he relied on the decision of Dubé J. in <i>Berneche 
    et al v. Canada </i>(1990), 34 F.T.R. 85 at p. 87 (F.C.T.D.), as follows:</p>

      fully comprehensive appeal system for determining the eligibility and the 
      quantum of disability pensions.  It follows that the last section of the 
      Act, s. 111, prescribes that no action or other proceeding lies against 
      the Queen in respect of any injury or disease or aggravation thereof, in 
      any case where a pension is or may be awarded under this Act.</div>

    in <i>O’Connor</i>, it is our view that it does not assist the appellant.  
    In <i>O’Connor</i>, as in <i>Berneche</i>, the issue was whether the claimant 
    was entitled to a pension.  We agree with the statement in the reasons in

    The prohibition did not come out of the blue.  It had a gestation period of 
    at least 20 years and the admissibility of some of the material before the 
    court in that regard was attacked by the appellant both here and below.  A

    judgment.  The material before the court was not, as in the trial process, 
    the testimony of live witnesses together with documents identified by them 
    or admitted by the parties.  Instead, the material before the court consisted 
    of the affidavits of seven persons, the transcript of the cross-examination 
    of one of the deponents and the documents exhibited to those affidavits and 
    cross-examination.  Of the seven persons, two deposed on behalf of the plaintiff

    of the concerns of the appellant below was with respect to the admissibility

    motions judge summarized the material before him on the subject of the enactment 
    of s.&nbsp;5.1(4), at pp. 240-44, as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>The material indicates that from the 1970’s forward group after group 
        of bureaucrats looked at the “problem” of non-payment of interest and 
        potential liability therefore. While we do not know from the materials 
        gathered to date just who the people were at these various meetings, and 
        while they certainly have not been subjected to cross-examination to test 
        what they had to say, the repetition over and over by one bureaucrat after 
        another and one study group after another that there was a problem and 
        there could be liability for it gives credence to the view that the senior 
        levels of the DVA must have felt there was a problem, and that there was 
        a potential of liability arising from it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>In 1985, the Auditor General’s Report, which is acknowledged to be a 
        public document, noted that:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1>at the 31<sup>st</sup> of March 1985, more than $53,000,000 
        was being held in trust on behalf of veterans.  We found that there were 
        inadequacies in the controls over veterans trust accounts by the department 
        and the Canadian Pension Commission and in the policy guidance to those 
        responsible for administering these trust accounts for veterans . . .</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>In 1986 the Auditor General returned to the question of “veterans trust 
        accounts” and commented extensively on these accounts and their administration.  
        A few quotes from this document are germane to the issues here:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1>Para. 13.43 – The duty to invest funds.  One of the 
        most basic duties of the trustee is to invest trust funds.  He or she 
        must use prudence in selecting good investments and ensuring they are 
        suitable, given the terms of the trust and the interest of the true beneficiaries.  
        The department does not invest or pay interest on money held in any trust 
        account.  Where veterans have raised the matter of receiving interest, 
        they have been told by department officials that such arrangements are 
        not possible.</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>Para. 13.44 – As a trustee, the department has a responsibility to 
          invest funds in approved instruments and to account to the beneficiary 
          regularly.  The department is vulnerable to legal action by veterans 
          to recover the difference between the amounts accumulated in the trust 
          accounts and what would have been produced if the money had been properly 
          invested.  Given the amounts involved and the length of time that many 
          of these accounts have been in existence, this liability could be large.</p>
        <p>Para. 13.45 – Conflict of interest and Duty – Crown self-dealing in 
          trust funds.  While there does not appear to be a conflict of interest 
          problem with staff employed by the department, the Crown as trustee, 
          may be viewed as being in a position where its interest and duty conflict.  
          Technical self-dealing arises with respect to the Crown’s failure to 
          invest or pay interest on money held in trust accounts in the consolidated 
          revenue fund.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=Section1>Para. 13.46 – Implications.  The department and the 
        commissioner recognize that a trust relationship exists with their administered 
        account clients.  However neither has met the minimum obligations of the 
        situation.  Recipients whose affairs have been administered by the department, 
        have, at best, had the benefit of its good intentions.  However they have 
        been deprived of the investment value of their funds.</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>These statements by an independent public body also do not constitute 
        admissions binding on the Crown.  The opinions expressed are untested, 
        and are not binding on me.</p>
      <p>However, predictably that report resulted in a flurry of memorandums, 
        studies, task forces, etc.  At Tab 111 of the moving party’s motion record 
        there is a copy of a letter from Pierre P. Sicard, the Deputy Minister 
        of [the] DVA to Mr. F. Iacobucci, Deputy Minister of Justice (as he then 
        was) advising that at the suggestion of Mr. Paul Tellier, Clerk of the 
        Privy Council, he is being invited to designate a senior official to participate 
        in a working group directed to find an acceptable solution of the problem 
        of the non-payment of interest.  That working group would include representatives 
        from [the] DVA, Finance, Treasury Board, Comptroller General and Justice.  
        At Tab 114 is found a document headed “Trust Analysis” and further headed 
        “Secret” apparently dated January 17, 1987 not bearing the name of any 
        author but containing at para. 9.5, headed “Interior Departmental”, the 
        following:</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1>Concerns have been raised by Privy Council Office, Treasury 
        Board, Finance and Office of the Comptroller General as to the potential 
        liability of the Crown and on-going costs for payment of interest on portfolio 
        trusts and the potential impact of such an initiative on trust relationships 
        across the federal sector, estimated to be in excess of $1 billion.</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>This document and this paragraph is perhaps indicative of the state of 
        mind within the various government departments at that time.</p>
      <p>The 1986 Auditor General’s report commented at paras. 13.35 and 13.36 
        that:</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1>. . . no training and [<i>sic</i>] trust administration 
        is provided . . . knowledge of this area is not a basic requirement for 
        a councilor’s job and is not even included in the job description . . 
        . neither councilors nor employees dealing with the financial administration 
        of trusts have any real knowledge of the responsibilities associated with 
        trust accounting; further, there are no procedural guides and policies.  
        The result is that persons who have no knowledge of the trustee’s duties 
        administer trusts as they see fit with virtually no formal guidance.</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>My reading of many pages of comments by one bureaucrat to another on 
        “the problem”, leads me to feel that for many of them, “law” meant only 
        federal statutes and regulations.  Indeed one of them, in a report, described 
        “equity” as  “mysterious”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>In November of 1986, the DVA issued a directive that no new administrations 
        (called in the document “trust relationships”) were to be accepted without 
        the approval of the Assistant Deputy Minister, after exhausting all other 
        options.</p>
      <p>At Tab 83 there is a letter from David Broadbent, the Deputy Minister 
        of [the] DVA to Mr. Stanley H. Hartt, Deputy Minister of the Department 
        of Finance, speaking of the work being done in his department to clean 
        up the administering of funds but saying further:</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1>the work we are doing did not seem to be getting far 
        in eliminating the risk of litigation over failure to pay interest on 
        accounts for which arguably we had the responsibility of a trustee.</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>He goes on to say that he is setting up a small task force to, among 
        other things, develop options for the consideration by Cabinet in September 
        1988.</p>
      <p>At Tab 122, is a document entitled “Trust Review Project Option Papers” 
        dated March 15, 1988.  This document generally recommends a new system 
        but at p. 30 indicates the options in relation “to interest oweable prior 
        to new system”.  Five options are listed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>1.         Let courts settle each case if and when it arises.</p>
        <p>2.         Keep quiet.  Settle case out of court if and when it arises.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=Section1></div>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>3.         Devise standard settlement formula, to be used in lieu of 
          old liability, if client agrees.</p>
        <p>4.         Devise standard settlement formula, to replace old liability, 
          whether client chooses or not (<i>ex post facto</i>).</p>
      </div>
      <div class=Section1></div>
      <div class=Section1>5.         Eliminate old liability (<i>ex post facto</i>).</div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>Since the Deputy Minister had requested a study of available options, 
        it is reasonable to assume that he got that option paper.  It is also 
        reasonable to assume that those options were part of the context in which 
        the 1990 legislation was drafted.  We do not know what materials were 
        presented or discussed by Cabinet, and we probably will not know because 
        of the s.&nbsp;39 privilege on Privy Council documents in the <i>Canada 
        Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.</p>
      <p>I conclude that in addition to the admissible public documents, the various 
        documents above referred to, are admissible as constitutional evidence 
        of the context in which this legislation may have been prepared.  I find 
        the correspondence at the Deputy Minister level to be much more important 
        in that regard than the musings of unnamed lower level bureaucrats.  I, 
        however, conclude that none of these documents is of very much assistance 
        in dealing with the ultimate issue.</p>
      <p>I conclude, however, that what was said when the Bill containing s. 5.1(4) 
        was introduced in the house, as reported in <i>Hansard</i>, is helpful.  
        Perhaps even more helpful is what was not said.  On second reading of 
        the Bill, on November&nbsp;8,&nbsp;1990, the Minister spoke of the Bill 
        as having three key elements.  On the second element he said:</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>For decades veterans’ affairs has followed ordinary banking practices 
          with regard to administered accounts.  The assumption has been that 
          the accounts were like checking accounts.  A service was received and 
          the costs of this service was provided through waiving interest on the 
          account.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>Well times have changed.  Financial institutions pay interest on virtually 
          every type of account and Bill C-87 will permit veterans’ affairs to 
          fall into line with modern practice.  With the passage of this legislation, 
          veterans’ affairs will pay interest on administered accounts effective 
          January 1, 1990.  The interest this year will amount to approximately 
          $3.5 million.  That Mr. Speaker, is the type of change I had in mind 
          when I said we want veterans and their dependants to receive 1990’s 
          service and treatment.</p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1></div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>No mention was made that in fact the authority had existed for many, 
        many years to pay interest but had not been used.  No mention was made 
        at all of s. 5.1(4), except by a general statement that the Bill contained 
        a number of “housekeeping measures”.</p>
      <p>I was provided with only an excerpt of <i>Hansard</i>.  It contains no 
        explanation of the need for s. 5.1(4) – that is there is no statement 
        that, for instance, it would be impossible to locate the old records on 
        past interest claims going back many years, or that the government, in 
        carefully balancing its financial priorities, had concluded that it was 
        better to spend its limited resources on pressing needs than hold them 
        in reserve against a contingent liability.  I was simply not shown any 
        explanation at all.  An extensive search of further Hansard reports does 
        not show any mention of s. 5.1(4).  If there was a policy explanation, 
        it would have been up to the Crown, in putting its best foot forward on 
        this motion, to have produced it, or evidence of it.  Absent that and 
        in the context of past history, the public documents and the concerns 
        indicated among the bureaucrats, I can only conclude that the purpose 
        of this section is to try [to] do what it says it is going to do and no 
        more – prevent claims being made for or on account of interest on monies 
        held or administered by the Minister during any period before January 
        1, 1990.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After 
    an extensive review of the jurisprudence, the motions judge summarized the  
    status and principles of the <i>Bill</i>, at pp. 254-55, as follows:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>
      <p>1.         The <i>Bill of Rights</i> is still in full force, but because 
        it relates only to federal legislation, and only empowers a court to declare 
        a statutory provision to be inoperative in a particular factual situation, 
        it has had a limited effect.</p>
      <p>2.         The <i>Bill of Rights</i> can protect rights that existed 
        (or were declared by it to exist) when it was passed, but it does not 
        create new rights.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1>
      <p>3.         Impugned legislation will be looked at in a general way to 
        see if it was in pursuit of a <i>valid</i> federal legislative objective, 
        and if so found, the courts will then look to see if the alleged discrimination 
        or other breach is necessarily incidental to such objective, and if so 
        found, may decline to declare the legislation inoperative.  However, inequality 
        before the courts will be looked at more stringently.</p>
      <p>4.         The right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles 
        of fundamental justice is a free- standing right, not qualified by the 
        due process concept. [Emphasis in original].</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1>
      <p>Relating those principles to this case, I conclude that the <i>Bill of 
        Rights</i> provides an effective remedy in this case.  The general right 
        to property is specifically recognized in s. 1(a) of the <i>Bill of Rights.</i>  
        The right to require a trustee or fiduciary to invest funds on hand, and/or 
        pay interest, has existed since the 1700s.  The omnibus Bill was certainly 
        passed in pursuit of a valid federal legislative objective, but the Bill 
        as a whole is not impugned – just s. 5.1(4).  That subsection does not, 
        on its face, have anything to do with improving the benefits, or the benefit 
        system, of veterans – on its face, the only objective is to block legitimate 
        potential claims by veterans.  The Crown was well aware of those potential 
        claims, both from its own studies and from the blunt reports of the Auditor 
        General.  No evidence at all of any higher purpose for this pernicious 
        subsection, buried in the Bill, that could come even close to objectives 
        of general good for veterans, or for the country as a whole, has been 
        put before this court, nor has any indication been given that s.&nbsp;5.1(4) 
        was necessary for, or even related to, the objectives of the Bill.</p>
      <p>I appreciate the difficulty with the vague words “due process”, and the 
        great concern Laskin J. had over the American experience with those words.  
        However, one thing is very clear to me – “due process” cannot mean “no 
        process”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1>
      <p>It is also clear to me that any beneficiary of any trust, or trust-like 
        relationship in Canada, would be entitled to bring his or her trustee 
        or fiduciary before the courts of Canada, so that a fair hearing could 
        be held on any allegation of breach of trust or obligation.  The outright 
        denial of that right to the disabled veterans in this class is a denial 
        of fundamental justice, and a clear breach of s. 2(<i>e</i>) of the <i>Bill 
        of Rights</i>, calling for remedial action by this court.</p>
      <p>I declare that s. 5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i> 
        is inoperative in barring the claims raised by the plaintiff class in 
        this action.</p>

    Cases can be cited to support each of the propositions set out above.  The 
    <i>Bill of Rights</i>, however, remains in place.  In  <i>R. v. Drybones</i>,

    [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, the Supreme Court of Canada relied upon the <i>Bill</i>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [109]<span

    provisions of the <i>Canadian Human Rights Act</i> in <i>MacBain v. Lederman</i>, 
    [1985] 1 F.C. 856, and the Manitoba Court of Appeal relied upon the <i>Bill</i> 
    in declaring inoperative a portion of the <i>Indian Act</i> in <i>R. v. Hayden</i> 
    (1983), 3 D.L.R. (4th) 361.  <i>MacBain</i> was not appealed further.  Leave

    of the cases referred to by counsel discuss the question whether the “due

      be rigidly confined to procedural matters.  There is often an interaction 
      of means and ends, and it may be that there can be a proper invocation of 
      due process of law in respect of federal legislation as improperly abridging 
      a person’s right to life, liberty, security and enjoyment of property.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
    our view it is not necessary to decide that issue in the instant case because, 
    as the motions judge noted towards the end of his reasons dealing with the 
    <i>Bill</i>, “due process” cannot mean “no process”.  Putting it another way, 
    assuming without deciding that “due process” is limited to matters of procedure, 
    s. 5.1(4) must still be found inoperative because there is no evidence before 
    the court that those whose property rights were foreclosed by that section 
    were made aware of the intention of Parliament to pass this legislation or 
    accorded any other process to contest the complete removal of their right 
    to receive interest.  Such evidence as there is tends to suggest that the 
    government characterized the proposed changes as being benevolent rather than 
    otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Counsel 
    for the appellant relies heavily on the decision of the Manitoba Court of 
    Appeal in <i>R. v. Bryan</i> (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 487.  Bryan was prosecuted 
    for violating the <i>Customs Act</i> in that he exported grain from Canada 
    without first getting an export permit as required by the <i>Canadian Wheat 
    Board Act</i>.  Bryan argued first that the requirement was ultra vires the 
    federal government because the law dealt with property and civil rights.  
    In the alternative, Bryan argued that the requirement of a permit was rendered 
    inoperative by s. 1(a) of the <i>Bill</i> because it purported to deprive 
    him, without due process of law, of a property right, namely, the right to 
    export grain.  The Manitoba Court of Appeal found that the legislation dealt 
    with trade and commerce and hence was intra vires the federal government.  
    In dealing with the <i>Bill</i>, Scott C.J.M., after referring <i>inter alia</i> 
    to <i>Hogan</i> and <i>Drybones</i> said, at pp. 497-98:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>Since the <i>Bill of Rights</i> is not a true constitutional document, 
        there is no mandate to set aside the will of Parliament through judicial 
        review.  Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, which 
        protects property rights through a “due process” clause, was not replicated 
        in the <i>Charter</i>, and the right to “enjoyment of property” is not 
        a constitutionally protected, fundamental part of the Canadian society.  
        See, for example, <i>R. v. Appleby (No. 2)</i> (1976), 76 D.L.R. (3d) 
        110, 35 C.C.C. (2d) 94 (N.B.C.A.).  Furthermore, in contrast to the <i>Charter 
        of Rights and Freedoms</i>, the due process provision of s. 1(a) of the 
        <i>Bill of Rights </i>is procedural as opposed to substantive . See <i>Curr 
        v. The Queen</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 889, 26 D.L.R. (3d) 603, 7 C.C.C. (2d) 
        181, and <i>Smith, Klein </i>[sic]<i> &amp; French v. Attorney General 
        of Canada</i>, [1986] 1 F.C. 274 at pages 302-4, 24 D.L.R. (4th) 321, 
        affirmed [1987] 2 F.C. 359, 34 D.L.R. (4th) 584 (C.A.), leave to appeal 
        to the Supreme Court dismissed (1987), 27 C.R.R. 286n, 42 D.L.R. (4th) 
        viii.  As Professor W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Tarnopolsky (as he then was) described 
        the matter:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p>. . . it is clear that whatever right one has to “enjoyment of property” 
          is modified by the last clause, i.e., “the right not to be deprived 
          thereof except by due process of law.”  Therefore, as long as it does 
          not exceed its legislative jurisdiction, and as long as it observes 
          “due process of law,” Parliament can interfere with “the right of the 
          individual to enjoyment of property.”  [<i>The Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, 
          2nd rev. ed., McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1975, p. 221.]</p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1>There is no suggestion that the <i>Act</i> and Regulations 
      thereunder were not validly enacted by Parliament and the Governor in Council 
      respectively.  This, in my opinion, constitutes due process for the purposes 
      of s. 1(a) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>.  There is no constitutional 
      dimension to the question before us and, in any event, no breach of s.&nbsp;1(a) 
      of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.</div>

    marked contrast to the view of Scott C.J.M. is the view of Wilson J. in the 
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Singh</i>.  Although Wilson J. ultimately rested 
    her decision on the <i>Charter</i>, speaking for herself, Dickson C.J. and 
    Lamer J., she commented on the <i>Bill</i>, at p. 185, as follows:</p>

    <div class=Section1>In the written submission presented in December 1984 counsel 
      considered whether the procedures for the adjudication of refugee status 
      claims violated the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, in particular s. 2(<i>e</i>).  
      There can be no doubt that this statute continues in full force and effect 
      and that the rights conferred in it are expressly preserved by s. 26 of 
      the <i>Charter</i>.</div>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [117]<span

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p>Section 26 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> should

    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1><b>26.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1>Thus, the<i> Canadian Bill of Rights</i> retains all its 
      force and effect, together with the various provincial charters of rights.  
      Because these constitutional or quasi-constitutional instruments are drafted 
      differently, they are susceptible of producing cumulative effects for the 
      better protection of rights and freedoms.  But this beneficial result will 
      be lost if these instruments fall into neglect.  It is particularly so where 
      they contain provisions not to be found in the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights 
      and Freedoms</i> and almost tailor-made for certain factual situations such 
      as those in the case at bar.</div>

  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>The blunt statement that the enactment of a statute constitutes

      back to the factual situation that this particular <i>Act</i> was passed 
      by Parliament under its clear mandate under the <i>British North America</i> 
      <i>Act</i> re trade and commerce, with the provision re exporting being 
      an essential part of the legislative scheme.  In that light, the decision

      at para. 67 of the Quicklaw version of <i>R. v. Beauregard</i>, [1986] 2

    motions judge went on to deal with <i>Singh</i> in some detail.  For our part, 
    we would add that the result in <i>Bryan</i> would seem to have been dictated 
    by the fact that the <i>Canadian Wheat Board Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-24, 
    and the regulations made under it do not simply purport to abolish a property 
    right.  The Board was set up to manage and control sales of grain grown in 
    Canada.  A necessary part of such control is the management of exports and 
    hence the development of a permit system.  The <i>Act</i> and the regulations 
    under it provide a procedure for the management of exports.  In the result 
    the vendor of grain gets paid for his grain.  His property right is not simply 
    abolished.  The procedure set up by <i>Act</i> and regulations provides the 
    “due process” required by s.&nbsp;1(a) of the <i>Bill</i>.  There is no similar 
    or analogous procedure provided by the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i> 
    or otherwise in the instant case.  There is no “due process” whatsoever.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
    reference of the motions judge to the comments of Dickson C.J., in <i>Beauregard

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>This short history of “equality before the law” under 
      s. 1(b) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> demonstrates that a majority 
      of the Court was never prepared to review impugned legislation according 
      to an exacting standard which would demand of Parliament the most carefully 
      tailored, finely crafted legislation.  On the contrary, a majority of the 
      Court was consistently prepared to look in a general way to whether the 
      legislation was in pursuit of a valid federal legislative objective.  This 
      approach was followed in cases involving legislative distinctions on the 
      basis of race, sex and age, and in cases involving profoundly important 
      interests of the person asserting the equality right.  The passages which 
      I have quoted from these cases indicate that the Court was concerned with 
      the merely statutory status of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> and the 
      declaratory nature of the rights it conferred.  I believe the day has passed 
      when it might have been appropriate to re-evaluate those concerns and to 
      reassess the direction this Court has taken in interpreting that document.</div>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
    appellant argues that this matter should not have proceeded by way of summary 
    judgment.  We wish to stress again that the appellant and respondent both 
    brought motions for summary judgment before Brockenshire J.  The appellant 
    argued in this court, as it did before the motions judge, that the statutory 
    benefits at issue did not give rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the 
    Crown.  In its motion for summary judgment the appellant also sought dismissal 
    of the plaintiff's action on the basis of the statutory bars and jurisdictional 
    arguments that it raised in the court below and in this court.  These issues 
    were fully argued in the court below and in this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
    appellant contends before this court, as it did before the motions judge, 
    that it had not been given adequate time to compile the complete evidentiary 
    record that it required to argue the two motions.  The appellant indicated 
    that it would have produced additional documents, compiled a legislative history 
    and prepared evidence pertaining to the history of the DVA and veterans’ benefits.  
    The appellant also argued that Brockenshire J. unfairly denied the Crown the 
    opportunity to complete the record when he refused to grant an adjournment 
    in respect of the plaintiff's summary judgment motion.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We 
    disagree with the assertions that Brockenshire J. granted summary judgment 
    on the basis of an incomplete evidentiary record or that the Crown was in 
    any way prejudiced by the decision to deny an adjournment. Both parties in 
    the court below relied on the productions made by the Crown, up to the date 
    of the hearing of the motions, in September 2000.  All of the material on 
    which Brockenshire J. decided the motions was properly before him and virtually 
    all of that material was based on evidence that had been tendered by the Crown.  
    Significantly, the appellant tendered no fresh evidence on the appeal, let 
    alone any evidence that would contradict anything on which the motions judge 
    relied or that would give rise to a genuine issue of fact for trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The 
    issues before Brockenshire J. involved questions of statutory interpretation, 
    equity, the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> and the <i>Canadian Charter of 
    Rights and Freedoms</i>.  They were issues of law, argued within a substantially 
    agreed-upon factual matrix.   As in <i>Chippewas of Sarnia Band v. Canada 
    (Attorney General)</i> (2001), 51 O.R. (3d) 641 at pp. 657-58 (C.A.), the 
    appellant participated fully in the summary judgment proceedings.  Although 
    it unsuccessfully sought an adjournment to file further material, the appellant 
    ultimately did not take the position before Brockenshire J. that, having regard 
    to the voluminous record placed before him and the issues of law raised by 
    that material, it was not appropriate to deal with the matter under Rule 20.  
    The appellant cannot now argue that it was denied an opportunity to “put its 
    best foot forward”, whether as moving party or as respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [129]<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Having 
    determined that the respondent was entirely successful, that the government’s 
    actions towards the veterans could be classified as “reprehensible”, and that 
    this was a situation where the government as trustee/fiduciary had to be sued 
    in order to bring a response, Brockenshire J. ordered the appellant to pay 
    solicitor-client costs, which he fixed at $668,000.  The appellant argues 
    that an award of solicitor and client costs was not appropriate in this case.  
    We would not give effect to this argument.</p>

    and 13.43, Kenneth M. Dye, F.C.A., stated that the then recent landmark decision 
    in <i>Guerin</i> clarified the obligations of the Crown in fiduciary situations 
    such as the trust funds being administered by the DVA on behalf of veterans 
    who were incapable of managing their own affairs. Mr. Dye reported that:</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>CONCLUSION</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
    these reasons, we agree with the conclusions and dispositions that the motions 
    judge made on each of the issues in appeal.  In particular, we agree that 
    the Crown was a fiduciary to the class members while their funds were being 
    administered by the DVA and that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty by 
    failing to invest or pay interest on these funds.  In addition, s. 9 of the 
    <i>CLPA</i> is not a bar to this action.  Nor is section 5.1(4) of the <i>Department 
    of Veterans Affairs Act</i> a bar because it is rendered inoperative as against 
    these claims by the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Accordingly, 
    we would dismiss the appeals from the dismissal of the appellant's motion 
    for summary judgment and from the judgment in favour of the respondent.  The 
    respondent is entitled to his costs of the appeals.  We invite counsel to 
    address this issue by letter within thirty days of the release of these reasons.  
    Counsel may address the questions of the appropriate scale, the quantum of 
    costs and whether these costs should be fixed by this court or assessed.</p>
