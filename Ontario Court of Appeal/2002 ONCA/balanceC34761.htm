<p>On appeal from his conviction by Judge Charles H. Vaillancourt on July 20, 
  2000.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Notwithstanding Mr. Fenton’s very able submissions, we have not been 
  persuaded that there is a basis for interfering with the trial judge’s conclusion 
  that the two crane games were games of mixed chance and skill, thus, falling 
  within the prohibition in s. 206(1)(f) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i><a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  The test to be applied as set 
  out in cases such as <i>Bailey v. The King</i> (1938), 70 C.C.C. 342 (S.C.C.) 
  and <i>Rex v. Athonas</i> (1931), 56 C.C.C. 146 (Ont. S.C. App. Div.) is whether 
  the game, as intended to be played by the ordinary person likely to play it, 
  is a game of skill or mixed chance and skill.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the amount of control exercised by the ordinary player 
  was so minimal that the game operated as one of chance or at best mixed chance 
  and skill.  The evidence established that the average player simply could not 
  exercise sufficient skill to compensate for the other elements of the game that 
  were wholly beyond the power of the player to influence.  The ability of the 
  player to control the crane’s lateral movement gave the appearance of an element 
  of skill.  In reality, however, as a matter of common sense the game would be 
  played as a game of chance.  The expert evidence adduced by the Crown and accepted 
  by the trial judge demonstrated that there were too many other variables that 
  were far more important than the positioning of the crane that would overcome 
  what little skill the operator might bring to the game.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We agree with the appellant that simply because a game has an increased 
  level of difficulty does not necessarily mean the game will be viewed as one 
  of chance or mixed skill and chance.  We also accept that merely because some 
  elements of the game are out of the control of the player does not make the 
  game one of mixed chance and skill. Where, as in this case, however, virtually 
  all of the elements of the game are out of the control of the player, it was 
  open to the trial judge to conclude as he did that the game is one of mixed 
  chance and skill.  As the trial judge said, as a matter of common sense the 
  games are “games of mixed skill and chance with an overwhelming degree of chance 
  and merely a dash of skill”. This was not a case where there were some unpredictable 
  elements that might occasionally defeat the player’s skill, but the systematic 
  resort to chance:  <i>Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen</i>, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 
  1 (S.C.C.) at 17.</p>
