<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from conviction for first degree

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>MOLDAVER J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for first degree 
  murder. He raises numerous grounds of appeal in support of his submission that 
  the conviction should be quashed and an acquittal entered or, alternatively, 
  that a new trial be ordered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>For reasons that follow, I am satisfied that as a result 
  of three errors in the charge to the jury, the conviction cannot stand and a 
  new trial must be ordered. In so concluding, I reject the appellant’s submission, 
  advanced in the final paragraph of his factum, that the direct and circumstantial 
  evidence implicating him as the person responsible for his brother’s death is 
  so lacking in probative value that “it is inevitable that, given a fair retrial, 
  the appellant will be acquitted.” On the contrary, I am satisfied that apart 
  from the direct evidence of the jailhouse informant, the circumstantial evidence 
  implicating the appellant as the killer, taken alone, is very strong and warrants 
  a new trial. </p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW OF THE CASE</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant is the brother of the deceased, Kestutis Baltrusaitis. 
  On September 7, 1994, Kestutis was found dead in the living room of his home 
  at Inverhuron, Ontario. He had been shot six times at close range with a shotgun, 
  once to the head, once to the wrist and four times to the body. Although the 
  pathologist who performed the autopsy could not ascertain the exact time of 
  death, the state of decomposition of the body led him to conclude that death 
  could have occurred as early as the night of September 4<sup>th</sup> and as 
  late as September 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Although Kestutis was legally married to Elizabeth McBean 
  at the time of his death, he had recently separated from her after learning 
  that she had been intimate with a former boyfriend who had been living with 
  the couple at their home. Various witnesses testified that Kestutis was angry 
  and upset about his wife’s infidelity, that he had been referring to her publicly 
  as a “slut” and a “whore”, and that he was planning to cut her out of his will 
  and pay her as little financial support as possible.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At trial, there was no dispute that Kestutis had been murdered. 
  The two live issues for the jury were whether the appellant committed the murder 
  and, if so, whether the murder was planned and deliberate.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE AGAINST 
  THE APPELLANT</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The Crown’s case against the appellant rested largely, although 
  not entirely, on circumstantial evidence. Various witnesses attested to the 
  long-standing rift between the appellant and his brother dating back to their 
  mother’s death in 1983 and the appellant’s belief that his brother had cheated 
  him out of his fair share of their mother’s estate. Added to this was the fact 
  that Kestutis and the appellant had little in common. As a successful pharmacist 
  living a traditional lifestyle, Kestutis looked upon the appellant’s transient 
  lifestyle with disdain.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Other evidence led by the Crown revealed that the appellant’s 
  transient lifestyle had landed him in financial hot water in the early 1990s. 
  According to the Crown, this only served to exacerbate his anger towards Kestutis 
  for having cheated him out of his fair share of their mother’s estate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In addition to this body of evidence, which went to the issue 
  of motive, the Crown led evidence of opportunity. In particular, a neighbour 
  of the deceased gave incontrovertible evidence placing the appellant’s vehicle 
  in the vicinity of the deceased’s home on the morning of September 5<sup>th</sup>. 
  Other neighbours also observed a vehicle similar to the appellant’s that same 
  morning and one reported seeing it at 9:40 a.m., leaving Inverhuron and heading 
  towards Kincardine at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>As for evidence of planning and deliberation, the Crown relied 
  in part on the testimony of various neighbours of the deceased who reported 
  seeing a vehicle similar to the appellant’s vehicle driving in the neighbourhood 
  in the week or so prior to the murder. One such neighbour claimed to have seen 
  the suspect vehicle on six separate occasions and he noticed that it had two 
  aerials attached to it. His evidence dovetailed with evidence from other witnesses 
  who reported that the appellant possessed electronic surveillance equipment, 
  including scanner antennas, which he regularly used to intercept cellular phone 
  calls.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown relied on this evidence, as well as 
  evidence indicating that the appellant had been in Kincardine at the end of 
  August looking for Kestutis at his workplace, to establish that the appellant 
  had been stalking the deceased in the several weeks prior to his death as part 
  of a plan to kill him.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Additional circumstantial evidence implicating 
  the appellant as the killer included shotgun cartridges, found by the police 
  in his camper, which bore the same bunter dye as that used on one of the spent 
  cartridges found at the murder scene. According to Paul Sweeney, a firearms 
  and ballistics expert, the matching bunter dye meant that there was an excellent 
  chance that the cartridges in the camper and the spent cartridge at the scene 
  were produced by the manufacturer in the same production run. Notably, however, 
  he had no information about the length of the particular production run or the 
  number of cartridges produced in it.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Other evidence found in the appellant’s camper 
  and car included assault grips used to replace the pump slide on a rifle or 
  shotgun and thus to reduce the size of the weapon, a wooden pump slide and a 
  brown butt stock from a shotgun, reading material relating to shotguns and a 
  piece of paper dated July 4, 1987 regarding the sale of a Winchester model 94, 
  30-30 rifle.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the Crown relied on certain after-the-fact conduct related 
  to a statement the appellant made to the police prior to his arrest. In particular, 
  the Crown focused on the appellant’s lie to the police about never owning a 
  shotgun, his  inappropriate reaction upon being told of his brother’s death 
  and his failure to admit to the police that he had met with his brother two 
  weeks before the killing.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>APPELLANT’S REPLY TO THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL 
  CASE</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not testify at trial. With 
  respect to motive, it was his position, supported by various Crown witnesses, 
  that although he was angry with the deceased for cheating him out of his fair 
  share of their mother’s estate, that event had occurred in 1983, eleven years 
  before his brother’s death. There was no evidence that he had ever been violent 
  towards his brother in the interim, nor that he had ever threatened him with 
  violence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As for his lifestyle and precarious financial state in the early 
  1990s, several witnesses indicated that the appellant was happy with his transient 
  existence and even proud of it. They further testified  that he was always able 
  to make ends meet and that he did not appear to be preoccupied with or overly 
  concerned about money matters.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to opportunity, the defence made some attempt to 
  cast doubt on the evidence identifying the appellant’s vehicle in the vicinity 
  of the deceased’s home on the morning of September 5<sup>th</sup>. More importantly, 
  the defence focused on the lack of certainty as to the time of death and the 
  fact that the deceased’s estranged wife and her boyfriend had a motive to kill 
  the deceased and the opportunity to do so on the night of September&nbsp;4<sup>th</sup>. 
  In this respect, the appellant relied on evidence given by neighbours of the 
  deceased who recalled hearing a loud noise that sounded like a rifle shot on 
  the night of September 4<sup>th</sup> between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. 
  He also relied on the fact that the clothing worn by the deceased and the physical 
  evidence in his kitchen were more consistent with the killing having occurred 
  at night than in the morning.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the evidence of stalking, some 
  effort was again made to cast doubt on the apparent sightings of the appellant’s 
  vehicle by neighbours in the week or so prior to the murder. No effort was made 
  to deny the appellant’s interest in electronic surveillance equipment, but some 
  witnesses described this as nothing more than a hobby.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Turning to the gun paraphernalia found in the 
  appellant’s camper, the defence conceded that the appellant had an interest 
  in guns. However, the defence emphasized </span><span
lang=EN-US>that the appellant was not found to be in possession of the murder 
  weapon and argued that the evidence relating to the shotgun shells and matching 
  bunter dye was of little probative value given Mr. Sweeney’s lack of information 
  about the length of the particular production run and the number of shells produced 
  in it. The appellant maintained that, if anything, the cartridges and gun paraphernalia 
  found in his camper pointed more to his innocence than his guilt, because if 
  he had killed his brother, he would have disposed of these items long before 
  the police searched his camper. Along the same lines, the appellant relied on 
  the fact that apart from the inconclusive bunter dye evidence, there was no 
  other forensic evidence linking him to the murder scene.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>By way of counterattack, the appellant maintained 
  that the circumstantial evidence implicating the deceased’s wife, Elizabeth 
  McBean, as the killer, was as compelling, if not more compelling, than the evidence 
  implicating him. In this regard, he pointed out that:</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>John Doe, a jailhouse informant, provided the

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Of the many grounds of appeal raised by the 
  appellant, I would give effect to only three. The unsuccessful grounds are listed 
  below and addressed summarily.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>UNSUCCESSFUL GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>(1)       The trial judge erred in ruling that the jailhouse informant, 
    John Doe, did not actively elicit statements from the appellant in violation 
    of the appellant’s right to silence under s. 7 of the Charter.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On a <i>voir dire</i> held to determine whether 
  John Doe improperly elicited statements from the appellant, the trial judge 
  found as a fact that the appellant was “a loquacious, outgoing person” who “talks 
  freely to everyone, about all manner of subjects”, thereby making it unnecessary 
  for Doe to “dig information out of him.” The trial judge further found that 
  any questions asked by Doe were not “probing or persistent such that they could 
  be considered inveigling or in the nature of an interrogation.” Rather, in his 
  view, the two questions asked by Doe were “innocuous” and consistent with “an 
  average cellmate showing mild interest by asking the occasional appropriate 
  question.”</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Applying the governing legal principles from 
  <i>R. v. Broyles</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) to those findings, 
  the trial judge concluded that the appellant had not made out a s. 7 <i>Charter</i> 
  violation. I see no basis for interfering with that conclusion.</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>(2)       The trial judge erred in admitting the opinion evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Sweeney, 
    the firearms and ballistics expert, regarding the apparent “match” between 
    a shell cartridge found at the murder scene and several cartridges found at 
    the appellant’s camper.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge should 
  not have admitted the “matching bunter dye” evidence because its prejudicial 
  effect outweighed its probative value. I disagree. It was open to the trial 
  judge to admit the impugned evidence. The expert’s lack of knowledge about the 
  length of the production run and the number of cartridges produced in it went 
  to the weight of his opinion, not to its admissibility. The information gap 
  in his testimony was brought to the attention of the jury and its impact would 
  have been apparent to them. This is not a case where the jury was at risk of 
  being overwhelmed by the “mystic infallibility” of the expert evidence.</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>(3)       The trial judge erred in refusing to permit the defence to elicit 
    certain statements made by the deceased to third parties.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge relaxed the hearsay rule and permitted the defence  
  to elicit a number of statements made by the deceased to third parties that 
  were potentially helpful to the appellant. In particular, he permitted the defence 
  to adduce evidence designed to show that the deceased’s wife had at least two 
  strong reasons for wanting to see her husband dead, one relating to her financial 
  interests, the other to her reputation in the community and her anger with her 
  husband for portraying her publicly as a slut and whore.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On appeal, Mr. Slansky conceded that these two 
  matters, which went to the issue of the wife’s motive, were of primary interest 
  to the defence and that other statements made by the deceased to third parties,

  can only be based on evidence found to be both credible and reliable, the same 
  does not hold true for a verdict of ‘Not Guilty’. Simply put, while it is perfectly 
  proper to instruct the jury that in order to find an accused guilty of a particular 
  offence, they must be satisfied on the basis of evidence found to be credible 
  and reliable, that each and every essential element of the offence has been 
  proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the same rule does not apply to a finding

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>John Doe was twenty-one years old when he testified 
  at the appellant’s trial. Despite his youth, he had already amassed a substantial 
  criminal record consisting of fourteen prior convictions. Some of the convictions

  crimes of dishonesty and untrustworthiness, including failing to comply, failing 
  to attend, impersonation with intent and obstruct police.</span></p>

  in each instance, upon being stopped or arrested by the police, Doe falsely 
  identified himself as James A., his personal friend and roommate. Doe misidentified 
  himself because he was concerned that if the police learned his true identity, 
  he would not be released on bail in light of his extensive criminal record. 
  In using A.’s name, Doe knew that when he did not show up in court on the charges, 
  A. would likely be arrested. Nonetheless, he did not hesitate to lie and place 
  his good friend in jeopardy in order to further his own self-interest. Not unexpectedly, 
  his motivation for telling the authorities about the appellant and for cooperating

  the appellant and attempt to obtain further information from him. To that end, 
  on August 14<sup>th</sup>, Doe was taken to the London jail where he spent one 
  day with the appellant. According to Doe, he broke his agreement to stay the

  As well, after being referred to one of his answers at the preliminary hearing,

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>… On the other hand, consider the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Linkenheld. 
      He says he gave no details of the police investigation to Mr. Doe. Yet Doe 
      related particulars to us that the crown says he could not have known except 
      from Charles Baltrusaitis, for example, the lack of soil samples placing 
      him at the murder scene, the presence of the one unidentified fingerprint, 
      the fact the police found shotgun shells at the scene, but no gun as he 
      was able to get rid of it and most telling, the information that the deceased 
      was trying to change his will leaving the accused with nothing. The defence 
      suggests these particulars were general knowledge which he could have learned 
      from other inmates. He also related particulars that are probably incorrect 
      or are in fact incorrect, for example, that two guns, a rifle and a shotgun 
      were used in the murder; that there were five shots, not six and that Chuck 
      said his parents had died about six years before. However, the crown points 
      out he also referred to two types of shells, which is correct.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Later in the charge, the trial judge returned

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span>            </span>The crown says the admissions to John Doe on two 
      different occasions are clear confessions of guilt by the accused. John 
      Doe has nothing to gain or lose at this point. He said he does not care 
      if you believe him or not. It is up to you. He has completed all his sentences 
      and is not facing any more charges. Despite his criminal past he was an 
      honest witness worthy of belief. His testimony was a strong piece of evidence 
      identifying the accused as the killer, says the crown.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>The defence says the man is an admitted multiple 
      liar who has and will say anything to gain something for himself. With the 
      June 1995 revelations he hoped to get a better deal from the crown on his 
      charges. With the August revelations he hoped to make some money. In any 
      event, after he told his June story, he had to stick to it or risk further 
      charges. Whether he would have been charged or not is not relevant. He thought 
      he could be.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Applying those factors to Doe’s testimony, I 
  am satisfied that the trial judge should have provided the jury with a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
  warning and that his failure to do so constituted error. In fairness, it should 
  be pointed out that the trial judge did not have the benefit of <i>Brooks, supra</i>, 
  at the time of the charge. Had that decision been available to him, I am confident 
  that given the fair manner in which he conducted the trial, he would have warned 
  the jury to proceed with caution before acting on Doe’s evidence to convict 
  the appellant. A <i>Vetrovec </i>warning was required because Doe’s testimony 
  suffered from serious credibility problems and, although his evidence was perhaps 
  not crucial to the Crown’s case, it was very important to it.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Beginning with credibility problems, in my view 
  Doe’s evidence was inherently suspect for the following reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <span

    the interests of a good friend to further his own self interest;</span></p>
  <p> <span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span

  </span></span> As for the importance of Doe’s testimony, his was the only direct 
  evidence implicating the appellant as the killer. In that sense, it provided 
  the Crown with the fill needed to plug the potential cracks in its circumstantial 
  case. By way of example, the evidence supporting the appellant’s primary defence, 
  namely, that Elizabeth McBean may have killed her husband, was certainly capable 
  of creating such a crack. In that regard, Doe’s evidence accomplished two important 
  things for the Crown: (a) it devastated that defence; and (b) it lent support 
  to the Crown’s position that the appellant had planned and deliberated his brother’s 
  murder.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span> [4] </span></a> In sum, 
  although Doe’s evidence may not have been crucial to the Crown’s case, in my 
  view it was very important, and if accepted, it alone could support a conviction.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To apply the curative proviso in this case,

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Commencing with the independent evidence capable 
  of confirming Doe’s testimony, it will be recalled that in his charge to the 
  jury, the trial judge outlined for the jury some of the particulars provided 
  by Doe that could only have come from the appellant and upon which the Crown 
  relied to show that Doe was being honest. At the same time, the trial judge 
  outlined the defence position regarding particulars offered by Doe that were 
  incorrect. For convenience, I repeat the passage in question:</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>… On the other hand, consider the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Linkenheld. 
    He says he gave no details of the police investigation to Mr. Doe. Yet Doe 
    related particulars to us that the crown says he could not have known except 
    from Charles Baltrusaitis, for example, the lack of soil samples placing him 
    at the murder scene, the presence of the one unidentified fingerprint, the 
    fact the police found shotgun shells at the scene, but no gun as he was able 
    to get rid of it and<i> most telling, the information that the deceased was 
    trying to change his will leaving the accused with nothing. The defence suggests 
    these particulars were general knowledge which he could have learned from 
    other inmates</i>. He also related particulars that are probably incorrect 
    or are in fact incorrect, for example, that two guns, a rifle and a shotgun 
    were used in the murder; that there were five shots, not six and that Chuck 
    said his parents had died about six years before. However, the crown points 
    out he also referred to two types of shells, which is correct. [Emphasis added]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect, I am of the view that there are 
  a number of difficulties with this passage, all of which factor into my conclusion 
  that the independent evidence capable of confirming the veracity of Doe’s testimony 
  was not so compelling that the jury would inevitably have accepted his evidence, 
  <i>Vetrovec</i> warning or not.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the evidence left to the jury as being the “most telling” 
  in terms of its confirmatory value, namely, “. . .the information that the deceased 
  was trying to change his will leaving the accused with nothing” was, in my view, 
  questionable at best. There is no suggestion in this case, apart from Doe’s 
  testimony, that the deceased had made out a will leaving anything to the appellant, 
  nor is there any suggestion that the appellant believed otherwise. Accordingly, 
  to the extent that Doe attributed any “change of will  -loss of legacy” statement 
  to the appellant, his information was both incorrect and potentially misleading 
  in that it ascribed to the appellant a motive for the killing that was not borne 
  out by other evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To the extent that the appellant had knowledge of any plans by 
  his brother to change his will, that evidence could be seen as lending support 
  to the Crown’s theory that he had been intercepting his brother’s phone calls 
  and perhaps stalking him. On the other hand, the appellant may have learned 
  of his brother’s plans to change his will from “street talk” following his brother’s 
  separation from Elizabeth McBean. Whatever the case, Doe’s testimony regarding 
  the “change of will - loss of legacy” should not have been left to the jury 
  as the “most telling” piece of information capable of supporting the veracity 
  of Doe’s testimony because it was not supported by any independent evidence.<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span> [6] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, to the extent that Doe provided particulars 
  from the appellant that were incorrect, the jury was entitled to infer that 
  he was either concocting false information or that he was mistaken in his reporting 
  and thus an unreliable historian. In either case, given the false particulars, 
  it is hard to say that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning would have been meaningless 
  and that the jury would inevitably have accepted Doe’s evidence as truthful 
  based on the evidence capable of confirming his testimony.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, having regard to the nature of the 
  confirmatory evidence under consideration, I think that the trial judge should 
  have warned the jury in the strongest of terms that apart from the possibility 
  that Doe may have learned the information from other sources, they should also 
  consider the possibility that Doe may have received innocuous information from 
  the appellant and converted it into inculpatory information. In the passage 
  quoted above, it will be recalled that the trial judge mentioned only the first 
  possibility, referring to it as a suggestion made by the defence. With respect, 
  there are two reasons why in my view that instruction was insufficient in the 
  circumstances.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the warning about the possibility of 
  Doe learning information from other sources should have been framed as a direction 
  from the trial judge and not simply as a submission made by the defence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge should have warned the 
  jury, by way of direction, of the possibility that Doe received innocent information 
  from the appellant and converted it into inculpatory information. To my mind, 
  this is one of the great dangers associated with the testimony of jailhouse 
  informants and in cases where it conceivably exists, the jury should be alerted 
  to it and told to proceed with extreme caution. (For an insightful and comprehensive 
  discussion of the many dangers associated with the testimony of jailhouse informants, 
  see The Honourable Peter Cory, “<i>Report on the Inquiry Regarding Thomas Sophonow</i>” 
  (2001), at pp. 63-74). </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This case illustrates the point. By way of example, 
  Doe testified that the appellant told him that he disposed of a gun before the 
  police searched his camper. Manifestly, that statement, if made by the appellant, 
  was highly incriminating. But what if the appellant said to Doe - “the police 
  wrongly believe that I got rid of the murder weapon before they searched my 
  camper?” How easy it would be for Doe to twist that into the inculpatory statement 
  attributed to the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Another example arises from Doe’s testimony 
  about the appellant’s plan to implicate Elizabeth McBean as the killer. Suppose 
  the appellant told Doe that there was ample evidence implicating Ms. McBean 
  as the killer and that he planned to rely on that evidence as his primary line 
  of defence. Again, how simple for Doe to twist that into the inculpatory version 
  attributed to the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the 
  evidence capable of confirming Doe’s testimony was so compelling that the jury 
  would inevitably have accepted his evidence as truthful, <i>Vetrovec</i> warning 
  or not.</span></p>

  before the curative proviso can safely be applied, namely, that the circumstantial 
  evidence against the appellant was so overwhelming that even without Doe’s evidence, 
  the verdict would necessarily have been the same, I am of the view that although 
  the case is a close one, the circumstantial evidence falls just short of reaching 
  the overwhelming mark.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in leaving with the 
      jury the evidence of the appellant’s demeanour, his failure to ask questions 
      about the circumstances surrounding his brother’s death, and his failure

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>That in the context of his instructions 
      on after-the-fact conduct capable of supporting an inference of guilt, the

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Commencing with the first concern, I agree with the appellant 
  that the three impugned items of evidence should not have been left to the jury 
  as after-the-fact evidence capable of supporting an inference of guilt because 
  the probative value of this type of evidence is highly suspect and easily misinterpreted. 
  The point was recently addressed by this court in <i>R. v. Levert</i> (2001), 
  159 C.C.C. (3d) 71, at p. 81  where Rosenberg&nbsp;J.A. stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>The probative value of this type of evidence [unusually 
      calm reaction by the accused upon being confronted with an allegation of 
      sexual abuse] is highly suspect. In the two recent cases of Susan Nelles 
      and Guy Paul Morin use of the accused’s demeanour was found to have played 
      a part in the wrongful prosecution. <i>The Report of the Commission on Proceedings 
      Involving Guy Paul Morin</i>, (1998), Vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;1142 - 1150, contains 
      an extensive discussion of the dangers of admitting such demeanour evidence. 
      The expert and other evidence introduced at the Commission strongly suggests 
      that this evidence can be highly suspect and should be admitted at a criminal 
      trial with caution. Perceptions of guilt based on demeanour are likely to 
      depend upon highly subjective impressions that may be difficult to convey 
      to the jury and in any event the significance of the reaction will often 
      be equivocal. [Footnote omitted]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The concerns expressed by Rosenberg J.A. apply 
  with equal force to this case. In my view, rather than leaving the impugned 
  items of evidence to the jury as evidence capable of supporting an inference 
  of guilt, the trial judge should have told the jury to ignore them. With respect, 
  his failure to so instruct the jury constituted error.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Turning to the second concern, the trial judge 
  instructed the jury that in deciding whether or not the appellant’s apparent 
  lie about owning a shotgun amounted to “evidence of consciousness of guilt”, 
  they should: “[c]onsider all of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding 
  the accused’s making it. He was in a police station. He had just been told of 
  his brother’s death.”</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that this instruction 
  was inadequate and that the trial judge should have told the jury that the apparent 
  lie may simply have been the result of “confusion or forgetfulness combined 
  with the anxiety surrounding the police interview.”</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this submission. 
  The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the circumstances surrounding 
  the making of the statement. Although he could have gone further and instructed 
  the jury in the manner suggested by the appellant, in my view he was not required 
  to do so and his failure to elaborate further did not constitute error. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the third concern, it is submitted 
  that certain of the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct, such as leaving the 
  gun paraphernalia in his camper for the police to find, volunteering bodily 
  substances for testing, and not hiding his animosity towards his brother, constituted 
  evidence pointing to his innocence and that, as a matter of fairness, it should 
  have been left with the jury to counter the after-the-fact conduct pointing 
  the other way.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Since the trial of this matter, this court on 
  at least two occasions has stated that in appropriate circumstances, a trial 
  judge should draw the jury’s attention to after-the-fact conduct consistent 
  with innocence. (See <i>R. v. B. (S.C.)</i> (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 530, at 
  pp. 542-43 and <i>R. v. Schell</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 219, at p. 237. In 
  my view, this was such a case. The after-the-fact conduct of the appellant pointing 
  to guilt was weak and to the extent that the trial judge saw fit to leave it 
  with the jury at all, I believe that he should also have drawn the jury’s attention 
  to the after-the-fact conduct pointing to innocence. Accordingly, I would give 
  effect to the appellant’s position that the trial judge erred in his instructions 
  on after-the-fact conduct.</span></p>

    <p><span lang=EN-US>When I speak of reasonable doubt, I use the words in their 
      ordinary, natural meaning, not as a legal term having some special connotation.

      an honest and fair doubt, based upon common sense after having considered 
      all the evidence as a whole. It is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous 
      doubt borne out of sympathy or prejudice. Reasonable doubt may arise from 
      the evidence tendered at the trial, particularly from a conflict in the 
      evidence, or from a lack of evidence presented at the trial. However, reasonable 
      doubt must not be based upon conjecture or speculation. Further, it applies 
      only to essential matters. Individual items of evidence need not be proven 
      beyond a reasonable doubt. It may arise because you are unable to determine 
      the credibility or reliability of particular witnesses in relation to essential 
      matters. Finally, keep in mind that it is rarely possible to prove anything 
      with absolute or mathematical certainty. The burden on the Crown is to prove 
      guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond a shadow of a doubt. The Crown 
      is not compelled to prove guilt to the impossible degree of proof to a certainty. 
      In the end, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is the same as an absence 
      of a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Thompson</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 
  641 (C.A.), a case involving a charge of importing a narcotic, this court had 
  occasion to review the adequacy of the identical instruction given by the same 
  trial judge. The ratio of the decision, authored jointly by Morden and Goudge 
  JJ.A., is found in the following passage at p. 644:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>In our respectful view, the charge considered 
      as a whole in the overall context of the case does give rise to the reasonable 
      likelihood that the jury misapprehended the requisite standard of proof. 
      We acknowledge, at the outset, that the instructions do contain several 
      of the explanations which <i>Lifchus</i> and <i>Starr</i> said should be 
      included in a charge on reasonable doubt. We need not review them specifically. 
      We note, however, that the instructions do not include a statement, or anything 
      remotely suggesting, that more is required than proof that the accused is 
      probably guilty. We appreciate that this deficiency, in itself, is not necessarily 
      fatal (<i>R. v. Russell</i>, <i>supra</i>), but its absence is combined 
      with instructions, contrary to <i>Lifchus</i>, that the words “reasonable 
      doubt” are to be understood “in their ordinary natural meaning not as a 
      legal term having some special connotation” <i>and</i> that there is an 
      upper bracket of absolute or mathematical certainty. This combination leads 
      to the reasonable interpretation that the jury was <i>not</i> told that 
      probability is not enough but was implicitly told that probability of guilt, 
      or something close to it, would be sufficient. [Emphasis in original]</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Thompson</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> is potentially distinguishable from the case at hand because the sole 
  issue in <i>Thompson</i> was whether the accused was aware that she was transporting 
  narcotics in her suitcase. Although the evidence relating to her knowledge was 
  circumstantial, the trial judge, per <i>R. v. Cooper</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860, 
  did not provide the jury with any special instruction on the test to be met 
  before relying on circumstantial evidence to convict.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the present case, because the identity of 
  the killer was a central issue and the case against the appellant rested largely 
  on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge, on more than one occasion, instructed 
  the jury as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Before basing a verdict of guilty on circumstantial evidence, 
      you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 
  449, at p. 543 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J. for the majority observed that when appellate 
  courts are called upon to review “a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> jury charge”, they “… 
  must examine it to make sure that it was in substantial compliance with the 
  principles set out in that case.” In <i>R. v. Rhee</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 
  129, a more recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, Arbour J. for the 
  majority stated that when a portion of the Crown’s case ultimately rests on 
  circumstantial evidence, “… accurate instructions on reasonable doubt as it 
  pertains to circumstantial evidence …”, can be considered in determining whether 
  the substantial compliance test has been met. Along the same lines, in <i>R. 
  v. Nguyen</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 3 (C.A.), a murder case in which the identity 
  of the killer was the only live issue and the case for the Crown rested entirely 
  on circumstantial evidence, this court held that a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> charge 
  similar to the one in issue met the substantial compliance test because: “… 
  as a whole [it] was fair, balanced and otherwise error-free, it properly linked 
  the criminal standard of proof with the presumption of innocence and it contained 
  three separate specific instructions on the high onus the Crown must meet to 
  discharge its burden in a circumstantial case” (at para. 45). </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this case, I am not persuaded that the special 
  instruction on reasonable doubt pertaining to circumstantial evidence was sufficient 
  to overcome the deficiencies identified in <i>Thompson</i>. My concerns are 
  threefold. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the special instruction on circumstantial 
  evidence did not apply to Doe’s direct evidence. Accordingly, the jury would 
  have approached his evidence with no special requirements in mind. Given the 
  importance of his testimony to the Crown’s case, I cannot be certain that the 
  jury did not use his evidence, along with the circumstantial evidence, in concluding 
  that the Crown had proved its case to the requisite standard. To the extent 
  that the jury may have used Doe’s evidence for that purpose, I question whether 
  the special instruction on circumstantial evidence was sufficient to cure the 
  deficiencies in the general instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, unlike the situation in <i>Nguyen, </i>the charge in 
  the present case was not otherwise error-free. Having regard to the nature of 
  the other errors, I am concerned that, cumulatively, they may well have had 
  an impact on the jury’s assessment of whether a reasonable doubt existed. (See 
  generally <i>R. v. Starr, </i> <i>R. v. Avetysan</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 
  77 (S.C.C.) and the specific observations of Iacobucci&nbsp;J. in <i>R. v. Russell</i>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Third, I am of the view that in cases such as 
  this, where identity is in issue and where the case for the Crown readily surpasses 
  the civil standard of proof, it is especially important that trial judges locate 
  for the jury the reasonable doubt standard above the probability standard. Unfortunately, 
  that was not done here. Indeed, as this court concluded in <i>Thompson,</i> 
  the instruction in issue implied that probability of guilt or something close 
  to it would suffice for a conviction.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I am of the view that, in 
  the circumstances of this case, the instructions on reasonable doubt were inadequate
