<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Nick Borkovich of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated February 7, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="center">Released Orally December 17, 2002</p>    
<P>
  [1] It is clear that the standard of review of a decision of the Consent and 
  Capacity Board is reasonableness. The Board here correctly set out the two factors 
  in the statutory test for capacity: ability to understand the information relevant 
  to making a decision about treatment, and ability to appreciate the reasonably 
  foreseeable consequences of the decision or a lack of a decision. </p>    <P>
  [2] The question is whether it was reasonable for the Board to conclude, as 
  it did on the evidence before it, that because of his mental illness the appellant 
  lacked both abilities.</p>    <P>
  [3] These are findings of fact, and in our view, there was ample medical evidence 
  to sustain the Board's conclusion. It was not obliged to accept the appellant's 
  evidence which tended to the opposite conclusion although with some equivocation.</p>    <P>
  [4] This case is not like Starson v. Swayze. First, here, unlike Starson, the 
  medical evidence made clear that the appellant suffers from a delusional disorder 
  which has profoundly influenced his ability to take in and understand information 
  relevant to the decision to take treatment or to appreciate the consequences 
  of that decision. Second, the court's role in itself addressing the individual's 
  capacity arose in Starson only once it found the Board's decision to be unreasonable. 
  We do not reach that stage in this case.</p>    <P>
  [5] In our view, the appeal must be dismissed. No order as to costs.</p>
