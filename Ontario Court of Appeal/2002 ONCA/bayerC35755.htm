<p><b>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sidney Lederman dated January 2,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This appeal arises out of the infringement by Apotex Inc. (“Apotex”), 
  a leading Canadian pharmaceutical company, of the patent for a coronary disease 
  capsule of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (“Bayer”), a major international company 
  in the same field.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principal issues on the appeal relate to the appropriate remedy 
  for patent infringement. The trial judge determined that the remedy in this 
  case should be, at Bayer’s election, either damages or an accounting for profits 
  earned through the infringement.  The trial judge then referred the quantification 
  of damages or profits to a referee.  However, he determined one specific matter 
  relevant to the question of quantification, namely that all capsules sold by 
  Apotex should be counted.  The appellant, Apotex, appeals both of these components 
  of the trial judge’s decision.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the first stage, the trial judge, Lederman J., held that Apotex had 
  infringed Bayer’s patent:  see <i>Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and Miles Canada 
  Inc. v. Apotex Inc. (1995), 60 C.P.R. (3d) 58</i>.  This conclusion was affirmed 
  by this court: (1998), 82 C.P.R. (3d) 526.  The court, speaking through Cumming 
  J. (<i>ad hoc</i>), also held, at p. 541:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Bayer and Miles are entitled to damages, or an accounting of the profits 
      made by the defendant, for the infringement of its patent over this period 
      of time.  The matter is referred back to the trial judge for a determination 
      of the remedy consequential to the finding of an infringement of Bayer’s 
      patent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Lederman J. received evidence and conducted a hearing on the remedy 
  issue.  He wrote a comprehensive set of reasons, and concluded in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>Section 57(1) of the <i>Patent Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, authorizes 
      an award of an accounting for the profits earned through the infringement.  
      The circumstances present in this case warrant that this remedy be available 
      to Bayer.  The plaintiffs, therefore, will have an Order awarding damages 
      or an accounting of the profits made by the defendant for patent infringement, 
      whichever they may, upon inquiry, elect.</p>
    <p>The parties are to prepare a timetable for conducting the reference.  On 
      that reference, in respect of damages or profits, sales of all infringing 
      Apo-Nifed capsules are to be considered and Apotex may not apportion revenues 
      as between those Apo-Nifed capsules actually bitten, and those that were 
      swallowed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex appeals from the conclusions reached by the trial judge in both 
  of these paragraphs.  Apotex’s position is that Bayer should be limited to the 
  remedy of damages and should not be permitted to elect (as Bayer in fact has 
  elected) the alternative, and equitable, remedy of accounting for the profits 
  received through the infringement.  Moreover, Apotex contends that the trial 
  judge erred by giving <i>any</i> directions to the referee or, in the alternative, 
  he erred by giving the direction that all of the capsules sold by Apotex should 
  be counted and serve as the basis for the quantification of damages or profits.</p>

  </span> Apotex contends that the trial judge made three errors in his analysis 
  supporting the conclusion that Bayer could elect the remedy of an accounting 
  for profits.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <u><span lang=EN-US>Burden of proof</span></u><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'></span></h4>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The first alleged error is that the trial judge reversed the burden 
  of proof by not directing himself to a consideration of whether Bayer had demonstrated 
  an entitlement to the remedy of an accounting for profits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this is a very weak argument.  Section 57(1) of the <i>Patent&nbsp;Act</i>, 
  R.S.C.&nbsp;1985,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;33, gives the trial judge in an action for infringement 
  of a patent a wide discretion to “make such order as the . . . judge sees fit”, 
  including, in paragraph (b), an order “for and respecting . . . account”.  In 
  several leading patent cases, this discretion has been specifically applied 
  to the remedy of an accounting for profits:  see, for example, <i>Beloit Canada 
  Ltd. v. Valmet-Dominion Inc.</i> (1997), 73 C.P.R. (3d) 321 at 361 (F.C.A.) 
  and <i>Apotex Inc. v. Merck &amp; Co.</i> (1996), 70 C.P.R. (3d) 183 (F.C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Apotex v. Merck &amp; Co.</i> is particularly relevant to the present 
  appeal because in that case Apotex made precisely the same argument about the 
  trial judge reversing the burden of proof.  In brief reasons, Linden J.A. rejected 
  this argument, concluding that “in matters of the granting of equitable relief 
  no legal presumptions are controlling, something the Trial Judge clearly understood” 
  (p. 184).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would say the same about Lederman J.’s reasons in the present case.  
  In his endorsement dated June 17, 1999, which directed a hearing on the remedy 
  issue, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The remedy of an accounting of profits is not one to which a plaintiff 
      is entitled as of right following a finding of infringement.  Rather, the 
      right to elect such a remedy is a matter within the discretion of a trial 
      judge.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, in his reasons granting the accounting for profits remedy, 
  the trial judge very carefully considered a wide range of relevant factors, 
  including delay, windfall, complexity of calculation (as compared to damages) 
  and the conduct of Apotex (“when Bayer commenced this action, Apotex as licensee 
  attacked the patent which put Bayer in jeopardy in respect of its entire market”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, the trial judge did not err – indeed he did not come close 
  to erring – on the elementary question of burden of proof.  He understood that 
  the remedy of an accounting for profits was a discretionary one and he carefully 
  and fairly considered the relevant factors before making his decision.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is clear that at both stages of the action, liability and remedy, 
  Apotex’s central submission was that the unique feature of Bayer’s patent was 
  the biteability or “instant oral release” component of its capsule and that 
  Apotex’s capsule was not marketed for sale with any emphasis on this feature.  
  Lederman J. rejected that argument.  In the judgment under appeal he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[I]t is not open to the defendant to argue that a single aspect of the 
      infringing product was not a factor in the marketability of that product.  
      It may be that the defendant could have successfully marketed a product 
      with features different from the plaintiffs’.  The fact is that it did not.  
      Since the plaintiffs’ patent pertains to the whole of the product, so too 
      does the defendant’s infringement.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex contends that the trial judge misconstrued Bayer’s patent when 
  he stated in another part of his reasons that “Bayer’s patent is not limited 
  to the biteable capsule” because it ignores the description in Bayer’s patent 
  of a capsule with “instant oral release”.  Accordingly, Apotex submits, any 
  remedy should be limited to only biteable capsules.  Since very few of Apotex’s 
  infringing capsules were actually bitten, this would greatly reduce the quantum 
  of any remedy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are several problems with this argument.  First, Apotex’s capsules 
  have been held by the trial judge and this court to be biteable capsules.  So 
  any “error” correction to restrict the patent to merely biteable capsules would 
  not help Apotex because its capsules have been determined to be biteable, and 
  hence infringing, capsules.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, even if some (indeed most) of Apotex’s capsules were excluded 
  under a narrowed interpretation of the patent, that is irrelevant in terms of 
  which remedy is appropriate.  Such an exclusion would speak only to quantum, 
  not to choice of remedy.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the trial judge did not commit the error alleged by Apotex.  
  His use of the word “limited” was not meant to state that the biteability feature 
  was not an element of Bayer’s patent.  Indeed, he meant, and conveyed, the opposite, 
  namely that Apotex had copied all of the elements of the patent and not just 
  the biteability feature.  This is clear from the sentence immediately following 
  the impugned sentence.  The two sentences together state: “First, Bayer’s patent 
  is not limited to the biteable capsule.  The evidence at trial was that, while 
  the many individual aspects of the plaintiff’s product were not unique, there 
  was uniqueness in their specific combination”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, Apotex’s argument on this point is a disguised attempt to 
  re-argue the main point it lost at the liability stage of the trial – the nature 
  of its infringement of Bayer’s patent.  Moreover, the argument is irrelevant 
  on the issue of choice of remedy for infringement of the patent.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>            </span>(c)       <u>The link 
  between infringement and profits</u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex contends that the trial judge erred by failing to consider whether 
  Apotex’s profits were attributable to factors other than its infringement of 
  Bayer’s patent.  It submits that an apportionment of profits is possible because 
  the biteability factor in Bayer’s patent was virtually irrelevant in terms of 
  Apotex’s sales of its capsules.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In making this submission, Apotex relies on <i>Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial 
  Oil Ltd.</i> (1996), 71 C.P.R. (3d) 26 (F.C.A.) (<i>“Lubrizol”</i>).  In that 
  case, Imperial Oil infringed Lubrizol’s<i> </i>patent by using its dispersant 
  additive in its motor oil.  Although the appeal related to the production of 
  documents, the context within which this issue arose was Imperial Oil’s assertion 
  that it was entitled to apportion its profits on its sales of the infringing 
  motor oils because those sales depended in part on non-infringing components 
  of the product.  The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with this submission.  Hugessen 
  J.A. stated, at pp. 30-31:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The issue of apportionment is at bottom a question of fact bearing on the 
      relationship between the profits earned and the appropriation of the plaintiff’s 
      invention.  It may be possible for Imperial to show that some part of the 
      profits made on the infringing sales are not profits “arising from” the 
      infringement in that they are not caused by but simply made on the occasion 
      of such infringement.</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . . </p>
    <p>[T]he reality is that Lubrizol did not invent motor oil and that Imperial’s 
      motor oils contain other additives than the one here in issue . . . .  Thus 
      it is possible that such oils have achieved their market share and attendant 
      profits for reasons other than the presence of Lubrizol’s patented additive.  
      A finding that Imperial’s motor oils infringed the Lubrizol patent does 
      not necessarily amount to a finding that all the profits from the sales 
      of such motor oils are profits arising from the infringement.</p>

  characteristic.  Accordingly, an accounting for profits should permit an apportionment 
  to take account of this factor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  <i>Lubrizol</i> is inapplicable because in the present 
  case there was an express finding by the trial judge, confirmed by this court, 
  that the Bayer capsule as a whole, not just its biteability factor, was protected 
  by the patent.  As restated and explained by the trial judge in his reasons 
  relating to remedy:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The defendant manufactured and sold a product which, <i>in its entirety</i>, 
      infringed the plaintiff’s patent.  It made, presumably, a profit from those 
      sales.  It defies logic to suggest that these two facts taken together do 
      not add up to a causal link.</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p>Since the defendant’s product was <i>infringing by virtue of its entire 
      configuration</i>, it is conceptually impossible for there to be a division 
      of profits between infringing and non-infringing elements. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with this analysis, as did this court when it upheld Lederman 
  J.’s identical  line of reasoning in his judgment on the liability issue.  As 
  expressed by Cumming J. (<i>ad&nbsp;hoc</i>) in the appeal judgment, at p. 531:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The trial judge found that claims 1 and 14 of &#8242;582 constitute product 
      claims in that they describe a physical product, as opposed to addressing 
      how the capsule is to be used.</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p>On the basis of the evidence tendered at trial, the trial judge found that 
      Apotex’s product falls within the claims of Bayer’s &#8242;582 patent.  
      I agree with Lederman J.’s reasoning and conclusions on this issue.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, I reach the same conclusion as in the previous section of 
  these reasons.  Apotex’s argument is a disguised attempt to re-argue the main 
  point it lost at the liability stage of the trial and it is irrelevant on the 
  remedy issue.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(2)            <u>The direction to the referee</u></h4>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For ease of reference, I set out again the passage in the trial judge’s 
  reasons which the appellant challenges:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The parties are to prepare a timetable for conducting the reference.  On 
      that reference, in respect of damages or profits, sales of all infringing 
      Apo-Nifed capsules are to be considered and Apotex may not apportion revenues 
      as between those Apo-Nifed capsules actually bitten, and those that were 
      swallowed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Apotex challenges this conclusion in 
  two respects.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex contends that the trial judge erred by giving any direction to 
  the referee.  It submits that the issue of directions was not properly before 
  the court and that all issues relating to an accounting for profits should have 
  been left to the referee.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have difficulty understanding this submission.  The principal arguments 
  Apotex made in the two stages of the hearing were that the core of Bayer’s patent 
  was the biteability feature and that there was no causal link between Apotex’s 
  infringement of the patent and its profits.  Apotex initiated, and was given 
  the opportunity to fully develop, these arguments.  The trial judge rejected 
  them.  Having done so, it made perfect sense for the trial judge to remove them 
  from the quantification hearing to be conducted by the referee.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(b)            <u>Function of referee usurped</u></h4>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex contends that the question of whether the profits arising on 
  the sale of an infringing product result from the infringement is a question 
  of fact for the referee and should not be determined by the trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this argument overlaps almost completely with the previous 
  one.  Before the trial judge, Apotex argued strenuously that there was no causal 
  link between its infringement and its profits.  It cannot now resile from that 
  position and argue that the component of the apportionment issue relating to 
  the nature of the patent infringement and to the number of pills to be counted 
  on the reference should be left to the referee.  These matters were determined 
  by the trial judge in response to Apotex’s arguments.  They are not live issues.  
  On the reference, the referee must count all of the infringing capsules sold 
  by Apotex.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In any event, a referee conducts a reference pursuant to the directions 
  of a judge and makes a report to the judge.  I can see no objection to a trial 
  judge structuring the conduct of a reference to take account of the judge’s 
  decisions leading up to the reference.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span

  </span> In <i>Apotex Inc. v. Merck &amp; Co., supra,</i> Linden J.A. considered 
  the remedy of an accounting for profits for infringement of a patent.  He stated 
  that “the matter of granting of this equitable remedy is in the discretion of 
  the Trial Judge and is not lightly interfered with by the Court of Appeal” (p. 
  183).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with this statement.  In the present case, I see no basis for 
  interfering with the trial judge’s conclusion that an accounting for profits 
  is an appropriate remedy, at Bayer’s election.  Moreover, the direction the 
  trial judge made to the referee on the apportionment of revenues issue was one 
  that flowed naturally and, in my view, correctly from the decisions he made 
  on the liability and remedy issues.</p>

    on the appeal, specifically an affidavit by William Dovey, an accountant, 
    relating to Apotex’s export sales of the infringing patent.  The appellant 
    contested this motion, but also filed a responding affidavit by Jack Kay, 
    the President of Apotex.  The respondents then filed a reply affidavit by 
    William Dovey.  All of these affidavits were filed virtually on the eve of 
    the hearing of the appeal.  In my view, the fresh evidence proposed by the 
    appellant does not meet the test for admission set out in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, 
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  Accordingly, none of the affidavits should be admitted.</p>
