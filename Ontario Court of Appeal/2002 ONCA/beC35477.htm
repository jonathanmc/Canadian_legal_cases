<p>On appeal from the order of Justice D. Ferguson dated November 20, 2000.</p>
<p><b>CRONK J.A.:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves the nature and extent of 
  permissible cross-examination of a complainant, at a preliminary inquiry in 
  a sexual assault case, concerning the complainant’s diary, where the stated 
  purpose of the questioning is to lay the foundation for a subsequent production 
  application at trial under s. 278.3 of the<i> Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following a preliminary inquiry held on August 28, 2000 before 
  Justice L.E. Chester, the respondent was committed for trial on multiple counts 
  of sexual assault-related offences.  During the preliminary inquiry, counsel 
  for the respondent sought to cross-examine the complainant on matters relating 
  to his personal diary.  The preliminary inquiry judge disallowed the proposed 
  questioning.  On November 17, 2000, Justice Ferguson granted the respondent’s 
  application for <i>certiorari</i> and remitted the matter back for the continuation 
  of the inquiry.  The Crown now appeals that decision.  For the reasons that 
  follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>BACKGROUND FACTS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant, the respondent’s nephew, told police of two 
  alleged incidents of assault by the respondent at the respondent’s trailer on 
  two different occasions in 1999.  On July 15, 1999, the day prior to the second 
  alleged incident, the complainant had written the following note on a piece 
  of paper taken from a notepad:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A long time ago, oh, say 3 or 4 months ago, My Uncle [B. (E.)] touched 
      me and then made me touch him.  I feel so guilty.  I mean he’s a guy+ I’m 
      a guy so does that mean I’m gay?  Probably not because he forced me.  I 
      HATE HIM.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>The alleged incidents came to light when the complainant’s note was discovered 
  by his father.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant’s evidence-in-chief at the preliminary inquiry 
  was received by videotaped statement.  In his statement, the complainant indicated 
  that he had a journal or diary, but that he made the note on a piece of paper 
  from a different notepad because, at the time, he couldn’t find his diary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his videotaped statement, the complainant also stated that 
  some two to three weeks before the second alleged incident, and before he wrote 
  the note, he informed a friend in general terms of the first incident with the 
  respondent.  He also indicated that the same friend had gone with him to the 
  respondent’s trailer after the first alleged incident, but before the second.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant’s diary was not tendered as part of the Crown’s 
  case at the preliminary inquiry.  On the record before this court, it does not 
  appear that the diary was in the possession of the Crown prior to or at the 
  time of the inquiry.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the respondent did not seek production 
  of the diary, or any part of it, at the preliminary inquiry.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On cross-examination at the inquiry, the complainant testified 
  that he had not transposed the contents of the note into his diary.  He was 
  also asked on cross-examination whether he had written anything in his diary 
  about the two incidents that resulted in the criminal charges against the respondent.  
  Before Crown counsel could complete an objection, the complainant answered the 
  question in the negative.  In material part, the exchange was as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.  Have you written anything about these incidents, the two incidents 
      that resulted in the criminal charges being laid against your Uncle [B.(E.)]?  
      Have you written anything about those two incidents in your diary?</p>
    <p>A.  No.</p>
    <p>[Crown Counsel].  Objection.  This is privileged under the <i>Code</i>.  
      If counsel wants to get into a diary, he can’t ask it at a prelim.  He has 
      to bring an application pursuant to the <i>Criminal Code</i> with regard 
      to private matters, and I object to counsel getting in – into this.  The 
      note was discovered by the parent, became public knowledge, but a diary 
      or confidential items that persons write for themselves are protected under 
      the <i>Code</i> without appropriate application and at a criminal hearing 
      – at a preliminary hearing there’s no jurisdiction on the Court to – to 
      bring that application. [sic]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent thereafter sought to question the 
  complainant on various matters relating to the diary, including certain of the 
  topics in the diary.  The preliminary inquiry judge declined to permit such 
  questioning.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the respondent’s <i>certiorari</i> application, the reviewing 
  judge concluded that the proposed line of questioning was not prohibited by 
  s. 278.3 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> or by any common law rule of evidence.  
  He granted <i>certiorari</i> and ordered the continuation of the preliminary 
  inquiry, to permit cross-examination of the complainant on:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (a)        the location of the diary;</p>
    <p> (b)        whether the diary contains descriptions of several encounters 
      with the respondent on occasions other than the alleged offence dates;</p>
    <p> (c)        whether the diary contains references to the presence of another 
      person on those other occasions; and</p>
    <p> (d)        whether the diary includes a chronological record of the complainant’s 
      activities over a period of time when the complainant had some involvement 
      with the respondent.</p>

  </span></span> Sections 278.1 to 278.91 of the <i>Criminal </i>Code are set 
  out in full in Appendix A to these reasons.  Having regard to the positions 
  of the parties on this appeal, it is useful to now set out ss. 278.3(1) to (4):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>278.3</b>  (1) An accused who seeks production of a record referred 
      to in subsection 278.2(1) must make an application to the judge before whom 
      the accused is to be, or is being, tried.</p>
    <p>     (2)  For greater certainty, an application under subsection (1) may 
      not be made to a judge or justice presiding at any other proceedings, including 
      a preliminary inquiry.</p>

    <p> <i>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i> 
      the grounds on which the accused relies to establish that the record is 
      likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to 
      testify.</p>
    <p>    (4) Any one or more of the following assertions by the accused are 
      not sufficient on their own to establish that the record is likely relevant 
      to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify:</p>
    <p> <i>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p> <i>(f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></i> that the record may relate to the reliability of the testimony 
      of the complainant or witness merely because the complainant or witness 
      has received or is receiving psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling;</p>
    <p> <i>(g)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>All counsel agree that questions concerning 
  the actual contents of a record containing personal information, such as the 
  complainant’s diary, are impermissible at the preliminary inquiry.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Crown counsel acknowledges that at the preliminary inquiry the 
  complainant could be asked, generally, if he made reports, oral or written, 
  concerning the subject-matter of the charges against the respondent and, additionally, 
  whether his diary exists.  She argues, however, that a preliminary inquiry judge 
  does not have jurisdiction to allow defence counsel to cross-examine a complainant 
  who is alleging a sexual offence enumerated in s. 278.2 of the<i> Criminal Code</i>, 
  on the <i>contents</i> of a record such as a diary.  In her submission, virtually 
  all of the questions proposed to be asked of the complainant intrude on the 
  contents of the diary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the alternative, Crown counsel argues that to determine the 
  relevance of the “contents” of a record containing personal information, the 
  complainant’s constitutional rights to privacy, equality and security of the 
  person must be balanced against the accused’s constitutional rights to security 
  of the person and to make full answer and defence.  In these circumstances, 
  she submits, the scope of cross-examination concerning the record must be limited 
  by consideration of the principles enshrined in ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  It would follow that only general questions about the circumstances 
  and manner in which the diary was made would be permitted, excluding any questions 
  about the contents of the diary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the respondent argues that a preliminary 
  inquiry provides an opportunity for an accused to test and obtain discovery 
  not only of the Crown’s case but, also, to obtain evidence for a variety of 
  applications, including a production application under s.&nbsp;278.3 before 
  the trial judge.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He submits that an accused’s statutory right to cross-examine 
  witnesses called during a preliminary inquiry should not be limited absent a 
  clear expression of Parliament’s intention to do so.  To do otherwise, he argues, 
  would improperly restrict the respondent’s right to cross-examine for the purpose 
  of eliciting evidence to be subsequently relied upon on an application for production 
  under s.&nbsp;278.3, thereby impairing the respondent’s constitutional right 
  to make full answer and defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He further argues that the proposed questions are intended to 
  focus on the manner in which the diary was created and maintained by the complainant, 
  the physical characteristics of the diary, and a general description of the 
  topics found within the diary.  Consequently, he submits, the proposed questions 
  do not require the complainant to provide or to recount his recollection of 
  the exact contents of the diary.</p>

  (the “CLA”), argues that s.&nbsp;278.3, by its terms, does not preclude the 
  suggested line of questioning at the inquiry.  She submits that s. 278.1 is 
  intended to prevent defence counsel from gaining production of a third party 
  record at a preliminary inquiry merely on request.  She maintains that neither 
  ss. 278.1 to 278.91, nor the relevant jurisprudence, prohibit defence counsel

  foundation for a subsequent production application under s. 278.3.</p>

  </span></span> At issue on this appeal is the proper balance to be struck between 
  the constitutionally protected right of the complainant to privacy, and that 
  of the accused to make full answer and defence.  In this case, the engagement 
  of these rights also requires consideration of the jurisdiction of preliminary 
  inquiry judges.</p>

  </span></span> The tension between these competing constitutional rights has 
  been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in a number of cases in which 
  the fundamental equivalency of such rights has been recognized.  That court 
  has stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the one hand stands the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  
      On the other hand stands the complainant’s and witness’s right to privacy.  
      Neither right may be defined in such a way as to negate the other and both 
      sets of rights are informed by the equality rights at play in this context.  
    </p>
    <p>(<i>R. v. Mills</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at 339, per McLachlin 
      and Iacobucci JJ.).  Thus,</p>
    <p>… <i>Charter</i> rights must be examined in a contextual manner to resolve 
      conflicts between them.  Therefore, unlike s. 1 balancing, where societal 
      interests are sometimes allowed to override <i>Charter</i> rights, under 
      s. 7 rights must be defined so that they do not conflict with each other.  
      The rights of full answer and defence, and privacy, must be defined in light 
      of each other, and both must be defined in light of the equality provisions 
      of s. 15.</p>

  </span></span> In<i> Mills</i>, an accused charged with sexual assault and unlawful 
  sexual touching of a 13-year-old complainant, sought production of the records 
  of the complainant’s psychiatrist.  Without first bringing a production application, 
  the accused unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of ss. 278.1 to 
  278.91.  The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at 370-371:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In summary, the following broad considerations apply to the definition 
      of the rights at stake in this appeal.  <i>The right of the accused to make 
      full answer and defence is a core principle of fundamental justice, but 
      it does not automatically entitle the accused to gain access to information 
      contained in the private records of complainants and witnesses.  Rather, 
      the scope of the right to make full answer and defence must be determined 
      in light of privacy and equality rights of complainants and witnesses.</i>  
      It is clear that the right to full answer and defence is not engaged where 
      the accused seeks information that will only serve to distort the truth-seeking 
      purpose of a trial, and in such a situation, privacy and equality rights 
      are paramount.  On the other hand, where the information contained in a 
      record directly bears on the right to make full answer and defence, privacy 
      rights must yield to the need to avoid convicting the innocent.  Most cases, 
      however, will not be so clear, and <i>in assessing applications for production</i> 
      courts must determine the weight to be granted to the interests protected 
      by privacy and full answer and defence in the particular circumstances of 
      each case.  Full answer and defence will be more centrally implicated where 
      the information contained in a record is part of the case to meet or where 
      its potential probative value is high.  A complainant’s privacy interest 
      is very high where the confidential information contained in a record concerns 
      the complainant’s personal identity or where the confidentiality of the 
      record is vital to protect a therapeutic relationship. [Emphasis added]</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Mills</span></i> involved a production application 
  relating to records in the possession of a third party.  While we are not concerned 
  with such an application in this case, in my view the principles outlined in 
  <i>Mills</i> and related cases inform the assessment to be undertaken whenever 
  the right of an accused to make full answer and defence, protected under ss. 
  7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, is placed in direct 
  or indirect competition with a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy, protected 
  under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Thus, consideration of the <i>Mills</i> principles 
  is appropriate where the court is asked, as on the present appeal, to examine 
  the privacy rights of a complainant in relation to his diary in light of the 
  accused’s statutory right to cross-examine witnesses at a preliminary inquiry 
  and his constitutional right to make full answer and defence.</p>

  </span></span> The common law rules governing production of confidential third 
  party records were clarified by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> 
  (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  This seminal case proposed a two-stage 
  approach to determining whether such records should be produced to an accused 
  in a criminal proceeding.  The reasons of Justice L’Heureux-Dubé (for four members 
  of the court) emphasized that such production applications should only be entertained 
  at trial and, further, that a preliminary inquiry judge is without jurisdiction 
  to order the production of such records.</p>

  </span></span> In response to <i>O’Connor</i>, ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> came into force on May 12, 1997.  These sections address the production 
  in sexual offence proceedings of complainants’ and witnesses’ records in the 
  possession of the Crown or third parties.  They establish various protections 
  for persons whose private records are sought to be obtained by an accused.</p>

  </span></span> A review of these sections reveals that Parliament adopted the 
  approach to the assessment of production requests set out in Justice L’Heureux-Dubé’s 
  reasons in <i>O’Connor</i>.  Thus, such applications cannot be made to a preliminary 
  inquiry judge and must be made to the trial judge (ss. 278.3(1) and (2)).  Further, 
  under these provisions:</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Thus, Parliament’s legislative response to <i>O’Connor</i> 
  explicitly recognizes the privacy interests which attach to personal journals 
  and diaries, and mandates that reasonable expectations of privacy in relation 
  to such records be respected and taken into account in determining production 
  applications.</span></p>

  </span></span> As noted, Crown counsel argues that the principles enshrined 
  in ss. 278.1 to 278.91 should inform the assessment of the propriety of the 
  questions proposed to be asked of the complainant concerning his diary.  The 
  respondent and the CLA oppose this approach, on the ground that it would effect 
  an improper inferential expansion of the reach of these sections.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is clear that ss. 278.1 to 278.91 pertain solely to production 
  applications at trial.  Thus, they do not directly govern the issue raised on 
  this appeal.  However, in my view, even without resort to these sections, a 
  balancing of the expectation of privacy which attaches to the complainant’s 
  diary in this case, and the respondent’s right to make full answer and defence, 
  is required both by the constitutionally protected standards embodied in the 
  <i>Charter</i> and by the common law, as established in <i>Mills</i> and <i>O’Connor</i> 
  and related cases.  In this wider context, ss. 278.1 to 278.91 may be viewed 
  as reflecting Parliament’s mandated approach to such balancing on the occasion 
  of a production application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moreover, ss. 278.1 to 278.91 are relevant to this appeal in 
  at least one important respect.  Section 278.3(3) obliges an accused to establish 
  an evidentiary foundation of “likely relevance” to support an application for 
  production of a private record.  Counsel for the respondent argues that if he 
  is precluded from asking any questions at the preliminary inquiry concerning 
  the complainant’s diary, save general ones, it is difficult to conceive of how 
  the defence could ever meet the threshold requirement of establishing “likely 
  relevance” for the purpose of a s. 278.3 application.   He submits that while 
  questions concerning the actual contents of the diary are impermissible, only 
  those questions which bear on the “intensely private aspects” of the diary should 
  be precluded.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the CLA similarly argues that not every question 
  regarding the substantive contents of a private record is precluded.  She suggests 
  that at a preliminary inquiry defence counsel should be permitted to ask a complainant 
  if a particular topic is covered within his or her private record, but should 
  not be permitted to question the complainant about what he or she wrote in the 
  record concerning the identified topic.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the established jurisprudence and relevant policy

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the evidentiary basis necessary to support the analysis 
  required to determine a s. 278.3 production application can be established through 
  a variety of means, including by cross-examination of Crown witnesses at a preliminary 
  inquiry.  McLachlin J. (as she then was) and Iacobucci J., writing for the majority 
  in <i>Mills</i>, stated at 386-387:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… This [evidentiary] basis can be established through Crown disclosure, 
      defence witnesses, <i>the cross-examination of Crown witnesses at both the 
      preliminary inquiry and the trial</i>, and expert evidence, see: <i>O’Connor, 
      supra</i>, at para. 146, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.    [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>The majority in <i>Mills</i> did not distinguish

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>O’Connor</i>,  L’Heureux-Dubé J. commented, at  66:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In establishing the required evidentiary basis, the applicant may resort 
      to the Crown’s disclosure, to its own witnesses, <i>and to cross-examination 
      of the Crown witnesses at both the preliminary inquiry and the trial</i>.  
      On some occasions, it may also be necessary to introduce expert evidence 
      to lay the foundation for a production application … regardless of when 
      it is brought, an application for production will not succeed if it is not 
      supported by evidence demonstrating the likely relevance of the records.

lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The developed jurisprudence also supports the position of the 
  respondent and the CLA in a second respect.    It evidences a trend to distinguish 
  between cross-examination concerning a private record which intrudes on the 
  private or personal domain of the author of the record, and that which does 
  not.</p>

  involvement in therapy.  Crown counsel objected on the basis that the questions 
  were irrelevant or, alternatively, prohibited by ss. 278.2 to 278.8 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  In rejecting this argument, Jennis Prov. J. held that cross-examination 
  relating to the source and existence of third party records that “may likely 
  be relevant to the allegations before the Court” was proper.  He stated, at 
  para. 16:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

<blockquote>

      to ask questions of the witness which will relate to the existence and source 
      of such potential records provided that those questions do not call for 
      answers which relate to those, “Intensely private aspects” of the life of

      basis for such an application, which must be made to the trial judge.</i>  
      Whether that application is made prior to the trial or during it is a matter 
      of timing and choice by counsel.  Indeed, it would be hard to imagine any 
      basis for objection to such a cross-examination, given that the issue of

  was to establish that she did not record sexual abuse by the accused in the 
  diary.  In upholding the trial judge’s decision to disallow such questioning, 
  the British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded that to permit such questioning, 
  for the stated purpose, would necessarily lead to a wide-ranging examination 
  of the full diary, as counsel sought to demonstrate the significance, or otherwise, 
  of the absence of recorded abuse.  For this reason, the court declined to interfere 
  with the trial judge’s ruling but noted, at 253: “<i>If it had been possible 
  to confine the questions simply to the fact that the entries made no mention

  </span></span> The discovery aspect of the preliminary inquiry is supported 
  by the clear statutory right of an accused under s. 540(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> to cross-examine witnesses called by the prosecution at the inquiry.  
  Although the right to cross-examine is not unlimited, particularly in sexual 
  assault cases, the fundamental importance of the right in the criminal process 
  is unquestioned.  It forms an integral part of an accused’s constitutional right 
  to make full answer and defence (<i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at 
  663-65, per Cory J.; <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.)

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As observed by Cory J. in <i>Osolin</i>, at 
  667, a careful balancing must take place to ensure “… that the complainant’s 
  cross-examination is relevant and pertinent and not needlessly extended for 
  improper purposes”.</span></p>

  </span></span> In this case, we are not concerned with a pre-trial production 
  request by the respondent, nor could such an application be brought before the 
  preliminary inquiry judge.  We are concerned with the accused’s fundamental 
  right to cross-examine a complainant at a preliminary inquiry, as confirmed 
  by statute, and the proper limitations on such cross-examination having regard 
  to the competing constitutional rights of the complainant and the respondent.  
  As discussed further in these reasons, in my view, the significant privacy interest 
  of the complainant in his diary operates to limit the scope of permissible questioning, 
  but does not preclude all questioning concerning the diary.</p>

  </span></span> Crown counsel submits that a preliminary inquiry judge lacks 
  jurisdiction to allow the defence to cross-examine the complainant in the manner 
  suggested because the determination of the relevance of the proposed questions 
  necessarily involves the balancing of the complainant’s constitutional rights 
  against those of the respondent, an assessment which is said to be beyond the 
  power of the preliminary inquiry judge.  </p>

  derives from statute and is constrained in relation to constitutional issues.

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, however, no issue regarding the constitutionality 
  of legislation arises, nor is it necessary for the preliminary inquiry judge, 
  in assessing permissible cross-examination, to determine the scope of a right 
  under the <i>Charter</i> or an alleged denial or infringement of such a protected 
  right.  Rather, what is necessary, in my view, is a determination of the relevance 
  of each proposed question having regard to the purpose of the preliminary inquiry 
  process.  In <i>Kasook</i>, Vertes J. addressed these issues directly.  He stated, 
  at paras. 28 and 29:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I also cannot agree with the prosecution argument in this case that, due 
      to the privacy interests sought to be protected by these <i>Criminal Code</i> 
      provisions – privacy interests that have a constitutional aspect in themselves 
      – Parliament intended to put any inquiry into private records beyond the 
      scope of a preliminary inquiry judge …</p>
    <p><i>In my view, there is nothing inherent in this subject that would necessarily 
      preclude its consideration at the preliminary inquiry level other than the 
      fact that the preliminary inquiry judge by statute does not have jurisdiction 
      to hear an application for production.  That is not the same thing as allowing 
      questions as to the circumstances of the counselling so as to enable the 
      defence to make an application in the proper forum</i>.  In my respectful 
      opinion, the fundamental error in the Crown’s submission on this application 
      is that is conflates cross-examination as to the circumstances of counselling 
      with the actual application for production.       [Emphasis added]</p>

  </span></span> First, the complainant’s diary was not tendered by the Crown 
  as an exhibit at the inquiry and did not otherwise form part of the Crown’s 
  case.  Similarly, we are not concerned in this case with waiver by the complainant 
  of the application of ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the <i>Criminal </i>Code in connection 
  with a record in the possession or control of the Crown, which waiver is permitted 
  under s. 278.2(2).  This does not mean, however, that the probative value of 
  the diary, or of information related to it, is presumed to be low.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, although the Crown’s objection to the question of whether 
  the complainant had written anything in his diary concerning the alleged incidents 
  of assault was made almost in tandem with the complainant’s answer to the question, 
  the complainant did testify that he had not written anything about the two alleged 
  assaultive incidents in his diary.  This response bears directly on the relevance 
  of the remaining proposed questions regarding the diary and the probative value 
  of any information to be obtained from responses to those questions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Stated differently, had the complainant confirmed that he made 
  entries in his diary concerning the incidents of assault alleged against the 
  respondent, the analysis of the relevance and scope of proposed cross-examination 
  concerning the diary would be different.  In this case, the reverse occurred, 
  giving rise to a legitimate question regarding the probative value of cross-examination 
  questions concerning the diary, its characteristics and contents, and the circumstances 
  relating to its creation and maintenance by the complainant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, the assessment of the relevance of the proposed questions 
  and, hence, of the  probative value of the information sought to be obtained 
  from the complainant, does not end there.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> The admissibility of evidence at a preliminary inquiry, and the 
  scope of permitted cross-examination, is determined by relevancy.  This court 
  held in <i>R. v. R. (L.)</i>, at 336, that relevancy in this connection is not 
  to be governed solely by the narrow test for committal.  Rather, a broader approach 
  to relevancy is mandated by the discovery feature of the preliminary inquiry.

  </span></span> In <i>O’Connor</i>, in the reasons of the majority relating to 
  records in the possession of third parties, it was established that the meaning 
  of “relevance” in the disclosure context concerns whether the information <i>may 
  be useful </i>to the defence.  In the context of production, the test of relevance 
  at common law is even higher: “the presiding judge must be satisfied that there 
  is a reasonable possibility that the information is logically probative to an 
  issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify” (at 19). However, 
  relevance “to an issue at trial” refers (at 19):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . not only to evidence that may be probative to the material issues 
      in this case (i.e., the unfolding of events) but also to evidence relating 
      to the credibility of witnesses and to the reliability of other evidence 
      in the case . . . .</p>

  </span></span> In <i>O’Connor</i>, L’Heureux-Dubé J. suggested that the assumption 
  that private therapeutic or counselling records are relevant to full answer 
  and defence “is often highly questionable” (at 52).  However, Lamer C.J.C. and 
  Sopinka J.<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a> disagreed and stated, at 22-23:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>By way of illustration only, we are of the view that there are a number 
      of ways in which information contained in third party records may be relevant,

    <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      underlying the criminal complaint&nbsp;&nbsp;… </p>
    <p align="center">...</p>
    <p>(3)        they may contain information that bears on the complainant’s

  </span></span> I again emphasize that we are not concerned on this appeal with 
  either production or the disclosure obligations of the Crown.  We are concerned, 
  however, with the prospect that questioning the complainant regarding his diary 
  may furnish evidence to the respondent upon which he would be legally entitled 
  to subsequently rely for the purpose of a s.&nbsp;278.3 production application 
  at trial.  We are also concerned with the possibility that such questioning, 
  unless properly limited, may inevitably result in involuntary disclosure by 
  the complainant of intensely private matters recorded in his diary, thus depriving 
  him of the constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy which 
  attaches to his diary.  In my view, the considerations of relevancy outlined 
  by the majority in <i>O’Connor</i> do have significance in these circumstances.</p>

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is undisputable that the complainant’s personal diary attracts 
  a significant degree of privacy.  The very nature of such a record imports an 
  intention by the diarist that its contents remain confidential save as the diarist 
  may voluntarily elect. As noted in<i> Shearing</i>, at 255:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is in the nature of most personal diaries that they will, in the words 
      of <i>Plant</i> [<i>R. v. Plant</i> (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 203 (S.C.C.) 
      at para. 81] … “reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices 
      of the individual”.  Being forced to reveal the contents of a diary is akin 
      to having one’s inner discourse intercepted … </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(and see <i>R. v. M. (D.)</i> (2000), 37 C.R. (5th) 80 at 94, per Hill J.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with counsel for the respondent and the CLA, however, 
  that there is no absolute bar to all questioning of a complainant at a preliminary 
  inquiry concerning a private record, and that ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>, by their terms, and the decisions in <i>Mills</i> and <i>O’Connor</i> 
  do not preclude such questioning.  Rather, only those questions which implicate 
  the private or personal domain of the author of the record are impermissible.  
  It follows that where it is acknowledged, as in this case, that cross-examination 
  on the actual contents of the diary is impermissible, it is necessary to assess 
  the proposed questions to determine whether they will intrude on the intimate 
  and personal aspects of the recorded life experiences, thoughts and feelings 
  of the diarist.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The questions sought to be asked by the respondent are set out 
  in paragraphs 10 and 12 of these reasons.  In my view, they may usefully be 
  described as falling into two categories: (a) questions which do not, by their 
  nature or scope, in any way implicate the private or personal domain of the 
  complainant and (b), questions which, properly limited, need not and should 
  not be permitted to result in a description of the actual contents of the diary 
  so as to intrude on the private or personal domain of the diarist.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The questions set out in subparagraphs 10(a), 12(a), 12(b), 12(c), 
  12(d) and 12(e) fall into the first category, while the questions set out in 
  subparagraphs 10(b), 10(c),  10(d), 12(f), 12(g), 12(h), 12(i) and 12(j) fall 
  into the second category.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] 
  </span></a>  I conclude, with one important limitation, that the questions in 
  both categories, as currently framed, may be asked of the complainant at the 
  preliminary inquiry.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, questioning of a complainant at a preliminary inquiry 
  concerning a private record must be as limited as reasonably possible to respond 
  to the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  Accordingly, the issue 
  becomes <i>how</i>, not <i>whether</i>, cross-examination of the complainant 
  can be limited “in a manner that accords appropriate constitutional protection 
  to all of the constitutional rights at issue”  (<i>O’Connor</i>, at 52, per 
  L’Heureux-Dubé J.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I note also that, for the purpose of laying an evidentiary foundation 
  for a production application under s. 278.3 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in respect 
  of the diary, it is unlikely that the respondent could obtain information relating 
  to the complainant’s diary by any available means other than through limited 
  cross-examination of the complainant.  There is no evidence in this case that 
  any person other than the complainant has access to the diary or knowledge of 
  its contents, its physical characteristics and the circumstances of its creation 
  and maintenance.  These are facts which, on the record before this court, are 
  within the exclusive knowledge of the complainant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I conclude that the proper limitation in this case relates to 
  those questions falling within category (b), described in paragraph 62 above.  
  I do not agree with Crown counsel’s submission that a blanket prohibition on 
  all cross-examination concerning the contents of the diary is necessary or appropriate.  
  Rather, in my view, no questions may be asked of the complainant touching upon 
  his recollection of the exact contents of the diary or the content of actual 
  entries in the diary.  As suggested by counsel for the CLA, counsel for the 
  respondent should be permitted to ask the complainant at the preliminary inquiry 
  if a particular topic is covered within his diary, but should not be permitted 
  to question the complainant about what he wrote or recalls recording concerning 
  the identified topic.  A wide-ranging exploration of the topics addressed in 
  the diary is not permissible, however.  For this reason, only those questions 
  concerning content which fall within category (b), described in paragraph 62 
  above, and in the manner now framed by counsel for the respondent, may properly 
  be put to the complainant at the preliminary inquiry.</p>

  guidelines to be followed in assessing the scope of permissible cross-examination 
  at preliminary inquiries   on personal records in the possession of third parties, 
  including documents in the nature of therapeutic or counselling records.  Having 
  regard to the particular facts of this case, I do not think it appropriate or 
  necessary to do so.  The establishment of general guidelines regarding permissible 
  cross-examination on personal records in the possession of third parties, if

    [1] </span></a> Lamer C.J.C. and Sopinka J., writing for the majority in <i>O’Connor</i> 
    on this issue, also recognized that an accused may learn of the existence 
    of private third party records from the testimony of a complainant at a preliminary 
    inquiry (see <i>O’Connor</i>, at 21).  This observation, however, was confined 
    to disclosure of the “existence” of a private record, as opposed to disclosure 
    of its contents.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span> 
    [2] </span></a> In <i>O’Connor</i>, commenting on a complainant’s privacy 
    interest in therapeutic or counselling records, L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated that 
    such records contain “intensely private aspects of their lives, possibly containing 
    thoughts and statements which have never even been shared with the closest 
    of friends or family” (at 54).  In my view, these comments apply with equal 
    force to a personal journal or diary.</p>

    <i>O’Connor</i>, L’Heureux-Dubé</span> J. stated, at 73-74, in commenting 
    on the disclosure principles established by <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i> (1991), 
    68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.):  “Consequently, in light of <i>Stinchcombe</i> 
    and other decisions of this court that have elaborated on those disclosure 
    guidelines … it may be necessary to reassess the extent to which the “discovery” 
    rationale remains appropriate as a consideration in the conduct of the modern-day 
    preliminary inquiry”.</p>

    [5] </span></a> Thus, for example, an inquiry judge does not have jurisdiction 
    to grant a remedy under s. 24 of the <i>Charter</i> because a preliminary 
    inquiry is not a “court of competent jurisdiction” under s. 24 (<i>Mills</i> 
    and <i>Hynes</i>), and has no power to hear and determine the question of 
    whether a <i>Charter</i> right has been infringed or denied or whether a law 
    is constitutional (<i>Seaboyer,</i> at 381 and 411-412, per McLachin J., <i>R. 
    v. Mills</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863 at 954-55, per MacIntyre J., and <i>Hynes,</i>

    out in subparagraph 12(e), namely, whether the diary is still in existence, 
    may be asked of the complainant.  In my view, there is no constraint on defence 
    counsel at a preliminary inquiry in a sexual assault case which operates to 
    preclude asking a complainant if a private record exists.  This question does 
    not engage in any way the contents of the record and, without more, is an 
    entirely neutral inquiry.</p>
