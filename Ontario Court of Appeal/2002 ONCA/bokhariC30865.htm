  </span></span> This appeal is about contract interpretation.  The appellant 
  appeals the judgment of Cunningham J. dated October 9, 1998 in which the respondent 
  was awarded, for breach of contract, commissions obtained through his efforts 
  in respect of six Ottawa Customs Consulting Ltd. (“OCC”) corporate clients.  
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent left his job of 22 years at Revenue Canada in 
  1991 to work for OCC as a private custom consultant, which involved performing 
  customs and excise audits.  The respondent contracted with OCC on Feb 18, 1991 
  to provide services to OCC for one year in exchange for a salary, a consulting 
  fee percentage, and commissions.  On May 29, 1991, the respondent sought to 
  protect his interests with respect to considerable commission potential and 
  entered into a second contract with OCC.  This agreement called for an eleven-month 
  term –&nbsp;February 18, 2001 to January 18, 1992 – extendable on mutually agreeable 
  terms and conditions.  On February 20, 1992, the parties discussed terms on 
  which the contract could be extended but were unable to come to an agreement.  
  Prior to this meeting and following the January 18, 1992 termination of the 
  agreement, the respondent continued working for the appellant on a casual basis.

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span>      </span>The respondent received commission cheques 
  until August 1992.  In early September, the appellant informed the respondent 
  that he would no longer be sharing money that came into OCC.  On September 25, 
  the parties met with their accountants for what was a short, tense meeting.  
  In December 1992, the respondent issued his statement of claim.<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The main issue is the interpretation of the May 29, 1991 agreement.  
  The respondent’s position is that he is entitled to commissions in respect of 
  clients solely acquired by him or jointly acquired by him and OCC not only during 
  the life of the contract but forever after in connection with work done by the 
  defendants on behalf of such clients.  The appellant contends that the respondent 
  is entitled only to commissions in respect of work done by him and filings made 
  by him during the life of the agreement.  The trial judge found that the parties, 
  who were friends and unfortunately did not see the need for clear contractual 
  terms, intended that the revenue sharing provided for in the agreement would 
  continue beyond one year.  The trial judge concluded that the words used in 
  paragraph 4 of the second agreement under the heading “Sharing of Recoveries”; 
  namely, “recovered or to be recovered at a later date for such clients”, meant 
  that the respondent would be entitled to his commissions even after the expiry 
  of the agreement or any extension thereof in respect of clients jointly acquired 
  or those acquired solely by him.  He further concluded that paragraph 1 under 
  the heading “Ownership and Rights to Clients”, which set out that clients assigned 
  to or brought in by the respondent are to be OCC clients and that OCC has the 
  exclusive right to serve them for one year form the expiry or termination of 
  the agreement after which the respondent could deal with them directly, does 
  <i>not</i> restrict the respondent to recoveries made on behalf of the appellants 
  for a period of one year following the termination of the agreement. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our opinion, the appellant has not shown any reversible error 
  on the part of the trial judge.  He did not err in his interpretation that the 
  agreement continued to provide the respondent with “finders fee” commissions 
  beyond the fixed 11-month term of the contract.  We disagree that the agreement 
  included conditions precedent; namely, that the respondent would service the 
  client and work on client files before he would be entitled to commissions.  
  This is not a case to apply the doctrine of repugnancy as there are no clearly 
  contradictory terms in the agreement.  The specific terms of the contract, that 
  it was for a period of eleven months, related to the length of time over which 
  services were to be performed, whereas recovery of commission could clearly 
  take place beyond the life of the agreement.  Nor did the trial judge err in 
  failing to apply the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> in respect of the 
  second agreement.  This was not a contract of adhesion.  In our opinion, both 
  the positions adopted by the parties were extreme.  While, having regard to 
  the contract as a whole, we would not necessarily have interpreted the contract 
  in this fashion, having regard to the positions of the parties we have not been 
  persuaded that, in adopting the interpretation put forward by the respondent, 
  the trial judge committed any reversible error.  <span

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the wording of the contract and the nature of the 
  relationship between the parties do not support the trial judge’s interpretation 
  of the contract in a way that results in indefinite commissions to the respondent.  
  The question, then, is what can reasonably be taken from the contract language 
  and the evidence to be the parties’ intentions with respect to the recovery 
  of commissions.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> By his own admission, as the trial judge noted, Mr. Bokhari considered 
  the agreement with OCC to be a “temporary agreement which will prevail until 
  we renegotiate and come up with new arrangements.”  Based on this fact alone, 
  it seems to me to be unreasonable to attribute to the parties an intention that 
  perpetual financial consequences would flow from an eleven-month interim agreement.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Moreover, the contract as a whole reveals a one-year 
  time-limited arrangement with a two-stage exit strategy over two years available 
  for Mr. Bokhari.  In the first year after the end of the contractual term, Mr. 
  Bokhari was free to compete with OCC.  At the beginning of the second year, 
  the respondent and OCC were equally free to solicit any OCC clients Mr. Bokhari 
  brought in or helped to bring in.  The right to compete for these clients is, 
  it seems to me, inconsistent with Mr. Bokhari’s claim that he is contractually 
  entitled to perpetual commissions from them.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>  </span>There is no question that Mr. Bokhari is entitled 
  to recover 25% of the commissions earned from clients he either jointly or exclusively 
  brought into OCC.  The question is how long that entitlement should last.  Given 
  the short duration and temporary nature of the agreement, I think the interpretation 
  which best reflects both commercial sense and the parties’ intentions is one 
  which results in Mr. Bokhari being entitled to his share of commissions earned 
  from those clients, provided that work was done for them during the contractual 
  term.  He is entitled to that money, whether or not it is available during the 
  life of the contract.  To that extent, I see no time limit on the payment of 
  commissions.  But the work must have been performed during the contract, whether 
  by Mr. Bokhari or by other OCC personnel.  If no work was done, no commissions 
  are payable.  If work was done, they are payable to Mr. Bokhari whether or not 
  they are received beyond the contract term.  This, I think, is what is meant 
  by the phrase “to be recovered at a later date.”</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>       </span>To find otherwise would render meaningless 
  the fact that there is a time limit in the contract.  It would also nullify 
  the language in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the “Sharing of Recoveries” section of 
  the contract, which refers to the deduction from the commission of expenses 
  incurred in earning the gross monies recovered.  This language would be redundant 
  unless the paragraphs are interpreted as meaning that work has to be done –  
  and expenses incurred – before any commission is payable.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The phrase “recovered or to be recovered” should therefore be 
  read to mean <i>recovered or to be recovered for work done</i>.  This means, 
  among other things, that the phrase “recovered or to be recovered” has the same 
  meaning not only in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the “Sharing of Recoveries” section, 
  but in paragraph 1 of that section as well.  In fact, the phrase “recovered 
  or to be recovered” makes no sense in paragraph 1 of that section at all unless 
  the words “for work done” is read in,  and unless the work is done during the 
  term of the contract.  If no work was done, there is no recovery.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>     </span>I am also reinforced in this view by Mr. Bokhari’s 
  contractual right, as set out under the “Restrictions and Limitations” section, 
  to approve and determine the remuneration of anyone retained by OCC to work 
  on a jointly or exclusively obtained client.  This means that the parties intended 
  a one-year arrangement during which Mr.&nbsp;Bokhari had a veto power over the 
  selection and remuneration of persons working for clients he brought in or helped 
  bring in.  This provision, creating a supervisory role, only makes sense if 
  it is seen as having a mirror relationship with paragraphs 2 and 3, that is, 
  that it anticipates work being done, being done by people approved by Mr. Bokhari, 
  and being done during the term of the contract.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would therefore find that the commissions payable to Mr. Bokhari 
  are for work done during the subsistence of the one year contract, whether or 
  not done by Mr. Bokhari, and whenever the monies are recovered.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.</span></p>
