<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice T. O’Connor, sitting with a jury, 
  dated September 24, 1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We would not give effect to any of the grounds 
  of appeal raised by the appellant. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the trial judge’s refusal to 
  declare a mistrial following the Crown’s opening address, we are satisfied that 
  the curative instructions given by the trial judge immediately after the Crown 
  opening, and again in his charge, served to remove any possible prejudice to 
  the appellant. This is particularly so when one considers that the improper 
  comment was a single line in a lengthy opening and that the offending portion, 
  which was not repeated, came nine days before the jury’s deliberations. In sum, 
  we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s decision to proceed with 
  the trial. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the s. 10(b) issue, the trial 
  judge found as a fact that the appellant waived his right to counsel after he 
  was told that he was being charged with robbery and wearing a face mask. We 
  think that that finding was open to the trial judge and we see no basis for 
  interfering with it. The appellant gave no evidence to the contrary. Moreover, 
  when given his rights to counsel a third time before providing a videotaped 
  statement, he asked and was permitted to contact counsel. This belies the position, 
  put forward on his behalf, that the appellant may have been under a misapprehension 
  that he was only entitled to one phone call. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Turning to the trial judge’s instructions on 
  the meaning of reasonable doubt, the charge in this case was given several days 
  after the release of <i>Lifchus</i> by the Supreme Court of Canada and we acknowledge 
  that the instructions are not fully in accordance with that decision. That said, 
  when the impugned instructions are considered in the context of the charge as 
  a whole, we believe there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended 
  the correct standard of proof. Our reasons for so concluding are three fold: 
  (1) the trial judge instructed the jury often and correctly on the presumption 
  of innocence and he linked those instructions to his instructions on the burden 
  of proof and the meaning of reasonable doubt; (2) apart from the instructions 
  on reasonable doubt, the appellant does not submit that the charge contained 
  any other errors; and (3) most importantly, in convicting the appellant on only 
  some of the offences and acquitting him on others, it is clear to us that the 
  jury fully appreciated the requisite standard of proof required for a conviction. 
  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, we are satisfied that there was ample 
  evidence to support the charges upon which the appellant was convicted. We would 
  therefore not give effect to the submission that the verdicts were unreasonable.

  dismissed.</span></p>
