<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Ross Webster, 
  sitting without a jury, dated February 26, 2001.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown appeals from the 18 months conditional sentence imposed 
  on the respondent following his plea of guilty to three sexual offences involving 
  three young boys.  The victims, two of whom were thirteen years old and one 
  fifteen years old at the time of the offences, lived in the same apartment building 
  as the 29 year-old respondent.  The respondent befriended each victim by providing 
  entertainment in his apartment including computer games, alcohol and pornographic 
  movies.  Over a period of a few months in the early part of 1999, the respondent 
  performed various sexual acts with each victim including grabbing of genitals, 
  mutual masturbation and fellatio. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent was arrested with respect to these incidents in 
  April 1999.  On August 18, 2000 the respondent pleaded guilty to two counts 
  of touching the body of a person under the age of fourteen years for a sexual 
  purpose and one count of sexual assault.  At the time the respondent entered 
  his plea, he had a criminal record with previous convictions for possession 
  of child pornography, breach of recognizance and possession of a controlled 
  substance.  The convictions for breach of recognizance and possession of a controlled 
  substance related to the respondents possession of marijuana and were committed 
  while he was released on the present offences.  The respondent was convicted 
  of these two offences on May 5, 2000 and was sentenced to one day in jail in 
  addition to 17 days of pre-trial custody. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The sentencing was adjourned from time to time and the sentence 
  was ultimately imposed on February 26, 2001.  By the time the sentence was imposed 
  on February 26, 2001, the respondent had been convicted of another charge of 
  breach of recognizance relating to his release on the instant offences.  By 
  the terms of his recognizance, the respondent was prohibited from associating 
  with children.  He breached this condition of release when he moved in a friends 
  home where two children aged ten and three also lived.  The respondent pleaded 
  guilty to this additional charge on January 23, 2001 and received a sentence 
  of 70 days in jail. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Further material was filed at the sentencing 
  hearing including victim impact statements describing the significant detrimental 
  effect these offences had on the young victims; letters of support from a previous 
  employer, acquaintances and friends of the respondent generally attesting to 
  his honesty and loyalty, with some expression of disbelief at his involvement 
  in these offences; a pre-sentence report; and a letter from a psychiatrist, 
  Dr. Conlon. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The pre-sentence report, completed prior to the respondents 
  second conviction for breaching his recognizance, was generally positive.  It 
  revealed that, although the respondent presently had positive relationships 
  with his family, his childhood was signified by violence, alcohol abuse and 
  little family communication.  He was also a victim of sexual abuse over a lengthy 
  period of time by a male babysitter.  The respondent expressed remorse for the 
  present offences, stating that his behaviour was stupid and that he was shocked 
  by his actions, knowing how he himself felt as a victim of sexual abuse.  The 
  author of the report indicated that the offences occurred during an unstable 
  period of time in the respondents life when he had lost his job, was drinking 
  and using drugs, relocated to a poor area and engaged in promiscuous behaviour.  
  The pre-sentence report also revealed that, following his arrest on these charges, 
  the respondent attended a number of counselling sessions with a psychiatrist, 
  Dr. Conlon and that the respondent indicated a willingness to attend for further 
  counselling and treatment at the courts direction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Conlon, in a letter dated December 7, 1999, reported that 
  the respondent admitted to sexual arousal by young men but adamantly denied 
  any sexual interest in children.  Dr. Conlon, noting that his assessment was 
  based primarily on self-report, diagnosed the respondent as having a sexual 
  disorder of an unspecified type, but stated that he did not fit the diagnostic 
  criteria for pedophilia.  He also diagnosed the respondent as having an adjustment 
  disorder with depressed mood and alcohol abuse.  Dr. Conlon concluded his report 
  by indicating that the respondent was compliant with his visits and that he 
  would continue to see him on an outpatient basis.  However, once the respondent 
  started working, he discontinued the counselling due to his concern over maintaining 
  his employment.  An up-date from the probation and parole officer provided to 
  the court at the hearing of the appeal revealed that no specific treatment has 
  yet resumed as mandated by the terms of the conditional sentence, again due 
  to conflicts with the respondents work schedule.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Crown counsel at the sentencing hearing took the position that 
  a custodial sentence in the upper reformatory range should be imposed, together 
  with a period of probation and an order under s.161 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  prohibiting the respondents access in specified circumstances to persons under 
  the age of 14 years.  The defence submitted that a conditional sentence should 
  be imposed.  The sentencing judge acceded to the defences request and imposed 
  a conditional sentence of 18 months followed by three years probation.  He 
  did not make a prohibition order under s.161 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The Crown submits that the sentencing judge erred 
  in principle in two significant respects: first, he erred in finding that the 
  respondent did not represent a risk to the public, and second, he erred in his 
  assessment of the gravity of the offences.  It is submitted that the first error 
  is particularly manifest in the trial judges trivialization of the respondents 
  repeated breaches of the conditions of his release and his failure to appreciate 
  the full impact they ought to have had on his assessment of the suitability 
  of a conditional sentence for this offender.  It is further submitted that the 
  second error is apparent from the sentencing judges minimization of the respondents 
  responsibility by importing a degree of complicity onto the young victims who 
  he described as interested in hanging out with this older man and not innocent 
  bystanders. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the imposition of a conditional sentence was manifestly 
  unfit in the circumstances of this case.  The offences involved serious and 
  repeated violations of the sexual integrity of young vulnerable victims.  With 
  respect to the sentencing judge who evidently gave this matter much consideration, 
  we agree with Crown counsels submission that his reasons for sentencing reflect 
  an improper attribution of responsibility to the victims and a consequent failure 
  to appreciate the full impact of the respondents criminal conduct.  The sentencing 
  judge also erred in his assessment of the risk posed by this offender.  Given 
  the respondents admitted attraction to young men, the absence of any relevant 
  treatment plan, and, perhaps more importantly, his repeated failure to abide 
  sby those court imposed conditions that were specifically crafted to minimize 
  the risk of re-offending, the respondent was demonstrably a poor candidate for 
  a conditional sentence.  While the term suggested by both counsel at the sentence 
  hearing was within the range of appropriate sentences, the respondent should 
  not have been allowed to serve his sentence in the community. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For these reasons, leave to appeal the sentence is granted, the 
  appeal is allowed, the conditional sentence order is set aside and, in substitution, 
  a term of 18 months imprisonment is imposed less 12 months credit for the time 
  served under the conditional sentence, resulting in a sentence of 6 months from 
  the time he is taken in custody.  A warrant may issue if necessary.  The probation 
  order shall remain the same.  While incarcerated, we recommend that the respondent 
  have access to any available temporary absence program that would allow him 
  to continue his employment. </p>
