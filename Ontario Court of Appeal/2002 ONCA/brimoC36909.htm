<p><b>On appeal from the order of Justice Harry LaForme dated July 31, 2001.</b></p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Released Orally:  February 22, 2002</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the dismissal of her action 
  against Stephen A. Suske, an officer and director of the corporate defendant.  
  For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge dismissed the action against Mr. Suske on two grounds: 
  (1) that the statement of claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action 
  against him as required by rule 21.01(1)(b), and (2) applying rule 21.04(2), 
  that there was no genuine issue for trial in respect to the two issues which 
  the motion judge discussed under the heading of negligent misrepresentation.  
  In regard to the second ground, he found as a fact that Mr. Suske was acting 
  in his capacity as C.E.O. of the corporate defendant and that the misrepresentations 
  which it is claimed he made did not constitute negligent misrepresentations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the motion judge erred in respect of both grounds. As for 
  the first ground, the statement of claim in paragraphs 1, 15 to 20, 22, 25 and 
  34 plead the facts in support of the plaintiff’s claim against Mr. Suske and 
  it is not plain and obvious, giving the statement of claim a generous reading, 
  that the plaintiff’s claim cannot succeed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the second ground, on the evidence there are genuine issues for 
  trial in respect to both conclusions reached by the motion judge.  On the evidentiary 
  record it was not open to him to make these findings. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Therefore the appeal is allowed with costs.  There will be an order 
  that the motion is dismissed with costs, including the costs of the motion before 
  the master.  We fix these costs at $2,500 plus disbursements and GST for the 
  motion before LaForme J. and $750 plus disbursements and GST for the motion 
  before the master.  As for the costs of the appeal, after considering the appellant’s 
  bill of costs and her offer to settle the appeal, costs are fixed in the amount 
  of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
