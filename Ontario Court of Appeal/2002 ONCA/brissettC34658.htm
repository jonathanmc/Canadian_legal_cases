<p><b>On appeal from her conviction by Justice Thomas Dunn on December 8, 2000 
  and the sentence imposed on January 31, 2001.</b></p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant was convicted 
  of importing narcotics into Canada and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment 
  to be served in the community conditionally. She appeals against conviction 
  and sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant was arrested 
  in the customs secondary area of Pearson International Airport after arriving 
  on a flight from Jamaica. Customs officers discovered four body packs containing 
  3818 grams of cannabis resin strapped to her body. At trial, the appellant raised 
  the defence of duress, claiming that she carried what she knew to be contraband 
  only because of threats to her life.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It is apparent from 
  his reasons that the trial judge essentially rejected the testimony of the appellant. 
  We accept the respondent’s submission that the trial judge’s finding that the 
  appellant failed to avail herself of an obvious safe avenue of escape by seeking 
  assistance from Canadian authorities following her arrival in Canada related 
  to his assessment of her credibility. Although it may have been preferable for 
  the trial judge to set out the ingredients of the common law defence of duress, 
  and to make specific reference to the subjective/objective element of this ingredient, 
  he did not err by failing to do so. Further, the trial judge’s reasons indicate 
  he was alive to the issue of the appellant’s right to silence. The appellant 
  had opportunities to seek assistance from Canadian authorities prior to the 
  time when her right to silence was triggered. The trial judge’s finding does 
  not undermine that right.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although the trial judge 
  did not make a specific finding that the appellant knew the body packs contained 
  narcotics, that inference is available on the evidence relating to the drugs 
  being strapped to her body. The trial judge is presumed to know the law, including 
  the necessary elements of the offence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As to sentence, the 
  trial judge was entitled to require the appellant to remain within Ontario unless 
  otherwise ordered by the court under s. 742.3(2)(f) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, 
  R.S.C. 1985, C. c-46. He did not modify the mandatory statutory conditions of 
  a conditional sentence “illegally” in so doing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appeal against conviction 
  is accordingly dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence is granted, but the 
  appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
