<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Moira

  </span> In the spring of 2000 the community of Walkerton suffered a catastrophic 
  bacterial infection of its water supply. Through amalgamation, Walkerton had 
  become part of the new municipality of Brockton. Hence it was Brockton that 
  had to develop the multitude of municipal responses required by this disaster.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To assist it in responding to various legal aspects of this crisis, 
  including the inevitable civil actions, Brockton sought help from its insurer. 
  However it very quickly became dissatisfied with the legal assistance provided 
  by its insurer and retained its own lawyers.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The central issue in these proceedings is whether Brockton had the right 
  to take over control of the defence of the civil actions from its insurer in 
  the circumstances of this case and whether it therefore had the corollary right 
  to appoint counsel for this purpose at the insurers expense.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At first instance, Caswell J. decided against Brockton. For the reasons 
  that follow I agree with that conclusion and would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>THE 
  FACTS </span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The dramatic events in Walkerton began in mid-May 2000 with the discovery 
  that the water supply system contained a deadly form of E-coli bacteria. The 
  crisis came emphatically to public attention when on May 21 the medical officer 
  of health issued a boil water advisory.  Despite this, hundreds of residents 
  were infected and became seriously ill. Tragically, several people died as a 
  result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An atmosphere of crisis swept the community, accompanied by the intense 
  glare of national media attention. Very quickly, people began to demand both 
  information and explanations from municipal officials. The Ontario Provincial 
  Police began an investigation as did the Office of the Chief Coroner. On May 
  23, the Ministry of the Environment issued a request requiring the municipality 
  to retain an engineer to respond with an action plan by May 26. On May 26 the 
  media reported that a class action lawsuit had been launched seeking damages 
  of at least $100 million.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Understandably, the municipality felt the need of assistance from its 
  insurers. Brockton was the named insured under a policy of liability insurance 
  underwritten by  Guarantee Company of North America, Lombard General Insurance 
  Company of Canada and CGU Insurance Company of Canada through their managing 
  general agent Frank Cowan Company Limited. I will refer to them collectively 
  as Cowan. They are the respondents in this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Brockton was also insured as an additional interest under a policy of 
  liability insurance which extended primary coverage to the Walkerton Public 
  Utilities Commission as the named insured. That policy was underwritten by the 
  Municipal Electrical Association Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (MEARIE). I will 
  refer to this policy as the MEARIE policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>   In their attempt to obtain legal assistance, Brockton officials met 
  on May 25 with Cowan representatives and lawyers from Borden Ladner Gervais 
  LLP (Borden Ladner) whom Cowan had appointed to defend Brockton. The next day 
  Borden Ladner wrote to confirm its position and the advice it had given. The 
  letter said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We wish to confirm that we were instructed by Frank Cowan Company to meet 
      with its insured, the Municipality of Brockton, under a reservation of rights. 
      As we discussed  with  you and the members of Council, and your local solicitor, 
      the reservation of rights means that our attendance to investigate and assist 
      is without prejudice to the insurers rights, and the insureds rights, 
      under the policy of insurance.</p>
    <p>As we discussed, it is our understanding that the Municipal Electrical 
      Association Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (MEARIE) will respond where third 
      parties sue not only the Public Utilities Commission, but also the municipality, 
      alleging that they have been negligent in the operation of the utility. 
      This understanding is supported by the special bulletin published by MEARIE 
      and the 1996 letter from the PUC to its insurance broker, copies of which 
      we left with you. The wording of the MEARIE policy also supports this position. 
      Accordingly, if and when lawsuits or other claims are made against the municipality, 
      those claims should be sent to MEARIE for response. For information purposes, 
      in order that Frank Cowan Company can monitor the situation, copies of such 
      documents should also be sent to Frank Cowan Company on the understanding 
      that a response in the first instance is expected from MEARIE.</p>
    <p>We would also strongly encourage the municipality to continue to emphasize 
      the separate roles of the municipality and the PUC in relation to this matter. 
      This separation should be carried forward in dealing with the public and 
      the media, and should be considered when any municipal action in respect 
      of this matter is taken. This strategy is particularly important for the 
      Mayor.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Brockton was not satisfied with this response from the Cowan insurers 
  and had received no response at all from the MEARIE insurers. Brockton officials 
  felt an urgent need for the fullest possible legal representation and as a result, 
  on May 26, Brockton appointed Miller Thomson LLP (Miller Thomson) as counsel 
  with instructions to act with respect to any and all suits, claims, actions 
  and inquiries arising from the contamination of the Walkerton water system. 
  Miller Thomson moved quickly to assemble a team to deal with the immediate requirements 
  of the regulatory and investigative agencies and to prepare a broad defence 
  to the anticipated civil actions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At a meeting on June 12, Brockton officials made clear to Cowan that 
  they felt that Borden Ladner had taken no steps to prepare to defend the civil 
  actions and that the municipality wished to be represented by Miller Thomson 
  in all matters arising out of the contamination of the water system. Brockton 
  further asserted that Cowan should pay for these services. Cowan responded that 
  this would have to be authorized by the underwriters of the Cowan policy. No 
  such authorization was ever forthcoming. </p>

  </span> On June 14, Borden Ladner wrote to Miller Thomson to follow up on its 
  previous correspondence. The June 14 letter read as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>First, we confirm that Frank Cowan Company continues to investigate and 
      handle this matter pursuant to a reservation of rights. <u>As we advised, 
      Frank Cowan Company has appointed separate coverage counsel to provide it 
      with advice in that regard</u>.</p>
    <p>In our earlier letter, we strongly encouraged the municipality to emphasize 
      the separate roles of the municipality and the PUC in relation to this matter. 
      The obvious concern was that actions taken by the municipality, including 
      dealing with the public, the media and regulators, not compromise, or be 
      seen to compromise, the possible requirement that insurers defend third 
      party claims in connection with this matter. Frank Cowan Company understands 
      that the municipality is working hard to respond to the various investigations, 
      inquiries and regulatory requirements at this time. However, it is concerned 
      that it appears that the municipality, and not the PUC, has taken the leading 
      role in responding to regulators, the media and other related aspects at 
      this time. For example, while the MOE may have issued an order, or orders, 
      to the municipality, perhaps those orders should have been directed to the 
      PUC, the entity charged with the responsibility for the water supply. Again, 
      Frank Cowan Company urges the municipality to carefully consider the extent 
      and nature of municipal action in order that the municipalitys own interests 
      are protected vis-à-vis its obligations and rights under insurance policies.</p>
    <p>Frank Cowan Company also wishes to remind the municipality to forward copies 
      of third party claims in order that Frank Cowan Company can monitor such 
      claims. We trust that the municipality will otherwise co-operate with Frank 
      Cowan Company as required under the policy, including providing copies of 
      orders, reports and other relevant documentation as it becomes available.

  </span> On June 16, coverage counsel wrote to Miller Thomson indicating that 
  whether or not there is coverage with respect to indemnity, there is no coverage 
  for costs incurred with respect to the Public Inquiry, the coroners inquest, 
  or, until charges are laid, any investigation by the Ministry of the Environment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On June 23, coverage counsel informed Miller Thomson that Cowan had 
  retained the Lawson McGrenere law firm to act as defence  counsel on behalf 
  of Brockton in the civil actions. Cowan had released Borden Ladner because two 
  members of that firm had become part of the legal team assisting Mr. Justice 
  OConnor at the public inquiry. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On July 24, coverage counsel wrote to Brockton confirming that Cowan 
  had accepted the obligation to defend Brockton in the civil actions in accordance 
  with the Cowan policy. The letter also affirmed the insurers right to appoint 
  Lawson McGrenere as counsel to conduct this defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Then on August 3, coverage counsel advised that Cowan was extending 
  coverage to Brockton under the policy. The letter noted however that this coverage 
  was subject to the limits of liability in the policy and further that the claims 
  in the class action for punitive and exemplary damages were excluded from coverage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Throughout this period of time, the MEARIE insurers provided no legal 
  assistance to Brockton. Their response to Brocktons request for reimbursement 
  for payments made by Brockton to Miller Thomson was that no coverage was available 
  to Brockton under the MEARIE policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the several months following its retainer, Miller Thomson provided 
  significant assistance to Brockton. It orchestrated responses to the regulatory 
  authorities including the Ministry of the Environment, the Coroners investigation 
  and the criminal investigation launched by the Ontario Provincial Police. It 
  assisted in negotiating government loans and remediation contracts. It was involved 
  in preparing for the civil litigation and for the Public Inquiry. Brocktons 
  view was that these efforts cannot be segregated and all contributed to the 
  defence of the civil actions. Hence it sought reimbursement from its insurers 
  for the payments made to Miller Thomson. Both Cowan and MEARIE refused. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To resolve this stand-off between Brockton and its insurers, Brockton 
  commenced this proceeding on July 24. In its application it sought the following 
  relief:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.            A Declaration that there is primary coverage responsibility 
      by Cowan and MEARIE triggering their respective duties to defend Brockton 
      under their respective policies of insurance.</p>
    <p>2.            A Declaration that Brockton has the right to control the 
      defence of the civil actions and to appoint counsel.</p>
    <p>3.            A Declaration that Cowan and MEARIE each has a respective 
      duty to defend Brockton in the civil actions, and the scope of that duty 
      includes reimbursing Brockton for all defence costs and costs incurred in 
      remediation, responding to regulatory compliance and criminal and regulatory 
      investigations including the Public Inquiry.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cowan commenced a counter-application seeking a declaration that Cowan 
  is entitled to control the defence of the civil actions and has the right to 
  appoint counsel.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Originally, Cowan also sought a declaration that Brockton had breached 
  the conditions of its policy by appointing Miller Thomson, thereby freeing Cowan 
  from any further obligation to defend the civil actions. However, at the hearing 
  of this application that assertion was withdrawn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Caswell J. heard both the application and the counter-application. She 
  decided first that the Cowan policy provides the primary insurance and that 
  the MEARIE policy can only be accessed after the Cowan policy limits are exhausted 
  and then only in the limited circumstances set out in the MEARIE policy. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, she found that Brockton had not demonstrated such an appearance 
  of impropriety or such an apprehension of conflict that would entitle Brockton 
  to be able to appoint its own counsel paid for by the insurer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, she determined that Cowan has the duty to defend Brockton in 
  the civil actions and that the scope of this duty does not include legal fees 
  for the responses to the regulatory and investigative authorities including 
  the OPP, the Coroner, the Ministry of the Environment and the Public Inquiry. 
  Nor does it include engineering reports ordered in response to the MOE field 
  orders or public relations and remediation expenses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Brockton appealed from this decision. After the appeal was perfected, 
  the class action was settled on terms that required Brockton to discontinue 
  its appeal as against MEARIE. Since the class action has been concluded, the 
  real question on this appeal is whether the costs already incurred by Brockton 
  in retaining Miller Thomson must be paid by Cowan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Several provisions of the Cowan policy provide the contractual backdrop 
  for that issue. The municipal liability part of the policy covers property 
  damage and personal injury where liability is imposed on the insured by law 
  for compensatory damages. The errors and omissions liability part of the policy 
  covers compensatory damages imposed on the insured by law because of a wrongful 
  act. Both parts contain additional insuring agreements in essentially identical 
  terms. The most relevant of these provisions are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>ADDITIONAL INSURING AGREEMENTS</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>1.            Upon receipt of notice of loss or damage caused to persons 
      or property, to serve any person insured by this policy by such investigation 
      thereof, or by such negotiations with the claimant, or by such settlement 
      of any resulting claims, as may be deemed expedient by the Insurer; and</p>
    <p>2.            To defend in the name and on behalf of, any Corporation or 
      person insured by this policy and at the cost of the Insurer, that part 
      of any civil action claiming compensatory damages covered by this policy 
      which may at any time be brought against such Corporation or person on account 
      of such loss or damage to persons or property, even if any of the allegations 
      in such action are groundless, frivolous, false or fraudulent; and</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>5.            To reimburse the Insured for all reasonable expenses, other 
      than loss of earnings, incurred at the Insurers request.</p>
    <p>CONDITIONS</p>
    <p>11.            ASSISTANCE AND CO-OPERATION OF THE INSURED:  The Insured 
      shall co-operate with the Insurer and, upon the Insurers request, shall 
      attend hearings and trials and shall assist in effecting settlement, securing 
      and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct 
      of suits.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With this background I turn then to an analysis of the issues raised 
  in this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The application judge found that the Cowan policy provided the primary 
  coverage to Brockton and that the respondents were therefore obliged to provide 
  Brockton with a defence to the civil damage claims. The respondents do not contest 
  this on appeal and indeed have never denied a duty to defend Brockton under 
  the Cowan policy. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The first and central issue is whether in the circumstances of this 
  case the respondents surrendered their right to control Brocktons defence of 
  the civil actions. In particular, did the respondents lose the right to appoint 
  defence counsel, thereby entitling the appellant to retain independent counsel 
  at the respondents expense? </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant does not contest that in the first instance this right 
  to control the defence (including the appointment of counsel) is that of the 
  insurer. The insurance contract makes this clear. It provides that it is the 
  role of the insurer to investigate and defend claims covered by the policy and 
  it is the role of the insured to assist in that regard. It is the insurer which 
  conducts the defence. This includes the appointment of defence counsel. Indeed 
  this right of the insurer to control the defence can be seen as being in return 
  for its obligation to pay a proper claim. LeBel J.A. made this point in <i>Zurich 
  of Canada v. Renaud &amp; Jacob</i>, [1996] R.J.Q. 2160 (Que. C.A.) at 2168.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the right of the insurer to control the defence is not absolute. 
  The question in this case is whether between May 25, 2000 (when the respondents 
  were first notified of a claim and provided counsel to Brockton) and July 24 
  (when this proceeding was launched) anything happened which caused the respondents 
  to lose their right to control the defence and appoint counsel. To answer that 
  question, it is necessary to first address the legal test to be met before the 
  insurer loses this right to the insured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant does not cast this case as one of professional negligence 
  where appointed counsel is alleged to have fallen below the standard demonstrated 
  to be required. Rather, the appellant argues that the usual right of the insurer 
  to control the defence and appoint counsel should be overriden if there is an 
  appearance of impropriety, which can be based on conflicts, divergences of 
  interest and other proper objections or factors.  It relies on <i>Laurencine  
  v. Jardine </i> (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 336 (Ont. H.C.) where the trial judge permitted 
  the insured to take over the defence from an insurer which was ordered to defend 
  but maintained that its policy did not provide coverage. <i>Laurencine</i> relied 
  on the earlier case of <i>Szebelledy v. Constitution Insurance Co. of Canada 
  et al. </i>(1985), 11 C.C.L.I. 140 (Ont. Dist. Ct.) where the trial judge used 
  the notion of appearance of impropriety to remove lawyers acting for a defendant 
  insurer because those lawyers had previously acted for the plaintiff insured 
  in another action arising from the same accident. This approach to assessing 
  whether a lawyer has a conflict of interest because of a previous retainer has 
  since been displaced by <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235 
  which does not rely on this notion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Laurencine</i> also drew on a line of American jurisprudence exemplified 
  by <i>San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union et al. v. Cumis Insurance Society 
  Inc.</i> 208 Cal. Rptr. 494 (1984). In <i>Cumis</i> the California Court of 
  Appeal found that an insurer which defended a claim but reserved its rights 
  based on possible noncoverage must give up control of the defence and must pay 
  for counsel chosen by the insured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that the facts of this case demonstrate an appearance 
  of impropriety requiring the insurer to surrender control of the defence of 
  the civil actions arising from the Walkerton water disaster. The appellants 
  fundamental complaint is the nature of the advice given by Borden Ladner, counsel 
  appointed by the respondents. Right from the beginning the municipality was 
  advised by Borden Ladner that it should separate itself from the Walkerton Public 
  Utility Commission and that the latter should take the lead role in reacting 
  to the emerging legal and administrative proceedings. The appellant felt strongly 
  that the disaster required it to give it a much more active and comprehensive 
  response to these events. The appellants other major concern was the insurers 
  reservation of rights concerning the policy limits and the exclusion from coverage 
  of punitive and exemplary damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant says that these circumstances created an appearance of 
  impropriety requiring the respondents to surrender control of the defence and 
  pay for counsel retained by the insured to do what was necessary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot agree with the appellants position.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the law does not permit the appellant to build the concept 
  of appearance of impropriety on to the concept of conflict of interest as a 
  basis to require the insurer to surrender control of the defence. The older 
  jurisprudence such as <i>Szebelledy</i>, <i>supra</i>, which applies the notion 
  of appearance of impropriety, does so in a conflict context rather than as an 
  entirely stand alone concept. Moreover, even if it were advanced merely as 
  an addition to conflict of interest, appearance of impropriety carries a vagueness 
  which would make it difficult to apply with consistency and therefore unwise 
  to adopt. More importantly however, the relevant jurisprudence both in Canada 
  and in the United States has developed so as to clearly articulate the governing 
  principle in this kind of case to be limited to conflict of interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Zurich</i>, <i>supra</i>, LeBel J.A. carefully set this out. In 
  that case, Zurich provided professional liability insurance to the chartered 
  accountancy firm of Renaud &amp; Jacob. When the accounting firm was sued, the 
  insurer provided counsel to defend but reserved its rights because certain of 
  the claims, namely, those for fraud, conflict of interest and breach of trust 
  were not covered by the policy. The question was whether by reserving its rights 
  in this way, the insurer had given up its right to control the defence and entitled 
  the insured to retain its own counsel at the insurers expense. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> LeBel J.A. decided that without more, this was not a conflict of interest 
  costing the insurer its right to control the defence. He reviewed the origin 
  of this right arising from the insurance contract itself and the duty of an 
  insurer to provide a defence as described in <i>Nichols v. American Home Assurance 
  Co., </i>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 801. He underlined the duty of counsel appointed by 
  the insurer to fairly ensure the defence of the insured and fully protect its 
  interests. He recognized the potential tension between the insurer and the insured 
  which is inherent in both the structure of liability insurance policies and 
  in the separate and different obligations of the insurer to defend and to indemnify.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> LeBel J.A. concluded that the potential tension which inheres in the 
  relationship between the insurer and the insured and which is manifested by 
  the reservation of rights by the insurer is not <i>per se</i> sufficient to 
  require the insurer to surrender control of the defence. It would too quickly 
  cost the insurer the right it contracted for. Rather, the focus must be on the 
  mandate given by the insurer to the counsel it appoints to conduct the defence. 
  Do the circumstances of the particular case create a reasonable apprehension 
  of conflict of interest if that counsel were to act for both the insurer and 
  the insured in defending the action?  If the insurer puts counsel in a position 
  of having conflicting mandates it must surrender control of the defence to an 
  insured who wishes to retain its own counsel paid for by the insurer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In coming to this conclusion, LeBel J.A. noted that American jurisprudence 
  had moved towards a similar position and away from the broader basis for shifting 
  control of the defence to the insured that was articulated in <i>Cumis</i>. 
  For example, after <i>Cumis</i>, in <i>Foremost Insurance Co. v. Wilks,</i> 
  253 Cal. Rptr. 596, (1988), the California Court of Appeal made clear that not 
  every case where the insurer elects to defend the insured under a reservation 
  of rights creates a conflict of interest requiring the insurer to furnish independent 
  counsel. If the reservation of rights arises because of coverage questions which 
  depend upon an aspect of the insureds own conduct that is in issue in the underlying 
  litigation, a conflict exists. On the other hand, where the reservation of rights 
  is based on coverage disputes which have nothing to do with the issues being 
  litigated in the underlying action, there is no conflict of interest requiring 
  independent counsel paid for by the insurer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the approach taken in <i>Zurich</i> and <i>Foremost</i>. 
  The issue is the degree of divergence of interest that must exist before the 
  insurer can be required to surrender control of the defence and pay for counsel 
  retained by the insured. The balance is between the insureds right to a full 
  and fair defence of the civil action against it and the insurers right to control 
  that defence because of its potential ultimate obligation to indemnify. In my 
  view, that balance is appropriately struck by requiring that there be, in the 
  circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable apprehension of conflict 
  of interest on the part of counsel appointed by the insurer before the insured 
  is entitled to independent counsel at the insurers expense. The question is 
  whether counsels mandate from the insurer can reasonably be said to conflict 
  with his mandate to defend the insured in the civil action. Until that point 
  is reached, the insureds right to a defence and the insurers right to control 
  that defence can satisfactorily co-exist.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In speaking of the insured and the insurer, D.S. Ferguson (now Ferguson 
  J.) put it this way in Conflict Between Insured and Insurer: An Analysis of 
  Recent Canadian Cases, (1990) 12 Advocates Quarterly 129 at 142-43.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> It is important to recognize what the two parties have not agreed to. 
      They have not agreed, unless the policy says so, that the insurer will provide 
      free counsel to the insured to protect his separate interest whether to 
      defend himself against uninsured claims, or to consider his position with 
      respect to claims in excess of limits, or to protect his interest in any 
      dispute with the insurer. Conversely, they have not agreed that the insurer 
      will be able to instruct defence counsel to act to the prejudice of the 
      insureds rights [footnotes omitted]. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i> </i>I turn then to whether the complaints of the appellant in this 
  case raise a reasonable apprehension of conflict of interest on the part of 
  counsel appointed by the respondents to defend the civil actions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no suggestion that the advice given by Borden Ladner was anything 
  other than its best view of how to minimize the appellants liability in the 
  civil actions and therefore minimize the indemnity obligation of the insurer. 
  In my view, it does not reflect a mandate from the insurer that conflicts with 
  Borden Ladners obligation to defend the appellant in the civil actions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reservation of rights by the respondents was based on the monetary 
  limits of the policy and its exclusion of punitive and exemplary damages. The 
  reservation was not based on any conduct of the insured that would be in issue 
  in the underlying litigation. Hence defence counsel was under no mandate to 
  show that the insured had acted in a way which would remove the insurers indemnity 
  obligation. Moreover, the insurer had appointed separate coverage counsel, thereby 
  removing any conflict that could have arisen from the reservation of rights 
  in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel appointed by the respondents to defend the civil action was 
  not under any set of contradictory mandates in defending the civil actions. 
  Counsels single mandate was simply to provide a sound defence to those actions. 
  This counsel proceeded to do.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants complaint is really about the way counsel proposed to 
  conduct that defence. However, the tactics used in the defence remain the province 
  of the insurer where the insurer retains the right to control that defence. 
  One can sympathize with the appellant, given the catastrophic circumstances 
  which faced the community of Walkerton. However, absent an insurance contract 
  providing specific terms (for example, allowing the insured to direct counsel 
  appointed by the insurer in defence of claims arising from an environmental 
  disaster) the insurers right to control the defence remains unless there is 
  a reasonable apprehension of conflict of interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore conclude that in the circumstances of this case the 
  respondents had not surrendered the right to control the defence of the civil 
  actions and were not obliged to pay for independent counsel retained by the

  </span> The second issue in this appeal arises from the finding of the application 
  judge that the scope of the duty to defend resting on the respondents includes 
  the appellants legal costs and other expenses directly related to the defence 
  of the civil actions, but excludes both legal fees for the responses to regulatory 
  and investigative authorities and engineering reports and other remediation 
  expenses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court the appellant seeks an order including within the duty 
  to defend those costs excluded by the application judge and requiring the respondents 
  to reimburse the appellant for all costs falling within that duty.</p>

  </span> The respondents cross-appeal from the finding below. They seek an order 
  confirming the scope of the duty to defend as determined by the application 
  judge but, more importantly, confining the respondents duty to reimburse the 
  appellant to those costs either authorized by the respondents or incurred at 
  their request.</p>

  </span> In my view, the resolution of this issue turns simply on the provision 
  in the contract of insurance which obliges the insurer to reimburse the insured 
  only for those reasonable expenses (other than loss of earnings) which were 
  incurred at the insurers request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not find it necessary to address which of the services performed 
  by Miller Thomson could be said to fall within the scope of the duty to defend. 
  Had those services been performed by counsel appointed by the insurer it may 
  well be that all would fall within that duty. However, Miller Thomson was retained 
  and proceeded without the respondents consent. Absent some subsequent authorization 
  about which we were not advised, there is no obligation on the respondents to 
  reimburse the appellant for those services. None of those expenses were incurred 
  at the insurers request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary therefore, I would dismiss the appeal. I would allow the 
  cross-appeal and vary paragraph 4 of the order below consistent with these reasons. 
  The respondents shall have their costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
