<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Sherrill M. Rogers dated August 2 and 
  December 5, 2000 and from the orders of Justice Casimir N. Herold dated September 
  6 and 18, 2001.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals from judgments of Rogers J. and the orders of 
  Herold J.  The judgments of Rogers J. concern custody and access (August 2, 
  2000) and various financial issues, including spousal and child support, (December 
  5, 2000).  The orders of Herold J. (September 6 and 18, 2001) concern the status 
  of the boat pending execution of Rogers J.'s  judgment of December 5, 2000 and 
  pending appeal to this court.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>            Custody and access</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant does not now seek custody of the children and concedes 
  that there is no basis for interfering with the order for no access in relation 
  to Virginia and extremely limited access to Alexandra.  However, he renews his 
  application that the court order counselling for Alexandra in the hope that 
  at some point she will be willing to initiate greater access.  The appellant 
  submits that he should be given greater access to Charlotte.  Finally, the appellant 
  has raised a concern about paragraph 15 of the reasons for judgment.  He submits 
  that in this paragraph the trial judge appeared to accept what he says are unfounded 
  allegations of abuse.  He does not refer to any specific errors in law or in 
  fact made by the trial judge in respect of custody and access.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are not persuaded that there is any basis for interfering with the 
  trial judge’s judgment respecting custody and access.  This court is required 
  to give substantial deference to decisions of trial judge’s in matters of custody 
  and access.  See <i>Van De Perre v. Edwards</i>, 2001 SCC 60.  There is no error 
  in the reasons of the trial judge.  She considered the various factors and could 
  properly conclude that the limited access was in the best interests of the children.  
  As the court said in <i>Van De Perre</i>, the Court of Appeal is not in a position 
  to determine what it considers to be the correct conclusions from the evidence 
  in the name of the interests of the children.  That is the role of the trial 
  judge.  As to paragraph 15 of the reasons, as the appellant acknowledged, the 
  appeal is against the judgment, not the reasons.  That said, it is obvious to 
  us that the trial judge had no concern about abuse since she permitted unsupervised 
  access to the youngest of the children.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also submits that he was disadvantaged in arguing that 
  part of the appeal related to access because the transcript of evidence of the 
  expert witness could not be produced.  We are satisfied that the appellant has 
  suffered no such disadvantage.  In accordance with the directions made at the 
  case conference, the examination in chief of the witnesses was done by way of 
  affidavits.  Thus, we have the report of the expert.  That report tended to 
  favour the appellant’s position.  The trial judge acknowledged the assistance 
  of the expert but found that it was of diminished aid because the report was 
  outdated.  The expert had not seen the children for some three years after the 
  report had been prepared.  The trial judge noted that the expert herself advised 
  that her evidence was outdated and therefore not very helpful.  There was much 
  more current and reliable information, especially from the social worker with 
  the office of the Children’s Lawyer, upon which the trial judge could and did 
  rely.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the appeal from the judgment of Rogers J. of August 2, 
  2000 is dismissed with costs to the respondent.  The Children’s Lawyer did not 
  seek costs.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>            The appeal from the order of Herold J.</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following the decision of Rogers J. on the financial issues, the respondent 
  moved <i>ex parte</i> before Herold J. for an order requiring the appellant 
  and anyone else having control over the boat to deliver it up to the respondent.  
  This motion was granted.  The appellant having been served with this order moved 
  before Herold J. to set it aside on the basis that the respondent had failed 
  to make complete disclosure of the financial circumstances concerning the boat.  
  Herold J. conducted a hearing and decided that the order should not be set aside.  
  Orders made by judges of this court have ensured that the respondent take no 
  steps to sell or dispose of the boat pending the appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We did not call upon counsel for the respondent to respond to this part 
  of the appeal.  Assuming without deciding that one or both of Herold J.’s orders 
  were final orders that are subject to appeal to this court, we see no basis 
  for setting them aside.  The orders did nothing more than preserve the status 
  quo pending the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal from the orders of Herold J. is dismissed with costs.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>            The Financial issues</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant raises a large number of issues under the heading of financial 
  issues.  Some of those matters were never raised before the trial judge and 
  we decline to deal with them.  Our disposition of the matters arising from the 
  December 5, 2000 judgment of Rogers J. follows.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Child support</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in basing child support 
  on an amount of income of $75,000.  When the parties separated, they signed 
  a separation agreement in which the appellant agreed to pay child support on 
  the basis of income of $100,000.  The appellant had legal and financial advice 
  at the time of entering into the separation agreement.  He says, however, that 
  the income figure was based on a number of assumptions that never came about.  
  In particular, he notes that pursuant to the agreement the respondent was to 
  transfer title to the boat and to Wastestreams to him and refrain from further 
  costly litigation.  He points out that the respondent failed to transfer title 
  to the boat or Wastestreams.  As a consequence, he says he was unable to maintain 
  the same level of business activity as before.  He was also hampered by the 
  departure of the respondent, her sister and her father from the business.  Finally, 
  the respondent’s actions have immersed him in time-consuming and costly litigation.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are not persuaded that there is any reason to interfere with the 
  trial judge’s decision.  She was well aware that the respondent had not complied 
  with certain parts of the separation agreement.  She dealt expressly with the 
  fact that the respondent did not transfer Wastestreams to the appellant.  Having 
  had the benefit of the mass of evidence adduced by the parties on this issue, 
  the trial judge concluded that the income level of $100,000 was high.  She held 
  that an appropriate amount was $75,000 bearing in mind the loss of the respondent’s 
  skills in managing the business.  We see no basis to order a retrial of this 
  issue, the trial judge having made no error in law or fact in arriving at her 
  decision.  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  </span> We are also satisfied that the arrears are as set out in the schedule 
  in the respondent’s affidavit that we admit as fresh evidence.  The Director 
  has confirmed that schedule.  The order of Payne J. of March 13, 1997 establishes 
  the amount of the child support arrears as of that date.  That order was never 
  appealed.  The schedule to the respondent’s affidavit shows the calculation 
  of arrears based upon the order of Rogers J. and the payments that the appellant 
  has made on account of those arrears.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span

  </span> The appellant submits that he should not be responsible for the arrears

  The trial judge dealt with this issue in paragraph 5 of the custody and access 
  reasons and rejected the appellant’s claim that he could not locate the respondent 
  and the children.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his schedule I, the appellant claims entitlement to set off a large 
  number of payments that he has made against any amount that may be found owing 
  by him to the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several of 
  those items were never raised before the trial judge and some refer to matters 
  that occurred after the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They are therefore not properly before us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of the other matters, most are not proper deductions 
  having already been taken into account in the calculation of the arrears, having 
  been disposed of adversely to the appellant in other proceedings before Payne 
  J. and Speigel J. or having been properly dealt with by the trial judge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
  </span>There are, however, three matters that should be deducted from the child 
  support arrears:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)     As conceded by the respondent, the garnishment proceeds of $958.00 
      should be deducted from the child support arrears as set out in Schedule 
      “A” to the respondent’s fresh evidence affidavit.</p>
    <p>(ii)    As conceded by the respondent, the appellant is liable for one-half 
      of the Curtis account.  As the judgment now stands the appellant was required 
      to discharge the entire mortgage that was used to pay the entire Curtis 
      account.  Accordingly, one-half of the amounts paid to Curtis should be 
      deducted from the child support arrears as set out in the same Schedule 
      “A”.  To avoid further costly litigation we think it appropriate for this 
      court to fix the one-half amount at $11,500.</p>
    <p>(iii)  As conceded by the respondent, the appellant is liable to pay back 
      to the respondent the proceeds from the mortgage not used by her to pay 
      off the Curtis account.  Again, to avoid further costly litigation we think 
      it appropriate for this court to fix this amount to be paid back at $4,000.  
      That amount should therefore also be deducted from the child support arrears 
      as set out in Schedule “A”.</p>
    <p><b><i>The Curtis account</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the respondent should be liable for the entire 
  Curtis account because it was known at the time of the separation agreement 
  and is, in fact, referred to in her Financial Statement.  There was conflicting 
  evidence whether the equalization payment took into account the liability to 
  Curtis.  As shown in the financial statement the account was disputed at the 
  time.  The trial judge has accepted the respondent’s evidence on this point.  
  We are not persuaded that we should interfere with her finding of fact on that 
  issue.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Wastestreams and the Cadillac</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is a dispute about the payment for the Cadillac.  The trial judge 
  held that there was no “reasonable challenge” to the validity of the separation 
  agreement.  We think it is implicit in that finding and her order that the respondent 
  transfer Wastestreams to the appellant and the appellant transfer the Cadillac 
  to the respondent that the trial judge resolved the issue against the appellant.  
  We would therefore not make any variation of the trial judge’s order with respect 
  to Wastestreams or the Cadillac.  They are to be transferred in accordance with 
  the trial judgment.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The Boat</i></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge ordered that the appellant immediately sell the boat 
  and use the proceeds to </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)     repay the bank to discharge the boat mortgage, </p>
    <p>(ii)    retire the child support arrears, </p>
    <p>(iii)  repay any principal and interest paid on the boat mortgage that 
      represents the appellant’s one half share of Ms. Curtis’ bill, </p>
    <p>(iv)   retire any outstanding costs orders from this litigation with interest 
      including the cost orders of Spiegel J. and Payne J.</p>
    <p>(v)    repay any fees and disbursements incurred in the arranging of the 
      mortgage on the boat.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We did not understand the respondent to dispute that the appellant has 
  now dealt with items (i) and (v).  We also understand that the respondent has 
  taken the necessary steps to discharge the mortgage.  The respondent also concedes 
  that the appellant should only be responsible for one-half of the payments made 
  by the respondent on account of principal and interest of the boat mortgage 
  (item (iii)).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the history of this litigation, we cannot say that the trial judge 
  erred in requiring the appellant to sell the boat to retire the child support 
  arrears, the outstanding costs orders and his share of the payments made on 
  account of principal and interest.  Accordingly, we would not interfere with 
  the trial judge’s order in that respect.  However, like the trial judge we believe 
  that the appellant should be given the opportunity to keep the boat if he pays 
  those amounts.  Accordingly, the appellant will have until June 1<sup>st</sup>, 
  2002 to pay the amounts noted above.  If he does so, the respondent will complete 
  the transfer of the boat to the appellant.  If he does not, the respondent is 
  at liberty to sell the boat in accordance with the judgment of the trial judge 
  and apply the proceeds to the amounts owing to her in accordance with the judgment 
  of this court following these reasons.</p>
