<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of 
  Justice James C. Kent dated February 22, 2000.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>CHARRON J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cable Assembly Systems Limited (“Cable Assembly”) appeals from 
  the dismissal of its action against The Dufferin-Peel Roman Catholic Separate 
  School Board (“the Board”).  Cable Assembly’s claim was for damages for breach 
  of the duty of fairness and good faith arising from the Board’s Request for 
  Proposals (“RFP”) for a computer cabling project for the Board’s elementary 
  schools. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the commencement of the trial, the parties agreed that, if 
  liability was found, Cable Assembly’s damages were to be assessed at $425,000, 
  exclusive of pre-judgment interest.  It was also common ground between the parties 
  that the Board’s RFP gave rise to a duty to act fairly and in good faith during 
  the decision-making process to determine to whom the final contract would be 
  awarded.  The sole issue was whether the Board had breached its duty.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was Cable Assembly’s position at trial that the Board had 
  acted unfairly in negotiating the terms of the final contract with the three 
  lowest acceptable bidders rather than with Cable Assembly alone, as the lowest 
  of the three. Alternatively, it was alleged, on the basis of certain events 
  that occurred during the course of the negotiations, that the Board breached 
  its duty by failing to provide the three bidders with an equal opportunity to 
  make a new proposal, and by treating them differently.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge rejected Cable Assembly’s position and dismissed 
  the action.  I see no reason to interfere with this result.  It is consistent 
  with governing principles of law, and founded on findings of fact that are supported 
  by the evidence.  My reasons follow.  </p>
<h3>1.  The facts </h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The RFP was made on August 16, 1995, with a closing date of September 
  13, 1995.  The computer cabling project was described in part as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Bidders are required to provide pricing for installation of approximately 
      13,000 drops in 88 sites, however, in 1995 the Board will require installation 
      in approximately 40 sites with a completion date of December 20, 1995.  
      <i>We hope to complete the remaining installations pending budget approval 
      during the 1996 Budget Year.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The RFP also set out the Board’s objectives, concluding with 
  the following  remarks: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The [Board] requires solutions covering <i>all </i>portions of this RFP.  
      <b>Partial bids will not be accepted. </b> Please recall that the board 
      will require the installation of approximately 40 sites in the 1995 budget 
      year, <u>and hopes to receive allocations to complete installations in the 
      1996 budget year</u>.  [Emphasis in original; underline added.] </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The RFP also contained the following privilege 
  clauses: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Board shall not be obligated to accept the lowest, 
      or any, proposal in whole or in part thereof and reserves the right to re-bid 
      or cancel the project in its entirety.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Board shall not be obligated to accept the lowest, 
      or any proposal and reserves the right to accept, or reject a proposal received, 
      or to re-bid or cancel the project in its entirety. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the RFP provided that the Board’s Purchasing Acquisition 
  and Disposal Procedures (“the Procedures”) would apply.  The following provisions 
  are relevant to this appeal.  Under the definition section of the Procedures, 
  “proposal” is defined as “an offer from a supplier to provide goods and services, 
  acceptance of which may be subject to further negotiation.” The Procedures provided 
  for “purchase by negotiation” to apply in various circumstances including, under 
  clause 4.4, where “the lowest bid received substantially exceeds the estimated 
  cost of the goods.”  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The evidence at trial disclosed that, at the time the RFP was 
  made, the “estimated cost of the goods” or budget allocation for the entire 
  project was $2,000,000.  Cable Assembly’s proposal was the lowest acceptable 
  bid and the only one that came below the estimated cost for the project, at 
  $1,914,429.60.  However, by the time the proposals were evaluated, the Board 
  was aware that it did not have the funding it had expressed hope to receive 
  for the 1996 calendar year.  The budget allocation was therefore down to $1,000,000. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Given the time constraints which did not reasonably allow for 
  the making of a new RFP, and the fact that the lowest acceptable bid exceeded 
  the revised “estimated cost of the goods”, the Board decided to invoke clause 
  4.4 of the Procedures and to proceed with a purchase by negotiation.  The Board 
  met and entered into negotiations with the three lowest acceptable bidders, 
  including Cable Assembly and Compucentre Toronto Inc. (“Compucentre”).  Compucentre 
  was ultimately awarded the contract. <span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
<h3>2.  The meeting and negotiations with two additional bidders</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge held that “[w]hile a safer course 
  for the Board may have been to negotiate only with the lowest bidder, it was 
  not excluded from wider negotiations by the terms of the request for proposal, 
  its own purchasing acquisition procedures or current jurisprudence.” He therefore 
  found no breach of duty on this ground. </span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cable Assembly submits that the Procedures did not allow for 
  such negotiations to take place.  It is argued that the words “estimated cost 
  of the goods” in clause 4.4 can only be referable to the Board’s initial estimate 
  of $2,000,000, and that since Cable Assembly’s bid did not exceed that amount, 
  the clause was of no application.  Cable Assembly therefore argues that, in 
  the circumstances, the Board’s only alternative was to reject all the proposals 
  and to make a new RFP.  Alternatively, Cable Assembly argues that the definition 
  of “proposal” itself provided for negotiations to take place only with the lowest 
  bidder.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I see no merit in the contention that the definition of “proposal” 
  provided for anything more than a definition. I also do not agree that the sole 
  remaining course of action available to the Board was the making of a new RFP.  
  In my view, based on the terms of the RFP and the Procedures, the trial judge’s 
  conclusion that wider negotiations were open to the Board was reasonable. By 
  its terms, the RFP made it clear that the scope of the project and, consequently, 
  the “estimated cost of the goods” were subject to funding being available for 
  the year 1996. I therefore would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<h3>3.  The different treatment accorded to the three bidders in the negotiations 
  process</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cable Assembly’s contention at trial that the Board had not provided 
  all three bidders with an equal opportunity to make a new bid was based in large 
  part on an allegation that Compucentre had received confidential information 
  about the Board’s revised budgetary position prior to the first meeting at which 
  time the Board informed the three bidders of the reduced scope of the project.  
  Cable Assembly relied on the fact that Compucentre arrived at that meeting prepared 
  to discuss a revised proposal that involved fitting all the sites with half 
  the cables as a means of lowering the project’s cost, a suggestion that coincided 
  with the Board’s revised plan.  The trial judge was not satisfied on the evidence 
  that there had been a leak of information.  He held that “[t]reating all schools 
  equally rather than completing only approximately half the schools and perhaps 
  not being able to complete the other half in the next year is an approach that 
  two minds could conceive of independent of one another.” He therefore rejected 
  that the Board could be liable on this basis. Given the express references in 
  the RFP to the uncertainty of funding for the second year, it is my view that 
  the trial judge’s finding on this point is entirely supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Cable Assembly does not dispute the trial judge’s finding that 
  there was no leak of information, but submits that the fact that Compucentre 
  entered into the negotiations for a revised bid with a distinct advantage compounds 
  the unfairness arising from the different treatment accorded to the three bidders 
  during the negotiating process that followed.  Cable Assembly relied at trial 
  and on appeal on certain communications that had taken place and on indulgences 
  granted to Compucentre.  The trial judge held that there had been “differing 
  treatment” accorded to the three bidders in certain respects, and found that 
  this was “unfortunate and inappropriate.” However, he further concluded that 
  the differing treatment had not enabled “Compucentre’s new bid to become lower 
  than Cable’s” and that, consequently, the question whether or not it constituted 
  unfairness was “of academic interest only.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-GB>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, it was open to the trial judge on the evidence to 
  find that the differing treatment accorded to the three bidders was “unfortunate 
  and inappropriate”. However, I do not agree with Cable Assembly’s submission 
  that the trial judge erred in failing to conclude, based on the cumulative effect 
  of this conduct, that the Board breached its duty of fairness and good faith. 
  The trial judge's conclusion that the conduct in question had no bearing on 
  the ultimate award of the contract is also supported by the evidence. Consequently, 
  since Cable Assembly did not lose the opportunity to participate fairly in the 
  process, its claim was properly dismissed: see <i>Martel Building Ltd v. Canada</i>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 860.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
