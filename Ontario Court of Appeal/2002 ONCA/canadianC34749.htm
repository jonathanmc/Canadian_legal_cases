<p class=headingtitle>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 43 of the <i>Criminal Code,</i> R.S.C. 1985 c. C-46 reads as 
  follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 43. Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent 
      is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, 
      as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed 
      what is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This section provides a parent, surrogate parent or teacher with a defence 
  to what would otherwise be a criminal assault. In this respect it puts a limited 
  aspect of family life beyond the reach of the criminal law. The broad issue 
  in this appeal is whether, in doing so, the section strikes a fair balance between 
  the interest of the child and the interest of the state. Or, on the other hand, 
  does it violate the child’s constitutional rights to security of the person, 
  to be protected against cruel and unusual punishment, and to equality? </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The question is not whether a parent using reasonable force on a child 
  for corrective purposes is a good or a bad thing. The question is whether Parliament’s 
  decision not to criminalize that conduct violates the <i>Charter of Rights and 
  Freedoms</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE DECISION APPEALED FROM</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At first instance, McCombs J. answered this question in the negative. 
  For the reasons that follow, I agree with him and I would therefore dismiss 
  this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, the Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law 
  is a not&#8209;for&#8209;profit organization which advocates on behalf of children 
  and children’s rights. It is supported in this appeal by the Ontario Association 
  of Children’s Aid Societies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent, the Attorney General of Canada is supported by the Canadian 
  Teachers’ Federation and the Coalition for Family Autonomy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant commenced these proceedings by way of application. While 
  the application did not arise from a specific fact circumstance, the parties 
  tendered a significant volume of affidavit evidence from experts in child protection, 
  children’s rights and social science research. No objection was taken to this 
  method of bringing the legal questions before the court or to the standing of 
  the appellant to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> McCombs J. found significant areas of agreement among these experts, 
  which he set out at paragraph 17 of his reasons as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> 1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Corporal 
      punishment of very young children</i>: Hitting a child under two is wrong 
      and harmful. With very young children, even mild spanking has no value and 
      can destroy a child’s sense of security and self-esteem, essential components 
      of a healthy nurturing environment. A child under two will not understand 
      why he or she is being hit. [<span
style='font-size:11.0pt;'>All social science witnesses in this application accepted 
      a definition of spanking as “the administrating of one or two mild to moderate 
      ‘smacks’ with an open hand, on the buttocks or extremities which does not 
      cause physical harm.”]</span></p>
    <p> 2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Corporal 
      punishment of teenagers</i>:  Is not helpful and [is] potentially harmful. 
      There is a consensus that corporal punishment of teenagers achieves only 
      short-term compliance and carries with it the danger of alienation from 
      society, along with aggressive or otherwise anti-social behaviour.</p>
    <p> 3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Use 
      of objects in corporal punishment:</i> Corporal punishment using objects 
      such as belts, rulers, etc., is potentially harmful both physically and 
      emotionally and should not be tolerated.</p>
    <p> 4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>A 
      slap or blow to the head: </i>Corporal punishment should never involve a 
      slap or blow to the head.</p>
    <p> 5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Injury</i>:  
      Corporal punishment which causes injury is child abuse.</p>
    <p> 6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Resort 
      to spanking for correction</i>: None of the experts goes so far as to <i>advocate 
      or recommend</i> spanking, or other forms of corporal punishment, as a form 
      of child discipline. They agree that other forms of discipline, such as 
      withdrawal of privileges or removing a child from the room, are equally 
      effective in most cases.</p>
    <p> 7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Absence 
      of evidence of benefits of spanking</i>: There is general agreement among 
      the experts that the only benefit of spanking to be found in the research 
      is short-term compliance.</p>
    <p> 8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>“Time 
      out”</i> <i>as an effective alternative to spanking</i>: The experts all 
      endorsed the “time out” method as an effective and appropriate method of 
      child discipline. [<span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>The “time out” method 
      involves placing a child in a chair or room, sometimes using mild force, 
      and requiring the child to remain there for a period of time until he or 
      she calms down. …]</span> </p>
    <p> 9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Spanking 
      is not child abuse</i>: Most of the social science witnesses and professionals, 
      agree that spanking as defined here is not child abuse.</p>
    <p>10.<i>Only abusive physical punishment should be criminalized</i>: The 
      consensus among the experts is that not every instance of physical discipline 
      by a parent should be criminalized. Many believe that the desirable objective 
      of changing societal attitudes regarding child discipline would be best 
      achieved through educational incentives, rather than the use of criminal 
      sanctions to prosecute non-abusive physical punishment. <i>The experts agree 
      that extending the reach of criminal law in this way would have a negative 
      impact upon families and hinder parental and teacher efforts to nurture 
      children</i>. [Emphasis added.]<span
style='font-size:11.0pt;'></span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> McCombs J. went on to find that there is no empirical evidence establishing 
  a definitive long term causal link between corporal punishment and negative 
  outcomes for children. Nor is there any reliable empirical evidence that non-abusive 
  or mild forms of physical discipline such as spanking have a positive corrective 
  effect upon children. At paragraph 20 he summarized his findings this way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In short, it is impossible to determine with scientific precision whether 
      corporal punishment leads to negative outcomes or whether it is simply a 
      factor among other negative environmental factors that cumulatively impact 
      negatively upon a child’s future.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, he  concluded that the evidence fell short of establishing

  </span> Even though this evidence was tendered by way of affidavit rather than 
  oral testimony, these findings are entitled to appellate deference. See <i>Equity 
  Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town)</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321

  the evidence, they must be accepted in this court.</p>

  </span> McCombs J.’s reasons for decision are thorough and well reasoned. He 
  concluded that s. 43 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not violate s. 7, s. 12 
  or s. 15 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </i>He therefore dismissed 
  the application but made no order as to costs.</p>

  </span> On this appeal the appellant contests each of these determinations. 
  In doing so, neither the appellant nor the Ontario Association of Children’s 
  Aid Societies advances any arguments specific to teachers. Hence, for simplicity 
  I will, for the most part, discuss the issues in the context in which the appeal 
  was primarily argued, namely the parent-child relationship. I will address each 
  of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> challenges in turn.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>THE SECTION 7 ISSUE</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and 
      the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles 
      of fundamental justice.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that by justifying conduct which would otherwise 
  constitute a physical assault on the child, s. 43 infringes that child’s security 
  of the person and does so in violation of the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent agrees that s. 43 engages the physical security interest 
  of the child and that therefore the debate is about whether the section violates 
  the principles of fundamental justice. Hence I will proceed on the basis that 
  Parliament’s decision not to criminalize the conduct described in s. 43 engages 
  the security of the person interest protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>. 
  The question is whether this infringement is in accordance with the principles 
  of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addressing this question it is essential to consider the social and 
  legislative context in which s. 43 operates. The Supreme Court of Canada has 
  repeatedly made this clear. See for example <i>Winnipeg Child and Family Services 
  v. K.L.W.</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 519 at 562.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The family, and particularly the parent-child relationship, provides 
  the principal social context for this case. In <i> Winnipeg Child and Family 
  Services v. K.L.W., supra,</i> L’Heureux-Dubé J. speaking for the majority offered 
  an eloquent description of that context. While the potential state interference 
  in that case was by means of child protection legislation, the description may 
  be even more apt where the interference would be through the blunt instrument 
  of the criminal law. She said this at p. 562:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> The mutual bond of love and support between parents and their children 
      is a crucial one and deserves great respect. Unnecessary disruptions of 
      this bond by the state have the potential to cause significant trauma to 
      both the parent and the child. Parents must be accorded a relatively large 
      measure of freedom from state interference to raise their children as they 
      see fit.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While thankfully the family provides a vital and nurturing environment 
  for children in most instances, it can also be a place of danger. When it is, 
  the full weight of the criminal law is brought to bear, save for the conduct 
  excused by s. 43. Even in relation to that excused conduct, however, it is clear 
  the federal government does not advocate any form of physical punishment. To 
  the contrary, it sponsors extensive educational programs which specifically 
  advise against the use of physical punishment by parents. For example: “Nobody’s 
  Perfect” is one such program run by Health Canada which teaches parenting skills 
  to those with children under five. Its material clearly states: “No matter how 
  angry you are it’s never okay to spank children. It’s a bad idea and it doesn’t 
  work.”  The text then goes on to explain how a parent can effectively discipline 
  a child without using physical violence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to the criminal law and federal educational programs, provincial 
  child protection legislation is a very important part of the safety net for 
  children in Canada. Every province and territory has legislation which enables 
  the state to act to protect the child at risk or in need of protection. In Ontario 
  that legislation is the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.11. 
  While each jurisdiction has its own definition of a child in need of protection, 
  all definitions include physical abuse. I agree with McCombs J. when he said 
  this at paragraph 93 of his reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> There is a framework in place in each province and territory to monitor 
      the family and deal with issues of child protection as they arise. This 
      framework addresses such issues in a flexible manner with the goal of assisting 
      families. The provincial framework reflects the reality that criminalization 
      is often too blunt and heavy-handed an instrument with which to address 
      many of the problems concerning the welfare of children.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Many other countries have addressed this issue in much the same way 
  that Canada has. A small number of countries in Europe (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, 
  Norway, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia and Latvia) have used their civil law or family 
  law to ban the physical punishment of children. Importantly however, these countries 
  attach no criminal penalty to these provisions. Rather, they operate together 
  with educational campaigns designed to change attitudes about parental discipline. 
  No country in the world has criminalized all forms of physical punishment of 
  children by parents, which is what accepting the appellant’s position would 
  entail. Again, I agree with McCombs J.’s summary at paragraph 104 of his reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> A review of the methods other countries have adopted for dealing with 
      the corporal punishment of children demonstrates a consensus that the most 
      appropriate way of addressing this issue is to develop educational and other 
      social programs designed to change social attitudes, rather than to expand 
      the reach of the criminal law.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The situation is similar at the international agency level. The United 
  Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Canada in 1991. 
  It provides that State parties should take all appropriate measures to protect 
  a child from all forms of physical or mental harm, violence and neglect while 
  in the care of parents. It does not say that all forms of physical punishment 
  should be criminalized. Likewise, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
  which was set up under the Convention for reporting and monitoring purposes, 
  recommended in 1994 that the federal government undertake educational campaigns 
  to change attitudes about corporal punishment of children and suggested a review 
  of the penal legislation allowing corporal punishment of children by parents 
  and in schools. While the Committee recommended that corporal punishment of 
  children be prohibited, it nowhere required that this be done by an extension 
  of criminal sanctions. Indeed, where that has been done elsewhere, it has been 
  done by civil law provisions not criminal law provisions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to this broader context, the meaning and purpose of s. 43 
  are both vital in considering the appellant’s position that the section breaches 
  the s. 7 rights of children by decriminalizing certain conduct and should therefore 
  be declared to be of no force and effect. McCombs J. describes the consequence 
  of that at paragraphs 88 and 89 of his reasons for judgment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> The offence of assault is defined in s. 265 of the <i>Code</i> as “the 
      intentional application of force to another person, directly or indirectly, 
      without the consent of that person”. This broad definition, standing alone, 
      would make criminal any mild or moderate forms of physical discipline, including 
      spanking as defined in this case. Without s. 43, other forms of restraint 
      would be criminal, such as putting an unwilling child to bed, removing a 
      reluctant child from the dinner table, removing a child from a classroom 
      who refused to go, or placing an unwilling child in a car seat. All parties 
      to this application agree that these are common and necessary applications 
      of force.</p>
    <p> The fact that such commonly accepted forms of parental discipline would 
      become criminalized without s.43 is a very significant consideration.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In approaching the meaning and purpose of s. 43 it is helpful to set 
  it out again:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 43. Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent 
      is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, 
      as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed 
      what is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This section has been part of the <i>Criminal Code</i> since 1892. The 
  leading case interpreting this section is <i>R. v. Ogg-Moss,</i> [1984] 2 S.C.R. 
  173. While not a case involving a constitutional challenge, Dickson J. (as he 
  then was) provided important guidance to the interpretation of s. 43. At page 
  183 he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> A better starting point, in my view, is not the <i>purpose</i> of s. 43 
      but its effects. While a confident conclusion as to the purpose of s. 43 
      must await an accurate assessment of the meaning of its terms, the overall 
      <i>effects</i> of that section are clear, no matter how its terms are defined. 
      It exculpates the use of what would otherwise be criminal force by one group 
      of persons against another. It <i>protects</i> the first group of persons, 
      but, it should be noted, at the same time it <i>removes</i> the protection 
      of the criminal law from the second. For the Attorney-General of Ontario 
      this latter effect justifies a restrictive reading of s. 43, specifically 
      of the terms “child” and “pupil”. It is his submission that:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>… the class of persons against whom otherwise criminal force can be 
          employed ought to be restricted, not broadened, and … any section which 
          authorizes otherwise illegal physical violence should be strictly construed 
          against the actor.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p> There is much to be said in favour of this submission. As a statement 
      of general principle it accords with our normal assumptions about the purpose 
      and operation of the criminal law. One of the key rights in our society 
      is the individual’s right to be free from unconsented invasions on his or 
      her physical security or dignity and it is a central purpose of the criminal 
      law to protect members of society from such invasions. I agree with the 
      Attorney-General that any derogation from this right and this protection 
      ought to be strictly construed. Where the effect of such a purported derogation 
      is to deprive a specific individual or group of the equal protection we 
      normally assume is offered by the criminal law, I think it appropriate to 
      view the proferred definition with suspicion and to insist on a demonstration 
      of the logic and rationale of the interpretation. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dickson J. applied this strict construction approach to refuse to extend 
  the area of conduct protected from the criminal law to physical punishment of 
  mentally disabled adults. He dismissed the argument that “child” should be given 
  a functional interpretation which would have expanded the scope of the section.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dickson J. went on to make clear that s. 43 offers protection only when 
  the parent, surrogate parent or teacher applying the force intends it for “correction”, 
  when the child being “corrected” is capable of learning from that correction, 
  and then only when the force used is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While Dickson J. clearly laid out the intention with which reasonable 
  force must be applied to a child to remove that conduct from the reach of the 
  criminal law, the case did not require that he set out the legislative purpose 
  of the section and he did not do so. However his analysis of the section is 
  vital in determining that purpose. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Parliament has extended s. 43 only to parents, surrogate parents and 
  teachers – those who must interact with children on a close and constant basis 
  to properly discharge their important responsibilities to train and nurture 
  children. The section exempts only the use of force that is reasonable in the 
  circumstances and is by way of correction. It decriminalizes only non-abusive 
  physical punishment of children by parents or teachers where the intention is 
  to correct, and correction is possible.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the strict construction that it must be given, and the broader 
  context in which it must be placed, the legislative purpose of s. 43 is to permit 
  parents and teachers to apply strictly limited corrective force to children 
  without criminal sanctions, so that they can carry out their important responsibilities 
  to train and nurture children without the harm that such sanctions would bring 
  to them, to their tasks and to the families concerned. This legislative purpose 
  is congruent with two particularly vital aspects of the context in which s. 
  43 operates, namely, Parliament’s use of educational measures to promote better 
  ways of disciplining children and the existence of non-criminal legislation 
  that protects against child abuse. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is against this backdrop that the appellant’s arguments of how s. 
  43 violates the principles of fundamental justice must be considered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the appellant argues that it is an essential purpose of the criminal 
  law to protect members of society from invasions of their physical security 
  and that s. 43 violates this principle of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not agree. While this essential purpose of the criminal law cannot 
  be questioned,  I do not think it is appropriately characterized as a principle 
  of fundamental justice for the purposes of s. 7. If it were, then every deprivation 
  of a person’s physical security would <i>per se</i> be contrary to the principles 
  of fundamental justice. As Sopinka J. said in a similarly reasoned passage in 
  <i>Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 
  at 592: “This interpretation would equate security of the person with a principle 
  of fundamental justice and render the latter redundant.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the appellant says that s. 43 violates the procedural dimension 
  of fundamental justice because when an adult seeks to invoke s. 43 at a criminal 
  trial the child has no standing to oppose its application. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view this argument is misconceived. Section 43 sets up no procedure 
  which is to be tested against the principles of natural justice or procedural 
  fairness. Rather the section is purely a matter of substantive law, setting 
  up a defence for conduct that would otherwise constitute a criminal assault. 
  The infringement of the child’s personal security interest arises from Parliament’s 
  decision to enact the section, not from any legal process conducted pursuant 
  to the section. Given that this decision is embodied in a properly passed law 
  there can be no question of the section violating the procedural aspect of fundamental 
  justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the appellant argues that s. 43, in decriminalizing limited physical 
  punishment of children intended for correction, contravenes “the best interests 
  of the child”, which it argues is a principle of fundamental justice. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot agree that in the context of this case “best interests of the 
  child” stands as such a principle. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly 
  made clear that the meaning of fundamental justice must depend in a given case 
  on both the nature of the s. 7 right asserted and the character of the alleged 
  violation. See for example, <i>Godbout v. Longueuil (City)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 
  844 at 898. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In that light it must be remembered that this is not a case arising 
  in the context of family law where, if the removal by the state of a child from 
  a parent’s custody infringes the parent’s right to security of the person, fundamental 
  justice may require an evaluation of the best interests of the child. Indeed, 
  even in the family law context of child protection, the fundamental principle 
  has been articulated not in terms of “best interests of the child” but in the 
  rather more guarded language quoted by L’Heureux-Dubé J. in <i>Winnipeg Child 
  and Family Services v. K.L.W., supra,</i> at p. 572:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The protection of a child’s right to life and to health, when it becomes 
      necessary to do so, is a basic tenet of our legal system, and legislation 
      to that end accords with the principles of fundamental justice, so long, 
      of course, as it also meets the requirements of fair procedure.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the application of “best interests of the child” as a principle 
  of fundamental justice in this criminal law context presents significant difficulty. 
  In <i>Rodriguez, supra</i> at p. 591, Sopinka J. makes clear that principles 
  of fundamental justice must have some precision, sufficient to yield understandable 
  results in the particular situation. Here, where s. 43 infringes the<i> </i>child’s 
  security of the person, the appellant would have the court determine whether 
  that infringement violates that child’s best interests. If any application of 
  force to the child, however limited and reasonable in the circumstances, is 
  <i>per se</i> a contravention of the child’s best interests, the appellant’s 
  position suffers from the same tautological flaw described earlier. It equates 
  the child’s security of the person with a principle of fundamental justice and 
  renders the latter redundant. If, on the other hand a very minor application 
  of force to the child can accord with the best interests of that child, where 
  is the line to be drawn beyond which the infringement of the child’s security 
  of the person violates the “best interests” principle?  The appellant suggests 
  no answer to this dilemma. Nor can I.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hence I think that the concept of “best interests of the child”, while 
  undoubtedly one of the underlying principles upon which our society is based, 
  is insufficiently precise in the criminal law context presented here to serve 
  as a principle of fundamental justice in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the appellant argues that s. 43 violates the principles of 
  fundamental justice that proscribe vagueness and overbreadth. As this court 
  said in <i>R. v. Zundel</i> (1987), 58 O.R. (2d) 129 at 157, these are two separate 
  concepts although they may in some cases be closely interrelated. The appellant 
  argues first that by requiring that the force applied be “reasonable in the 
  circumstances” and be “by way of correction” s. 43 employs an impermissibly 
  vague standard. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree. In <i>R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society,</i> [1992] 
  2 S.C.R. 606, Gonthier J. made clear that a law will be unconstitutionally vague 
  if it does not provide an intelligible standard or sufficient guidance for legal 
  debate. At p. 627 Gonthier J. said that in determining this, factors to consider 
  include the interpretative role of the courts, the impossibility of achieving 
  absolute certainty and the possibility that many judicial<i> </i>interpretations 
  of a provision may exist and perhaps co-exist.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the concept of force that is “reasonable in the circumstances” 
  is well within the bounds of constitutionality. Courts are well used to dealing 
  with an objective standard of reasonableness in a wide variety of circumstances. 
  In <i>R. v. Dupperon</i> (1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 453 the Saskatchewan Court of 
  Appeal set out a useful list of criteria by which to assess reasonableness for 
  the purposes of this section. At p. 460 that court said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In determining that question the court will consider, both from an objective 
      and subjective standpoint, such matters as the nature of the offence calling 
      for correction, the age and character of the child and the likely effect 
      of the punishment on this particular child, the degree of gravity of the 
      punishment, the circumstances under which it was inflicted, and the injuries, 
      if any, suffered.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This conclusion is not displaced by the fact that all parties acknowledged 
  before McCombs J. that there have been cases in the past where s. 43 was applied 
  to excuse applications of force that, in light of today’s standards and the 
  unprecedented body of expert evidence filed in this proceeding, should rightly 
  be characterized as assault. In this court the respondent went so far as to 
  say that a number of these acquittals based on s. 43 were wrongly decided. As 
  Gonthier J. said, varying judicial interpretations do not equate to vagueness. 
  Moreover I agree with McCombs J. that many of the more recent cases are consistent 
  in adopting the approach of <i>R. v. Dupperon, supra</i> to assess the reasonableness 
  of the force used. Ultimately, the question is whether the phrase “reasonable 
  in the circumstances” provides the court with an intelligible standard for legal 
  debate. I have no doubt that it does.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I reach the same conclusion about the concept of “by way of correction”. 
  As I have indicated, in  <i>R. v. Ogg-Moss, supra</i>, Dickson J. engaged in 
  an elaborated interpretation of this phrase. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate 
  that this phrase provides sufficient guidance for legal debate. This concept 
  as well cannot be said to be unconstitutionally vague.</p>

  </span> The appellant argues that s. 43 suffers from overbreadth because it 
  may permit parents to use force on children up to 18 years of age when the expert 
  evidence is that hitting a child under the age of 2 is both wrong and harmful 
  and corporal punishment of teenagers is not helpful and potentially harmful.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Again, I disagree. Cory J. said in <i>R. v. Heywood</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 
  761 at 794 that legislation will be unnecessarily broad only where it goes beyond 
  what is needed to accomplish the governmental objective. As I have indicated, 
  the governmental objective in enacting s. 43 is to permit parents and teachers 
  to apply strictly limited corrective force to children without criminal sanctions 
  so that they can carry out their important responsibilities to train and nurture 
  children without the harm that such sanctions would bring to them, to their 
  tasks and to the families concerned. Section 43 is reasonably tailored to effect 
  this purpose. It does so without exposing children to unreasonable physical 
  punishment. In determining whether the force used in any particular case is 
  reasonable and therefore excused from being an assault by s.&nbsp;43, the court 
  must take into account the age of the child and will be moved also by expert 
  evidence reflecting the strong agreement of social scientists concerning physical 
  punishment of very young children and teenagers. Hence s. 43 is reasonably tailored 
  to achieve the governmental objective. It is not unnecessarily broad. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have concluded that none of the arguments advanced by the appellant 
  demonstrate that s. 43 violates any principle of fundamental justice. Beyond 
  these arguments however, the Supreme Court of Canada has said on many occasions 
  (for example, in <i>Rodriguez, supra</i>, at p. 593) that these principles require 
  that the interest of the individual and the interest of the state implicated 
  by the section under scrutiny be carefully assessed to ensure that in enacting 
  the section, Parliament has struck a fair balance between the two. Indeed in 
  <i>Godbout v. Longueuil (City)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 899, LaForest J. referred 
  to the notion of balancing individual rights against collective interests as 
  itself reflecting a principle of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have said, s. 43 implicates the child’s security of the person 
  interest. The section permits limited physical punishment of the child by a 
  limited class of people without the punishment being a criminal assault. The 
  section does not approve or encourage such punishment. It carefully defines 
  the limits that must be observed if those actions are to escape criminal sanction. 
  Those limits are found in the language of the section as informed by the kind 
  of expert evidence presented in this case rather than in the reported facts 
  of particular cases which may be incomplete or worse, wrongly decided. For exemption 
  from the criminal law this section requires that the force be applied to the 
  child by a parent, surrogate parent or teacher. The force must be reasonable 
  in the circumstances which will inevitably include consideration of the age 
  and character of the child, the circumstances of the punishment, its gravity, 
  the misconduct of the child giving rise to it, the likely effect of the punishment 
  on the child and whether the child suffered any injuries. Finally, the person 
  applying the force must intend it for “correction” and the child being “corrected” 
  must be capable of learning from the correction. Hence s. 43 infringes the child’s 
  security of the person only to the extent of decriminalizing the limited application 
  of force to the child in circumstances where the risk of physical harm is modest. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the other hand, the state interest is to avoid the harm to family 
  life that could come with the criminalizing of this conduct. Those insulated 
  from the criminal law by s. 43 – parents, surrogate parents and teachers – must 
  be in close and constant contact with children to fulfil their important responsibilities 
  to those children. As McCombs J. found, the experts agree that extending criminal 
  sanctions so as to prosecute non-abusive physical punishment would have a negative 
  impact upon families and hinder parental and teacher efforts to nurture children. 
  This state interest exists in a context where the state is also vigorously pursuing 
  educational programs to discourage and if possible eradicate physical punishment 
  of children and where there is significant non-criminal child protection legislation 
  designed to prevent child abuse. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given that the infringement of the child’s security of the person is 
  carefully circumscribed, that there is an important state interest to be achieved 
  by not criminalizing the specified conduct and that there are other mechanisms 
  in place to significantly reduce the risk of physical harm to children, I think 
  s. 43 represents a fair balance between the interest of the state and the interest 
  of the individual child. Hence in my opinion the section conforms to the principles 
  of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, the s. 7 issue presented by s. 43 is not about whether physical 
  punishment of children is good or bad. The government has clearly and properly 
  determined that it is bad. Rather the issue is whether s. 43 infringes the child’s 
  security of the person in a way that violates the principles of fundamental 
  justice. The appellant has not demonstrated any such violation. Indeed, in my 
  view, s. 43 fairly balances the individual and state interests at stake. This 
  ground of appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE SECTION 12 ISSUE</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that s. 43 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>violates 
  s. 12 of the <i>Charter. </i>That section reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>12.            Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel 
      and unusual treatment or punishment. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view the simple answer to the appellant’s argument is that s. 
  43 is not the legislative foundation for any state imposed punishment on a child, 
  nor does it subject the child to treatment by the state. It simply creates a 
  criminal law defence for certain persons who apply reasonable force to children 
  by way of correction. By enacting the section the state cannot be said to either 
  inflict the physical punishment or be responsible for its infliction. Nor when 
  the child is physically punished is there an active state process in operation 
  involving an exercise of state control over the child as there must be if s. 
  12 is to be engaged. See <i>Rodriguez, supra, </i>at p. 612.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, in my view s. 43 does not violate s. 12 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE SECTION 15 ISSUE</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that s. 43 violates s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>. 
  It says that by decriminalizing physical assaults only against children the 
  section subjects them to differential treatment on the enumerated ground of 
  age. This treatment is said to diminish their dignity and worth as human beings 
  within Canadian society.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am prepared to proceed on the basis that this is so, because in my 
  view s. 43 is clearly justified under s. 1 of the<i> Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The framework for the s. 1 analysis is well known. In <i>Egan v. Canada,</i> 
  [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513 at 605 Cory and Iacobucci JJ. set out this framework as 
  follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A limitation to a constitutional guarantee will be sustained once two conditions 
      are met. First, the objective of the legislation must be pressing and substantial. 
      Second, the means chosen to attain this legislative end must be reasonable 
      and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. In order 
      to satisfy the second requirement, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) 
      the rights violation must be rationally connected to the aim of the legislation; 
      (2) the impugned provision must minimally impair the <i>Charter</i> guarantee; 
      and (3) there must be a proportionality between the effect of the measure 
      and its objective so that the attainment of the legislative goal is not 
      outweighed by the abridgement of the right. In all s. 1 cases the burden 
      of proof is with the government to show on a balance of probabilities that 
      the violation is justifiable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have said, the objective of s. 43 is to permit parents and teachers 
  to apply strictly limited corrective force to children without criminal sanctions 
  so that they can carry out their important responsibilities to train and nurture 
  children without the harm that such sanctions would bring to them, to their<i> 
  </i>tasks and to the families concerned.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Parents, teachers and families play very significant roles in our society. 
  Facilitating those roles in a way which keeps them free of harm is an objective 
  that is undoubtedly pressing and substantial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Assuming that s. 43 violates the equality rights of children, in doing 
  so it is obviously rationally connected to the aim of the legislation, as I 
  have outlined it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The area of conduct which is decriminalized by s. 43 is strictly limited. 
  It encompasses only non-abusive physical punishment by parents and teachers 
  which is intended to and can achieve correction. In determining precisely where 
  to draw the line around the area of conduct that must be decriminalized in order 
  to achieve its legislative objective, Parliament is engaged in a difficult policy 
  judgment which, for institutional reasons, courts should scrutinize with some 
  deference. Moreover, it is difficult to think of how this area could be shrunk 
  further by criminalizing some of the conduct now protected, given the objective 
  of the legislation. To do so would risk the very harm that the legislation seeks 
  to avoid. Indeed the appellant does not suggest a further narrowing of the area 
  of decriminalized conduct but rather argues for its complete elimination. In 
  my view, the government has discharged its burden of showing that s. 43 minimally 
  impairs the equality rights of children.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the s. 1 test requires that there be a proportionality between 
  the effect of s.&nbsp;43 and its objective so that the salutary effects of the 
  legislation are not outweighed by its deleterious consequences. I have already 
  described the factors that in my view are relevant to this analysis. In creating 
  an exemption to the criminal law, the section sets strict limits on the force 
  used on children, those who can apply it and the intention with which it is 
  applied. While there is significant associational evidence linking corporal 
  punishment to poor outcomes for children, there is no empirical evidence establishing 
  a definitive long term causal link between the two. On the other hand, prosecuting 
  non-abusive physical punishment of children by parents or teachers would hinder 
  them in the discharge of their responsibilities towards those children and harm 
  families. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the context of the active educational programs undertaken by government 
  to eliminate physical punishment altogether and non-criminal legislation protecting 
  against child abuse, I think the proportionality requirement is met. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE COSTS ISSUE</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the appellant challenges McCombs J.’s decision that there be 
  no order as to costs. It seeks to have the respondent pay its costs on a solicitor 
  and client scale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot agree with the appellant. In reaching his conclusion McCombs 
  J. considered the respondent’s success in resisting this application, the undoubted 
  public importance of this <i>Charter</i> challenge, the non-profit nature of 
  the appellant and the fact that it received only limited funding pursuant to 
  a federal funding program. He looked for but found no exceptional circumstances. 
  He concluded that he could not order costs to the appellant as the unsuccessful 
  applicant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the award of no costs was one entirely within the discretion 
  of the judge of first instance. He was entitled to consider all the factors 
  he did and made no error in principle in the exercise of his discretion. I would 
  not interfere with the order he made.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, for the reasons I have set out the appeal must be dismissed. 
  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal if demanded.</p>
