  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General of Canada representing 
  the interests of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada (the “landlord”) appeals 
  the dismissal by Wilkins J. of his action brought against the respondents Chomcy 
  (the “tenants”) for arrears of rent.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On March 17, 1993, the landlord entered into a residential lease 
  with the tenants with respect to a property consisting of some 20 acres of land 
  in the Town of Pickering.  The lease was to run from May 1, 1993 to April 30, 
  1994 at a rent of $1,100.00 per month.  The lease has been subject to several 
  renewals; however, by April 1, 1998, the tenants had become monthly tenants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The property contained a ranch style residence in which the tenants 
  lived, a bank barn, and an old frame house.  There is conflicting evidence on 
  the condition of the bank barn and old frame house at the time the lease was 
  entered into.  However, in 1997-98, the landlord or his agents conducted a study 
  on the property that described the barn and the old house as “abandoned/collapsing” 
  and indicated that they “may pose a safety concern”.  The landlord had the barn 
  and old house demolished in early September 1998.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The tenants stopped paying rent in October 1998. Subsequently, 
  the parties entered into an interim rental agreement whereby the tenants agreed 
  to pay some rent on a without prejudice basis.  They paid $6,000 and then discontinued 
  the payments.  In the fall of 1999, the landlord brought an application before 
  the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) for termination of the 
  tenancy and arrears of rent.  At the time of the hearing, the arrears exceeded 
  the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  The landlord requested an adjournment of 
  the hearing in order to pursue the claim for arrears in the Superior Court.  
  The hearing was adjourned pending disposition of the claim for arrears in the 
  present action.  The issue of the termination of the tenancy is to be dealt 
  with when the hearing resumes before the Tribunal.</p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The action proceeded as a summary trial on the basis of a written 
  record without cross-examination.  In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge 
  emphasized the fact that the lease had been entirely prepared by the landlord.  
  He also gave considerable weight to the definition of “premises” in the preamble 
  of the lease, which includes the ranch style residence, the bank barn, and the 
  old frame house.  He found that by September 1998, the bank barn and the old 
  frame house were in a state of disrepair.  He also found that the destruction 
  of the bank barn and the old frame house were not the removal of an “obstruction” 
  and did not fall within clause 17 of the lease.  Instead, the trial judge relied 
  on clause 15.  He concluded that because the landlord had destroyed part of 
  the premises, had failed to rebuild the bank barn and the old frame house, and 
  had failed to declare the tenancy terminated, rent had ceased to be payable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, there were no arrears of rent to the date of the 
  trial, namely, July 6, 2001.  The trial judge dismissed the landlord’s action 
  with costs and ordered the landlord to repay to the tenants the interim rent 
  of $6,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge was clearly not impressed with the conduct of 
  the landlord.  He was of the view that the lease had been poorly drafted, that 
  the landlord had not acted reasonably in this dispute, and that the landlord 
  had been the author of its own misfortune.</p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The landlord claims to be in a Catch-22 situation as a result 
  of the trial judge’s decision.  The trial judge held that the tenants owe no 
  rent to the landlord and are, in effect, entitled to live on the property rent-free.  
  The landlord argues that, under the <i>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 
  1997, c. 24, ss. 39(1), 41, and 60(1), failure to pay rent is the sole basis 
  on which the landlord can terminate this lease.  Consequently, the landlord 
  claims that the only ground on which the tenancy could be terminated before 
  the Tribunal has been removed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The tenants rely on the fact that the lease was drafted by the 
  landlord without any input from the tenants.  They endorse the trial judge’s 
  decision that there is no rent owing on the basis of clause 15.  When pressed 
  during the hearing of the appeal, counsel reluctantly conceded that the tenants 
  will take the position before the Tribunal that, in light of the trial decision,

  </span></span> Under either scenario, the result is a commercial absurdity.  
  As a result of the destruction of an old barn and frame house, which were in 
  a state of disrepair, the tenants can remain on the property rent-free forever.

  </span></span> The trial judge never considered the contract as a whole.  Rather, 
  the trial judge centered his decision on the definition of “premises” in the 
  preamble that, as noted above, is said to include the ranch style house, bank 
  barn, and old frame house.  That definition does not accord with the use of 
  the word “premises” in another part of the preamble (i.e. &quot;fit for habitation&quot;) 
  and in clauses 2,5,8,10,19 and 21, where the word cannot possibly be taken to 
  be referring to all the buildings on the property.  In fact, the definition 
  used by the trial judge is not consistent with the use of that word in a majority 
  of the clauses in the lease.  For example, one would not interpret the provisions 
  of the lease requiring tenants to “keep the premises in ordinary state of cleanliness” 
  and to “leave the premises in good repair” as applying to the bank barn and 
  frame house.  Nor would they have believed that they would have to indemnify 
  the Crown for the repair of any damage to those buildings, as provided in clause 
  19.  Clearly, there was ambiguity in the lease with respect to the word &quot;premises&quot;.</p>

  </span></span> An apparent ambiguity in a word  in a contract does not require 
  immediate resort to the <i>contra proferentem </i>rule.  As Estey J. explained 
  in <i>Consolidated-Bathurst v. Mutual Boiler</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Even apart from the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> as it may be 
      applied in the construction of contracts, the normal rules of construction 
      lead a court to search for an interpretation which, from the whole of the 
      contract, would appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties 
      at the time of entry into the contract.  Consequently, literal meaning should 
      not be applied where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or 
      a result which would not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere [in 
      which the contract was made].</p>

  </span></span> It could not have been the intention of the parties that the 
  “destruction” of any part of the 20 acres would allow the tenant to live in 
  the residence (the ranch style house) rent-free, no more than it would allow 
  the landlord to destroy a fence in disrepair and terminate the tenancy.  On 
  the contrary, the intention of clause 15 was to provide relief to tenants who 
  can no longer occupy a residence because it has been partially or fully destroyed.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The record supports this interpretation.  Even assuming that 
  the barn and frame house were in a good state of repair in 1993 (and the record 
  does not support that assumption) there can be no doubt that they were in a 
  state of disrepair in 1998.  The tenants never complained about the condition 
  of these buildings or requested the landlord to repair them, as they may have 
  been entitled to do under s. 24(1) of the <i>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</i>, 
  if not under the lease.  Moreover, the landlord maintains that the tenants did 
  not object to the demolition of the barn and old house.  On the contrary, when 
  the tenants did complain by way of a letter dated November 11, 1998, they complained 
  only about the waste materials on the property resulting from the demolition.  
  Their letter, in its entirety, reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As per our conversation October 30<sup>th</sup>, 1998, I have been holding 
      back the rent on […] North Road, Claremont, Ontario, due to breach of Landlord 
      and Tenant Act.  I have requested as compensation all rent monies since 
      August 1998 be returned <i>until the dump and sort site is cleaned up.</i> 
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The tenants did not complain that there should have been no demolition, 
  nor did they make any claim for losing part of the enjoyment of the premises.  
  The sole basis for the complaint is the use of the property as a &quot;dump 
  and sort site&quot;. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, “destruction or partial destruction” of the premises 
  in clause 15 must be interpreted in relation to the purpose of the lease.  The 
  predominant purpose of the lease was to provide living accommodation in the 
  “ranch style” residence located on the property.  Clause 8 specifies that the 
  premises are to be used as “a private dwelling only”.  The only reasonable interpretation 
  of clause 15, in order to give the lease a sensible commercial result, is that 
  “destruction” applied only to the residence.  In the circumstances, clause 15 
  had no application and there was no basis to suspend or stop the monthly rent 
  payable. </p>

  </span></span> The lease was signed by both Frederick Earl Chomcy and Nora Chomcy.  
  The action was commenced against both defendants and the Amended Statement of 
  Defence is filed on behalf of both.  It is pleaded that Mrs. Chomcy vacated 
  the premises on or about the 30<sup>th</sup> day of December 1996.  The counterclaim 
  is brought only by Mr. Chomcy.  In the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, the 
  landlord denies being advised of this allegation until October 1999 and claims 
  recovery of the rent arrears against both tenants.  These respective positions 
  are essentially repeated in the affidavits of the landlord’s representative 
  and Mr. Chomcy.            </p>

  </span></span> This issue was not dealt with by the trial judge.  The issue 
  is only mentioned in the factum of the landlord.  It was not argued on appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no record that the landlord was advised that Mrs. Chomcy 
  had vacated the property or had made a request to have the lease amended to 
  remove her name.  More importantly, Mrs. Chomcy never filed any evidence to 
  support that allegation.  This is an issue between the tenants.  The landlord 
  is entitled to recover against both tenants. </p>

  </span></span> In the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment dated July 
  6, 2001 is set aside.  The landlord will have judgment for the total rent owing 
  since October 1998.  If the parties cannot agree to the amount owing, I direct 
  a reference be held before a registrar pursuant to Rule 54.03 of the <i>Rules 
  of Civil Procedure.</i>  </p>

  </span></span> With respect to costs, the trial judge was justified in being 
  displeased with the conduct of the landlord in this dispute.   The poorly drafted 
  lease was the major cause of the dispute.   In addition, the landlord failed 
  to act in a commercially responsible manner in dealing with the tenants and 
  was solely responsible for the inexcusable delay in resolving the dispute.  
  In these circumstances, I would make no order as to costs in this court or in 
  the court below.</p>
