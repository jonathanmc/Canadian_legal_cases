<p><b>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bonnie J. Wein dated March 8, 2001</b></p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Released Orally:  March 7, 2002</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants assert that the motions judge erred in finding that the 
  respondent was forced to withdraw from his partnership with the appellants and 
  that a <i>de facto</i> expulsion of him from the partnership had occurred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the fall of 1999, the appellants expressed their preference that 
  the respondent leave the partnership.  Thereafter, the parties entered into 
  a series of negotiations to resolve their differences, which ultimately proved 
  to be unsuccessful.  There is no evidence that these negotiations included the 
  possibility that the respondent would remain as a partner of the firm on some 
  altered basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The partnership agreement is not a model of clarity.  Nonetheless, on 
  a plain reading of Article 3.5 of the agreement, it is evident that that article 
  applies to involuntary withdrawals or expulsions from the partnership.  The 
  appellants argue that Article 8.1, which was relied upon by the respondent in 
  his application, applies only to voluntary withdrawals or expulsions.  We are 
  agreed that Article 8.1, by its language, is not so restricted.  It refers, 
  and specifically incorporates, the provisions of Article 3.5.  It contains no 
  language of qualification regarding the type of withdrawal or expulsion contemplated 
  under Article 8.1(b).  If it was the intention of the parties to so restrict 
  Article 8.1, this intention was not realized by the language of Article 8.1.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was evidence to support the factual findings of the motions judge 
  that the respondent was forced to withdraw from the partnership and we see no 
  basis to interfere with her findings in that regard.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On a combined reading of Articles 3.5 and 8.1 of the partnership agreement, 
  it was open to the motions judge to conclude that the agreement reflects an 
  intention of the parties that on involuntary withdrawal or expulsion – or, in 
  the circumstances of a voluntary withdrawal, at the option of the remaining 
  partners – the Schedule “A” price was to be paid to the departing partner.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A real issue between the parties at the hearing before the motions judge 
  was the determination and valuation of the respondent’s partnership interest.  
  At the hearing before the motions judge this was made clear.  No evidence of 
  prejudice to the appellants appears on the record before this court.  If such 
  prejudice was alleged to exist at the time of the hearing before the motions 
  judge, the appropriate remedy was to then seek an adjournment for the purpose 
  of adducing further or other evidence.  This did not occur.</p>

'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.  The respondent is entitled 
  to his costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed, on consent, in 
  the sum of $3,500 plus applicable goods and services tax.</p>
