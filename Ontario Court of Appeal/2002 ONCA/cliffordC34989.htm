  </span></span> This Crown appeal concerns the scope of the protection offered 
  by the  personal information records provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  
  The principal question raised is whether those provisions apply to so-called 
  “joint  records” where the accused and the complainant have participated in 
  the same  sessions.  The trial judge, Mocha J., held that the provisions apply 
  and that the respondent had not met the threshold test for production of those 
  or any other records sought by the defence.  The summary conviction appeal court 
  judge held that the provisions did not apply to joint  records.  Hawkins J. 
  also held that the defence had met the threshold test for production of the 
  private  records to the court for inspection.  Accordingly, he allowed the appeal 
  and ordered a new trial.  For the following reasons, while I would confirm the 
  trial judges' ruling with respect to the records, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE FACTS</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent and the complainant began a common law relationship 
  in 1994 when the respondent began to live with the complainant and her daughter 
  from an earlier relationship.  The relationship was unstable and the complainant 
  had only recently returned to live with the respondent in the weeks before the 
  incident giving rise to the charge of sexual assault.  The respondent and the 
  complainant quarreled a few days before the incident and were not talking to 
  each other.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent and the complainant lived on the bottom floor 
  of an apartment building in Toronto.  The complainant’s parents, siblings and 
  other family members lived in the same building in other apartments.  On the 
  night of August 17, 1996, the complainant’s daughter stayed at her grandmother’s 
  apartment.  The complainant slept in her daughter’s room and the respondent 
  slept in the master bedroom.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant gave this version of the assault.  On the morning 
  of Sunday, August 18th, she was rushing to get ready to go to church with her 
  mother and other family members.  The respondent came in to the daughter’s bedroom 
  and began to hug her and try to talk to her.  The respondent was only wearing 
  a T-shirt.  The complainant told him that she did not want him to touch her 
  and she did not want to talk to him.  However, the respondent picked her up 
  and placed her on the bed.  She struggled and screamed at him to stop and get 
  off her.  The respondent persisted and pulled up her shirt and began to kiss 
  her breasts.  The complainant then heard tapping at an outside window and her 
  mother calling her and asking what was going on.  The respondent covered her 
  mouth and persisted with the attack.  The complainant’s mother and sister entered 
  the room and told the respondent to get off her.  The respondent drove them 
  out of the room.  There was some further conversation and then a brief “tug-of-war” 
  at the door with the respondent trying to keep the door closed and the complainant’s 
  sister and brother trying to gain entry to the apartment.  Eventually, the door 
  opened and the complainant left.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant’s mother and one of her sisters, L. testified 
  for the Crown.  The mother testified that she heard her daughter crying and 
  went downstairs to investigate.  She knocked on the door (not the window as 
  the complainant testified) and after receiving no response she and one of her 
  other daughters was able to enter the apartment with a key supplied by the superintendent.  
  She heard her daughter crying and found her in her granddaughter’s bedroom.  
  When she looked in, the respondent stood up.  He was wearing only a T-shirt.  
  He pushed her and L. away.  The complainant was, however, able to leave the 
  bedroom and they pulled her out of the apartment and called the police.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> L.'s  evidence was similar to that of her mother, except that 
  she recalled her mother going to one of the outside windows to look in to the 
  apartment after they had no response to knocking on the door.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent’s version of events was quite different.  On Sunday 
  morning, he went to the bedroom where the complainant had spent the night to 
  try and speak to the complainant.  As far as he could tell, the complainant 
  was not getting ready for church.  She was in shorts and a T-shirt and was sorting 
  laundry.  In fact, while he often went to church with the complainant, it was 
  very rare for her to go with her family.  Initially, he was rebuffed and he 
  just sat down on the bed.  Eventually, the complainant lay down beside him and 
  they began to hug and make up.  Suddenly, the complainant’s mother began to 
  scream through the open window and the complainant’s demeanour completely changed.  
  She became angry and agitated.  There was a loud exchange between the complainant 
  and her mother and the complainant began to cry.  She then became angry with 
  the respondent and blamed him for getting her in trouble.  The respondent heard 
  a noise at the door and he left the bedroom to investigate.  He saw the complainant’s 
  mother and other members of the family in the apartment.  The respondent was 
  still only wearing the T-shirt and when the mother saw this she “went nuts” 
  and ran out of the apartment.  The respondent closed the door.  The complainant 
  remained in the apartment for a short time.  She asked the respondent if she 
  could leave and he let her go.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant had no physical injuries.  The respondent had 
  a small scratch on his cheek and several scratches on his shoulder.  The complainant 
  was unsure if she had caused those injuries.  The respondent thought the complainant 
  might have scratched him after the confrontation between her and her mother 
  at the window when the complainant began to cry and blame him for getting her 
  in trouble.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE APPLICATION FOR RECORDS</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;'><b><span lang=EN-US>The 
  notice of application and supporting affidavit</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Some months prior to trial, counsel for the respondent filed 
  an application for the production of third party records of Dr. Hardin “pertaining 
  to the complainant”.  In the notice of application, the defence stated that 
  the respondent had attended several of the treatment sessions with the complainant 
  at Dr. Hardin’s office.  The defence asserted that the records “as well as Dr. 
  Hardin’s oral testimony” were necessary to the defence as they were likely to 
  establish the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>a)   The history of the relationship;</p>
    <p>b)   The relative credibility of the parties and specifically a purported 
      tendency on the part of the complainant to exaggerate;</p>
    <p>c)   The unfolding of the events leading up to the time of the allegations, 
      including the complainant’s attitude and state of mind;</p>
    <p>d)   A pattern on the part of the complainant to accuse the respondent 
      and then recant shortly thereafter; and</p>
    <p>e)   The complainant’s feelings of shame and guilt about her consensual 
      sexual relationship with the respondent, arising from her social and religious 
      background.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent filed his own affidavit in support of the application.  
  He claimed that the complainant was raised in a strict religious family in the 
  Philippines and had initially not informed her family of the birth, out of wedlock, 
  of her daughter.  He also stated that the complainant’s sisters  tried to separate 
  the complainant and the respondent because they were “living in sin”.  According 
  to the respondent’s affidavit, the complainant therefore sought counselling 
  from Dr. Hardin, a psychotherapist.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent accompanied the complainant on several of those 
  sessions and heard Dr. Hardin tell the him and the complainant that, “as a result 
  of her powerful religious convictions as well as those of her sisters, [the 
  complainant] was constantly feeling compelled to give her daughter up to her 
  married sisters and to leave [the respondent]”.  In May of 1996, the pressure 
  proved too much and the complainant ended her relationship with the respondent 
  and moved herself and her daughter in with her mother.  In early June, the complainant 
  and her daughter moved back in with the respondent.  The complainant’s mother 
  and sisters were outraged and told her that her “soul would burn in hell”.  
  The complainant and the respondent continued to see Dr.&nbsp;Hardin, &quot;who 
  assessed her condition as having deteriorated significantly”.  He advised the 
  complainant that she was “more at risk and that she should increase the frequency 
  of her sessions”.  The complainant had almost no contact with her family until 
  August 1, 1996, when they attempted to reconcile with her.  The complainant 
  then stopped talking to the respondent. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the affidavit, the respondent asserted that 
  Dr. Hardin would provide the following evidence:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>a)   The complainant’s upbringing and religious and family pressures;</p>
    <p>b)   The complainant’s attitude toward sex and her feelings of guilt about 
      allowing herself to have sex out of wedlock;</p>
    <p>c)   The emotional support the respondent provided to the complainant and 
      the love and respect he felt for her;</p>
    <p>d)   The manner in which the complainant’s perception of reality is often 
      warped by her feelings of shame and desperation; and </p>
    <p>e)   The likelihood that all of the foregoing factors could result in the 
      complainant making false allegations against the respondent.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The respondent concluded his affidavit with 
  the assertion that Dr. Hardin was the only objective witness who could speak 
  to the religious struggles and family pressures suffered by the complainant.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>                        </span>The hearing before 
  the trial judge</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the hearing before the trial judge, counsel for the complainant 
  opposed production of Dr. Hardin’s records.  Counsel for the respondent stated 
  that the defence position was that the complainant made the complaint to the 
  police because of the nature of her relationship with her family.  He stated 
  that Dr. Hardin’s evidence would show the conflict between the complainant and 
  her family “with respect to the way that they would want her to live and the 
  way that she was living, and the religious component or the strong religious 
  belief that she has”.  He asserted that the fact that the family knew about 
  the relationship “doesn’t take that away”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent conceded that he had no information 
  about any specific occasions on which the complainant had made allegations about 
  the respondent and then recanted them as alleged in paragraph (d) in the notice 
  of application.  He also conceded that there was nothing in the affidavit to 
  tie this part of the application to any information Dr. Hardin might provide.  
  He stated, however, that “if my client’s position is correct that there have 
  been recanting of statements on previous occasions and if it is true that their 
  statement with respect to religious belief and her interaction with him, then 
  certainly that will go to the credibility of the party”.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>                        </span>The trial judge’s ruling</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge’s ruling related to the threshold issue of whether, 
  in accordance with s. 278.4 of the <i>Criminal Code,</i> Dr. Hardin’s records 
  should be produced to the court for review by the judge.  Section 278.5(1) provides 
  that the trial judge may order production to the court if the judge is satisfied 
  that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(<i>a</i>)       the application was made in accordance with     subsections 
      278.3(2) to (6); </p>
    <p>(<i>b</i>)       the accused has established that the record is likely   
      relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify; 
      and</p>
    <p>(<i>c</i>)       the production of the record is necessary in the interests 
      of justice.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 278.5(2) sets out the test the judge must apply in making 
  this determination.  The trial judge observed that the application was based 
  solely on the theory that the records may relate to the credibility of the complainant.  
  She held that the allegation of a pattern of making allegations and then recanting 
  them was not substantiated in the material.  As to the complainant’s feelings 
  about having consensual sex because of her religious background, the trial judge 
  stated that the fact the complainant was “Roman Catholic and may have had certain 
  feelings about consensual sex is irrelevant to the issues in this court”.  However, 
  she went on to say that if counsel felt that this was a relevant issue, the 
  best evidence of the complainant’s religious affiliations would come from the 
  complainant’s family members.  As to the claim that the respondent felt nothing 
  but love and respect for the complainant, the trial judge stated that Dr. Hardin’s 
  evidence would be irrelevant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the trial judge dismissed the application.  She 
  stated that based on the application material before her “at this time”, the 
  respondent had not met the test for release of third party records.  There was 
  no suggestion during the hearing that the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions did 
  not apply because the sessions with Dr. Hardin were joint  sessions.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Evidence during the trial about

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant’s mother was asked in cross-examination if she 
  approved of the relationship between the complainant and the respondent.  She 
  said, “I really don’t, I can’t make decision for that because it’s up to them, 
  she’s my daughter and it’s up to her”.  Counsel did not further pursue the matter 
  with this witness.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In cross-examination, the complainant testified that there was 
  a “lot of pressure” on her relationship with the respondent and that her family 
  did not approve of the relationship.  She stated that she loved her family very 
  much and loved the respondent and she wanted the respondent to “accept” her 
  family.  She denied that she had ever previously accused the respondent of sexual 
  assault and then recanted.  She agreed that she had tried to end the relationship 
  at different times because the respondent did not seem to have a commitment 
  to her and only wanted her for sex.  She denied that religion had anything to 
  do with the problems with their relationship.  However, she testified that she 
  believed it was sinful to live with the respondent because he was previously 
  married.  This caused her concern personally, but was not something that concerned 
  her family.</p>

  about her visits to Dr.&nbsp;Hardin.  She testified that the respondent came 
  with her but stayed outside.  Crown counsel then objected and the trial judge 
  stated that the respondent would have to bring a new application if he wishes 
  to read evidence of the content of those meetings .  The respondent’s counsel 
  did not pursue the matter any further.</p>

  </span></span> After the complainant testified, the trial judge adjourned the 
  case for several months because the complainant’s sister was pregnant and not 
  available to testify.  The complainant’s sister testified in cross-examination 
  that her mother did not interfere with the relationship between the complainant 
  and the respondent.  Counsel did not pursue the matter further.</p>

  </span></span> The respondent testified that the complainant wanted to have 
  a relationship with him and with her family, but they did not approve and this 
  was “very divisive for her”.  He testified that at one point after they split 
  up and then reconciled, her mother  “disowned her and cursed her and threatened 
  her”.  This incident had not been put to any of the Crown witnesses.</p>

  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent also asked the respondent whether 
  Dr. Hardin had been his doctor.  According to the respondent, he became a patient 
  because Dr. Hardin had become interested in him in terms of his relationship 
  with the complainant.  Counsel did not ask any further questions about this.  
  In cross-examination, Crown counsel asked the respondent about family pressures 
  on the complainant.  He testified that the complainant was ambivalent and was 
  “torn back and forth” and this was one of the reasons that she sought psychiatric 
  help.  He agreed that he attended family functions with the complainant, although 
  he believed his inclusion was something of an afterthought.  He stated that 
  in August 1996, there was no contact between him and her family.</p>

  </span></span> Crown counsel asked the respondent if the complainant had expressed 
  the concern that he was not really committed to her and was only interested 
  in her for sex.  The respondent seemed to agree but then said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Keep in mind too that she comes from a very strict Catholic background 
      and she’s very, there’s a lot of guilt feelings about sex and relationships 
      out of wedlock and having children, you know unmarried, being an unmarried 
      mother, and all these things.  She’s very committed to the Church, she feels 
      guilt if she doesn’t go to church.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Crown counsel questioned the respondent further about this.  
  The respondent testified that the complainant’s family had broken up the relationship 
  between the complainant and her daughter's father and sent the complainant to 
  Canada.  He agreed that soon after his relationship began with the complainant, 
  they started living together in the same building as the rest of her family.  
  Dr. Hardin and others had advised them to move out of that building.  It seemed 
  to the respondent that the family kept apart from the complainant and there 
  would be periods when they would not talk to her.</p>

  </span></span> Defence counsel (not Mr. Dawe) then called Dr. Hardin.  In response 
  to leading questions, Dr. Hardin agreed that the respondent had been a patient 
  and that he had seen him along with the complainant.  It was unclear whether 
  Dr. Hardin intended to say that he had seen the two together.  At this point, 
  Crown counsel objected and the defence counsel stated that he was not calling 
  Dr. Hardin as an expert but “to buttress evidence given by [the respondent]”.  
  Counsel seemed unsure about how Dr. Hardin’s evidence would be relevant.  He 
  conceded that Dr. Hardin's testimony on what the respondent told him would be 
  inadmissible hearsay.  He then suggested that Dr. Hardin could confirm that 
  he had felt it would be good for the respondent and the complainant to move 
  away from the complainant's family.  The trial judge pointed out that this would 
  be opinion evidence and counsel had said he did not intend to qualify Dr. Hardin 
  as an expert.  She also stated that even if he were qualified as an expert, 
  Dr. Hardin's opinion would be simply based upon hearsay from the respondent.

  This interchange then took place:</p>

  for the respondent has submitted that, irrespective of the records issue, the 
  order for a new trial must stand because the trial judge misapprehended certain 
  crucial parts of the evidence.  I will deal with those issues later in these 
  reasons.  The trial judge found that the complainant was forthright in acknowledging 
  that the family did not approve of the relationship and that this caused her 
  some concern.  She also reviewed the evidence that the complainant had said 
  that religion did not have anything to do with the situation but that living 
  with the respondent when they were not married did cause her some concerns.  
  In this too, the complainant was being forthright.  In summary, the trial judge

  they gave consistent accounts on all of the major particulars.  </p>

  beyond a reasonable doubt.  She also considered whether the respondent might 
  have had a defence of mistaken belief in consent, although this had not been

  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>Application of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> to joint 
    counselling records</span></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I stated earlier, the main issue in the appeal is whether 
  the personal information records provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> cover 
  joint records.  Before dealing with this issue, it is only right to point out 
  that at trial, counsel for the respondent never contended that the <i>Criminal 
  Code </i>provisions did not apply to Dr. Hardin’s records.  This view of the 
  case was raised for the first time before the summary conviction appeal court.  
  Resolution of the issue turns on the wording of s. 278.1, which provides as 
  follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.9, &quot;record&quot; 
      means any form of record that contains personal information for which there 
      is a reasonable expectation of privacy and includes, without limiting the 
      generality of the foregoing, medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counseling, 
      education, employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, 
      personal journals and diaries, and records containing personal information 
      the production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament 
      or a provincial legislature, but does not include records made by persons 
      responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This definition is important because under s. 278.2, no “record 
  relating to a complainant or a witness shall be produced to an accused in any 
  proceedings in respect of”  an offence such as sexual assault, except in accordance 
  with the scheme set out in sections 278.3 to 278.91.  The Crown’s principal 
  submission in this court was that since these are therapeutic or counseling 
  records relating to the complainant, they fall within the s. 278.1 definition 
  of record, irrespective of whether or not the accused or some other party was 
  present with the complainant and the counsellor.  In the alternative, she submits 
  that notwithstanding the presence of another party, such as the respondent in 
  this case, the complainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect 
  to the records and therefore s. 278.1 applied.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent contends that no record of any kind 
  falls within s. 278.1, even if like therapeutic and counseling records they 
  are specifically enumerated in the section, unless there is a reasonable expectation 
  of privacy.  He submits that where, as here, the accused was present during 
  the counseling session, there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the correct interpretation falls somewhere between 
  the positions advanced by the Crown and the respondent.  The leading case on 
  the interpretation of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions respecting disclosure 
  of personal information records is <i>R. v. Mills</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.).  <i>Mills</i> involved a constitutional challenge to these provisions.  
  In order to deal with that challenge the court had to determine with some particularity 
  the ground covered by the legislative scheme and the <i>Charter</i> principles 
  at stake.  Writing for a majority of the court, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. 
  held that several principles were at play.  They paid special attention to the 
  accused’s right to full answer and defence and the complainant’s right to privacy 
  and thus protection against an unreasonable search and seizure.  They also considered 
  the equality and security of the person interests may be implicated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the right to privacy, McLachlin and Iacobucci 
  JJ. referred to the line of cases beginning with <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, 
  [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145 that protect a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy.  
  They held at p. 364 that this right was relevant to the issues because “an order 
  for the production of documents is a seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the 
  <i>Charter</i>”.  Thus, an order for production of documents made under the 
  personal records scheme “falls within the ambit of s. 8”.  The majority then 
  turned directly to s. 278.1 and concluded as follows, at p. 365:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Therefore, if a record does not contain information regarding which 
      there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, then it is not subject to 
      the impugned provisions governing production.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As part of the discussion about the importance of the privacy 
  right in therapeutic records, the majority noted at p. 366 that “the protection 
  of the complainant's reasonable expectation of privacy in her therapeutic records 
  protects the therapeutic relationship”.  Despite the importance of this privacy 
  interest, the majority held at p. 367 that the right may be limited and in particular 
  a “reasonable” search or seizure is permitted.  Most importantly, McLachlin 
  and Iacobucci JJ. held at p. 368 that a “reasonable search or seizure is consistent 
  with the principles of fundamental justice”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The majority then undertook the task of measuring the personal 
  information records provisions against the <i>Charter</i> principles involved.  
  One line of attack against the constitutionality of the legislation, which had 
  found favour in the trial court, was that the legislation was overly broad because 
  of the wide definition of “record” in s. 278.1.  The majority rejected this 
  attack in these words, at p. 372:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>The response to these claims is to remember that the legislation applies 
      only to records &quot;in which there is a <i>reasonable </i>expectation 
      of privacy&quot; (s. 278.1 (emphasis added)). Only documents that truly 
      raise a legally recognized privacy interest are caught and protected: see 
      <i>R. v. Regan</i> (1998), 174 N.S.R. (2d) 230 (S.C.). The Bill is therefore 
      carefully tailored to reflect the problem Parliament was addressing</span></u> 
      - how to preserve an accused's access to private records that may be relevant 
      to an issue on trial while protecting, to the greatest extent possible, 
      the privacy rights of the subjects of such records, including both complainants 
      and witnesses. <u>By limiting its coverage to records in which there is 
      a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Bill is consistent with the definition 
      of s. 8 privacy rights discussed above.</u> Moreover, as will be discussed 
      below, the mere fact that records are within the ambit of Bill C-46 will 
      not, in itself, prevent the accused from obtaining access to them. Applied 
      in this way, s. 278.1 and s. 278.2(1) will not catch more records than they 
      should, and are not overly broad.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The reference to, and apparent approval of, <i>R. v. Regan</i> 
  is important in this context.  In <i>Regan</i>, MacDonald A.C.J.S.C. was faced 
  with an application for a declaration that the these provisions were unconstitutional.  
  At para. 35, he said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I believe that it is not only understandable but necessary for Parliament 
      to establish an all inclusive definition of “record”.  The regime must cover 
      all documents for which there may potentially be a reasonable expectation 
      of privacy.  <u>At the same time the accused is protected by the limiting 
      words in this section.  The definition applies only to records “that contain 
      personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy”.  
      This section will not deny the accused access to records that would otherwise 
      be public in nature</u>.  [Emphasis added.]<u></u></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>MacDonald A.C.J.S.C. then gave school records

  records, would not be covered if they were otherwise public in nature.</span></p>

  </span></span> In my view, <i>Mills</i> is conclusive against the broad proposition 
  asserted by the Crown that any record specifically named in s. 278.1 is covered 
  by the legislation.  In order to uphold the constitutionality of the legislation, 
  the Supreme Court found that the definition only applies to records in which 
  the complainant or witness has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  It is only 
  in connection with such records that the complainant’s privacy rights would 
  be implicated and there would be a need to balance those rights against the 
  accused’s important right to full answer and defence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, the structure of s. 278.1 cannot be ignored.  Parliament 
  could have simply defined “record” for the purpose of the scheme as one in which 
  there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The fact that Parliament went 
  on to specify certain types of records was, in my view, intended to assist the 
  court in determining the scope of the provisions.  It obviously wanted to avoid 
  an <i>ad hoc</i> reappraisal in every case of the need to protect certain important 
  categories of records that could be presumed to have a reasonable expectation 
  of privacy.  Thus, absent evidence from the accused to the contrary, a trial 
  judge is entitled to assume that a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches 
  to any of the records falling within the enumerated categories and that, accordingly, 
  the accused must comply with the provisions in order to gain access to the records.</p>

  </span></span> The question in this case, then, is whether the accused adduced 
  any evidence before the trial judge at the time of the application that there 
  was no reasonable expectation of privacy in these therapeutic and  records concerning 
  the complainant.  The evidence at the time of the application is in the respondent’s 
  affidavit, which states that he had accompanied the complainant to “several 
  of her sessions with Dr. Hardin” in which he “personally heard” Dr. Hardin identify 
  some of the complainant’s problems.  The respondent also stated that Dr. Hardin 
  had met with him and the complainant on many occasions.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, notwithstanding this evidence, these were records 
  in which the complainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The whole 
  thrust of the respondent’s affidavit is that these were the complainant’s  sessions 
  in which she was seeking help because of the pressure being brought to bear 
  by her family.  The items of information about which the respondent claimed 
  Dr. Hardin had knowledge concerned highly personal matters such as her attitude 
  toward sex and her feelings of guilt about having sex out of wedlock.  In <i>Mills</i> 
  at p. 365, the majority discussed the nature of the privacy interest protected 
  by these provisions and said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>This interest in being left alone by the state includes the ability 
      to control the dissemination of confidential information.</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span

    <p><u><span

      &quot;about one's lifestyle, intimate relations or political or religious 
      opinion</span></u>s&quot;: <i>Thomson Newspapers, supra</i>, at pp. 517-18<i>,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The information that the respondent sought to have produced was 
  of this nature.  It was about her “lifestyle, intimate relations or … religious 
  opinions”.  The fact that the respondent was present for some of these sessions 
  and may have been privy to some of the disclosures by the complainant and the 
  advice from Dr. Hardin did not undermine her reasonable expectation of privacy.  
  First, if the respondent was present, it was likely because Dr. Hardin felt 
  it would be helpful in treating the complainant.  Thus, for example, disclosures 
  in group therapy would not lose the protection of the <i>Code</i> provisions 
  because other persons were present.  Second, as the <i>Mills</i> analysis makes 
  clear, the intrusion against which these provisions offer protection is not 
  just intrusion by the accused but by the state.  The procedure set up in the 
  <i>Code</i> is not for the purpose of satisfying some prurient interest in the 
  accused.  It is not an end in itself.  The purpose is to obtain information 
  to be used in a criminal trial, information, if the application is successful, 
  that will be exposed to the judge, the lawyers, police officers, the jury, and 
  members of the public who may be present at the trial.  The point of these provisions 
  is that the complainant has the right to be left alone in these highly personal 
  areas unless the accused can meet the test set out by Parliament.  Finally, 
  as the majority said in <i>Mills</i> at p. 375, privacy is not an all or nothing 
  right and in modern society privacy interests “include the reasonable expectation 
  that private information will remain confidential to the persons to whom and 
  restricted to the purposes for which it was divulged”.</p>

  </span></span> The appeal judge erred in holding that s. 278.1 did not apply 
  to the records in Dr.&nbsp;Hardin’s possession.  The appeal judge also purported 
  to order Dr. Hardin to produce the joint  records to the respondent on the basis 
  that they were as much the respondent’s as the complainant’s.  In my view, the 
  appeal judge had no jurisdiction to do so.  This was a criminal case and the 
  application for production was made under the <i>Code</i> provisions.  If, as 
  I have held, the records fell within s. 278.1, they could only be ordered produced 
  in accordance with the procedure set out in ss. 278.2 to 278.91.  Whether or 
  not the respondent had some right  to obtain his records independent of this 
  scheme was not before the appeal court judge.  He was seized only with a summary 
  conviction appeal under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>

  </span></span> Section 278.5 sets out the threshold test that an accused must 
  meet to obtain an order that records be produced for review by the trial judge.  
  For the purposes of this case, the applicable considerations are set out in 
  s. 278.5(1)(b) and (c).  The accused must establish that the record is likely 
  relevant to an issue in the case and production of the record is “necessary 
  in the interests of justice”.  Section 278.5(2) sets out a number of factors 
  to be taken into account.  The factors that seem to me of particular concern 
  in this case are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(<i>a</i>)       the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused 
      to make a full answer and defence;</p>
    <p>(<i>b</i>)       the probative value of the record; and</p>

      privacy with respect to the record [.]</p>

  </span></span> I will now turn to the five grounds upon which the respondent 
  put the case for production.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><i>a)  The history of the relationship</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was open to the trial judge to find that, when the application 
  was made, the records were not necessary to establish the history of the relationship.  
  These parties were all well known to each other.  The complainant, her family 
  members and the respondent were the best sources of information about the history 
  of the relationship.  Dr. Hardin’s notes would, at best, recount hearsay statements 
  from the complainant and the respondent about that history.  To the extent that 
  it was relevant, the respondent had more than adequate means of exposing the 
  nature of the relationship without the need to turn to these personal records.  
  It would have been open to the respondent to renew the application if, as the 
  trial developed, it became necessary to obtain such information from some other 
  source.  However, at trial counsel for the respondent made little if any effort 
  to pursue this issue either with the Crown witnesses or the respondent.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There was nothing in counsel’s submissions before

  </span></span> There was nothing in the respondent’s affidavit and in counsel’s 
  submissions to show that Dr. Hardin had any records concerning the events of 
  August 18<sup>th</sup>.  If there was any doubt on that matter, it was settled 
  in the course of submissions when counsel wanted to call Dr. Hardin to testify 
  at the trial proper.  As I have said, counsel conceded that Dr.&nbsp;Hardin 
  had no information about the incident.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><i>d)  A pattern on the part of the complainant to accused the respondent 
    and then recant</i></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There was no substance to this ground.  There is nothing in the 
  respondent’s affidavit to support the allegation of a pattern of allegations 
  against the respondent followed by recantations.  Counsel at trial could offer 
  no specifics of any such allegations, although the respondent would have been 
  in the best possible position to provide those details.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><i>e)   The complainant’s feelings of shame and guilt about her consensual

  </span></span> Counsel for the respondent submits that the trial judge erred 
  in holding that the complainant’s feelings about having consensual sex because 
  of her religious background were irrelevant to the issues before the court.  
  In this court, he argues that the uncontradicted evidence on the application 
  was that the complainant was under intense familial pressure to break off her 
  intimate relationship with the respondent and that this pressure was causing 
  her serious psychological torment and anguish.  This led her to seek the assistance 
  of Dr. Hardin.  The respondent argues that this psychological torment and anguish 
  was so intense that it led the complainant to make a false allegation of sexual 
  assault when her mother saw her with the respondent the morning of August 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, based on the submissions that were made to her, it 
  was open to the trial judge to conclude that the records should not be produced.  
  At trial, counsel put the case for production as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The evidence that we’re trying to get admitted, Your Honour, is something 
      that definitely will show the conflict between herself and her parents with 
      respect to the way that they would want her to live and the way that she 
      was living, and the religious component or the strong religious belief that 
      she has, and the fact that [the family] knew before [about the consensual 
      sexual relationship] doesn’t take that away.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was open to the trial judge to find that the complainant’s 
  religious beliefs about consensual sex were irrelevant to the issues in the 
  case.  The submissions on the application disclosed that the complainant had 
  lived openly with the respondent as man and wife, in the same building as her 
  family members.  Like the trial judge, I find it difficult to see how her religious 
  beliefs were of any probative value to the case.  The respondent has not shown 
  that that part of the trial judge’s ruling was incorrect.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The other aspect of the case for production is more compelling.  
  The fact that the complainant was under intense family pressure to end the relationship 
  to the point that she was suffering psychological harm was arguably a viable 
  theory.  The question for the trial judge, however, was whether Dr. Hardin’s 
  notes were necessary for the respondent to make this defence.  I think it was 
  open to the trial judge to conclude that, at that stage, they were not.  At 
  the point of the application, there was nothing to indicate that this information 
  was unavailable from other sources that would not involve an invasion of the 
  therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal court judge fell into error when he held that the 
  trial judge erred in failing to produce the record because, in his view, the 
  records “may contain material relevant to this issue”.  Section 278.5 also permits 
  the judge to take into account a broader range of interests, like the privacy 
  rights of the complainant:  <i>Mills</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;385.  Likely 
  relevance is not the sole consideration.  On the record before her, it was open 
  to the trial judge to conclude that the information sought from Dr. Hardin’s 
  records could be obtained from other sources.  I return to the important feature 
  of this case: the allegation arose out of an on-going relationship between the 
  complainant and the respondent.  The complainant and her family members were 
  going to be called as Crown witnesses.  They were available for cross-examination 
  and were an obvious source of information about the alleged familial pressures.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I will give one example based upon one of the only specific pieces 
  of information provided in the respondent’s affidavit.  He stated that the complainant’s 
  mother and sisters were outraged when the complainant moved back in with him 
  in June 1996 and told her that her “soul would burn in hell”.  This was potentially 
  powerful evidence of the intensity of pressure being brought to bear upon the 
  complainant.  But the complainant, her mother and her sister were  obviously 
  superior sources of this information.  If one or all of them conceded that this 
  statement was made, there would be no need to access the records.  Yet, none 
  of the complainant, her mother and her sister was asked about this statement, 
  notwithstanding the trial judge’s comment in her ruling that the family members 
  were the best source of this information.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If at some juncture in the trial it became apparent that Dr. 
  Hardin’s notes were necessary for the respondent to make his defence, the respondent 
  would not have been precluded from renewing the application.  In fact, such 
  an opportunity presented itself during cross-examination of the complainant. 
   As indicated, after obtaining some information from the complainant about family 
  pressures, counsel for the respondent attempted to question the complainant 
  about her sessions with Dr. Hardin.  The trial judge stated that, as she saw 
  it, what the complainant told Dr. Hardin was irrelevant unless the respondent 
  wanted to make a new application.  Counsel declined to do so.  The fact that 
  counsel did not do so is very telling.  It was the defence position that the 
  respondent was present for some of these sessions.  If he had information that 
  the complainant had made statements to Dr. Hardin that were inconsistent with 
  her testimony about the family pressures, such as the “burn in hell” comment, 
  that was the time to bring it up and renew the application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before leaving this issue, I would make one final observation.  
  When the trial judge comes to determine whether the records should be produced 
  to the court,  s. 278.5 provides that one of the factors to be considered is 
  the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy with respect 
  to the record.  The trial judge might well find that there is a somewhat reduced 
  expectation of privacy in respect of  records relating to sessions where the 
  accused was present.  On the other hand, because the accused was present at 
  the session, he should be in a position to provide specific details of the information 
  sought.  Where, as in this case, the application for production is largely nothing 
  more than vague assertions, the court might be skeptical that the records contain 
  anything of value to the defence.  One explanation for the absence of detail 
  in this case is that the respondent did not want Dr. Hardin’s information about 
  what the complainant told him in the counselling sessions as much as Dr. Hardin’s 
  opinion about the family relationship.  The trial judge ruled against the respondent 
  on the admissibility of that evidence and the respondent did not pursue the 
  issue in this court.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at 391-92 and <i>R. v. Keegstra</i> (1995),

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This submission depends upon two parts of the 
  trial judge’s reasons. First, in reviewing the complainant’s evidence, the trial 
  judge said the following:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>What she does remember is that she said she heard someone tapping on the 
      window outside, that it was her mother, and that she said “He won’t let 
      me go,” and <u>that is consistent with what the mother had testified to 
      earlier</u>, where she indicated she had recalled hearing her daughter say 
      that she couldn’t get out.”  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is not an accurate reflection of the evidence.  The complainant’s 
  mother gave no evidence of having been at the window and hearing her daughter 
  say, “He won’t let me go.”  Indeed, she gave no evidence of having been at the 
  window at all.  She also gave no evidence in chief that the complainant at any 
  time said she could not get out.  In cross-examination, she did testify that 
  the complainant said that she could not get out, but she stated that the complainant 
  said this when the mother was inside the apartment, at the bedroom door.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the respondent relies upon the following 
  part of the reasons, which appears after the trial judge summarized the Crown 
  evidence:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>And before I move on to defence evidence I should indicate that having 
      carefully reviewed the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the 
      other witnesses, I found the evidence of the complainant to be very credible.  
      <u>I found the evidence of the other witnesses to be consistent with the 
      evidence of the complainant on all of the major particulars</u>, but there 
      were some minor discrepancies with regards to who was standing where, or 
      exactly who knocked on the door.  But with regards to any minor discrepancies 
      between the different witnesses, I did not feel that they were significant 
      in regards to this matter.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent submits that the evidence of the complainant was 
  not consistent with the evidence of the other Crown witnesses on all of the 
  major particulars.  He points out that none of the Crown witnesses supported 
  the complainant’s version of the conversation at the window.  This was a critical 
  issue for the respondent, since the theory of the defence was that the respondent 
  and the complainant were engaged in consensual conduct until the complainant’s 
  mother unexpectedly came to the window and interrupted them.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the other hand, the sister and mother do support the complainant 
  on some things.  They both testified that they heard crying in the apartment, 
  saw the half-naked respondent on top of the complainant and engaged in some 
  kind of tug of war at the door.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the summary conviction appeal court judge erred in 
  failing to give effect to this ground of appeal.  The incident at the window 
  was a critical feature of the case.  If the complainant did tell her mother 
  that the respondent would not let her go, this strongly supported her claim 
  that the sexual assault had commenced before the complainant’s relatives came 
  downstairs.  On the other hand, if the complainant did not say this to her mother, 
  then the mother’s evidence on this point was equally consistent with the respondent’s 
  testimony that the complainant only became angry after her mother appeared at 
  the window.  The trial judge appears to have thought that the mother’s evidence 
  supported the complainant’s evidence on this issue when it did not.  Further, 
  given the issues raised at trial, it cannot be said that the Crown witnesses 
  support the complainant’s evidence on all major particulars.  These are “errors 
  on findings central to the trial judge’s determination of guilt” and had a direct 
  bearing on the issue of reasonable doubt:  <i>R. v. G. (G.)</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 362 (Ont. C.A.) at 380-1.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

  granted the Crown an extension of time to appeal on September 12, 2000.   The 
  Crown filed the transcripts in October 2000.  The Crown only perfected the appeal 
  in September 2001.  When the appeal was originally set to be argued on November 
  20, 2001, it had to be adjourned because Crown counsel had only notified the 
  complainant of the date of the appeal the day before and she needed time to 
  consider whether to retain counsel to make submissions before this court.  The 
  court allowed the adjournment on terms that the Crown pay the respondent’s costs 
  of the day, which the court fixed at $1000.  </p>

  </span></span> Counsel who appeared before us, Ms. Bartlett-Hughes, had only 
  recently assumed carriage of the appeal and I do not attach any blame to her 
  for the delay.  She was candid in accepting that the delay in perfecting the 
  appeal was inexcusable.  This appeal raised an important point of law, and I 
  think it was necessary to hear the appeal on its merits.  I am also satisfied 
  that the respondent was not unfairly prejudiced by the delay.  He had served 
  the sentence (a four month conditional sentence) before the summary conviction 
  appeal was heard and so this is not a case where an accused is being returned 
  to jail after a lengthy delay.  The delay was not so excessive that the proceedings 
  amounted to an abuse of the court’s process.  That said, the Crown may wish 
  to consider whether it is now in the public interest and in the best interests 
  of the administration of justice to pursue the new trial in view of the Crown 
  delay and in view of the fact that the respondent has served the sentence originally 
  imposed.</p>
