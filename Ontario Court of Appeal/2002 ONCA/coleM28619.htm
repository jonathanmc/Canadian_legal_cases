<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This motion for directions by the respondents/defendants (the &quot;Moving 
  Parties&quot;) concerns the proper appeal route or routes to be followed in 
  connection with an appeal by the appellants/plaintiffs (the &quot;Responding 
  Parties&quot;) from the order of Justice N. Borkovich dated March 22, 2002 by 
  which summary judgment was granted in favour of the Moving Parties and the Responding 
  Parties' cross-motion for summary judgment on part of their claim and their 
  action in its entirety were dismissed.</p>
<p>
  I. THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The Moving Parties brought a summary judgment motion in the action. The 
  Responding Parties brought a cross-motion for summary judgment on part of their 
  claim. Both summary judgment motions were heard together by the motions judge 
  over nine full days, resulting in the motions judge's order dated March 22, 
  2002.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Responding Parties appeal to this court from that part of the motions 
  judge's order granting the Moving Parties' motion for summary judgment and dismissing 
  the action in its entirety. They have also moved before the Superior Court of 
  Justice for an order granting them leave to appeal to the Divisional Court from 
  that portion of the motions judge's order by which their cross-motion for partial 
  summary judgment was dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [4] On this motion for directions, the Moving Parties seek a determination that 
  this court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all matters which were before 
  the motions judge, including all matters at issue on the Responding Parties' 
  motion for summary judgment. If that determination is made, as urged by the 
  Moving Parties, the Responding Parties' motion in the Superior Court of Justice 
  for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court would be misconceived. Further, 
  as alternative relief on this motion, the Moving Parties seek an order directing 
  that the appeal pending before this court be expedited and that it be heard 
  and disposed of prior to the Responding Parties' motion for leave to appeal 
  to the Divisional Court.</p>
<p>
  [5] There is no dispute that it is in the interests of the parties, and judicial 
  economy, that the Responding Parties' appeal from the order of the motions judge, 
  in its entirety, be heard in one forum. The Responding Parties are content to 
  appeal the order of the motions judge, in its entirety, to this court. However, 
  they are concerned that leave to appeal may be required from a judge of the 
  Superior Court of Justice concerning that part of the motions judge's order 
  whereby their cross-motion for partial summary judgment was dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] The Moving Parties declined, as they are entitled to do, to consent to the 
  Responding Parties' motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court. If such 
  consent was forthcoming, and if leave to appeal be granted, the parties would 
  then be in a position to apply under s. 6(2) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C. 43 for an order that this court also hear and determine the Responding 
  Parties' appeal to the Divisional Court. That option is not available under 
  s. 6(2) absent the prior granting of leave to appeal to the Divisional Court.</p>
<p>
  [7] As an alternative procedural approach, the Moving Parties proposed that 
  the parties agree that the Responding Parties' motion for leave to appeal to 
  the Divisional Court be held in abeyance pending determination of their appeal 
  to this court. The reasoning behind that proposal was that if the appeal to 
  this court is dismissed, that outcome effectively would dispose of all matters 
  at issue between the parties subject only to the Responding Parties' right to 
  seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decision of this 
  court. Under that scenario, the Responding Parties' motion for leave to appeal 
  to the Divisional Court would be withdrawn or abandoned, as moot. The Responding 
  Parties, however, as is their right, did not agree to that proposal.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Moving Parties argue that this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine 
  all matters which were before the motions judge, including all matters at issue 
  on the Responding Parties' cross-motion for partial summary judgment, because 
  the order of the motions judge is final in the sense that it is dispositive 
  of all matters at issue in the action. The Moving Parties assert, therefore, 
  that the Responding Parties are improperly pursuing two separate appeal routes 
  by initiating an appeal before this court and by moving before the Superior 
  Court of Justice for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court.</p>
<p>
  II. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [9] It is well established that an order that finally determines the issues 
  in a proceeding is a final order, an appeal from which lies to this court under 
  s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act. In contrast, an interlocutory order 
  is one which does not determine the substantive rights of the parties but leaves 
  them to be resolved by subsequent adjudication. (See S. (R.) v. H. (R.) (2000), 
  52 O.R. (3d) 152 (C.A.)). However, the determination of whether an order is 
  final or interlocutory is sometimes made with great difficulty. Here, the motions 
  judge made one order, dealing with both summary judgment motions. That portion 
  of his order which concerns the Responding Parties' cross-motion for partial 
  summary judgment does not finally dispose of all of the Responding Parties' 
  claims in the action. In contrast, that portion of his order dealing with the 
  Moving Parties' motion for summary judgment concerns all of the issues in the 
  action. His further order that the Responding Parties' action be dismissed in 
  its entirety flowed from his conclusion that summary judgment should be granted 
  to the Moving Parties.</p>
<p>
  [10] In Albert v. Spiegel (1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 90 (Ont. C.A.), the plaintiff 
  moved before this court for leave to appeal from an order dismissing his motion 
  for summary judgment. A cross-motion by the defendant for summary judgment was 
  successful, and resulted in a judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action. The 
  plaintiff appealed from the latter judgment, as of right, to this court. At 
  issue was this court's jurisdiction to hear the proposed appeal from the order 
  dismissing the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, together with the plaintiff's 
  motion for leave to appeal. Morden A.C.J.O. stated (at p. 91): </p>
<p class="indent"> The order sought to be appealed is interlocutory and, by virtue 
  of s. 19(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, an appeal lies from it to the Divisional 
  Court with leave as provided in the rules of the court. Under r. 62.02(1) leave 
  to appeal this provision must be obtained from a judge of the General Division 
  other than the judge who made the interlocutory order.</p>
<p class="indent">In our view, it cannot be said that an appeal &quot;lies to 
  the Divisional Court&quot;, within the meaning of these words in s. 6(2) [of 
  the Courts of Justice Act] applied to the facts of this case, until leave has 
  been granted under s. 19(1)(b).</p>
<p>
  (See also, Merling v. Southam Inc. (2000), 42 C.P.C. (4th) 26 (Ont. C.A.); Nesbitt 
  Burns Inc. v. Canada Trustco Mortgage (2000), 131 O.A.C. 85 (C.A.); and V.K. 
  Mason Construction Ltd. v. Canadian General Insurance Group Ltd. (1998), 42 
  O.R. (3d) 618 (C.A.)).</p>
<p>
  [11] The facts in Albert v. Spiegel are clearly analogous to those in this case. 
  Based on Albert v. Spiegel, an order dismissing a motion for summary judgment 
  is an interlocutory order from which an appeal to the Divisional Court lies, 
  with leave.</p>
<p>
  [12] The Moving Parties rely on the subsequent decisions of this court in Whalen 
  v. Hillier (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 550 (C.A.) and Chippewas of Sarnia Band v. Canada 
  (Attorney General) (2000), 195 D.L.R. (4th) 135 (Ont. C.A.) in support of their 
  argument that where there are motions and cross-motions for summary judgment, 
  and one motion is granted with the result that the other motion is dismissed, 
  appeals on both motions properly lie to this court. In my view, for the reasons 
  that follow, neither of those cases displaces the rule established in Albert 
  v. Spiegel.</p>
<p>
  [13] First, Whalen v. Hillier did not involve a challenge of a decision not 
  to grant summary judgment. The issue in that case was whether a motions judge 
  had jurisdiction to grant summary judgment in favour of a party responding to 
  a motion for summary judgment brought by the party opposite. No doubt because 
  the issue in Whalen v. Hillier was different from the issue in Albert v. Spiegel, 
  no mention was made in Whalen v. Hillier of the decision in Albert v. Spiegel.</p>
<p>
  [14] Similarly, no mention was made of Albert v. Spiegel in Chippewas of Sarnia 
  Band v. Canada (Attorney General), which involved numerous appeals and cross-appeals, 
  including appeals from orders dismissing motions or cross-motions for summary 
  judgment. The action in the Chippewas case was complex and multi-faceted. The 
  appellate proceedings were the subject of extensive case management. The jurisdiction 
  of this court to hear all of the appeals together was not challenged. Indeed, 
  all parties agreed, given the nature of the judgment under appeal, that none 
  of the appeals and cross-appeals related to interlocutory orders. Given those 
  facts, the decision in the Chippewas case does not assist the Moving Parties.</p>
<p>
  III. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [15] I conclude, therefore, that the decisions in Whalen v. Hillier and in the 
  Chippewas case cannot be regarded as having overruled the decision in Albert 
  v. Spiegel. Until a motion under s. 6(2) of the Courts of Justice Act may properly 
  be brought, this court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Responding 
  Parties' appeal from the order of the motions judge dismissing their cross-motion 
  for partial summary judgment. A motion under s. 6(2) may only be brought after 
  leave to appeal to the Divisional Court has been granted, if leave be granted. 
  The Responding Parties have indicated that if they are successful in obtaining 
  leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, they intend to bring a motion under 
  s. 6(2) for an order directing that both appeals be heard together by this court.</p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, the directions sought by the Moving Parties are denied. I 
  direct that the Responding Parties' appeal to this court from the decision of 
  the motions judge granting summary judgment to the Moving Parties and dismissing 
  the action in its entirety not be heard until final disposition of the Responding 
  Parties' motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, or further order 
  of this court. By order dated June 13, 2002, I directed that the time for perfection 
  of the Responding Parties' pending appeal to this court be extended, on consent, 
  to the date which is four months after the date of release of this decision. 
  Should variation of that four month period be required to ensure that the Responding 
  Parties' motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court is determined prior 
  to argument of the appeal pending before this court, either party may seek such 
  variation by further motion to this court. This is not a proper case for an 
  award of costs and I decline to order same.</p>
