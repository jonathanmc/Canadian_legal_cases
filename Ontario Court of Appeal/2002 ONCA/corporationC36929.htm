style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When
    a civilian makes a complaint of misconduct or unsatisfactory work performance
    by a police officer, the officers Chief must investigate the complaint and
    make a decision as to whether or not to order a hearing into the complaint.  If
    the Chief of the police force in respect to which a complaint has been made
    (the Chief) decides not to hold a hearing, the complainant has a right
    of appeal to the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services (the Commission).  In
    exercising the powers conferred upon it, the Commission is required to interpret
    ss. 64(6) and (7) of the <i>Police Services Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.15 (the Act) to determine how these provisions apply to the facts
    of the case before it.  Section 64(6) provides that if the Chief is of the
    opinion that the complaint is unsubstantiated no action shall be taken.  Section
    64(7) provides that if the Chief is of the opinion that the police officers
    conduct may constitute misconduct or unsatisfactory work performance of
    a serious nature a hearing shall be held.  In the case before us, the Commission
    upheld a decision of the Chief not to order a hearing into a complaint.  The
    Divisional Court reviewed that decision and quashed it.  This is an appeal
    from that decision.</p>

  <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>(1)   The standard of review to be applied

  <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>(2)   In reviewing a decision of the Chief
      and interpreting ss. 64(6) and (7), the Commission must determine whether
      there is a reasonable basis in the alleged facts on which the complaint
      is based for proceeding to a hearing.  In deciding this question, the Commission,
      like the Chief, does not engage in weighing the evidence or assessing its
      truthfulness, except to the limited extent of determining whether the complaint
      is frivolous and vexatious.  </span></div>
  <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>(3)    In this case, the Commission, like
      the Chief, applied the wrong evidentiary standard in determining whether
      a hearing should be held.</span></div>

    the night of November 18, 1997, a fundraising dinner was held in a Guelph
    hotel which the Ontario Minister of Education attended.  A number of people
    gathered outside the Holiday Inn to demonstrate in protest against the proposed
    amendments to Bill 160 of the <i>Education Act</i>.  The Guelph police arrested
    nine women, including the complainants, on the basis that they had breached
    the peace by repeatedly trying to prevent  access to the hotel by persons
    attending the dinner.  The breach of the peace provision contained in s.
    31 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, Chap. C-46 grants only a power
    of arrest and detention.  It does not create an offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Upon
    their arrest, they were brought to the Guelph police station, which has 16
    holding cells.  Prior to the demonstration, the Guelph Police designated
    10 of these cells for adult males, 3 for adult females and 3 for youth offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> During
    the demonstration, the Guelph Police arrested 9 women, 5 men, and 1&nbsp;youth
    and brought them to the station.  The single youth taken into custody was
    never placed in a holding cell but was detained in an interview room until
    he was released into the custody of his mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Guelph Police held the first 6 women brought to the station in the cells
    designated for adult females and youths.  As large numbers of protesters
    were expected, the Guelph police had formulated an operational plan to send
    any overflow of prisoners to the Wellington Detention Centre (WDC), a maximum-security
    provincial detention facility designated as a police lock-up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    women in the cells were chanting and singing.  The cells were located close
    to the communication centre in the police station.  A police officer asked
    the individual complainants to be quiet.  One of the complainants, Alison
    Gorbould, alleges that a police officer warned her to keep her friends quiet
    or they would be sent to the WDC where they play hardball.  Another individual
    respondent confirms that Gorbould told her that an officer had made this
    statement. When the seventh woman arrived at the station, the Guelph Police
    decided to transfer all of the women to the detention centre.  The complainants
    allege that the decision to transfer them was made in bad faith and not in
    accordance with the policy the police had themselves devised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    complainants were transported by the Guelph Police to the detention centre
    where they were automatically strip searched by Ministry of Correctional
    Services (Ministry) staff in accordance with standard Ministry policy before
    being admitted to the female living units.  The appellants concede that the
    police had no power to strip search the women at the Guelph police station.  The

    of the women arrested complained to Chief Bradburn, the Chief of the Guelph
    Police Force, that in transferring them to the detention centre, the police
    knew or ought to have known that they would be subjected to a loss of dignity
    by being strip searched. They submitted that the decision to transfer them
    was police misconduct and violated their right to be free from unreasonable
    search and seizure.  They requested a hearing into their complaint. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    complainants further complained about their treatment and the conduct of
    the officers to the Guelph Police Services Board (Board).  On February
    12, 1998, the Board adopted a resolution requesting a report on the event
    in question from Chief Bradburn.  In her April 1998 report to the Board,
    Chief Bradburn concluded that the Guelph Police had acted in accordance with
    police policy.</p>

    complainants then filed formal complaints under the <i>Police Services Act</i>.
    Each complainant claimed that there was no legitimate basis for her arrest,
    some of them claimed that excessive force was used in apprehending them,
    some claimed undue delay before the police advised them of their rights,
    and some of them claimed they were detained in custody for an excessive period
    of time.  There were also complaints about hardships endured in custody,
    such as being forced to walk through snow and slush without their shoes.  The
    major nature of the complaints was that the women were needlessly transferred
    to the Wellington Detention Centre where each of them was subjected to a
    humiliating strip search.</p>

    a request for review of a decision of a police chief is received, the Commission
    has three options.  Pursuant to s. 72(8) of the Act, the Commission may confirm
    the decision, may direct the Chief to process the complaint as it specifies,
    or may assign the complaint to a police force other than the one in respect
    of which the complaint is made, and order that force to review or investigate
    the complaint, or to conduct a hearing of the complaint. </p>

    July 21, 1998, the Commission directed that the complaints be remitted to
    the Waterloo Regional Police Service (Waterloo Police) for investigation.  This
    was the first review of the complaints by the Commission under s. 72(8).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Waterloo Police categorized the nature of the complaints as complaints against
    the conduct of a police officer.  The complainants disagreed with this categorization
    and asked the Commission to review this decision, requesting that the complaints
    be characterized as involving matters of police policy.  The Commission confirmed
    the decision of the Waterloo Police.  This was the second review of the complaints
    by the Commission under s.&nbsp;72(8).</p>

    June, 1999, the Waterloo Police had completed their investigation and delivered
    a final report to Chief Bradburn of the Guelph Police Service for her consideration
    and decision pursuant to s.&nbsp;64(1) of the Act.  At this stage, the Canadian
    Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) intervened on behalf of the complainants
    and requested that the Commission ensure that the Guelph Police not reacquire
    jurisdiction over the complaints.  The Commission advised the CCLA that a
    decision by Chief Bradburn was both appropriate and in accordance with the
    legislative scheme.</p>

    Police and concluded that most of the complaints, including those relating
    to the decision to transfer the complainants to the WDC and their subsequent
    strip searches, were unsubstantiated.  In reaching its conclusion, the
    Professional Standards Committee relied on the findings of the Waterloo Polices
    investigation.  The findings and recommendations were reviewed and approved
    by Chief Bradburn, whose decision was communicated to the individual complainants

      review of the Commissions decision to order a hearing into allegations
      of police misconduct, with reference to the four factors for deciding the
      standard of review of a tribunal set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada
      in <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>,
      [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 at paras. 29-38.  They are: 1)&nbsp;the existence of
      a privative clause; 2)&nbsp;the expertise of the tribunal; 3)&nbsp;the
      purpose of the Act and its provisions; and 4) the nature of the problem.  She
      concluded that [t]he combination of the purpose of the Act [to increase
      confidence in the provision of police services including the processing
      of public complaints], the privative clause, and the designated and specialized
      expertise of the Commission call for patent unreasonableness as the guiding
      standard of review.  The standard of patent unreasonableness means that
      the Commissions decision whether or not to order a hearing can be set
      aside only if it was made arbitrarily or in bad faith, cannot be supported
      on the evidence, or if the Commission failed to consider appropriate factors: <i>Suresh
      v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) </i>(2002), 208 D.L.R.

    Police Association (Interveners) acknowledge that patent unreasonableness
    is the appropriate standard of review. The respondents submit that a constitutional
    issue of law relating to the lawfulness of the search is raised and that
    the Commission has no particular expertise in resolving constitutional issues.  The
    respondents submit that the standard of review is one of correctness.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This
    case is not about the constitutionality of the search that was conducted
    at the Wellington Detention Centre.  Indeed, that search was conducted pursuant
    to the statutory requirement regarding admission to a correctional facility
    under the <i>Ministry of Correctional Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.22.  That
    legislation is not the subject of a constitutional challenge here.  Nor is
    the conduct of the correctional officers who conducted the searches subject
    to review under the <i>Police Services Act</i>. This is not to say that the
    Commission could ignore the complainants constitutional right to be free
    from an unreasonable search as a factor in reviewing the decision of the
    Chief not to order a hearing into the complainants complaint. The failure
    to consider an appropriate factor is a consideration in the determination
    of whether the refusal to order a hearing is patently unreasonable.</p>

    summarize, the standard of review that applies to a decision of the Commission
    confirming the decision of the Chief not to hold a hearing into alleged misconduct
    is patent unreasonableness.  In making a determination as to whether the
    Commissions decision is patently unreasonable, a reviewing court will have
    regard to the factors the Commission ought to have considered.  One of those
    factors is whether the actions of the police in transferring the complainants
    to the WDC were consistent with s. 8 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights

    indicated in <i>Browne</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>the object of the Act is
    to increase confidence in the provision of police services, including the
    processing of complaints.  The intention of the Legislature in introducing
    the review mechanism in 1997 was to create a check or balance, to ensure
    that key decisions that are made by the chief can be reviewed by a provincial
    body and determined whether they should stand or be changed:  Ontario, Legislative

    legislative scheme of the Act contributes to the interpretation and understanding
    of ss. 64(6) and (7) and I will briefly review it.  The<i> Police Services
    Act</i> governs complaints about the services provided by a police force
    or a police officer.  A member of the public who is directly affected by
    the policy, service or conduct of a police force or one of its officers may
    make a complaint in writing:  s. 56(1) and ss.&nbsp;57(1) and (2).  The Chief
    determines whether a complaint is about policy, service or conduct. If the
    Chief considers the complaint to be frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith,
    or if the complaint is made more than six months after the facts on which
    it is based have occurred, he or she may decide not to deal with the complaint:
    ss. 59(3) and (4).  If these sections do not apply, the chief shall cause
    every complaint about an officers conduct to be investigated and reported
    in writing: s. 64(11).  This investigation and report may be done by a different
    police force: s. 64(2).  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span

    this situation, the Chief notifies the complainant of this decision and provides
    him or her with a copy of the report.  Similarly, s. 59(3) provides that
    if the Chief is of the opinion that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or made
    in bad faith, the Chief does not have to deal with the complaint.</p>

    conduct may constitute misconduct as defined in section 74, or unsatisfactory
    work performance, he or she shall hold a hearing into the matter:  s.&nbsp;64(7).  Misconduct
    in s. 74 includes breaching the prescribed code of conduct for a police officer.  Pursuant
    to s. 64(10), if a hearing is held and if misconduct is proved on clear
    and convincing evidence, the Chief must act in accordance with a range of
    disciplinary options set forth in s.&nbsp;68.  These range from dismissal

    64(11)-(15) give the Chief the power to characterize the seriousness of the
    conduct.  The Chief is required to give notice to the complainant of her
    opinion that the misconduct is not of a serious nature.  This gives the complainant
    an opportunity to have the decision reviewed by the Commission.  If the complainant
    agrees that the matter should be resolved informally or does not ask for
    a review of the decision categorizing the misconduct as not of a serious
    nature or, if there is a review and the Commission upholds the chiefs opinion,
    action is taken to resolve the matter informally.  One of the informal resolutions
    possible is an apology.  If negotiations to resolve the matter informally
    break down, the Chief may, nevertheless, proceed to impose a penalty on the
    police officer.  The penalty may be a forfeiture of not more than three days pay
    pursuant to s. 68(1)(e), a reprimand, or a direction that the officer take
    counselling or participate in a specified activity pursuant to s. 68(5).  If
    the officer does not accept the penalty imposed, the Chief shall not impose
    a penalty or take any other action  but shall hold a hearing under subsection
    7.: s. 64(15)(3).</p>

    as a complaint respecting policy, services or the conduct of a police officer;
    (2) the determination that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or made
    in bad faith; (3) the dismissal of the complaint for having been made more
    than six months after the facts on which the complaint is based; (4) a determination
    that the complainant is not directly affected by the policy, service or conduct

    Commission has the power to confirm or overturn the Chiefs decision, specify

    police force: s.&nbsp;72(8).  There is no appeal from the Commissions decision:

    the legislation sets out a detailed framework for the efficient and fair

    2002-2003 ed. (B.C.: Earlscourt, 2002) the authors discuss the standard clear
    and convincing evidence as follows: Clear and convincing evidence was defined
    in <i> Allan v. Munro</i>,<i> </i>Ont. Bd. Inq., 27 July, 1994 to mean weighty,
    cogent and reliable evidence upon which a trier of fact, acting with care

    agree that using reasonable and probable grounds as the standard for ordering
    a hearing would render the two-stage process virtually meaningless because
    it is too close to the clear and convincing evidence standard at a hearing.  The
    terminology in ss.&nbsp;64(6) and (7) as compared with s. 64(10) indicates
    that the Legislature intended a clear distinction between the two processes.
    The Chief is not required to hold a hearing only when a complaint has been
    proven on a balance of probabilities, or the slightly higher standard of
    clear and convincing evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    standard reasonable and probable cause is derived from the criminal law.  The Report
    and Recommendations on Amendments to the <i>Police Services Act </i>respecting
    Civilian Oversight of Police, dated November 21, 1996 by Roderick McLeod
    and prepared for the then Attorney General, Charles Harnick, formed the basis
    for the amendments to the Act that created the Commission.  The report recommends
    at 8.5.2 that, the current trappings of the criminal law be removed from
    the complaints/discipline process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    would reject the submission that reasonable and probable grounds 
    or clear and convincing evidence is the standard to be applied in ss. 64(6)
    and (7).  This standard does not accord with the wording of ss. 64(6) and

    (7).  In <i>Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission)</i> (1996), 140 D.L.R.
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 193 (S.C.C.) the court was concerned with somewhat similar
    wording. The Canadian Human Rights Commission was required, pursuant to the <i>Canadian
    Human Rights Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, s. 44(3), to consider the report
    of the investigator who had investigated a complaint and to take one of two
    courses of action.  The Commission could request an inquiry if it was satisfied that
    it was warranted or it could dismiss the complaint if it was satisfied that
    an inquiry was not warranted.  The Supreme Court held at para. 53 that
    the words indicated that the Commission was performing a statutory screening
    function. Similarly, in ss. 64(6) and (7), the words [if] the Chief is of
    the opinion 
    are indicative that the Chief performs a statutory screening function in
    deciding whether or not to hold a hearing.</p>

    discussing the decision in <i>Cooper</i> further it is appropriate to consider
    the decision in <i>MacBain v. Canadian Human Rights Commission</i>, [1984]
    1 F.C. 696 (F.C.T.D.); varied [1985] 1 F.C. 856 (F.C.A.).  This is a decision
    relied on by the appellants as to the meaning of the word substantiate.  Pursuant
    to the <i>Canadian Human Rights Act</i>, 1977, S.C. 1976-77, c. 33 (since
    amended), the Commission may adopt an investigative report if it is satisfied
    that the complaint to which the report relates has been substantiated: s.
    36(3)(a).    The Commission can appoint a tribunal to inquire into the complaint
    at any time after the filing of the complaint.  If, at the conclusion of
    the inquiry, a tribunal finds that the complaint 
     is substantiated it may make an order against the offending party: s.
    41(2).  After setting out the dictionary definition of the word substantiate 
    from the <i>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i> and the <i>Living Webster Encyclopedic
    Dictionary</i>, Collier J. held that the phrase substantiate as used in
    both sections simply meant proved.  On appeal, Heald&nbsp;J., on behalf
    of the court, held at p. 131 that Collier J. was correct in this interpretation,
    based on the presumption that the same words used in the same statute should
    have the same meaning and, conversely, that different words have different
    meanings.  He refused to interpret the word substantiated, as used in s.
    36(3), as meaning that an inquiry into the complaint is warranted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    interpretation given to the word substantiate in <i>McBain</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>should
    not be imported into the <i>Police Services Act </i>for several reasons.  The
    first is the substantial difference in the statutory framework.  Unlike the <i>Canadian
    Human Rights Act </i>that governed the case in <i>McBain</i>, whereby substantiate was
    used twice in the Act to refer to two distinct phases in the complaints process,
    in interpreting this term in the <i>Police Services Act </i>we are not hindered
    by this anomaly.  Rather, the terms should be interpreted in their entire
    context, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act, and the intention
    of the Legislature.  This was not the approach taken in <i>McBain</i>.  The
    Federal Court of Appeal in that case relied on an English decision, <i>Crawford
    v. Spooner</i> (1846), 18 E.R. 667 (P.C.), to the effect that the construction
    of an Act must be taken from its bare words:  We cannot fish out what possibly
    may have been the intention of the Legislature.  This approach is contrary
    to the Canadian contextual approach to statutory interpretation which includes
    consideration of the intention of the Legislature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    word substantiate according to <i>Websters Encyclopaedic Unabridged Dictionary </i>(1989),
    means to establish by proof or competent evidence.  The <i>Shorter Oxford
    Dictionary </i>(1987) also contains a definition of substantiate as to
    demonstrate or verify by proof or evidence to make good.  Unsubstantiated 
    is the antonym. The use of the words if  the Chief is of the opinion the
    evidence is unsubstantiated suggests that there is an evidentiary burden
    on the complainant that must be met and that if it is not the Chief shall
    take no action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    is important to remember that the Chief is to investigate, not adjudicate.  That
    is why the Chief does not hold a hearing.  In administrative law contexts
    concerning regulated professions, findings of fact are to be determined at
    the hearing stage and not at the preliminary stage of resolving whether to
    hold a hearing into professional misconduct.  In <i>Pierce v. Law Society
    of British Columbia </i>(1993), 103 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 233 (B.C.S.C.),
    for example, the court held that findings of fact are a matter for consideration
    by the benchers and not the Discipline Committee whose task it is to recommend
    whether or not to issue a citation to counsel.  (See also <i>Yuz v. Laski </i>(1984),
    48 O.R. (2d) 161 (H.C.J.), affirmed 57 O.R. (2d) 106 (C.A.), leave to appeal
    to the S.C.C. refused 42 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) viii, and Richard Steinecke, <i>A
    Complete Guide to the Regulated Health Professions Act</i>, looseleaf (Aurora:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    addition to the administrative law context, there is a common theme in criminal
    and civil law that the gatekeeper ought not to assess credibility, weigh
    the evidence or find the facts. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference> [1] </span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Divisional Court was correct in holding that the role of the Chief is not
    to make findings of fact.   That question is reserved for the trier of fact
    at a hearing.  The role of the Chief is to decide whether a hearing should
    be held and not what the result of a hearing should be. Given that findings
    of fact are based on an assessment of ultimate credibility, the Chief also
    does not assess the ultimate credibility of the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    use of the words if  the complaint is unsubstantiated the Chief shall take
    no action in s. 64(6) are, however, indicative that more than a bare assertion
    by the complainant is required. In this respect I do not agree with the Divisional
    Court that the evidentiary burden to be discharged is akin to that at a preliminary
    inquiry. I say this for several reasons. Firstly, as noted earlier, disciplinary
    proceedings are administrative and civil, not criminal in nature, and it
    would be inappropriate to apply a criminal approach to them. The 1996 <i>Report,
    supra</i>, and subsequent amendments to the <i>Police Services Act </i>reinforce
    this observation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Secondly,
    the Chief possesses a discretion that the judge conducting a preliminary
    inquiry does not have. If the Chief is of the opinion that the complaint
    is frivolous or vexatious or made in bad faith, s. 59(3) provides that a
    hearing need not be held. Section 135(1)(23.1) of the Act permits the Lieutenant
    Governor in Council to make regulations defining frivolous and vexatious and made
    in bad faith.  Although no regulations have been made in Ontario to date,
    these terms are addressed in the British Columbia Office of the Police Complaint
    Commissioners Practice Directive.  It states that a complaint is frivolous
    when, on its face, it is devoid of substance and/or without an air of reality.
    See the annotation in the <i>Ontario Police Services Act</i>, <i>Fully Annotated,
    supra</i> at p. 120. An indication that s. 64(6) encompasses s. 59(3) is
    found in the <i>Report</i>, <i>supra</i>, which<i> </i>recommended that both
    sections were not needed and that s.&nbsp;59(3) be repealed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    addition, even when the evidence indicates that there was police misconduct
    or unsatisfactory work performance, the Chief possesses the discretion under
    s. 64(11) to categorize the conduct as not of a serious nature and to resolve
    the matter informally without holding a hearing. While this discretion is
    subject to review, it is, nevertheless, an important power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Thirdly,
    in deciding whether or not to categorize the conduct in question as not being
    of a serious nature, the Chief may engage in considerations that have no
    role to play in a preliminary inquiry.  For example, the Chief may wish to
    consider such matters as whether the conduct is isolated or part of a pattern,
    and whether the type of conduct is a problem for which an example ought to
    be made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Fourthly,
    unlike the judge at a preliminary inquiry, the Chief is engaged in a balancing
    exercise. On the one hand, the expectation of the public is that those they
    have entrusted to serve and protect them do so in a manner that is worthy
    of this trust, confidence and respect.  On the other hand, the Chief must
    take into consideration that the police must often act in highly stressful,
    emotionally charged situations and must make decisions quickly that, while
    perfectly legitimate, may be offensive to those affected by them. The Chief
    will obviously be cognizant of the stress and stigma for a police officer
    if a hearing is held into his or her conduct  as opposed to informal resolution.  The
    Chief must treat both complainants and police officers in the fairest possible
    manner.  Section 64 provides legislative guidance in the performance of this
    balancing function by giving the Chief three options in dealing with a complaint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Sections
    64(6) and (7) must be read together.  Under s. 64(6), the facts alleged by
    the complainant must be more than a self-serving bald allegation.  The provisions
    of the Act respecting frivolous or vexatious complaints reinforce the conclusion
    that there must be a reasonable basis or an air of reality to the evidence
    before proceeding to the next stage.  Otherwise, the complaint is unsubstantiated.  If
    the Chief is not of the opinion that the complaint is unsubstantiated, then,
    under s. 64(7), the use of the words may constitute police misconduct or
    unsatisfactory work performance mean that if one of the permissible inferences
    to be drawn from all of the circumstances surrounding the complaint is that
    misconduct has occurred, then the statutory requirement has been met.  Subject
    to informal resolution under s. 64(11), the duty to act is clear:  a hearing
    must be held.</p>

    this case that evidence consists of the direct evidence of Alison Gorbould.  That

    decision to transfer the complainants that ignored or neglected their right
    to be free from unreasonable search and seizure could bring discredit upon
    the reputation of the police force and is thus evidence that misconduct 
    may have occurred.  At a minimum, such conduct could constitute unsatisfactory
    work performance.  The comments made imply, however, that the police were
    merely acting in accordance with the policy that had been established.  Thus,
    although the <i>policy</i> may have been inappropriate, the individual police
    officer did not engage in misconduct because he was merely complying with
    the policy.  In this regard, I note that the policy provided that the overflow
    population was to be transferred once the cells were full.  Even accepting
    that the designated cells for women were full, the policy did not require
    that <i>all </i>of the women be transferred to the Detention Centre.  It
    was only those arrested after the cells were full that were to be transferred.  There
    is, in addition, a question whether given the number of vacant cells designated
    for men that evening, there was some obligation to reassign occupancy of
    all cells in a way that avoided any arrested person, male or female, from
    being sent to a facility that performed strip searches.  There is, therefore,
    some circumstantial evidence that supports the allegation of the individual
    complainants that the transfer was done in bad faith. </p>

    to show that deficiency in the reasons caused prejudice to the exercise of
    the right of appeal. This functional approach is reflected in the administrative
    context in the Supreme Courts comments in <i>Baker, supra </i>that a statutory
    bodys duty to give a rationale for its reasons, which is based on a duty
    of fairness, is flexible and variable, and is defined by the context of the

    report was in turn confirmed by the Commission.  Both reports functioned
    as the reasons before the Commission.  By confirming the decision of the
    Chief, the Commission, in essence, adopted her report.  The cross-examination
    of Margo Boyd amplified the decision letter of April 13, 2000.  In reviewing
    the Commissions decision, the Divisional Court was, in the end, able to
    perform its task based on the material before it.  As a result, no reasons

lang=EN-US> The traditional formulation of the test for committal at a preliminary
      inquiry is whether there is any evidence upon which a properly instructed
      jury, acting reasonably, could find guilt: <i>United States of America
      v. Shepherd</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at p.1080.  Where there is direct
      evidence on all the elements of an offence, the case must proceed to trial.  However,
      where there is circumstantial evidence, the judge must engage in a limited
      weighing of the whole of the evidence, including any exculpatory evidence
      put forward by the defence, to determine whether, if the Crowns case is
      believed, it would be reasonable for a properly instructed jury to infer
      guilt.  The task of limited weighing involves consideration of the permissible
      inferences that may be drawn from the evidence.  It never requires consideration
      of the inherent reliability of the evidence itself:  <i>R. v. Arcuri</i>,
      [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828 at paras. 29-31. The requirement of an evidentiary
      foundation before a hearing is held is not unique to the preliminary inquiry.
      For example, before a defence raised by an accused can be put to a jury,
      the trial judge decides whether there is an evidentiary foundation for
      it.  This is referred to as the air of reality test.  The principles
      governing the air of reality test were recently discussed in<i> R. v.
      Cinous </i>(2002), 210 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 64 (S.C.C.)<i>. </i> McLachlin
      C.J.C. and Bastarache J., for the majority, stated at para. 51: </span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div id=ftn1><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;
'>The basic requirement of an evidential foundation for defences gives rise to
      two well-established principles.  First, a trial judge must put to the
      jury all defences that arise on the facts.  Second, a trial judge has
      a positive duty to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div id=ftn1>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>In determining whether a defence
      meets the evidentiary burden of having an air of reality, corroboration
      is not required but there must be more than a bare assertion of the defence:  <i>R.
      v. Park</i>,<i> </i>[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836. At a later point in their reasons,
      McLachlin C.J.C. and Bastarache J. reject the argument that the air of
      reality test after <i>Pappajohn v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1980] 2 S.C.R.
      120 required an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence and that
      this requirement imposes a more onerous burden than the traditional some
      evidence requirement.  McLachlin C.J.C. and Bastarache J. conclude that
      the evidence required to satisfy the evidential threshold is, some evidence
      on the basis of which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could
      acquit.  In applying this test, the trial judge assumes that the evidence
      relied upon by the accused is true.  Whether there is an evidentiary foundation
      for a defence is determined by looking at the whole of the evidence, including
      the factual circumstances of the case, and not just the evidence of the
      accused.  At para. 54, they observe:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div id=ftn1><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;
'>The trial judge does not make determinations about the credibility of witnesses,
      weigh the evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual
      inferences.  Nor is the air of reality test intended to assess whether
      the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed
      at the end of the day. The question for the trial judge is whether the
      evidence discloses a real issue to be decided by the jury, and not how
      the jury should ultimately decide the issue.<i>  </i>[Citations omitted].</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div id=ftn1>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>If, however, the jury acting reasonably
      would be incapable of acquitting, the evidentiary threshold has not been
      satisfied. The minority opinion, authored by Arbour J., emphatically agreed
      with the majority, at para. 163, that no attempt at weighing the evidence
      should be made and she certainly would not have disagreed with the balance
      of the comments made by McLachlin C.J.C. and Bastarache J. in para. 54
      cited above.  Arbour J. was concerned, however, that the term some evidence would
      result in the trial judge transgressing on the function of the jury.  She
      therefore proposed that a no evidence 
    test rather than a sufficient evidence test should be applied in determining
    whether a proffered defence has an air of reality. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>In the non-criminal context, a preliminary
      determination is made by a judge as to whether there is a genuine issue
      for trial when a party brings a motion for summary judgment seeking to
      have a claim dismissed or seeking judgment on the claim: see <i>Rules of
      Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 20.  In <i>Aguonie v. Galion
      Solid Waste Material Inc.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), and <i>Dawson
      v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc. </i>(1998), 164 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
      257 (Ont. C.A.), the court held that on such a motion the judge ought never
      to assess credibility, weigh the evidence, or find the facts, all of which
      are functions reserved to the trier of fact.  However, an issue of fact
      must relate to a material fact, otherwise it cannot raise a genuine issue
      for trial.  Merely raising an issue of credibility is not sufficient; the
      issue of credibility must be material and genuine.  Likewise, in <i>Guarantee
      Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.</i>,<i> </i>[1999] 3 S.C.R.
      423, the Supreme Court held that a party opposing summary judgment must
      show a real chance of success.  A self-serving affidavit does not create
      a triable issue in the absence of detailed facts and supporting evidence.</span></p>
