  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Crown appeals from the conditional sentence 
  imposed by the Honourable Justice Donnelly on the respondent Thomas Cromien 
  following his plea of guilty to indecent assault contrary to s. 156 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code.</i></span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Overview of the facts</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thomas Cromien was a Roman Catholic priest in a small parish 
  in Woodstock, Ontario.  Michael Keller was a 13-year-old altar boy with a difficult 
  home life.  Over the course of some three years the respondent gradually enticed 
  him into increasingly invasive sexual acts including touching, masturbation, 
  attempted anal penetration, oral sex, and simulated intercourse.  He took photographs 
  of some of this.  He showed Keller child pornography.  He encouraged him to 
  drink alcohol.  These acts took place in the church house, in local motels, 
  at a scout camp and on a ship where Keller was taking a sea cadet course.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sometime in 1978, when Michael Keller was 16, his mother found 
  a pornographic letter written by Keller to the respondent.  The respondent’s 
  father took the letter to another priest, and then went to see that priest’s 
  supervisor in Toronto.  The respondent was a member of the Holy Ghost Fathers 
  (also called the Spiritans) at the time.  Father Doyle, the supervisor of the 
  Spiritans, told Keller’s father to confront the respondent, suggesting that 
  maybe the allegations were untrue.  Keller’s father wrote to the respondent 
  asking him to stop his “relationship” with his son and leave Oxford County.  
  The respondent wrote back apologizing and saying that he would respect the request.  
  When his father told him what he had done, Keller was relieved that it was over.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Oxford County police investigated the offence in 1983.  No 
  charges were laid and the investigation ended.  In 1999 the police again investigated 
  and the respondent was arrested.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent left the priesthood several years after Keller’s 
  father first discovered what was going on and confronted him.  The respondent 
  went on with his life after leaving the priesthood.  He married, had a child, 
  and lived a quiet life in Toronto until he was finally charged with this offence 
  in 1999.  In June 2001 after a preliminary inquiry the respondent pled guilty 
  to one count of indecent assault.  The trial judge found that the precise time 
  frame and number of sexual assaults were unknown, but it was clear that there 
  were many incidents over an extended period.  On September 14, 2001 the respondent 
  received a conditional sentence of two years less a day, requiring him to stay 
  home except for medical appointments, attending church, shopping, and reporting 
  requirements of his parole officer.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is the position of the Crown on this appeal that the sentence 
  imposed on Thomas Cromien was manifestly unfit.  The nature of this offence 
  and the particular circumstances of this offender made a conditional sentence, 
  to be served at home under conditions essentially no different to those of his 
  daily routine, entirely incapable of meeting the operable sentencing principles 
  in this case.  The reasons for sentence, while admittedly thorough, are animated 
  by a flawed approach to the question of the respondent’s remorse and to the 
  ramifications of the historical nature of this offence.  While the reasons for 
  sentence address the relevant sentencing principles and demonstrate a cognisance 
  of the demands imposed on sentencing judges, the appellant nevertheless submits 
  that the manner in which those principles and obligations were applied caused 
  the trial judge to impose an unfit sentence in the particular circumstances 
  of this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The approach to the task of sentencing taken by the trial judge 
  involved a disproportionate assessment of the conduct of the respondent as it 
  related to the question of remorse, and a fundamental failure to address how 
  a community based sentence could achieve the objectives demanded by the principles 
  of sentencing at work in this case.  We have frequently stated that a conditional 
  sentence should rarely be imposed in cases involving sexual touching of children 
  by adults, particularly where the sexual violation is of a vulnerable victim 
  by a person in a position of trust.  See <i>R. v. Bedard</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 216 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Gianfelice</i> (1992), 52 O.A.C. 243 (C.A.); 
  and <i>R. v. Roy</i> (1999), 127 O.A.C. 270 (C.A.).  I will quote from the judgement 
  of Moldaver J.A. in <i>Bedard</i> because it is very similar on its facts to 
  the case in appeal.  He said at p. 222:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Although the trial judge referred to the appropriate sentencing objectives 
      and principles, the sentence imposed fails to reflect the seriousness of 
      the offenses and it is manifestly inadequate.  In the circumstances of this 
      case, a conditional sentence, even one of eighteen months on the terms imposed 
      by the trial judge, could not meet the objectives of general deterrence 
      and denunciation.</p>
    <p>The crimes committed by the respondent were extremely serious.  As indicated, 
      over the course of ten years, he sexually assaulted thirteen female patients 
      and in doing so, he [a licensed chiropractor] repeatedly broke the sacred 
      bond that forms the essence of a doctor/patient relationship.  By any measure, 
      this was a gross breach of trust and, as is all too often the case, it has 
      resulted in tragic consequences for the victims.  In many respects, the 
      respondent is responsible for undermining, if not destroying the physical, 
      emotional and psychological well-being of thirteen patients who placed their 
      faith and trust in him, only to have it shattered.  He is also responsible 
      for causing several of the complainants to lose faith generally in male 
      health care professionals.</p>
    <p>In my view, criminal conduct of this nature calls for severe punishment.  
      Normally, it would attract a penitentiary sentence.  In this case however, 
      because of the plea negotiations, Crown counsel at trial requested a sentence 
      of only twelve months imprisonment.  Giving full effect to the mitigating 
      factors, the sentence requested by Crown counsel was, in my view, an extremely 
      lenient one.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Circumstances that involve multiple sexual acts over an extended 
  period of time and escalating in intrusiveness generally warrant a severe sentence.  
  The extenuating circumstances or factors in this case were not such that they 
  warranted the imposition of a conditional sentence.  It was the sentencing judge’s 
  overemphasis on some of those factors that led him to impose this sentence. 
  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>[The] reasonable, informed public would expect fair treatment 
      for an offender who immediately acknowledged responsibility but who, incidental 
      to long term delay in the criminal process, has endured an equivalency to 
      punishment that otherwise would not have been imposed.</span></p>
    <p>Fundamental fairness in the final balancing of accounts requires that Mr. 
      Cromien receive some measure of credit for his twenty-five years of “quiet 
      desperation”.  This credit is much as he might have received for “time served” 
      under s.&nbsp;719(3) which provides an invariably exercised discretion, 
      as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span
lang=EN-US>In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of 
        an offence a court may take into account any time spent in custody by 
        the person as a result of the offence.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is where the trial judge demonstrates manifest error.  The 
  emphasis in his mind is all about the respondent and his internal struggle to 
  reconcile his sexual exploitation of a vulnerable little boy with his vows as 
  a priest.  Very little is said in this judgement about the little boy who the 
  respondent was able to prey upon because the boy was starved for love and emotional 
  support at home to the degree that at age 17 he ran away and attempted suicide.  
  To this day he suffers from psychological disorders and requires counselling.  
  Again, I take a completely different view from the trial judge of the expressions 
  of remorse that were made by the respondent.  They were highly selective and 
  were expressive more of damage control than genuine contrition.</p>
