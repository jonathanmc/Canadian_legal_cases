  </span> This appeal concerns two actions, each arising from similar circumstances. 
  In each, summary judgment has been awarded dismissing the claim of the landlord 
  of commercial real estate seeking lease payment damages against the tenant Domgroup 
  Ltd. The circumstances are similar to those in the recent decision of this court 
  in  <i>J.P. Morgan Canada  v. Maxlink Canada Inc.</i>, released February 7, 
  2002, but the legal backdrop is very different. All three cases involve a long-term 
  lease to a lessee, an assignment to a sub-lessee, and the insolvency of the 
  sub-lessee. All concern the legal impact upon the relationship between the landlord 
  and the original tenant. In <i>Morgan,</i> the result flowed from the interpretation 
  of a court order. In the instant appeal, the decision flows from an interpretation 
  of s. 65.2 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, 
  as amended to 1994.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Do the provisions of that section terminate a lease for all purposes 
  or do they only affect the obligations of the insolvent? The motions judge found 
  that the notices of repudiation given under that section terminated the leases 
  for all purposes. He also held that the compensation paid to the landlord pursuant 
  to s. 65.2 constituted the landlord’s full entitlement under each lease.  Thus, 
  the actions against the original lessees were dismissed.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge succinctly outlines the facts of each case and they 
  are so similar that, for purposes of this appeal, a quotation of the reasons 
  concerning <i>Crystalline </i>will suffice:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>By a lease dated April 30, 1979 Dominion Stores Limited, the predecessor 
      of Domgroup, leased from Crystalline premises located in the Northumberland 
      Square Shopping Centre in Douglastown, New Brunswick. The term of the lease 
      was for 25 years ending on March 31, 2004. The lease contained the following 
      provision:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Notwithstanding any assignment or sublease the lessee shall remain fully 
        liable under this lease and shall not be released from performing any 
        of its covenants, obligations or agreements in this lease and shall continue 
        to be bound by this lease.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By an assignment dated May 25, 1995 Dominion Stores Limited assigned the 
      lease to Coastal Foods Limited. It subsequently amalgamated with The Food 
      Group Inc. On or about February 11, 1994 The Food Group Limited filed a 
      Notice of Intention to make a proposal pursuant to Part III of the 1992 
      Act. On February 18, 1994 Peat Marwick Thorne Inc., acting as the proposal 
      trustee of The Food Group Inc., delivered a Notice of Repudiation of the 
      lease to Crystalline pursuant to s. 65.2 of the 1992 Act. The Notice of 
      Repudiation stated, in part, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>3. The repudiation of the lease will become effective on the 31<sup>st</sup> 
        day of March, 1994 at 11:59 PM local time.</p>
      <p>4. Before the repudiation becomes effective, you may apply to the court, 
        within 15 days after the day of which this notice is received, for a declaration 
        that subsection 65.2(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> does 
        not apply in respect of the lease mentioned above ….</p>
      <p>6. By virtue of subsection 65.2(3) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
        Act</i>, a proposal filed by the undersigned commercial tenant must provide 
        for payment to you, immediately after court approval of the proposal, 
        of compensation equal to the lesser of</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> (a)            an amount equal to six months rent under the lease, 
          and</p>
        <p> (b)            the rent for the remainder of the lease, from the date 
          on which the repudiation takes effect.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>7. As detailed in the proposal, The Food Group Inc. or the Trustee intends 
        to continue to occupy the premises for the period from the date of the 
        notice of intention until a date not later than March 31, 1994, and the 
        payment provided for under Part 6 of this notice shall be considered compensation 
        for all damages and occupation rent and the landlord shall not have any 
        right to vote a claim in respect of accelerated rent, damages arising 
        out of the repudiation or the compensation provided for herein (section 
        65.2(4)).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Crystalline did not apply to the Court to challenge the repudiation of 
      the lease as it was entitled to under the 1992 Act. By a letter dated March 
      16, 1994 Peat Marwick Thorne Inc. undertook to pay Crystalline the amount 
      to which it was entitled under the 1992 Act subject to confirmation that 
      Crystalline would not  object to the application for approval of the proposal 
      by the Court. Crystalline returned a signed copy of the letter and confirmed, 
      in accordance with the terms of the letter, that it would not take any action 
      to object to the application for approval of the proposal. This was confirmed 
      by counsel for Crystalline. The proposal stated that a number of leases, 
      including the one with Crystalline, would be terminated in accordance with 
      s. 65.2 of the 1992 Act with effect on March 31, 1994. This proposal was 
      approved by the Court of Queen’s Bench for New Brunswick in Bankruptcy by 
      order dated March 18, 1994. Pursuant to that order Crystalline received 
      and accepted payment in the amount of $131,154.54 in respect of the compensation 
      payable under s. 65.2(3) of the 1992 Act for the termination of the lease. 
      The lease was terminated effective March 31, 1994. However, on January 20, 
      1995 Crystalline sent to Domgroup a letter in which it referred to the assignment 
      clause and alleged that Domgroup was in default of payment of rent due under 
      the lease. The letter expressed an intention to seek relief through the 
      Courts if Domgroup did not remedy the alleged default. The letter did not 
      acknowledge the termination of the lease as of March 31, 1994. </p>

  </span> Section 65.2 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> was introduced 
  in 1992 along with other sections dealing with proposals by insolvent persons. 
  That section reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <b>65.2 </b>(1)  At any time between the filing of a notice of intention 
      and the filing of a proposal, or on the filing of a proposal, in respect 
      of an insolvent person who is a commercial tenant under a lease of real 
      property, the insolvent person may repudiate the lease on giving thirty 
      days notice to the landlord in the prescribed manner, subject to subsection 
      (2).</p>
    <p> (2)  Within fifteen days after being given notice of the repudiation of 
      a lease under subsection (1), the landlord may apply to the court for a 
      declaration that subsection (1) does not apply in respect of that lease, 
      and the court, on notice to such parties as it may direct, shall make such 
      a declaration unless the insolvent person satisfies the court that the insolvent 
      person would not be able to make a viable proposal, or that the proposal 
      the insolvent person has made would not be viable, without the repudiation 
      of that lease and all other leases that the tenant has repudiated under 
      subsection (1).</p>
    <p> (3)            Where a lease is repudiated pursuant to subsection (1), 
      a proposal filed by the insolvent person must provide for payment to the 
      landlord, immediately after court approval of the proposal, of compensation 
      equal to the lesser of</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>(<i>a</i>)            an amount equal to six months rent under the lease, 
        and</p>
      <p>(<i>b</i>)            the rent for the remainder of the lease, from the 
        date on which the repudiation takes effect.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(4)            For the purpose of voting on any question relating to a 
      proposal referred to in subsection (3), the landlord does not have any claim 
      in respect of accelerated rent, damages arising out of the repudiation, 
      or the compensation referred to in subsection (3).</p>
    <p> (5)            Nothing in subsections (1) to (4) affects the operation 
      of section 146 in the event of bankruptcy.</p>
    <p> (6)            Where an insolvent person who has made a proposal referred 
      to in subsection (3) becomes bankrupt</p>
    <p>(<i>a</i>)            after court approval of the proposal and before the 
      proposal is fully performed, and </p>
    <p>(<i>b</i>)            after compensation referred to in subsection (3) 
      has been paid,</p>
    <p>the landlord has no claim against the estate of the bankrupt for accelerated 
      rent. </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This section must be read in context with s. 65.1, which provides that 
  where a notice of intention or a proposal is filed by an insolvent, no person 
  may terminate an agreement or claim an accelerated payment by reason only of 
  the insolvency or the failure to pay rent. Thus, the landlord’s rights against 
  the insolvent tenant are suspended subject to the right to collect rent on a 
  day-to-day basis following the date of the notice or  proposal. For a discussion 
  of this section, see <i>Re Cosgrove-Moore Bindery Service Ltd.</i> (2000), 48 
  O.R. (3d) 540 (S.C.J.). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 65.2 then follows, providing the insolvent tenant an opportunity 
  to rid itself of lease obligations in order to make its proposal viable. In 
  that event, the landlord recovers a maximum of 6 months rent after repudiation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This statutory scheme is clearly designed to permit commercial businesses 
  to avoid being dismantled in a bankruptcy and to survive in the hope of future 
  viability. The question before this court is whether the insolvent assignee’s 
  repudiation of the lease pursuant to the scheme affects the agreement between 
  the landlord and the original lessee. I note at the outset that it seems counter-intuitive 
  to consider that the original lease is affected and indeed terminated by the 
  repudiation. This result confers no benefit on the insolvent and does nothing 
  to serve the purpose of the legislation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Much was made in argument of the fact that by a 1997 amendment the English 
  version of ss. 65.2(1), (2), (3) and (4) was amended to change the word “repudiate” 
  to “disclaim”. This was also a significant pillar in the trial judge’s reasoning. 
  Curiously, no change was made to the French version, which employs the word 
  “résilier”. The argument is that a repudiation destroys the lease while a disclaimer 
  may not have that effect. I cannot accept that proposition. A canvas of dictionaries 
  including a French to French dictionary shows only a modest difference, mostly 
  of usage in a particular context, between “repudiate”, and “disclaim” and  “résilier”. 
  No one knows why the change was made and the appellant is probably right in 
  suggesting it was simply to be consistent with other uses of “disclaim” in the 
  Act. In any event, the French version has equal authority to the English version, 
  leaving no room to argue that the meaning has changed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Of far more significance is the fact that s. 65.1 uses the term “termination” 
  when a final act is contemplated. A landlord may respond, in ordinary circumstances, 
  to a failure to pay rent by terminating the lease – an act in response to a 
  failure to meet a condition of the lease. Section 65.1 prevents that termination 
  if a proposal has been filed. A disclaimer or a repudiation is a statement of 
  position by one party. It creates legal rights in the other party which are 
  triggered by a response but does not, in ordinary circumstances, effect a termination 
  without a response and election. The result under s. 65.2 of the repudiation 
  by the insolvent is that the landlord’s rights against the insolvent are as 
  set out in the section.  It may come forward to have the insolvent satisfy the 
  court that the viability of the proposal depends upon the repudiation. If not, 
  it may claim six months rent and has no further claim on the insolvent. Those 
  are the statutory consequences visited upon the landlord and there is no mention 
  in the statute of termination or consequences affecting others who may have

  </span> Trafford J. was of the opinion that the repudiation terminated the lease. 
  The sole entitlements of the landlord were to appear pursuant to s. 65.2(2) 
  and contest the repudiation and, if unsuccessful, to recover the six months’ 
  rent provided for in s. 65.2(3). I have expressed my view that repudiation under 
  s.65.2(2) is not the equivalent of termination at common law. I would only add 
  that the hearing as to the viability of the proposal without the repudiation 
  is totally unrelated to the rights of the landlord against other third parties 
  and the compensation provided for in s. 65.2(3) is nominal compared to the income 
  stream from a twenty-five-year lease with a credit-worthy original lessee. It 
  should be noted that the lease may have real value to that original lessee. 
  Consequently, the original lessee’s rights cannot be abrogated in its absence.</p>

  </span> My conclusion that the rights as between the landlord and the original 
  tenant are unaffected by these proceedings under s. 65.2 is supported by every 
  authority brought to my attention, albeit none deal with this section of the 
  Act.</p>

  </span> In <i>Cummer-Yonge</i> <i>Investments Ltd. v. Fagot et al.</i>, [1965] 
  2 O.R. 152 (H.C.) aff’d [1965] 2 O.R. 157 (C.A.), Gale C.J.H.C. found that when 
  a lease is disclaimed by a trustee in bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s covenants to 
  perform are dissolved. Since the guarantors’ obligation is to assure performance 
  of those covenants, their obligations disappear with the covenants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The distinction between the position of a guarantor and one who has 
  primary obligations was identified by Austin J. in <i>Andy &amp; Phil</i> <i>Investments 
  Ltd. v. Craig</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 656 (Gen. Div.) at 658, where he states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> In <i>Cummer-Yonge </i>the guarantor guaranteed “the due performance by 
      the Lessee of all its covenants in this lease”. Gale C.J.H.C. decided that 
      this was a “secondary obligation” (p. 154 O.R., p. 64 C.B.R.) which ended 
      when the primary obligations passed to the trustee on the bankruptcy of 
      the lessee.</p>
    <p> The obligation of Craig in the present case is not secondary. It is clear 
      from the language of clause 16.15 that Craig signed “as principal and not 
      as surety”. Clause 16.15, set out above, makes Craig a tenant to all intents 
      and purposes. Craig not having gone bankrupt, there has been no suspension 
      of the landlord’s rights to proceed against Craig as tenant or principal.</p>

  </span> Similarly, in <i>Glenview</i> <i>Corp. v. Lavolpicella</i> (1997), 12 
  R.P.R. (3d) 74, Chadwick J. found an assignor lessee liable under the lease 
  when the assignee’s trustee in bankruptcy disclaimed the lease. They were assignors 
  and not guarantors and, thus, liable. </p>

  </span> In <i>Transco Mills Ltd. v. Percan Enterprises Ltd. </i>(1993), 100 
  D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 359, the British Columbia Court of Appeal dealt with 
  identical facts to those on this appeal, although not under s. 65.2 and applied 
  the word “disclaim” rather than “repudiate”. Taylor J.A. dealt at length with 
  the history in England of the right of a trustee to disclaim a lease, seeking 
  to resolve the same debate as is now presented to this court but in the context 
  of a British Columbia statute empowering the trustee to “disclaim any lease”. 
  As an aside, I note that this long history of use of “disclaim” may explain 
  the 1997 <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </i>amendment. In <i>Transco Mills</i>, 
  Taylor J.A. quoted, at p. 366, from Vice-Chancellor Megarry in <i>Warnford</i> 
  <i>Investments Ltd v. Duckworth, </i>[1978] 2 All E.R. 517 (Ch.D.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> On the other hand, where the lease has been assigned, and the bankruptcy 
      is that of the assignee in whom the lease is vested, and not of the original 
      lessee, the position of the original lessee is very different. <i>The disclaimer 
      does not destroy the lease, but leaves it in existence, though without an 
      owner until a vesting order is made. </i>The original lessee is a person 
      who as principal, undertook towards the lessor, the obligations of the lease 
      for the whole term; and there is nothing in the process of assignment which 
      replaced this liability by the mere collateral liability of a surety who 
      must pay the rent only if the assignee does not. The bankruptcy of the assignee 
      has for the time being destroyed the original lessee’s right against the 
      assignee to require him to discharge the obligations of the lease, and it 
      has impaired the lessee’s right of indemnity against him when he has to 
      discharge the obligations himself; but it has not affected his primary liability 
      towards the lessor, which continues unaffected. At no time does an original 
      lessee become a mere guarantor to the lessor of the liability of any assignee 
      of the lease. [Emphasis is that of Taylor J.A.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although there is no procedure in British Columbia for a vesting order, 
  Taylor J.A. concluded at p.367:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> There appears to me to be very good reason for our taking the same approach 
      to determination of the consequences of disclaimer by a trustee in bankruptcy 
      under the <i>Commercial Tenancy Act</i> [R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 54] as the English 
      courts have adopted under the English legislation – that is to say, so as 
      to accomplish the purpose of the bankruptcy scheme only, and so far as possible 
      not adversely to affect the position of those outside the bankruptcy.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This reasoning is as convincing with the word “repudiation” as with 
  “disclaim”. Both are unilateral expressions of a refusal to be bound by the 
  lease in the future and the consequences of one or the other should be restricted 
  to those set out in s. 65.2 and directed to the purposes of insolvency proceedings.

  judgments with costs to the appellants here and below. Under the new rules effective 
  January 1, 2002 this court must assess the costs. The appellants shall submit 
  a bill of costs with appropriate details, based upon the partial indemnity scale,
