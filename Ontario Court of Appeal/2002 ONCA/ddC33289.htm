    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At issue in this appeal is the appropriate 
    range of sentence for adult offenders who prey upon innocent children to satisfy 
    their deviant sexual cravings. The appellant in the instant case was found 
    guilty after trial of 11 sex-related offences involving four young boys. He 
    was sentenced to 8 years and 1 month on each count concurrent.<a

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes issue with the length 
    of his sentence. He relies on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>R. v. 
    Stuckless</i> (1998), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.) and submits that the 
    six-year global sentence,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [2] </span></span></a> considered by this 
    court to be a fit sentence in that case, represents the high-water mark for 
    adult offenders who groom and sexually abuse innocent children over prolonged 
    periods of time. He further submits that there are no significant differences 
    between the facts and circumstances of his case and those in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i> 
    and certainly none that would justify the additional 3 years imprisonment 
    imposed upon him. Accordingly, he asks that his sentence be reduced by 3 years 
    to bring it into line with the sentence imposed in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i>. 
    I would not give effect to his request for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, I reject the submission that there 
    are no significant differences between this case and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Stuckless</i>. A comparison of the aggravating and mitigating features 
    in each satisfies me that the facts and circumstances of this case are more 
    egregious than those in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i> 
    and for that reason alone, the 3-year additional penalty imposed on the appellant 
    was clearly warranted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, I sharply disagree with the appellants 
    contention that the 6-year global term, considered to be a fit sentence in 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i>, represents the high-water 
    mark for sexual predators who prey on innocent children. On the contrary, 
    for reasons that will become apparent, I consider the 6-year global sentence 
    in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i> to be at the lower 
    end of the appropriate range of sentences for crimes of the magnitude committed 
    by Stuckless. It follows, in my view, that in the appellants case, where 
    the facts and circumstances are even more egregious than those in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i>, the higher 9-year global sentence 
    selected by the trial judge was appropriate. Indeed, if anything, I believe 
    it fell at the lower end of the appropriate range of sentences for crimes 
    as grave as those committed by the appellant.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Details of the nature, extent and magnitude 
    of the appellants crimes are found in a 25-page document entitled Agreed 
    Statement of Facts. The Agreed Statement format proved necessary because 
    the appellant did not plead guilty but chose instead to maintain his innocence 
    and proceed to trial. The trial lasted some two weeks and the appellant took 
    the witness stand and denied the allegations against him. The trial judge 
    rejected his evidence, accepted the evidence of the victims and convicted 
    the appellant on all counts. It was not until the sentence hearing and then, 
    only at the eleventh hour, that the appellant, through counsel, admitted that 
    he had in fact committed the offences for which he now stood convicted. By 
    this time of course, the four young victims had been compelled to testify 
    not once but twice, first at the preliminary hearing and then again at trial. 
    In each instance, they were required to re-live the horror of their ordeals 
    and suffer the humiliation of cross-examination designed to impugn their integrity.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For present purposes, I find it unnecessary 
    to identify the individual victims or detail the specifics of the crimes committed 
    against them. Suffice it to say that over a 7-year period, beginning in 1990 
    when he was 25 and ending in 1997 when he was 32, the appellant befriended 
    four young boys ranging in age from 5 to 8 years and for periods of time ranging 
    from 2 to 7 years, he regularly and persistently engaged them in all manner 
    of sexual activity. The abuse took many forms, including countless acts of 
    masturbation and oral sex, group sexual encounters involving the appellant 
    and several of the boys, attempted acts of anal intercourse in the case of 
    three of the boys and completed acts of anal intercourse in the case of two. 
    A somewhat more detailed account is found in the following excerpt from the 
    Crowns factum:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            
      </span>The Appellant coerced his young victims to engage in virtually every 
      conceivable homosexual act with him. More specifically, the Appellant French 
      kissed them; he licked them (their backs and bums); he fondled their buttocks 
      and genitals; he masturbated them, masturbated himself in front of them, 
      and had them masturbate him; he relentlessly attempted to anally penetrate 
      them (thinking that sooner or later it would fit); he had them anally 
      penetrate him; he had them commit acts of fellatio on him (sometimes ejaculating 
      into their mouths); he performed oral sex on them; and he successfully had 
      anal intercourse with them. Sometimes these sexual acts took place in groups, 
      or with others watching the sexual activities.</span></div>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At all material times, the appellant stood 
    in a position of trust towards the boys. In three cases, he was a close and 
    trusted family friend and in the fourth, he assumed a role akin to that of 
    step-father. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In order to gain his way with the boys and 
    keep them compliant, the appellant made life interesting and exciting for 
    them. He bought them expensive gifts, took them on fun-filled adventures, 
    including overnight camping trips, allowed them to use his video games and 
    his off-road vehicles and on occasion, provided them with beer and cigarettes. 
    In addition, as part of the grooming process, he exposed the boys to pornography 
    in the form of a video tape that depicted all manner of sexual activity, including 
    women engaged in acts of bestiality with dogs and horses.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The means chosen by the appellant to ensure 
    compliance, on the one hand, and secrecy, on the other, involved not only 
    the carrot but the stick. When necessary, he used violence to compel compliance. 
    For example, one boy recalled that whenever he tried to stop the appellant 
    from penetrating him anally, the appellant would smack or punch him. The 
    appellant also used threats of violence and extortion to keep the boys quiet. 
    One of the boys was told that he would go to jail and not see his parents 
    again if he said anything. Another was told that if he disclosed, his parents 
    would think there was something wrong with him and they would dislike him 
    and kick him out of the house. Still others were photographed while engaging 
    in homosexual acts and told that if they disclosed to anyone, the pictures 
    would be posted at their schools. And finally, in the case of his surrogate 
    stepson, the appellant held the child over his thirtieth floor apartment balcony 
    and warned him that he would be thrown off if he ever complained to anyone.</span></p>

    in untold grief and misery for the children and their families. The lives 
    of four families have been shattered; four children have been robbed of their

    damaged psychologically for life. This is attested to in the victim impact

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>One boy speaks of the fear he felt while being 
    sexually assaulted, a fear surpassed only by the terrifying prospect of being 
    thrown over the appellants thirtieth floor balcony should he dare disclose. 
    To this day, when he thinks about what the appellant did to him, he feels 
    sick and dirty and sometimes he actually gets sick. In his words, the appellant 
    took away my childhood. The boys mother reports that the appellants conduct 
    has affected the family to degrees unimaginable. She explains how she herself 
    was molested as a child by her father and how the appellants conduct has 
    caused her to live her sons pain and re-live her own pain. In her words, 
    this has taken many years from my sons life and I know this will hurt me 
    for the rest of my life. The childs father speaks about his sons emotional 
    problems and the symptoms that appeared with the onset of abuse, including 
    withdrawal, misbehaviour and bed-wetting. He also talks about the amount of 
    time the family has spent taking their son to doctors to try to get a handle 
    on his emotional problems and how he himself suffers from bouts of depression 
    and ongoing stomach problems as a result of all that has happened.</span></p>

    has left him angry, nervous and scared. At times, when he gets angry, he has 
    visions of stabbing the appellant a million times until he looks like 
    a chunk of red pulp. According to his parents, the child is filled with 
    anger and frustration and he sometimes becomes belligerent and outright 
    mean. His school work has suffered and his marks have dropped considerably. 
    He has a hard time focusing on his studies and difficulty sleeping. On occasion, 
    his mother reports that she hears her son moaning in his sleep: Stop, Stop, 
    Dont, Ill tell my Mom. Whereas her son was formerly kind, considerate and 
    confident, she now describes him as self-centred, lacking in self-esteem and 
    someone who sees himself as a stupid, bad kid. Both mother and father speak 
    of the constant torment they feel when they think of the horrible things that 
    the appellant, a once trusted friend, did to their child. Both wonder with 
    skepticism whether their relationship with their son will ever be the same.

    her son and his friends to build a friendship with the appellant. Never again 
    she says, will she be able to accept anyones good charity for what it is 
    because to her, such graceful acts now mean hurt, pain and deceit. She 
    reports that her son is doing very poorly at school, that he is angry and 
    mad at the appellant and that he thinks of little else. She now finds

    of indecent assault and sexual assault. The assaults spanned an almost 20-year 
    period and involved many young boys ranging in age from 10 to 15 years. Stuckless 
    engaged the boys in a wide range of sexual activities but at no time did he 
    perform or attempt to perform acts of anal intercourse on them, nor did he 
    require them to perform such acts on him.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Stuckless was diagnosed as both a pedophile

    he was motivated to take treatment and sex-reducing medication and that he

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>According to the record, Stuckless groomed 
    his victims and established a relationship of trust and confidence with them. 
    His strategy involved enticement and the exploitation of trust, but not the 
    use of overt physical violence or threats of violence. Nonetheless, as attested 
    to in the victim impact statements, his conduct had a devastating effect on 
    the lives of the victims and their families. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Before going further, I wish to emphasize 
    that the ranges which I have identified are not meant to be fixed and inflexible. 
    On the contrary, sentencing is not an exact science and trial judges must 
    retain the flexibility needed to do justice in individual cases. The suggested 
    ranges are merely guidelines designed to assist trial judges in their difficult 
    task of fashioning fit and just sentences in similar cases. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The overall message however, is meant to be 
    clear. Adult sexual predators who would put the lives of innocent children 
    at risk to satisfy their deviant sexual needs must know that they will pay 
    a heavy price. In cases such as this, absent exceptional circumstances, the 
    objectives of sentencing proclaimed by Parliament in s.718(a), (b) and (c) 
    of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Criminal Code</i>, commonly referred 
    to as denunciation, general and specific deterrence, and the need to separate 
    offenders from society, must take precedence over the other recognized objectives 
    of sentencing. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We as a society owe it to our children to 
    protect them from the harm caused by offenders like the appellant. Our children 
    are at once our most valued and our most vulnerable assets. Throughout their 
    formative years, they are manifestly incapable of defending themselves against 
    predators like the appellant and as such, they make easy prey. People like 
    the appellant know this only too well and they<span style="mso-spacerun:

    that can and often do follow.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this respect, while there may have been 
    a time, years ago, when offenders like the appellant could take refuge in 
    the fact that little was known about the nature or extent of the damage caused 
    by sexual abuse, that time has long since passed. Today, that excuse no longer 
    holds sway. The horrific consequences of child sexual abuse are only too well 
    known.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Two such consequences were identified by the 
    Alberta Court of Appeal almost ten years ago. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    (M.)</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 530 at 535, the court, composed of Major J.A. 
    (as he then was) and McDonald and Quigley JJ. made the following observations:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            
      </span>When the victim of a major sexual assault is a child, it is also 
      no doubt true that such an assault frequently results in serious psychological 
      harm to the victim.<br>
      <br>
      </span></div>
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            
      </span>When a man has assaulted a child for his sexual gratification, then, 
      even if no long-lasting physical trauma is suffered by the child, it is 
      reasonable to assume that the child may have suffered emotional trauma, 
      the effects of which may survive longer than bruises or broken bones, and 
      may even be permanent.</span></div>
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><br>
                  </span>One consequence of being abused sexually may be that 
      the child will never be able, as an adult, to form a loving, caring relationship 
      with another adult of the opposite sex, being always fearful, even unconsciously, 
      that such a partner will use sexual acts to hurt him or her rather than 
      as an intimate expression of caring and affection. There is no empirical 
      way of proving that a particular child victims emotional trauma will or 
      will not make it more difficult or impossible for him or her to love another, 
      without fear of abuse. We have only the recorded experiences of men and 
      women who attribute their difficulties as adults in forming mature and fulfilling 
      relationships to their having been abused sexually when they were children.</span></div>
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><br>
                  </span>Another consequence of being abused sexually may be that 
      the child, when he or she becomes an adult, will treat a child or children 
      as he or she had been treated as a child  that is, he or she may abuse 
      a child sexually. There is no empirical way of proving that a particular 
      child victim, when he or she becomes an adult, will do to some child what 
      has been done to him or her. We do know that sentencing judges are commonly 
      told by defence counsel that the accused claims to have been sexually abused 
      by a man (or by a woman, or both) who had stood in a parental relationship 
      to him or her when he or she was a child.</span></div>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As is apparent from these passages, with which 
    I completely agree, the Alberta Court of Appeal was focussing on the potential 
    long term effects of sexual abuse. Time alone will tell whether the children 
    in the present case will fall victim to one or both of these consequences. 
    In the short term, the immediate harm to them (a third consequence) is well 
    documented. I have earlier referred to the devastating effects of the appellants 
    conduct and there is no need to repeat it. Manifestly, the situation in the 
    four affected families is tragic.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A question arises in this case whether the 
    appellant should benefit from the fact that unlike Stuckless, he has not been 
    diagnosed as a pedophile. In particular, the appellant submits that because 
    he has not been found to be a pedophile, this should be viewed as a mitigating 
    factor weighing in his favour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect, I disagree. If the appellant 
    is not a pedophile and he does not suffer from some other psycho-sexual disorder 
    that could account for his reprehensible behaviour, then arguably his degree 
    of moral culpability rises significantly. Surely, that cannot translate into 
    a mitigating factor weighing in his favour. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>My rejection of this aspect of the appellants 
    argument should not be taken as an indicator that had the appellant been diagnosed 
    as a pedophile, I would have concluded that the 9-year global sentence selected 
    by the trial judge was too high. It was not.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this respect, assuming that the appellant 
    is a pedophile, I agree entirely with the views expressed by Abella J.A. at 
    pp.&nbsp;242 - 246 of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stuckless</i> 
    under the subheading The Role of General Deterrence and Rehabilitation. 
    In a nutshell, as my colleague points out, the sentencing objectives of denunciation, 
    and general and specific deterrence, can and do play a significant role in 
    the sentencing of pedophiles. Moreover, as Abella J.A. observes at pp. 244:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section3><span lang=EN-US>. . . Pedophilia is an explanation, not 
      a defence. Society is entitled to protection no less from pedophiles than 
      those who sexually abuse children without this tendency.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<div class=Section3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I agree wholeheartedly with this observation 
    and would only add that in the case of pedophiles, while their degree of moral 
    culpability may be somewhat diminished by virtue of their psycho-sexual disorder, 
    absent successful treatment,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [4] </span></span></a> they remain dangerous 
    and represent a very high risk to society. As such, in the case of pedophiles 
    who have not been successfully treated, I believe that in addition to the 
    sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence, serious regard must 
    be had to the objective of separating such individuals from society to protect 
    our children and spare them from the risk of irreparable harm.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To summarize, I am of the view that as a general 
    rule, when adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse innocent 
    young children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial periods 
    of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary 
    terms. When the abuse involves full intercourse, anal or vaginal, and it is 
    accompanied by other acts of physical violence, threats of physical violence, 
    or other forms of extortion, upper single digit to low double digit penitentiary 
    terms will generally be appropriate. Finally, in cases where these elements 
    are accompanied by a pattern of severe psychological, emotional and physical 
    brutalization, still higher penalties will be warranted. (See, for example, 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>R. v. M.(C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 
    500 in which the Supreme Court restored the 25-year sentence imposed at trial 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and R. v. W. (L.K.)</i> (1999), 138 
    C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.) in which this court upheld a sentence of 18 and 
    a half years imposed at trial.)</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant was prepared to risk the lives 
    of innocent children to satisfy his sexual cravings. His conduct was reprehensible 
    and it must be condemned in the strongest of terms. The harm occasioned by 
    the appellant and others like him is cause for grave concern. Children are 
    robbed of their youth and innocence, families are often torn apart or rendered 
    dysfunctional, lives are irretrievably damaged and sometimes permanently destroyed. 
    Because of this, the message to such offenders must be clear  prey upon innocent 
    children and you will pay a heavy price!</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The price in this case was a global sentence 
    of 9 years and 1 month, reduced to 8 years and 1 month by reason of time served 
    in pre-sentence custody. The sentence selected by the trial judge was within 
    the appropriate range. Far from being too high, in my view, it fell at the 
    lower end of the range of sentences for crimes as grave as those committed 
    by the appellant.</span></p>
