  </span></span> There are two appeals before this court, both commenced by the 
  plaintiff, Delrina Corporation, which carries on business as Carolian Systems 
  (Carolian).  In the first appeal, Carolian appeals from the dismissal of its 
  action by O’Leary J. against the defendants Triolet Systems Inc. and Brian Duncombe.  
  In this action Carolian alleged that the defendants’ computer software program, 
  known as Assess, infringed its copyright in its program known as Sysview.  In 
  the second appeal, Carolian appeals from a judgment of O’Leary J. assessing 
  the defendants’ damages under Carolian’s undertaking to pay damages given to 
  obtain an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from selling, 
  giving away, or marketing Assess.  I shall deal first with the appeal concerned 
  with the dismissal of Carolian’s action.</p>

  </span></span> Carolian raises four grounds of appeal, all of which allege errors 
  of law on the part of the trial judge.  In the circumstances, I do not think 
  it is necessary to set out the facts in detail.  They are comprehensively stated 
  in the trial judge’s reasons for judgment, which are reported at 47 C.P.R. (3d) 
  1.  My references to pages in the trial judge’s reasons are to the pages in

  </span></span> The respondent Duncombe was employed by Carolian for the period 
  from January 1984 to December 1985 to improve Carolian’s performance monitoring 
  program called Sysview.  The purpose of this program was to allow a skilled 
  operator of a Hewlett-Packard HP 3000 computer to assess the efficiency of the 
  operation of this computer.  Duncombe completely rewrote Sysview for Carolian.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After leaving Carolian in 1985, Duncombe began to design Assess 
  in January 1986.  Assess was designed to be functionally similar to Sysview 
  in order to compete directly with Sysview for the same customers.  I shall refer 
  to further facts where they are relevant to a particular ground of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The four grounds of 
  appeal, as stated in the appellant’s factum, are as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1.         </b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The learned trial judge erred in defining “copying” 
      as only including copying which Duncombe committed while having Sysview 
      before him, including its source code, when he created Assess.</span></p>
    <p><b>2.         </b>The learned trial judge erred in excusing the many similarities 
      between Sysview and Assess as being attributable to a collection of factors 
      which are irrelevant in copyright law.  These factors included: (a) Duncombe 
      deliberately designing Assess to be similar to Sysview; and (b) Duncombe 
      being the author of both programs.</p>
    <p><b>3.         </b>The learned trial judge erred in denying copyrightability 
      to much of Sysview.  The learned trial judge made this error, in large part, 
      by applying United States authorities on the copyrightability of computer 
      programs without regard to the significant differences between the copyright 
      statutes and the development of copyright law in the two countries [the 
      United States and Canada].  Based on these authorities, the learned trial 
      judge ignored the fact that Sysview met the standard set under the <i>Copyright 
      Act</i> of being “original”.</p>
    <p><b>4.         </b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The learned trial judge erred in: (a) drawing an adverse 
      inference that Carolian did not produce a privileged expert’s report because 
      it would not have been helpful to Carolian; and (b) finding that Fitzpatrick 
      J. might have declined to award an interlocutory injunction had he been 
      made aware of the Aronoff report.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents raised, as an additional issue in response to 
  the appeal, the question whether the trial judge erred in holding, as a matter 
  of law, that the user-interface of Sysview (specifically the screen displays), 
  was the proper subject matter for copyright protection.  In view of my conclusion 
  relating to the trial judge’s factual findings on this issue, it is not necessary 
  to deal with this question of law.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> By reason of the content and organization of the trial judge’s 
  reasons, there is considerable overlap among grounds 1, 2 and 3.  Further, if 
  the trial judge is right in his reasoning relating to ground 3 (which the appellant 
  attacks), it necessarily follows that there is no substance in grounds 1 and 
  2.  Because I conclude that the trial judge was right with respect to ground 
  3, I shall deal relatively briefly with grounds 1 and 2.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The key passage in 
  the trial judge’s reasons relating to this ground is as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In using the word “copying”, Campbell [a principal of Carolian] uses it 
      in the literal sense.  He means that Duncombe had a copy of Sysview before 
      him, including its source code, when he created Assess and that he copied 
      from it when it benefitted his work to do so – which was most of the time.  
      Campbell is not talking about copying from memory that Duncombe might have 
      had for some portions of the source code, the display screens, and other 
      portions of Sysview from having created it from scratch while at Carolian.  
      I also in these reasons use “copying” in the literal sense I have just described 
      (p. 9).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is not in issue that “copying” in the law of copyright clearly 
  goes beyond copying from something which is physically before the person who 
  copies.  It includes copying from memory, even subconscious memory: <i>Gondos

  </span></span> The issue with respect to this error relates to the extent to 
  which it affects the trial judge’s ultimate conclusions on copyright infringement.  
  It is a troublesome point but I am satisfied that, when the reasons are read 
  as a whole, it can be seen that the trial judge’s essential findings were not 
  based on the view that copying from memory could not be a basis of copyright 
  infringement.  As my reasons will indicate, the main basis for explaining similarities 
  between Assess and Sysview is that features common to both programs are not 
  capable of copyright protection.</p>

  </span></span> Further, if the trial judge was of the view that copying protectable 
  expression from memory was excusable, he would not have felt obliged to canvass 
  in the detail that he did what Carolian submitted to be intrinsic evidence of 
  copying.  He rejected Carolian’s submission.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This ground of appeal relates to the reasons of the trial judge 
  which are largely repeated in relation to the question of the copyright protectability 
  of elements of Sysview which I consider, in some detail, in relation to the 
  issues raised under ground 3.  Accordingly, I will not deal with it in any detail 
  at this point.  I will, however, make one or two observations with respect to 
  the two factors which are expressly mentioned in the statement of the ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first factor is “Duncombe deliberately designing Assess to 
  be similar to Sysview.”  Stated in these terms, this factor could hardly be 
  a copyright law justification of similarities between Assess and Sysview.  In 
  fact, as the appellant points out, it would be evidence which supports the finding 
  of copying from Sysview.  However, this is not what the trial judge said.  He 
  explained the similarities on the basis that it was Duncombe’s intention to 
  make Assess capable of performing every function that Sysview could perform 
  (p. 13).  Functional similarities between these two programs is not necessarily 
  evidence of copying.  The trial judge explained this in greater detail later 
  in his reasons when dealing with ground 3, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As Sieler [the expert witness called on behalf of the defendants] has indicated 
      and as the decided cases have emphasized, common similarities between two 
      competing functional works are to be expected without one being a copy of 
      the other.  The inference that copying has taken place which might arise 
      from a pure look at two articles must be tempered by the principle that 
      copying ideas for functional products is not enough.  Once anyone has got 
      the idea for a product, the general characteristics of the product are inevitably 
      going to be dictated by functional considerations.  Similarities attributable 
      to the nature of the product, the limited ways in which an idea can be expressed, 
      stock devices and common tools of the trade, the use of common sources, 
      knowledge and information, constraints imposed by the nature of the product, 
      are not indicators of copying or of substantial similarity between the copyright 
      and allegedly infringing work (p. 40).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second factor, “Duncombe being the author of both programs” 
  is, once again, hardly a justification of copying, if copying took place, but 
  this clearly was not what the trial judge said.  His point was that certain 
  similarities between Assess and Sysview could be understood as the result of 
  programming style and experience which Duncombe had, without the similarities 
  being probative of copying.</p>

  that Sysview met the standard set under the <i>Copyright Act</i> of being “original”.</p>

  </span></span> I should mention, at the outset of this part of my reasons, that 
  the evidence the trial judge relied upon showed, in his view, both that the 
  portions of Sysview which Carolian submitted proved copyright infringement by 
  the defendants were not entitled to copyright protection and, in fact, had not 
  been copied by Duncombe from Sysview.  On this the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>We have then Burkowski [an expert witness called on behalf the plaintiff] 
      and other witnesses for the plaintiff saying that certain parts of Assess 
      were copied from Sysview but making no attempt at establishing that Carolian 
      had copyright in the parts of Sysview that were copied.  We have Sieler 
      [the defendants’ expert] saying that the portions of Sysview, that Burkowski 
      and others referred to, were not copied by Duncombe in creating Assess, 
      and in many cases that the similarities are accounted for by being the logical 
      or only way of accomplishing the particular task at hand, or that the routine 
      came from the public domain or was dictated by the make-up of the HP3000 
      or other like reasons – all of which in addition to explaining away copying, 
      also deny copyrightability (p. 38).</p>
    <p align="center"><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>….</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Sieler lists many reasons for similarities between Sysview 
      and Assess without the suggestion of copying arising, but reasons which 
      likewise establish that those parts of Sysview under [re]view are not copyrightable 
      (p. 41).</span></p>

  </span></span> Carolian advanced several specific arguments under this ground 
  of appeal.  One fundamental argument was that the trial judge erred in dissecting 
  Sysview into parts and then determining that each of these parts was not entitled 
  to copyright protection.  The proper approach, Carolian submits, is, first, 
  to determine whether Sysview as a whole is entitled to copyright and then to 
  determine whether the part reproduced by the defendants is a substantial part 
  of the whole.  This latter step involves looking at the quality and quantity 
  of what has been taken.  Carolian submitted that the law is “neatly encapsulated” 
  in <i>Ladbroke (Football) Ltd. v. William Hill (Football) Ltd.</i>, [1964] 1 
  All E.R. 465 (H.L.).</p>

  </span></span> I shall deal with this basic submission now.  The House of Lords’ 
  decision in <i>Ladbroke</i> clearly supports the propositions advanced by Carolian, 
  but I think that the major answer to the appeal on this point is that the trial 
  judge, in his decision of the case, did not run afoul of these propositions.  
  In fairness to Carolian, I acknowledge that there are several general statements 
  in the trial judge’s reasons at pp. 27-46 which would tend to support its position.  
  However, in his actual decision on the issue of infringement, the trial judge 
  engaged in what I consider to be a proper analysis relating to whether the defendants 
  reproduced a substantial part of Sysview.  I shall elaborate.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The reasons of Lord 
  Pearce in <i>Ladbroke</i> at p. 481 are in point:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Did the appellants reproduce a substantial part of it?  Whether a part 
      is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than its quantity.  
      <i>The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not 
      normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be 
      protected</i>.  <i>For that which would not attract copyright except by 
      reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be 
      a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold 
      its reproduction to be an infringement</i>.  It is this, I think, which 
      is meant by one or two judicial observations that “there is no copyright” 
      in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright.  They afford no justification, 
      in my view, for holding that one starts the inquiry as to whether copyright 
      exists by dissecting the compilation into component parts instead of starting 
      it by regarding the compilation as a whole and seeing whether the whole 
      has copyright.  <i>It is when one is debating whether the part reproduced 
      is substantial that one considers the pirated portion on its own</i>. [Emphasis 
      added]</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge in his reasons at pp. 71-82 carefully examined 
  similarities between Sysview and Assess upon which Carolian relied and concluded 
  that none of them involved parts of Sysview that were entitled to copyright 
  protection or that, in fact, were copied by Duncombe from Sysview.  This analytical 
  approach is fully supportable under the emphasized passages in <i>Ladbroke</i> 
  set forth above.  While it would have been preferable if the trial judge had 
  avoided using “copyrightable” in considering the elements of Assess alleged 
  to be similar to Sysview (the word applies more accurately to a work as a whole), 
  I think that he properly considered whether those elements were entitled to 
  copyright protection.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Ladbroke</i>, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant 
  had infringed its copyright in a football betting coupon which was a “compilation” 
  form of “literary work” under the applicable legislation.  The first line of 
  defence was that the plaintiff did not have copyright in the coupon as a whole.  
  In pursuing this position the defendants argued that “the coupons could be dissected 
  and that on analysis no copyright attached to any of their component parts and 
  accordingly no protection is available” (p. 475).  This approach was rejected 
  by the House of Lords.</p>

  </span></span> In the present case, the trial judge at no place in his reasons 
  expressed the view that there was no copyright in Sysview as a whole and, for 
  the purpose of these reasons, I am prepared to assume that Carolian had copyright 
  in the work as a whole.  It was sufficient for the trial judge to examine those 
  elements of Assess which Carolian alleged were similar to elements of Sysview, 
  with a view to determining whether Assess was a substantial reproduction of 
  Sysview.  If the elements of Assess Carolian alleged were similar to Sysview 
  were not capable of copyright protection, Carolian cannot rely on those similarities 
  to establish copyright infringement.  </p>

  </span></span> I accept that the reproduction of a particular arrangement of 
  elements that are not themselves protectable can constitute copyright infringement 
  if that arrangement is original.  However, in this case the trial judge found 
  that all of the alleged similarities between Sysview and Assess, including similarities 
  in the arrangement of elements, were dictated by functional considerations or 
  otherwise not protectable by copyright.  Given this finding, it could hardly 
  be concluded that Assess was a substantial reproduction of Sysview, even if 
  the Sysview elements, by reasons of their collocation with other parts of Sysview, 
  were part of a work which was entitled to copyright as a whole.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The foregoing relates to the particular similarities upon which 
  Carolian relied.  The trial judge also looked at the aggregate of what was alleged 
  to be copied.  First, with respect to the user interface (which includes the 
  display screens and keyboard commands) he held, contrary to the submission of 
  the defendants, that it was legally capable of being protected by copyright 
  (pp. 27-31) but found that, on the evidence, no substantial part was “copyrightable” 
  (pp. 44 and 46).  Second, with respect to the source code part of the program, 
  he was satisfied that portions of it were not copyrightable but, more importantly, 
  that none of it (apart, unwittingly, from a <i>de minimus</i> 40 lines out of 
  a total of 14,000 lines – pp. 29 and 31) was copied by Duncombe (pp. 39 and 
  46).  On this point he made the following significant finding:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>After examining the source code for both Sysview and 
      Assess, Sieler stated:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In the clearest possible terms, I want to state: I do 
          not believe that the source for Sysview was altered into the source 
          code for Assess. … Both Sysview and Assess show rigid, but different, 
          coding disciplines.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>No independent expert has come forward to say that the Assess source code 
      was copied from Sysview.  Accordingly, the evidence of Sieler goes a long 
      way in convincing me that Duncombe, in creating Assess did not copy from 
      the Sysview source code (p. 39).</p>

  </span></span> These aspects all relate, in various ways, to what Carolian submits 
  is the trial judge’s incorrect application of the term “original” in copyright 
  law, specifically, that the trial judge ignored the fact that Sysview met the 
  standard under the <i>Copyright Act</i> of being original.  This error, according 
  to the submission, stems from the trial judge’s reliance on U.S. authorities 
  as opposed to Canadian and English authorities.</p>

  </span></span> It is a fundamental feature of the copyright law in all three 
  countries that it protects only original <i>expression</i>.  It does not protect 
  the idea underlying the expression.  Frequent reference has been made to the 
  following statement of Thorson P.<i> </i>in<i> Moreau</i> <i>v. St. Vincent</i>, 
  [1950] Ex. C.R. 198 at 203.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is … an elementary principle of copyright law that an author has no 
      copyright in ideas but only in his expression of them.  The law of copyright 
      does not give him any monopoly in the use of the ideas with which he deals 
      or any property in them, even if they are original.  His copyright is confined 
      to the literary work in which he expressed them.  The ideas are public property, 
      the literary work is his own.  Everyone may freely adopt and use the ideas 
      but no one may copy his literary work without his consent.</p>

  </span></span> Although the idea/expression dichotomy is a common feature of 
  copyright law in the three countries, it has been observed that it is applied 
  with greater rigour in the United States, with the effect of enlarging the idea 
  aspect of a work and, correspondingly, reducing the expression aspect.  The 
  result is a narrowing of the scope of copyright protection.  The submitted wider 
  protection afforded under the English/Canadian approach is based on some recognition 
  of the skill and labour in the creation of the work:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While Anglo-Canadian copyright law also places significant emphasis on 
      the idea/expression distinction, this principle has not been applied with 
      the same rigour.  Canadian and British courts have been willing to depart 
      from this principle and grant copyright protection based on the skill and 
      labour used in the creation of a work.  This departure has created some 
      doctrinal tension.  In choosing to protect skill and labour, British and 
      Canadian courts have accorded a certain degree of protection to ideas.</p>

  of Carolian’s claim based on breach of a fiduciary obligation by Duncombe, which 
  is no longer in issue in this proceeding, and not in a copyright law part of 
  the case.  With respect to the latter, he stated the law correctly:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps the next most fundamental principle is that to 
      give rise to copyright, the work must be original, that is to say, it must

  of Sysview. Carolian submitted that the trial judge misplaced the legal burden 
  of proof relating to the existence of copyright.  The <i>Copyright Act</i>, 
  s. 34.1(1)(a) provides that “Copyright shall be presumed, unless the contrary 
  is proved.”  There are passages of some generality in the trial judge’s reasons 
  which misstate the law on this issue.  For example: “For Carolian to succeed 
  on its copyright infringement claim, it must, of course, first establish it 
  has copyright which subsists in Sysview or some material portion of it” (p. 
  27).</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is clear, however, 
  that when the trial judge dealt with the issues on which the case turned, relating 
  to copyright protectability in the parts of Sysview which Carolian alleged were 
  copied, he came to a determinate conclusion that Sysview had no protection:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view, Sieler’s evidence in regard to each of the examples of alleged 
      copying I have just reviewed, while relevant to the issue of copying, establishes 
      if accepted (and I accept it) that those portions of Sysview’s interface 
      referred to in those examples were not copyrightable… At the same time, 
      Sieler has convinced me that for many of the reasons that parts of the user 
      interface are not copyrightable, for those same reasons portions of the 
      source code are not copyrightable.  Little will be accomplished by identifying 
      those portions of the Sysview source code that are not copyrightable since 
      I have concluded that in any event none of it was copied by Duncombe (p.

  judge’s reasons at pages 33-37.  As I have said, it is a method of determining

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The true position is that where an ‘idea’ is sufficiently general, then 
      even if the original work embodies it, the mere taking of that idea will 
      not infringe.  But if the ‘idea’ is detailed, then there may be infringement.

  </span></span> The merger question was raised in rather stark form in <i>Apple 
  Computer</i>.  This was not a case of infringement based on an alleged substantial 
  reproduction of the plaintiff’s work but one of an outright copying of the whole 
  work.  One of the defendant’s defences was the general submission that “a computer 
  program exhibits a merger of the idea and the expression of the idea and therefore 
  is not copyrightable” (p. 24).</p>

  </span></span> Reed J. was of the view that there were several difficulties 
  with this argument.  One of them was that the assembly code version of the program 
  in question had been conceded to be copyrightable.  I do not think that the 
  court’s rejection of the merger argument that computer programs, generally, 
  are not entitled to copyright necessarily forecloses its application to a particular 
  element in a program in the course of a substantial reproduction analysis.  
  As <i>Ibcos</i> said “[i]t is a question of degree.”</p>

  </span></span> The merger notion is a natural corollary of the idea/expression 
  distinction which, as I have said, is fundamental in copyright law in Canada, 
  England and the United States.  Clearly, if there is only one or a very limited 
  number of ways to achieve a particular result in a computer program, to hold 
  that that way or ways are protectable by copyright could give the copyright 
  holder a monopoly on the idea or function itself.</p>

  which Carolian alleged were copied in Assess.  As part of this analysis he was 
  obliged to consider the defendants’ evidence that these parts were not entitled 
  to copyright protection and, in fact, had not been copied.  I say at the outset 
  that his rather detailed canvass of the points of alleged similarities between 
  Sysview and Assess shows that the source of similarities was not Sysview but, 
  rather, other sources. Many were dictated by Hewlett Packard’s operating system

      but his report has never been produced and he did not testify at the trial.  
      I assume his evidence would not have helped Carolian.</p>
    <p>Of greater concern is the fact that at the time of the successful motion 
      for an interlocutory injunction, on February 3, 1987 before Fitzpatrick 
      J., the existence of a report from Arnoff was not revealed to the Court

  drew an adverse inference against Carolian because of its failure to call Mr. 
  Arnoff as a witness at the trial and that he was wrong in doing so.  (Carolian 
  says that the correct name is “Aronoff.” It appears that all of the references 
  in the material at the trial and in the pre-trial proceedings are to “Arnoff”

  submitted that both O’Brien J. and Master Donkin, in pre-trial orders, had denied

  trial judge, in the quoted passage from his reasons, did draw an adverse inference.  
  He assumed that Mr. Arnoff’s evidence would not have helped Carolian.  While 
  his thinking could have been spelled out at greater length, the wording is a 
  recognized terse way of drawing an inference.  Sopinka <i>et al</i>, <i>The 
  Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, 2nd ed. (1999) at p. 297 says: “Such failure 
  [to call a witness who would have knowledge of the facts and would be assumed 
  to assist that party] amounts to an implied admission that the evidence of the 
  absent witness would be contrary to the party’s case, or at least would not 
  support it.”  It may be seen that the trial judge drew the milder of the two 
  inferences referred to in this passage.  In any event, when the passage is examined 
  in the context of the reasons as a whole, it can be seen that it had no bearing 
  on the trial judge’s ultimate findings.</p>

  </span></span> The passage was in that part of the reasons concerned with the 
  question of factual copying and, no doubt, was relevant to this issue.  The 
  defendants’ expert witness, Mr. Sieler, had testified in some detail in support 
  of his report which stated that “Assess is new and has not been copied from 
  the source code for Sysview” (p. 17).  The trial judge accepted his evidence, 
  as well as that of Mr. Duncombe (… “I accept Duncombe’s evidence that he created 
  Assess without copying Sysview in any way” (p. 18)) and referred to portions 
  of the evidence which supported his conclusion of no copying.</p>

  a factor in the trial judge’s conclusion on actual copying, it is very clear 
  that it formed no part of his reasoning with respect to issue 3, that relating 
  to whether Assess was a substantial reproduction of Sysview.  As I have indicated, 
  the trial judge’s reasons on this issue are an independent basis of his ultimate 
  judgment.  The reasons on this issue are quite separate from those relating

  </span></span> Carolian submits that no inference should be drawn because the 
  report made by Mr. Arnoff was held to be privileged in a decision of Master 
  Donkin on March 29, 1989 on a motion by the defendants for production of the 
  report.  Master Donkin held that “the report was for the sole purpose of this 
  litigation.”</p>

  that because the parties exchanged their source codes, pursuant to two earlier 
  court orders, to have them compared by a court-appointed assessor, the report

  the eleven page segment I mentioned earlier said to the trial judge that he 
  “had no intention of now trying to overturn the claim of privilege and an order 
  of Master Donkin.”  In light of this, the trial judge would not have been wrong 
  in considering that Mr. Arnoff’s evidence was privileged.  However, it appears

  citing Spencer Bower, Turner, and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata, 3rd

  trial.  For example, if the Arnoff report was protected by lawyers’ privilege, 
  it would seem that the defendants could have obtained disclosure of Mr. Arnoff’s 
  findings, opinions, or conclusions, but not if Carolian had undertaken not to 
  call him as a witness at the trial (rule 31.06(3)(b)).  If the matter had been 
  gone into, it is clear that Carolian would have given this undertaking.  If 
  it had given it, this would have been a logical explanation which would have 
  prevented the adverse inference from being drawn.</p>

  </span></span> At this point I shall deal with a further complaint of Carolian 
  on the trial judge’s reference to the Arnoff’s potential evidence.  Carolian 
  submits that the trial judge’s view of the matter resulted in his awarding solicitor 
  and client costs against it.  I have two observations on this point.  The first 
  is that there is no appeal against costs – no motion for leave to appeal costs 
  and, if leave be granted, a request to have the costs order varied (see rule 
  61.03.1(17)) and the subject is not raised in the appellant’s factum.  Second, 
  although the trial judge did consider the failure to deliver the Arnoff report 
  to be relevant to the awarding of solicitor and client costs, it appears from 
  his reasons that he would have awarded solicitor and client costs even in the 
  absence of this consideration.  He said in paragraph 174 of the decision on 
  damages: “In any event, if the undertaking to pay damages is to have the effect 
  of compensating the defendants for their losses, it is necessary that the defendants 
  be reimbursed for the cost of the litigation.”</p>

  </span></span> There is no dispute in this appeal respecting the applicable 
  legal principles.  The damages to be awarded must be reasonably foreseeable 
  at the time of the granting of the interlocutory injunction and they must be 
  caused by (“naturally flow from”) the injunction and not by something else:

  417 (C.A.) at 434-436.  The trial judge’s reasons make it clear that he appreciated 
  that these were the applicable principles and that, in arriving at his conclusions, 
  he applied them.  What the appeal comes down to, then, is whether these conclusions 
  are reasonably supportable on the evidence.</p>

  </span></span> Before addressing the grounds of appeal, I shall set forth the 
  trial judge’s basic reasoning which led to his award.  He accepted the expert 
  evidence of one Derek Rostant who was called as a witness by the defendants.  
  Mr. Rostant had expertise in accounting, quantification of loss resulting from 
  business interruption, business evaluation, and viability of a business.  The 
  trial judge preferred Mr. Rostant’s evidence to that of Mr. Eric G. Rule, the 
  expert called by Carolian.  In general terms, the trial judge found that Mr. 
  Rostant’s evidence, in light of the other evidence called during the trial on 
  damages, was more realistic than Mr. Rule’s. </p>

  that the damages, apart from those relating to the lost sales of the Assess 
  3000 classic product, were not caused by the injunction and were not reasonably 
  foreseeable.  Because there is some practical overlap between these grounds, 
  I shall deal with them together.  Before I do so, I should mention that all 
  of the submissions which Carolian made to us were made to the trial judge, in 
  the form of various objections to the reasoning and conclusions of Mr. Rostant, 
  and each was dealt with in considerable detail in the trial judge’s reasons.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to causation and foreseeability, Carolian submits 
  that the trial judge should not have awarded damages relating to loss of sales 
  of performance monitors in markets relating to two new generations of Hewlett 
  Packard computers which followed the Hewlett Packard 3000 product – the HP 3000 
  XL and HP Unix markets.  On this issue the trial judge relied upon evidence 
  that Duncombe, in 1986, had a business plan (salient parts of which are quoted 
  in paragraph 85 of his reasons) that included “porting” his current Assess program 
  to the new systems and that the injunction, by shutting Duncombe out of the 
  Assess classic market, also shut him out of the new markets.  I quote from parts 
  of the trial judge’s reasons on this issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[41] For a company with the proper expertise, porting the classic monitor 
      to the XL computer could be done.  But what all witnesses with knowledge 
      of the market place seem to agree on is that unless a vendor had established 
      itself with a reputable performance monitor in the HP 3000 classic market 
      it could not likely have broken into the XL market. …</p>
    <p>[42] In 1986 (but not in volume until 1990) Hewlett Packard, while not 
      abandoning its XL computer, came out with a new Unix computer; thus competing 
      for the Unix market with others such as I.B.M.  Once again a vendor of a 
      monitoring tool to the HP 3000 community wanting to keep its share of the 
      Hewlett Packard software market or indeed to take advantage of the Unix 
      market had to port its XL tool to the Unix operating system.  This was less 
      complicated than the adaptation from the classic to the XL had been.  It 
      was accomplished by Lund and could just as easily have been accomplished 
      by Duncombe.  Once again a presence in the old market with a reliable XL 
      computer monitoring tool was essential.  Perhaps even more devastating to 
      Duncombe’s ability to enter either the XL market place or the Unix market 
      place was the fact that he had been unable because of the injunction to 
      stay in the classic market and by marketing first the classic monitor and 
      then the XL to keep such tools up-to-date with the frequent changes made 
      by Hewlett Packard in its classic and XL computers, and to alter the function 
      of the monitoring tools to meet the needs and demands of computer users 
      as their perceived needs changed.  Putting it another way, by not being 
      in the market place with performance monitoring tools Duncombe lost touch 
      with the current needs in the market place.  Indeed even his performance 
      monitoring skills became rusty.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>….</span></p>
    <p>[63] One of the important assumptions made by Rostant in making the report 
      is that Duncombe would have but for the injunction, expanded his business 
      into other market areas just as several of the other companies that he had 
      contacted had done.  I agree with him.  It was a natural progression to 
      expand from the HP 3000 Classic to the HP 3000 XL market and then on to 
      the HP 9000 (HP Unix) market place and then to other Unix market places.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>….</span></p>
    <p>[80] …. As I have already stated in these reasons if Duncombe had been 
      in the market with a classic monitor he could have migrated his Assess first 
      to XL and later to Unix.  The injunction kept him out of the classic market; 
      and so because he had no reputation with a classic monitor he was kept out 
      of the XL and Unix markets.</p>
    <p>[81] But the injunction itself prevented migration of Assess to XL and 
      Unix computers.  If Assess/3000 was enjoined because it was copied from 
      Sysview, then to use Assess as the model for an XL or Unix monitor would 
      violate the spirit of, if not the letter of the injunction.  Eighty percent 
      of Assess as created by Duncombe could have been used virtually unchanged 
      to create an XL monitoring programme.  But surely the XL programme so created 
      would still be a copy of Sysview.  A copy of the copy though working on 
      a different computer would still be a copy of Sysview.  The same applies 
      to a Unix monitor.</p>

  </span></span> In support of a submission that the injunction did not keep Duncombe 
  out of the Unix market, Carolian referred to evidence that in 1990 Duncombe 
  became a shareholder in a company, Strategic Systems Inc., to develop performance 
  software for the Unix systems but in 1991 dropped out of Strategic Systems Inc. 
  and offered to sell his shares.  This, Carolian submits, shows that it was not 
  the injunction that kept Duncombe out of the Unix market.  I think that the 
  trial judge’s finding on this submission, that he accepted that Duncombe did 
  not have the time or the money to continue in the Strategic Systems Group project, 
  is reasonable.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[96] Duncombe’s inability to continue with the Unix project is no reason 
      for concluding that Duncombe running a thriving utility software business 
      would fail to enter the Unix market.  Rather, it is inconceivable that he 
      would not enter it.  To fail to stay abreast of changes in computer technology, 
      would be to destroy his business.</p>

  </span></span> Carolian submits that this shows that the injunction order of 
  Fitzpatrick J., as extended by subsequent orders, did not exclude the defendants 
  from the HL market and that Mr. Duncombe knew this.  There are several answers 
  to this, not the least of which is that the wording of the quoted order is not 
  at all clear on the point.</p>

  </span></span> The major answer is that the Probe 3000 XL product had been designed 
  by a Mr. Apgood.  Mr. Duncombe had nothing to do with this.  Carolian’s allegation 
  was that Mr. Duncombe had assisted Mr. Apgood to “transform down” the Probe 
  3000 XL product to create Probe 3000 using his knowledge of the Sysview 3000 
  product.  On this evidence, it is understandable that the December 11, 1989 
  order would not, if such be the case, enjoin the defendants from entering the 
  XL market.</p>

  With respect to forseeability, there was evidence that both the XL and Unix 
  computers were “on the cards” in 1986 and that this was known to Duncombe and, 
  if it was not known to Carolian, it reasonably should have been.  The trial 
  judge said: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[59] In my view, the undertaking as to damages must relate to those damages 
      that were reasonably foreseeable on March 29, 1989, and not just on February 
      3, 1987.  I add, however, that in my view, Carolian should have foreseen 
      on February 3, 1987 the injunction would keep Duncombe out of the XL and 
      Unix markets as well as the Classic HP 3000 market.  I will return to this 
      point later.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge made these findings:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[86] It is not possible that what was known and obvious 
      to Duncombe was unknown to Carolian.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>….</span></p>
    <p>[88] Carolian then knew of Hewlett Packard’s plan in 1986 for what became 
      known as the HP 3000 XL when the same was released by it in volume in 1988-89.  
      It knew that any vendor of a performance monitor selling to the HP 3000 
      Classic market would need, in order to keep its share of the Hewlett Packard 
      market, to port its monitor to the new computer.  That is exactly what Carolian 
      attempted to do when the XL computer was released.  ….</p>
    <p>[89] Porting or migrating a HP 3000 Classic monitor to the XL and Unix 
      computers was not just a matter of choice for a performance monitor vendor.  
      It was something that had to be done to stay in the performance monitor 
      business.</p>
    <p>[90] Carolian knew on February 3, 1987 that Duncombe, if not enjoined, 
      would of necessity, port Assess 3000 to the XL computer and any other computers 
      that Hewlett Packard introduced in numbers.  Carolian also knew for the 
      reasons I have already given that the injunction and the effects of the 
      injunction would prevent him from entering the XL and Unix markets with 
      Assess.  The injunction not only meant the demise of Assess, it also killed 
      what would have been the natural progression of Assess into the XL and Unix 
      markets and this was clearly foreseeable.  Loss from being kept out of the 
      XL and Unix markets was the inevitable result of the injunction and flowed 
      naturally, indeed necessarily from the injunction.</p>

  The third objection to the assessment of damages is to the quantification of 
  the defendants’ loss.  This is entirely a matter of the exercise of judgment 
  on the evidence called.  There were many aspects of Mr. Rostant’s evidence that 
  were challenged by Carolian and the trial judge gave consideration to each of 
  these challenges (paragraphs 97 to 161).  They were along the following lines:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The share of the HP 3000 
      Classic and XL performance monitoring market and the number of sales of 
      Assess to that market that Rostant projected Duncombe would have captured 
      was unrealistically high.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In calculating the projected 
      revenue, Mr. Rostant assumed too high a selling price for Assess.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Mr. Duncombe did not have

      Rostant.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Any loss projected by Mr. 
      Rostant because consulting and training fees were not earned should be ignored 
      because the injunction did not prevent such fees being earned.</span></p>

      </span></span> Mr. Rostant’s projected earnings of Triolet’s pre-tax profit 
      rate of 16% was excessively generous.  It should be closer to 4.4%.</p>
    <p> <span

      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It was inappropriate to undertake 
      a future valuation calculation, even if damages were to be awarded for lost 
      XL or Unix profits.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The rate of return relating 
      to the value of Triolet on April 30, 1997 should have been 18% rather than 
      the 8.4% after tax rate of return used by Mr. Rostant.</span></p>

  As I have said, the trial judge gave full reasons in his consideration of each 
  of these objections.  I will not set them forth beyond that part which relates 
  to the second last mentioned objection, (g), respecting the inappropriateness 
  of undertaking a future value calculation.  It is:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[155] … It is likely but for the injunction, that Duncombe would have had 
      on April 30, 1997 a thriving business that would be saleable, or that he 
      could have continued to operate with the reasonable expectation that it 
      was likely to continue to prosper.  Duncombe should be compensated because 
      he did not have that business.</p>

    <p>It is well settled that a Court of Appeal should not alter a damage award
