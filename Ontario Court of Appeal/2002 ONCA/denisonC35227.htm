  </span></span> Denison and Hydro entered an agreement for the supply of uranium 
  in December 1977 (the “Sale Agreement”).  Article XI of the Sale Agreement contained 
  an arbitration clause.  It is common ground that the wording of that clause 
  precluded any appeal.  It is in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Art. XI.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this agreement or 
      expressly otherwise agreed to by the parties, all disputes arising in connection 
      with this agreement shall be finally settled under the provisions of the 
      <i>Arbitrations Act </i>of Ontario by three arbitrators.  Each of the parties 
      hereto shall appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed 
      shall appoint the third arbitrator.  The proceedings before the arbitrators 
      shall take place in Toronto, Ontario or such other place as the arbitrators 
      may determine.</p>
  </blockquote>

  </span></span> A dispute arose between Denison and Hydro.  Denison alleged breach 
  of the Sale Agreement and claimed that Hydro had failed to pay $12.5 million 
  due under certain invoices.  Denison filed a Notice of Arbitration under the 
  Sale Agreement for this claim.  Hydro admitted the validity of the invoices, 
  but claimed a right of set-off for the entire amount and alleged a conspiracy 
  between Denison and the Toronto Dominion Bank (“TD”) arising from a related 
  tri-partite financing arrangement between Denison, Hydro and TD.  Hydro commenced 
  an action in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) against Denison 
  and TD in respect of its claims.  After the Hydro action was commenced, all 
  three parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute.  They entered a written arbitration 
  agreement dated September 2, 1992 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) staying Hydro’s 
  action and providing the terms for the arbitration.  </p>

  </span></span> The Arbitration Agreement, the terms of which are set out in 
  full in the Appendix to these reasons, did not expressly exclude an appeal.  
  The<i> Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, (the “Act”) came into force 
  after the date of the Sale Agreement but before the date of the Arbitration 
  Agreement.  The Act changed the law respecting rights of appeal.  Section 45 
  (1) provides that where the parties have not by agreement excluded an appeal, 
  one lies with leave on a question of law:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>45.(1)      If the arbitration agreement does not deal with appeals on 
      questions of law, a party may appeal an award to the court on a question 
      of law with leave, which the court shall grant only if it is satisfied that,

  </span></span> The matter proceeded to arbitration and Denison’s claim was dismissed 
  by a majority of the arbitration panel.  Denison then sought leave to appeal 
  pursuant to s. 45(1) of the Act.  On the application for leave to appeal, it 
  was agreed that the application judge would deal first with the issue of jurisdiction 
  to grant leave to appeal.  The application judge found that that arbitration 
  was governed by Article XI of the Sale Agreement precluding an appeal.  She 
  concluded that the Arbitration Agreement did not, on its own, represent the 
  contractual intention of the parties, but that it was more appropriately interpreted 
  as an amendment to the Sale Agreement, made to accommodate TD in the arbitration.  
  She held, accordingly, that she had no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is common ground 
  between the parties that if the arbitration is governed by the terms of the

<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my respectful view, the application judge erred in her interpretation 
  and appreciation of the legal effect of the Arbitration Agreement.  On its face, 
  the Arbitration Agreement is unambiguous.  It is a complete and comprehensive 
  agreement providing for the arbitration of a dispute between the three contracting 
  parties.  If it were nothing more than an amendment to the Sale Agreement, one 
  would expect to find some reference to that earlier document in the recitals 
  or elsewhere in the text of the Arbitration Agreement.  The recitals, however, 
  refer only to Hydro’s action and the agreement of the parties to have that dispute 
  settled by arbitration.  The recitals provide that the dispute between the parties 
  is to be referred to arbitration “on the terms set out below”.  The “terms set 
  out below” make no reference whatsoever to the terms of the Sale Agreement.  
  Clause 6 explicitly distinguishes the tri-partite arbitration to be conducted 
  under its terms from “the previous arbitration between Denison and Hydro pursuant 
  to the Notice of Arbitration delivered by Denison dated February 26, 1992.”  
  While this refers to an earlier arbitration of another dispute between Denison 
  and Hydro, it is significant that the only aspect of the Arbitration Agreement 
  that even remotely refers to the Sale Agreement serves to distance it from the 
  arbitration at issue here.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Arbitration Agreement deals comprehensively with the conduct 
  of the arbitration.  It sets out a different method of appointing the panel 
  from that contemplated by the Sale Agreement.  It provides for the terms of 
  discovery, the jurisdiction of the panel to award costs and interest and even 
  the method of setting down the time and place of the arbitration.  In this respect 
  as well, it bears all the hallmarks of a free-standing agreement rather than 
  an amendment to the Sale Agreement.  </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Perhaps even more significant is the fact that the parties to 
  the Arbitration Agreement are different.  As TD was not a party to the Sale 
  Agreement, it is difficult to see how it could be held to the terms of that 
  agreement precluding any right of appeal.  It would surely be anomalous if one 
  party to a tri-partite agreement had the right to seek leave to appeal under 
  s. 45(1) of the Act, but the other two parties did not.  </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, in the face of the terms of the Arbitration Agreement, 
  Hydro’s assertion that its purpose and effect was “merely to adjust the process 
  to accommodate TD’s presence in the arbitration” is untenable.  It seems to 
  me to be flatly inconsistent with the terms of the agreement TD and the other 
  parties signed. </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Throughout her reasons for judgment, the application judge referred 
  to the Arbitration Agreement as “the Amending Agreement”.  In reaching the conclusion 
  that the Arbitration Agreement merely amended the Sale Agreement, and that the 
  arbitration clause of the Sale Agreement was therefore controlling, the application 
  judge relied on Denison’s pleadings in the arbitration.  In its formal Statement 
  of Position in the arbitration, Denison stated: “This arbitration is brought 
  pursuant to Article XI of the Sale Agreement”.  All of Denison’s documents in 
  the arbitration bore the caption “ARBITRATION UNDER ARTICLE XI OF THE DECEMBER 
  15, 1977 AGREEMENT BETWEEN ONTARIO HYDRO AND DENISON MINES LIMITED”.  </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Denison’s formal pleading in the arbitration does not, in my 
  view, amount to an admission that the Sale Agreement governs.  At the time Denison 
  submitted this document, the issue of the relative status of the Sale Agreement 
  and the Arbitration Agreement had not been raised.  There is nothing to suggest 
  that Denison or the other two parties raised or adverted to the point at issue 
  here and therefore there was nothing for Denison to admit.  Nor is there any 
  evidence that Hydro relied on this aspect of Denison’s pleading or that Hydro 
  took or failed to take any action because of it.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Denison submits that the pleading should not even be considered 
  as it constitutes parole evidence that is inadmissible in the face of the unambiguous 
  terms of the Arbitration Agreement, citing <i>Eli Lilly and Co. v.</i> <i>Novopharm 
  Ltd; Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc. </i>(1998), 161 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>), 
  1 (S.C.C.).  Hydro submits that the pleading should not be excluded as extrinsic 
  or parole evidence, but that it forms part and parcel of the arbitration itself.  
  I do not find it necessary to deal with the issue of admissibility.  Assuming, 
  without deciding, that it is admissible, Denison’s pleading, standing alone 
  and without any other evidence, does not provide an adequate basis to ignore 
  or overcome the very clear language and effect of the Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, this case is distinguishable from<i> Labourers’ International 
  Union of North America, Local 183 v. Carpenters’ and Allied Workers, Local 27</i> 
  (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 472 (C.A.).  In that case, the parties had entered into 
  an arbitration agreement before the date the Act came into force, but the arbitration 
  itself took place after the operative date of the Act.  The arbitration agreement 
  provided that the arbitration would be “final and binding” and was otherwise 
  silent as to appeals.  The applicant argued that since the arbitration agreement 
  was silent on the question of an appeal, it could have recourse to the new s. 
  45(1) and apply for leave to appeal.  This Court rejected that submission, finding 
  that the arbitration agreement had to be interpreted in light of legal regime 
  prevailing at the date it was written.  When the parties entered the agreement, 
  it was not necessary to exclude a right of appeal expressly.  The words “final 
  and binding” indicated an intention to exclude any right of appeal, and the 
  parties could not be expected to have expressly contracted out of a legislative 
  scheme that did not exist when they wrote the agreement.  In the case at bar, 
  the situation is different.  The parties did turn their minds to the terms of 
  the arbitration after the new Act came into effect.  They entered a complete 
  and comprehensive agreement that made no reference to the Sale Agreement or 
  to rights of appeal. In these circumstances, the 1992 Act and the right to seek 
  leave to appeal under s. 45(1) apply.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Section 3 of the current 
  <i>Arbitration Act 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c.17 defers to the intentions of the 
  parties in determining the finality of arbitrations. The intention of Denison 
  and Hydro, as set out in the operative Sale Agreement, was to have arbitral 
  finality. The subsequent September 2, 1992 Tripartite Agreement does not displace 
  this intention. It is merely an agreement to accommodate the participation of 
  the Bank in protecting its contingent interests in the resolution of a dispute 
  between Hydro and Denison under the Sale Agreement.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The dispute arose 
  as a result of Denison’s allegation that Hydro was in breach of its obligations 
  to Denison under the Sale Agreement in making payments to the Bank instead of 
  to Denison. When Hydro suspected - correctly, as Denison conceded at the arbitration 
  - that Denison had devised a scheme to force Hydro, as guarantor, to pay Denison’s 
  debt to the Bank, Hydro prepaid the full guarantee to the Bank and set off the 
  amount of these prepayments against amounts it owed Denison for the final shipments 
  of uranium.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Denison, in response 
  to these deductions of prepayments, delivered Notices of Arbitration to Hydro, 
  alleging that Hydro had breached the Sale Agreement by failing to pay for the 
  uranium deliveries. This is what the arbitration was about - a dispute between 
  Denison and Hydro about whether Hydro had breached the Sale Agreement.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Denison’s position 
  is set out in the numerous Notices of Arbitration it submitted to Hydro. These 
  Notices, as well as Denison’s pleadings in the arbitration, all set out clearly 
  that the arbitration is under Article XI of the Sale Agreement. These pleadings 
  are not extrinsic evidence. They are explicitly mentioned in the first paragraph 
  of the 1992 Tripartite Agreement and are thereby incorporated by reference into 
  that agreement. That paragraph states:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>The parties hereby submit to arbitration at Toronto 
      <u>all issues in respect of the Tripartite Agreement which are raised in 
      the Statement of Claim in the Action, and in the Statements of Position 
      to be filed by the parties on this arbitration</u>, including all claims 
      and defences which properly could be raised under the Rules of Civil Procedure 
      were the matter to proceed by way of action in the Ontario Court (General 
      Division). [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The pleadings are 
  therefore relevant in determining the intentions of the parties. Denison styled 
  its Amended Statement of Position as “Arbitration Under Article XI of the December 
  15, 1977 Agreement Between Ontario Hydro and Denison Mines Limited”. Similarly, 
  the majority of the arbitration panel styled the award: “IN THE MATTER OF AN 
  ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE ONTARIO ARBITRATIONS ACT”, referring to the legislation 
  that governed arbitrations at the time the Sale Agreement was signed, and was 
  designated as binding in Article XI. It is therefore incongruous for Denison 
  to now argue that its declared intention, when it was actually participating 
  in the arbitration, can be retroactively retracted.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This declared intention 
  should be respected as having been genuine at the time, if only because of the 
  undue prejudice that imputing a contrary intention would impose on Hydro. In 
  taking at face value Denison’s representation that the arbitration was under 
  Article XI, Hydro lost the opportunity, prior to embarking on the expense of 
  the arbitration, to address the possibility that its confidence in the finality 
  protected under Article XI might be misplaced.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my view, therefore, 
  the 1992 Tripartite Agreement, on its face, manifests the parties’ intention 
  not to displace the Sale Agreement. In addition, the context in which the 1992 
  Tripartite Agreement was signed also illuminates the intentions of Hydro and 
  Denison at the time as being to preserve the finality agreed to in Article XI 
  of the Sale Agreement. (See <i>Labourers’ International Union of North America, 
  Local 183 v. Carpenters and Allied Workers’ Local 27</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 
  472).</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The issues raised 
  in the Statements of Position all relate to the core dispute between Denison 
  and Hydro under the Sale Agreement. The Statement of Claim by Hydro against 
  the Bank was contingent on the outcome of this central dispute, with Hydro claiming 
  that if it were found liable to Denison under the Sale Agreement, the Bank should 
  correspondingly be found liable to Hydro. Denison asserted no claim against 
  the Bank and the Bank asserted no claim against Denison.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Bank agreed to 
  participate in the arbitration as a party with interests derivative of those 
  of Hydro, and Hydro accordingly abandoned its court action to permit the resolution 
  in one forum of all the issues related to Denison’s Notices of Arbitration. 
  In so doing, Hydro did not abandon, and should not be penalized by being held 
  to have abandoned, its pre-existing rights under the Sale Agreement with Denison. 
  And Denison should not now be permitted to assert that the Bank’s participation 
  in its claim against Hydro nullified its agreement with Hydro that there would 
  be no appeal from an arbitrator without a clear expression that this was the 
  parties’ joint intention.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The procedure in Article 
  XI for selecting the arbitrators necessarily anticipated the participation of 
  only Denison and Hydro and therefore needed revision to accommodate the presence 
  of a third party in the arbitration. It is, in my view, only for the limited 
  purpose of facilitating the presence of the Bank that the 1992 Tripartite Agreement 
  was entered into. It did not change what the arbitration was about: the determination 
  of the respective rights of Denison and Hydro under their Sale Agreement. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The essence of the 
  dispute, as reflected not only in the parties’ Statements of Position, but also 
  in the arbitral award, involved the interpretation of the Sale Agreement, including 
  the Aggregate Advance Payment Provision in Article IV s.8, and the propriety 
  of Hydro’s payments to the Bank under the May 7, 1991 Amending Agreement, s. 
  9 of which provided for the remedy of set-off that Hydro purported to invoke 
  when it made the prepayments to the Bank.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Far from being a free-standing 
  agreement with an independent life of its own, the 1992 Tripartite Agreement 
  is meaningless without reference to the Sale Agreement. The Tripartite Agreement 
  did not change what was at the heart of the dispute. In particular, it did not 
  change the underlying agreement between Hydro and Denison or shift the intentions 
  of the parties, including the intention, as set out in Article XI of the Sale 
  Agreement, that all disputes arising in connection with that agreement be “finally 
  settled” except as “expressly otherwise agreed to by the parties”.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Under Article XI, 
  Hydro and Denison not only expressed their clear intention regarding appeal 
  rights, but also declared that this intention could only be displaced by express 
  language. The 1992 Tripartite Agreement is silent about whether its provisions 
  supercede this provision in Article XI. The parties’ intentions in the Sale 
  Agreement that finality can be amended only by <i>express</i> language, should 
  not be implicitly displaced by the failure in the 1992 Tripartite Agreement 
  to express any intention at all.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In fact, there is nothing in the 1992 Tripartite Agreement to 
  displace the intended finality of any arbitrated disputes between Hydro and 
  Denison as explicitly expressed in the Sale Agreement.  And while I do not have 
  to decide the issue of the Bank’s appeal rights under the 1992 Tripartite Agreement, 
  I would see nothing anomalous or unduly prejudicial in the possibility that 
  the Bank might not be bound to this finality.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This is, in short, 
  an arbitration under the Sale Agreement, which expressed a clear substantive 
  intention concerning the finality of arbitration, an intention that should not 
  be displaced by the ambiguity of a subsequent procedural agreement. The 1992 
  Tripartite Agreement, in my view, does not supercede the intended finality expressed 
  in the Sale Agreement, and is not a rewriting of its core terms and express 
  intentions. It is nothing more than an adjunct to the Sale Agreement designed 
  to facilitate the Bank’s ability to respond to the possibility that its contingent 
  interests could be triggered by the outcome of the arbitrated dispute between 
  Hydro and Denison.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US

  dismiss the appeal with costs.</span></p>

    <p><span style='text-transform:none'><b>RECITALS:</b></span></p>
    <p>A. Whereas Hydro has commenced action no. B175/92 in the Ontario Court 
      (General Division) – Commercial List at Toronto claiming certain relief 
      in respect of an arrangement (“the Tripartite Arrangement”) between the 
      parties.</p>
    <p>B. And whereas the parties have consented to an Order that the Action be 
      stayed and the matters raised therein, and any related matters, be referred 
      to arbitration on the terms set out below.</p>
    <p><b>The parties therefore agree as follows:</b></p>
    <p>1. The parties hereby submit to arbitration at Toronto all issues in respect 
      of the Tripartite Agreement which are raised in the Statement of Claim in 
      the Action, and in the Statements of Position to be filed by the parties 
      on this arbitration, including all claims and defences which properly could 
      be raised under the Rules of Civil Procedure were the matter to proceed 
      by way of action in the Ontario Court (General Division).</p>
    <p>2. (a) It is understood and agreed that the relief sought by Denison in 
      the arbitration is payment by Hydro of the sum of $12,500,000, said by Denison 
      to be owing by Hydro in respect of deliveries of uranium, and that the $12,500,000 
      paid by Hydro to the Bank is not repayable to Hydro.</p>
    <p>(b) It is further understood and agreed that the relief sought by Hydro 
      in the arbitration is an award which will result in Hydro not being obliged 
      to pay the aforesaid sum of $12,500,000, or any part thereof, to Denison 
      unless it is also entitled to recover the same sum from the Bank and is 
      correspondingly released from its undertaking to the Bank.</p>
    <p>(c) It is further understood and agreed that the Bank’s position in the 
      arbitration is that, under no circumstances, is it obliged to return to 
      Hydro all or any portion of the sum of $12,500,000 paid by Hydro to the 
      Bank and applied by the Bank to Denison’s indebtedness under the Nordic 
      Lake Housing Mortgage.</p>
    <p>3. Thus the parties contemplate that the outcome of the arbitration will 
      be one of the following:</p>
    <p>(a) Hydro is required to pay Denison all or part of the sum of $12,500,000 
      and the Bank is required to pay all or part of the sum of $12,500,000 to 
      Hydro;</p>
    <p>(b) Hydro is required to pay Denison all or part of the sum of $12,500,000 
      but is not entitled to any recovery from the Bank; or</p>
    <p>(c) No party is required to make any payment to any other party.</p>
    <p>4. The arbitrators will also have jurisdiction to make awards in respect 
      of interest and prepayment penalties consistent with their award in respect 
      of the aforesaid sum of $12,500,000.</p>
    <p>5. There will be three arbitrators, one appointed jointly by Denison and 
      the Bank, one appointed by Hydro and the third, who shall be the chairperson, 
      appointed by agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, by the 
      other two arbitrators.</p>
    <p>6. The arbitration will be separate from and before an entirely different 
      panel of arbitrators than the previous arbitration between Denison and Hydro 
      pursuant to the Notice of Arbitration delivered by Denison dated February 
      26, 1992.</p>
    <p>7. The parties will make production of documents by way of unsworn lists 
      of documents, the scope of such production to be the same as if these issues 
      were proceeding in an action in the Ontario Court (General Division).</p>
    <p>8. Hydro will be entitled to pre-hearing oral discovery of Denison and 
      the Bank.  Denison and the Bank will be entitled to pre-hearing oral discovery 
      of Hydro.</p>
    <p>9. The arbitration hearing will be conducted at a time and place to be 
      agreed by the parties and the arbitrators and, failing such agreement, to 
      be determined by the arbitrators.</p>
    <p>10. The Action will be dismissed on consent without costs and there will 
      be no costs of the motions of Denison and the Bank returnable on September 
      2, 1992.</p>
    <p>11. The costs of the arbitration will be in the discretion of the arbitrators.  
      Until the disposition of costs by the arbitrators, Denison and the Bank 
      will pay the fees and disbursements of the arbitrator nominated by them, 
      Hydro will pay the fees and disbursements of the arbitrator nominated by 
      it, and Denison and the Bank, on the one hand, and Hydro, on the other hand, 
      will each pay fifty percent of the fees and disbursements of the chairperson.</p>
