<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Bruno Cavion dated May 27, 1999.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: December 12, 2002</p>
<p>ABELLA and MACPHERSON JJ.A.:</p>    <P>
  [1] While the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in imposing a lifetime 
  ban under s. 109 rather than s. 100(1) (the then operative section of the Criminal 
  Code), the trial judge purported to act under s. 100(1) and we see no basis 
  to impute a jurisdictional error to him simply because the technical form of 
  the order is headed &quot;s. 109&quot;. </p>    <P>
  [2] The remaining issue, therefore, is whether under s. 100(1) the trial judge 
  was entitled to impose the lifetime ban sought by the Crown - and not disputed 
  by defence counsel at trial. In our view, the arson offence in this case fell 
  within s. 100(1) on the bases of the conduct involved and the threat of violence. 
  Given the clear animus against the MNR by the appellant, his expressed threatening 
  views towards and about the people who worked there, and his possession of firearms 
  and explosives notwithstanding the existence of a prohibition order, we are 
  satisfied that the act of arson should be seen as, at the very least, threatening 
  the use of violence. </p>    <P>
  [3] Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>    
<P> &quot;R.S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;J.C. MacPherson J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>GOUDGE J.A. (Dissenting):</p>    <P>
  [4] I agree with my colleagues that this case should be approached on the basis 
  that the trial judge imposed the ban under s. 100. However, respectfully, I 
  differ from my colleagues as to the applicability of that section. I do not 
  think that section was open to the trial judge in this case. The trial judge 
  did not elaborate on how the preconditions for s. 100 were met here, and I do 
  not think it would have been reasonable for him to conclude beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the two acts of arson here constituted a threat of violence against 
  MNR employees, particularly given the location and the circumstances of the 
  arson. In my view, the appeal as to sentence should be allowed, this order set 
  aside, and the 10 year ban imposed as conceded by the appellant.</p>
