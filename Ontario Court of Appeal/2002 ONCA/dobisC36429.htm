<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Walter S.

<h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>MACPHERSON J.A.:</span></h4>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.            <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principal issue in this Crown appeal is the appropriateness of a 
  conditional sentence for a large scale fraud and theft involving over $2,000,000 
  committed by a senior and trusted employee of a mid-size family company.  A 
  secondary issue is whether leave to appeal the sentence should be granted when 
  part of the transcript of the sentence hearing is missing due to a malfunctioning 
  of the recording equipment.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            <u>FACTS</u></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent, Mark Dobis (“Dobis”), pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 
  and theft over $5000 relating to money he misappropriated from a company where 
  he was employed as its accounting manager.  The trial judge imposed a sentence 
  of two years less a day to be served in the community, plus probation for 18 
  months and a restoration order for $286,636.50.  The Crown appeals this sentence.  
  It seeks the imposition of a penitentiary sentence or, in the alternative, variation 
  of the conditional sentence to a custodial sentence of the same duration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The facts can be briefly stated.  Electro Canada Limited (“Electro Canada”) 
  is a Toronto-based company which manufactures electrical wiring assemblies for 
  appliances and automobile computers.  Craig Christie (“Christie”) bought the 
  company in 1979 when it had 20 employees.  For the next few years, he and his 
  wife worked hard at the company.  By 1998, there were over 250 employees.  In 
  the same year, the company opened a second factory in Mexico in order to maintain 
  its competitiveness in the NAFTA regime.  In addition, Christie was nominated 
  for the Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 1994 and the Ontario Ministry of Economic 
  Development, Trade and Tourism designated Electro Canada an “Innovative Growth 
  Firm” in 1997.  By 1998, the year in which the fraud came to light, Christie 
  described his company in these terms: “By then, Electro Canada and I were one 
  in the same, the Company was my identity, my financial security, my vocation 
  and my avocation” (Victim Impact Statement, p.1).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dobis joined Electro Canada as a payroll clerk in 1993 when he was 30 
  years old.  In February 1994, he temporarily assumed the position of accounting 
  manager.  Within a month, the company promoted him to that position on a permanent 
  basis.  As accounting manager, Dobis was responsible for preparing the payroll, 
  accounts receivable and accounts payable, and maintaining the company books.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Just 10 months after becoming accounting manager, Dobis commenced his 
  dishonest conduct.  Between January 30, 1995 and December 24, 1997, Dobis wrote 
  21 company cheques made payable to himself, his corporation or his stock brokerage 
  accounts.  On each cheque, he forged Christie’s signature because Christie was 
  the only person in the company with signing authority.  The amounts of the 21 
  cheques ranged from $7500 to $24,530.75.  In 1995, Dobis took about $25,000, 
  in 1996 about $128,000, and in 1997 about $133,000.  The total amount stolen 
  was $286,636.50.  These transactions formed the basis of the theft charge to 
  which Dobis pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In 1997, Dobis became involved in a different and much more serious 
  (at least financially) dishonest scheme.  A fellow employee received a letter 
  from “Dr. Ukah Dyke”, a person claiming to be “a senior civil servant with the 
  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation”.  In the letter, Dr. Dyke claimed that 
  government contracts in Nigeria had been deliberately overestimated and that 
  he was looking for foreign accounts through which to channel proceeds of more 
  than U.S. $35 million.  The letter promised a 30 per cent share of these proceeds 
  to the person who assisted with the transfer of the funds into a foreign account.  
  Dobis’ fellow employee brought the letter to his attention and Dobis decided 
  to participate, telling the fellow employee that he had a ‘dummy’ account he 
  could use.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Nigerian letter was a complete scam; indeed, it was probably one 
  of the largest frauds of the 1990s, with many victims in several countries.  
  Once Dobis agreed to participate, the fraudsters managed to persuade him that 
  the money was close to being released, but that first he needed to pay for a 
  particular service to assist in the transfer process.  From October 27, 1997 
  to March 27, 1998, on six different occasions Dobis sent a total of about $1.9 
  million to banks in Germany and the United States to pay for these services, 
  including ‘chemical decoding of cash funds’, insurance bonds, and bail for a 
  fellow participant who had been detained in Germany.  All, or virtually all 
  (Dobis claimed that the initial U.S. $25,000 was his own money; however, this 
  expenditure overlapped with the period when he was depositing some of the 21 
  company cheques into his own accounts) of this money came from Electro Canada 
  coffers.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dobis received no money from the Nigerian letter scam.  By the spring 
  of 1998, Dobis knew that his misappropriations were creating severe consequences 
  for Electro Canada’s operating line of credit.  A meeting between the company 
  and its banker, CIBC, was scheduled for April 8, 1998.  On the morning of that 
  day, Dobis went to Christie and said “we have a problem”.  He admitted his fraudulent 
  activities during the previous six months.  He was fired.  The six transactions 
  relating to the Nigerian letter scam formed the basis of the fraud charge to 
  which Dobis pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge accepted Dobis’ plea of guilty to two charges of fraud 
  and theft over $5000 on July 6, 2000.  For several reasons, including a change 
  in counsel for Dobis and difficulties in obtaining some material, the sentence 
  was not imposed until May&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2001.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge reviewed the circumstances 
  of the offences.  He stated that Dobis was “in a trust position and in control 
  of the company’s financial life”.  He recorded that the “fraud and theft were 
  over a period of over three years” and totalled more than $2,000,000.  He indicated 
  that because of the loss “the operation of the company and the well-being of 
  its employees were put at extreme risk”.  He described Dobis’ motivation for 
  his conduct in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The offender used the initial theft to pay for his personal expenses and 
      losses.  The larger amount was alleged to have been used to participate 
      in a “Nigerian” fraud, wherein, for the accused’s monetary involvement, 
      he was to receive a substantial amount of money from persons in Nigeria, 
      who had possession of stolen government funds.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also reviewed Dobis’ personal circumstances, including 
  his status as a first offender, his simple lifestyle and limited job prospects, 
  and the strong support of his family.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge concluded his reasons as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon reading the authorities furnished and taking into consideration all 
      the factors to which I have referred, an appropriate sentence in this matter 
      will be two years, less one day, which sentence shall be served in the community.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>After imposing this sentence, the trial 
  judge made a final comment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The only thing saving you from a penitentiary sentence, sir, is your past 
      lack of court involvement.  As I said, the effect on the company was absolutely 
      horrific.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown appeals the sentence on two grounds:  first, the trial judge 
  erred by overemphasizing the fact that the respondent had no prior criminal 
  record; and, second, the sentence was manifestly unfit.  The respondent addresses 
  these issues and raises an additional issue, namely, whether leave to appeal 
  should be refused because part of the transcript of the sentence hearing is 
  missing due to a malfunctioning of the recording equipment.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal raises three issues, which I find it convenient to consider 
  in this order:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      unfit in the circumstances of the case?</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span

  </span> The trial proceeded by way of guilty pleas to two charges on July 6, 
  2000.  The sentence component of the trial commenced on December 11, 2000 and 
  continued on January 11 and February 28, 2001.  The discussion on the first 
  two dates was largely about the material that was being submitted by both parties.  
  On January 11, Crown counsel indicated that he would want to cross-examine Dobis 
  on some of the material he had filed.  On February 28, there was a consent adjournment 
  to May 8, 2001.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On May 8, the sentence hearing proceeded.  The 28-page transcript begins 
  with this note:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>REPORTER’S NOTE:  At the outset of the proceedings the recording equipment 
      malfunctioned for the entire tape and all record at this particular point 
      was lost, but did begin recording when the equipment switched to the second 
      tape.  Therefore, the evidence given by the accused is not available.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The transcript then records the submissions 
  of both counsel and the trial judge’s reasons for sentence.  What is missing 
  is the testimony of the respondent, which apparently consisted of cross-examination 
  by Crown counsel on two documents (not affidavits) prepared by Dobis and filed 
  with the court: a six-page document dated April 20, 1998 entitled <i>Memorandum 
  - chronological events June 1997 to April 1998 M. Dobis</i>, and a three-page 
  document dated December 5, 2000 entitled <i>To: All persons having knowledge 
  in the matter of Mark Dobis and Electro Canada</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent submits that the appeal has not been properly perfected 
  in accordance with Rule 8 of the <i>Criminal Appeal Rules</i>, which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>8(11) </b>In respect of an appeal as to sentence only,</p>
    <p> <b>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></b> where 
      there was a plea of guilty at the opening of the trial before any evidence 
      was taken, <i>the transcript shall include the entire hearing before the 
      court including</i>,</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <i>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent contends that not all of the transcript at the sentence 
  hearing is before this court.  He is correct.  However, the reason for the omission 
  is an accident – the recording equipment failed.  In my view, Rule 8 must be 
  interpreted to make an allowance for this unusual situation.  If an allowance 
  were not made, the strict application of the rule might work great injustice.  
  For example, the logic of the respondent’s argument would mean that in this 
  case, if he had been given a sentence he wanted to appeal, he would not have 
  been able to do so, and through no fault of his own.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the proper approach to the problem of a missing transcript 
  in a criminal trial can be found in <i>R. v. Hayes</i> (1998), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 
  161 (S.C.C.).  In that case, a murder appeal, a malfunctioning of the recording 
  equipment at the trial meant that part of the trial judge’s charge to the jury 
  was not available for the appeal.  Section 609(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  (now, as amended,  s. 682(2)) was quite similar to Rule 8 of the <i>Criminal 
  Appeal Rules</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>609(2) </b>A copy or transcript of</p>

      <blockquote>

  </span> L’Heureux-Dubé J. interpreted this provision in this fashion, at p. 
  165:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in a transcript.  As a general 
      rule, there must be a serious possibility that there was an error in the 
      missing portion of the transcript, or that the omission deprived the appellant 
      of a ground of appeal.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By parity of reasoning, a new sentence hearing need not be ordered for 
  every gap in a transcript, especially where, as in <i>Hayes</i> and in this 
  appeal, the gap is accidental.  Nor should an appeal court refuse outright to 
  hear an appeal solely because of a missing transcript.  The question should 
  be:  is the respondent prejudiced on this appeal because of the missing transcript?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I think the respondent is not prejudiced.  In my view, for several reasons, 
  there is no “serious possibility” that the missing transcript is necessary for 
  a just resolution of the appeal.  First, the respondent filed two comprehensive 
  documents dealing with the chronology and details of his crimes and with his 
  personal situation and feelings, including his “deep regret for the result of 
  my actions”.  For purposes of the appeal, the respondent’s statements in these 
  documents, unchallenged by the missing cross-examination, will serve as his 
  description and explanation.  Second, the trial judge said nothing in his reasons 
  for sentence about anything the respondent said in his testimony at the hearing.  
  Third, the respondent knows what he said in his testimony.  If he truly had 
  a concern about the relevance of the testimony to this appeal, he could have 
  sought to place it before this court by way of an affidavit (by himself or trial 
  counsel) tendered as fresh evidence.  Since the transcript is missing only by 
  reason of accident, it is highly unlikely that the Crown would have objected 
  to, or this court refused, admission of the fresh evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, there is no basis on which to refuse leave to appeal because 
  of the missing transcript.  What is missing prejudices neither party.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, I proceed to a consideration of the appeal on its merits.  
  I do so with the knowledge that the Supreme Court of Canada has strongly cautioned 
  appellate courts to show substantial deference to the sentences imposed by trial 
  judges, including conditional sentences:  see <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995), 
  102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), and <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 
  449 (S.C.C.).  However, interference with a sentence is warranted if the trial 
  judge has committed an error in principle, failed to consider or overemphasized 
  a relevant factor, or if the sentence is demonstrably unfit:  see <i>R. v. M.(C.A.)</i> 
  (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.).  The Crown contends that the trial judge 
  overemphasized a single factor in his reasons for sentence.  The Crown also 
  submits that the sentence imposed on the respondent was demonstrably unfit.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown submits that the trial judge committed an error in principle 
  by overemphasizing the fact that Dobis had no prior record before being convicted 
  of fraud and theft in this case.  The Crown contends that this factor should 
  be given little weight in a fraud case because it is the offender’s good reputation 
  in the community, including the absence of a criminal record, that enables the 
  offender to get into a position to commit the fraud:  see <i>R. v. Foran</i>, 
  [1970] 1 C.C.C. 336 at 337 (Ont. C.A.), and <i>R. v. Bunn</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 505 at 522, per Bastarache J. (dissenting) (S.C.C.).  Finally, the Crown 
  contends that the trial judge’s overemphasis of the factor of no prior criminal 
  record is manifest in the trial judge’s reasons, especially his concluding remark 
  to the accused <i>after</i> he had imposed a conditional sentence:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The only thing saving you from a penitentiary sentence, sir, is your past 
      lack of court involvement.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree with the Crown’s submissions on this point.  In my view, 
  the trial judge’s final remark was in the nature of a parting comment to the 
  accused as the proceedings ended.  It is the type of comment that a judge will 
  often make to an accused at the conclusion of a sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons for sentence indicates 
  that he carefully considered the full range of factors that a judge should consider 
  before imposing a sentence.  He discussed the circumstances of the offences 
  and of the offender and considered the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> and case authorities.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon reading the authorities furnished and <i>taking into consideration 
      all the factors to which I have referred</i>, an appropriate sentence in 
      this matter will be two years, less one day, which sentence shall be served 
      in the community. [Emphasis added.]</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, an offender’s prior criminal record, or the absence thereof, 
  is <i>always</i> a factor entitled to <i>some</i> weight in a sentencing context.  
  In my view, the trial judge neither ignored nor attached too much weight to 
  this factor when he imposed sentence on the respondent.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown contends that the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly 
  unfit in two respects – its length and its form.  The Crown submits that the 
  trial judge erred by not sentencing the respondent to a penitentiary term.  
  In the alternative, the Crown submits that if a reformatory sentence was appropriate, 
  the trial judge erred by permitting the respondent to serve the sentence in 
  the community.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issues of length and form of sentence overlap to a certain extent 
  under the conditional sentence provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.   As 
  explained by Lamer C.J.C. in <i>Proulx, supra</i>, at p. 479:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[A] purposive interpretation of s.&nbsp;742.1(a) does not dictate a rigid 
      two-step approach in which the judge would first have to impose a term of 
      imprisonment of a <i>fixed</i> duration and then decide if that fixed term 
      of imprisonment can be served in the community.  In my view, the requirement 
      that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years 
      can be fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate range 
      of available sentences.  Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the 
      judge to proceed in two stages.  However, the judge need not impose a term 
      of imprisonment of a <i>fixed</i> duration at the first stage of the analysis.  
      Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has to exclude two possibilities: 
      (a) probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term.  If either of these 
      sentences is appropriate, then a conditional sentence should not be imposed.   
      [Emphasis is Lamer C.J.C.’s.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Applying this analysis, the first question to be addressed is whether 
  the trial judge erred by not imposing a penitentiary sentence on the respondent.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The circumstances surrounding the offences committed by the respondent 
  establish that his conduct and its consequences were particularly serious.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dobis was an employee in a position of trust with Electro Canada.  He 
  commenced stealing from the company less than a year after being made accounting 
  manager.  His thefts and fraud continued for more than three years.  His dishonest 
  conduct consisted of two different components – direct thefts for deposit into 
  his personal accounts and thefts to participate in a ‘get rich’ scheme with 
  an eye to reaping more than U.S. $10 million.  The amount stolen under both 
  schemes was very large – about $286,000 and $1.9 million respectively.  There 
  was a good deal of planning, skill and deception required to execute such a 
  massive theft and fraud over such a long period of time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The victims of the crimes suffered terribly.  The company was crippled; 
  its survival, including the jobs of 250 people, is still in jeopardy.  Moreover, 
  the long-term goals of the family owners of the company have been rendered fragile.  
  As expressed by Craig Christie in his Victim Impact Statement:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>. . . I bought Electro Canada Limited, a small electrical products manufacturing 
      company with 20 employees, in 1979.  </p>
    <p>For the next twenty years, my wife and I diligently worked long hours, 
      lived modestly and managed the Company conservatively, virtually debt free, 
      reinvesting all of the profits in the Company, in order to grow Electro 
      Canada, which was to provide our retirement pension and an inheritance for 
      our six children.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this was put in doubt, and remains in doubt today, because of the respondent’s 
  crimes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, at least from Dobis’ perspective, there was a second intended 
  victim of the Nigerian letter scam – the Government and people of Nigeria.  
  If the scheme had been a real one, U.S. $35 million would have been removed 
  from Nigeria and its people and Dobis would have pocketed more than U.S. $10 
  million.  Put bluntly, in Dobis’ eyes the scheme coupled greed (his) and misery 
  (Nigeria’s) on a massive scale, even though the intended international component 
  of the fraud never came to fruition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this description of the circumstances surrounding the respondent’s 
  offences required the imposition of a penitentiary sentence, as the Crown had 
  contended when it sought a sentence in the 3-5 year range.  Most of the factors 
  I have described have been held by this court to require a penitentiary sentence:  
  see, for example, <i> R. v. Scherer</i> (1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 30 (7 years); 
  <i> R. v. Holden</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 3481 (6 years); <i> R. v. Villanueva</i>, 
  [1999] O.J. No. 4939 (6 years); <i> R. v. Montemurro</i> (Unreported, June 21, 
  1984) (6 years); <i> R. v. Bertram and Wood</i> (1990), 40 O.A.C. 317 (6 years); 
  <i> R. v. Nichols, </i>(2001), 46 C.R. (5th) 294 (4 years); <i> R. v. Gray</i> 
  (1995), 76 O.A.C. 387 (2 ½ years and 2 years less a day for two accused); and 
  <i> R. v. Ruhland</i> (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (3 years and 2 years less 
  a day for two accused).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are fraud cases in which a reformatory sentence has been upheld 
  or imposed by this court.  However, in my view, each of those cases had important 
  mitigating or differentiating factors which are not present in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>R. v. McEachern</i> (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 189 (Ont. C.A.), a 
  bank manager stole $87,000 (not millions).  He was married and had two children.  
  He received a suspended sentence at trial.  When the appeal hearing took place, 
  the family was expecting a third child.  Nevertheless, the court allowed the 
  appeal and increased the sentence to 18 months in custody.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i> R. v. Pierce</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (Ont. C.A.), a woman 
  defrauded her employer of $270,000.  She received a sentence of 21 months.  
  On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 12 months, with the court taking note 
  of her personal circumstances (she was the mother of three small children).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>R. v. Underys</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 4372, this court upheld a conditional 
  sentence of 18 months for a manager who stole more than $1,000,000 from a credit 
  union.  However, the issue on the appeal in that case was the appropriateness 
  of a conditional sentence; the court’s endorsement began: “The Crown at trial 
  did not take issue with the sentence of eighteen months” (para. 1).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am not unsympathetic to the personal circumstances of the respondent.  
  These were his first criminal offences.  He is university educated and is living 
  a simple lifestyle.  His job prospects are probably limited.  There is no suggestion 
  that he has hidden any of the money he obtained by defrauding and stealing from 
  Electro Canada.  Although he does not have children to support, he does have 
  a partner and the strong support of his parents and brother.  His mother, in 
  particular, depends on him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, in the end I am persuaded that the serious nature and consequences 
  of the offences committed by the respondent required the imposition of a penitentiary 
  sentence.  There is a real need to emphasize denunciation and, especially, general 
  deterrence in the realm of large scale frauds committed by persons in positions 
  of trust with devastating consequences for their victims, which is how I would 
  characterize the offences in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>McEachern, supra</i>, Howland C.J.O. stated that “the most important 
  principle in sentencing a person who holds a position of trust is that of general 
  deterrence” (p. 191).</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The sentences in such cases are not really concerned with rehabilitation.  
      Instead, they are concerned with general deterrence and with warning such

      with them and their probable financial ruin.</p>

  “general deterrence as the paramount consideration” (para. 2) in large scale 
  fraud cases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with all of these statements.  Accordingly, general deterrence 
  needed to be central to the trial judge’s sentence in this case.  In my view, 
  the nature and consequences of the theft and fraud committed by the respondent, 
  which were fully and well-described by the trial judge in his reasons, required 
  a penitentiary sentence, probably in the range suggested by the Crown at trial, 
  namely, three to five years.</p>

  </span> It is clear that no category of offence is excluded from the conditional 
  sentence regime:  see <i>Proulx, supra</i>, at p. 501.  Specifically, a conditional 
  sentence is a possible sentence in a fraud case, even with respect to a large 
  scale fraud:  see <i>Bunn, supra</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, it is also clear that certain offences will usually lead to 
  custodial sentences.  As expressed by Lamer C.J.C. in <i>Proulx</i>, at p. 494:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]here may be circumstances in which the need for deterrence will warrant

  the sentencing process in cases involving large scale frauds with serious consequences 
  for the victims:  see: <i>McEachern, Bertram and Wood, Gray </i>and<i> Holden, 
  supra</i>.  Importantly, the court has said the same thing since the introduction 
  of the conditional sentencing regime.  Conditional sentences have been rejected 
  in large scale fraud cases such as <i>Pierce, supra</i>, and <i>Ruhland, supra</i>,

    the refusal to impose a conditional sentence, should be reserved for those 
    offences that are likely to be affected by a general deterrent effect.<span>  
    </span><i>Large scale well-planned fraud by persons in positions of<span>  
    </span>trust</i>, such as the accused in <i>R. v. Pierce</i>, would seem to 
    be one of those offences.<span>    </span>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent abused a position of trust in relation to a victim, his 
  employer.  He committed a large scale well-planned fraud.  Moreover, there are 
  none of the extreme personal mitigating circumstances that were central to the 
  decisions to impose conditional sentences in two large scale fraud cases, <i>Underys, 
  supra</i>, (“the many mitigating circumstances of the offender”: para. 4), and 
  <i>Bunn, supra</i>, (“The respondent was the sole provider and caregiver for 
  both his wife, who suffered from multiple sclerosis and had been confined to 
  a wheelchair for years, and their teenage daughter”: p. 517).  Accordingly, 
  the imposition of a conditional sentence in the circumstances of this case was 
  also manifestly unfit.</p>

  </span> I would grant leave to appeal the sentence and allow the appeal from 
  sentence.  An appropriate sentence at the trial would have been, at a minimum, 
  at the lowest point in the range suggested by the Crown, namely, three years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the respondent has served 9½ months of his conditional sentence.  
  I would give him full credit for this in light of the fact that the conditions 
  imposed by the trial judge for the first 12 months of the conditional sentence 
  almost amounted to house arrest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the circumstances of this case, I would make a modest adjustment 
  in the sentence to be imposed so that  the respondent can serve  the remainder 
  of  the sentence in a reformatory setting.  I would impose a custodial sentence 
  of two years less a day, to commence on the day the respondent surrenders into 
  custody.</p>
