    <p><span lang=EN-US>In my view this case is not one of the worst offender;

      a child, it was not premeditated; but it comes very close to being in that 
      group of offences that warrants a maximum sentence.<span>  </span>It comes 
      so very close in my view because of the tragic impact on Kenneth Deming 
      and on those who love him, because it was a brutal attack on a generous 
      friend, because Mr. Dunn left his friend with complete disregard for his 
      condition.<span>  </span></span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant and respondent agree that the 
  harmful consequences that flow from a criminal act are a pertinent consideration 
  on sentencing.<span>  </span>As stated by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. DeSousa 
  </i>(1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 124 at 141:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Conduct may fortuitously result in more or less serious 
      consequences depending on the circumstances in which the circumstances arise.<span>  
      </span>The same act of assault may injure one person but not another.<span>  
      </span>The implicit rationale of the law in this area is that it is acceptable 
      to distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally reprehensible 
      acts on the basis of the harm that is actually caused.<span>  </span>This 
      is reflected in the creation of higher maximum penalties for offences with 
      more serious consequences.<span>  </span>Courts and legislators acknowledge 
      the harm actually caused by concluding that in otherwise equal cases a more 
      serious consequence will dictate a more serious response. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant submits, however, that the trial 
  judge erred in principle by allowing the consequences of the appellant’s conduct 
  to dominate the sentencing resulting in a sentence that was outside the appropriate 
  range.<span>  </span>I would disagree.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The passage quoted above indicates that, in 
  addition to the consequences of the assault on the victim, the trial judge considered 
  the following other factors as contributing to the gravity of the offence:<span>  
  </span>1) the brutality of the attack; 2) the fact that the person attacked 
  was a “generous friend” of the appellant; and 3) the callousness of the appellant 
  in leaving his friend in such a serious condition. After beating up Ken Deming 
  in his own home, the fact that the appellant left his friend without medical 
  help was, together with the severity, number and location of the blows, closely 
  linked to the brain damage Ken Deming suffered.<span>  </span>It is a factor 
  that increases the moral culpability of the offender’s conduct.<span>  </span>Although 
  the appellant was intoxicated at the time, the trial judge found that the appellant 
  “knew what he was doing” and explicitly rejected the appellant’s evidence that 
  he was unable to remember the events of the night due to his intoxication.<span>  
  </span>Violence occurring while under the influence of alcohol is not usually 
  a mitigating factor:<span>  </span><i>R. v. Dennis</i>,<i> </i>[1993] M.J. No. 
  104 at 2 (C.A.).<span>  </span>The trial judge was entitled to place significant 
  weight upon the consequences of the appellant’s actions and he did not give 
  it undue weight.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The next issue is whether the sentence is outside 
  the appropriate range having regard to the length of pre-trial custody.<span>  
  </span>In her reasons for sentence, the trial judge carefully and thoroughly 
  considered all of the relevant sentencing principles, including the possibility 
  of the appellant’s rehabilitation.<span>  </span>In reaching her decision, the 
  trial judge expressly took into account the fact that the appellant had testified 
  that he wanted to turn his life around, had acquired his grade 12 diploma while 
  in pre-trial custody, was willing to attend counselling, and had expressed remorse 
  to the victim’s family during the sentencing hearing.<span>  </span>She recognized 
  the fact that the appellant’s childhood had been “terrible,” that there had 
  been violence in his family due to his abusive father, and that the appellant 
  had lacked “nurturing, support and guidance” in his childhood.<span>  </span>She 
  considered that the appellant could be rehabilitated, and that he now had several 
  supportive people in his life.<span>  </span>The trial judge also took into 
  account the need for denunciation and general deterrence of the type of conduct 
  that had been demonstrated by the appellant, and the need for specific deterrence 
  evidenced by the fact that the appellant’s 1996 sentence for an offence of violence 
  “failed to inspire Mr. Dunn to turn his life around.”<span>  </span>The reasons 
  of the trial judge disclose no error in principle.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant has cited a number of cases in 
  his factum wherein for similar injuries or death, sentences of six to eight 
  years were imposed.<span>  </span>The maximum sentence of 14 years was, however, 
  imposed in <i>R. v. Opsitnik</i> (1986), 13 O.A.C. 50 (C.A.).<span>  </span>In 
  that case the victim suffered extensive injuries (from which he recovered), 
  when he was stabbed five times by the accused upon confronting the accused’s 
  companion about an obscenity shouted in a parking lot.<span>  </span>Each case 
  turns on its own specific facts.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The following cases, however, do have some similarities 
  to the instant case and provide guidance as to the appropriate range of sentence.<span>  
  </span>In <i>R. v. Morrow</i> (1986), 120 O.A.C. 159 (C.A.), this court imposed 
  a sentence of 9 years for aggravated assault upon a 63 year-old woman in her 
  own home.<span>  </span>She had been kind enough to allow a young girl into 
  her home on the pretext of using the telephone to call a taxi.<span>  </span>As 
  the girl left, the accused and another accomplice rushed inside and beat and 
  robbed the victim.<span>  </span>The accused in that case was 19 years old, 
  did not have a lengthy criminal record, and had no prior convictions involving 
  violence.<span>  </span>He pled guilty to the charge of attempted murder.<span>  
  </span>On appeal, however, a conviction for aggravated assault was substituted 
  and the sentence reduced from 12 years to 9.<span>  </span>In <i>R. v. Abfalter</i>, 
  [1986] B.C.J. No. 715 (C.A.), a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment was upheld 
  after the accused, a young man who had been drinking, assaulted the complainant 
  in his own home after he had allegedly made sexual advances towards him, then 
  dumped him in the snow in front of a hospital.<span>  </span>The sentencing 
  judge thought it was a miracle the victim survived.<span>  </span>The victim 
  was left with a permanent partial disability and damage to his left eye.<span>  
  </span>In <i>R. v. Dennis</i>, <i>supra</i>, the accused went to the home of 
  his girlfriend to pick up his belongings.<span>  </span>He was under the influence 
  of alcohol and other drugs at the time.<span>  </span>Another woman and a male 
  friend, whose leg was in a cast, were present.<span>  </span>During the course 
  of the ensuing argument, the accused continued to strike the male victim with 
  a steel pipe even after he lost consciousness, then dragged him out of the house 
  and left him there.<span>  </span>The victim was partially paralyzed as a result 
  of the beating.<span>  </span>The accused had a lengthy criminal record spanning 
  15 years.<span>  </span>He served one year in pre-trial custody.<span>  </span>The 
  trial judge imposed a term of 9 years’ imprisonment, noting that he was taking 
  into account the year of pre-trial incarceration the accused had undergone.<span>  
  </span>The sentence was upheld on appeal.<span>  </span>In these cases, the 
  common elements are that the victims were assaulted in their own homes, suffered 
  serious injury and the perpetrator showed a callous indifference to whether 
  the victim lived or died afterwards. </span></p>
