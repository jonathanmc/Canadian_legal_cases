    the covenantor. Stinson J. ruled that the covenant, being a positive covenant,

    by DCC 123 and a declaration that it was not bound by any of the terms of 
    the Reciprocal Agreement. However, it was conceded at the hearing before Stinson 
    J. and on this appeal that Amberwood, as subsequent owner of the Phase 2 lands 
    who acquired title after the Reciprocal Agreement was registered, was bound 
    by the negative covenants and the easements contained in the Reciprocal Agreement 
    and was entitled to the benefit of the easements over the DCC 123’s Phase 
    1 lands. It was also common ground between the parties that the original parties 
    to the Reciprocal Agreement intended that all covenants should run with the 
    land, including the interim expenses provision. The sole question on the application 
    was whether the covenant to pay interim expenses should be treated differently,

    to pay interim expenses is an affirmative obligation that falls within the 
    definition of a positive covenant. Neither party takes issue with this finding. 
    He also held that it was settled law that obligations of this kind do not 
    run with the land either at law or in equity, despite the contracting parties’ 
    express intentions to the contrary. Hence, a successor in title to the original 
    covenantor is not bound by the terms of any positive covenants contained in 
    the original agreement to which he was not a party.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It was DCC 123’s contention that two of those 
    methods or exceptions to the rule that positive covenants do not run with 
    the land were applicable to this case: first, the benefit and burden doctrine 
    from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. Brizell</i>, [1957] 
    1 All E.R. 371; and second, the conditional grant of easement. It was argued, 
    with respect to the first “exception”, that a person who claims the benefit 
    of a deed must also take it subject to its burdens. It was further argued, 
    with respect to the second “exception”, that where the grant of a benefit 
    or easement in a conveyance of land is conditional on assuming a positive 
    obligation, the obligation is binding on the person who takes the grant. It 
    was DCC 123’s position that, on the facts of this case, Amberwood was bound 
    by the terms of the positive covenant under either exception.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The applications judge agreed with DCC 123’s 
    position. He held that the two methods relied upon by DCC 123 were clearly 
    adopted in English law and that both of those exceptions would apply to the 
    facts of this case. He concluded, however, that, absent legislative reform 
    or endorsement of the English exceptions by an appellate court, he was bound 
    by the principle of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stare decisis</i> 
    to follow the established rule that positive covenants do not run with the 
    land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consequently, he granted Amberwood’s 
    application, declared that it was not bound to pay the interim expenses, and 
    set aside the caution and notice of sale registered against Amberwood’s title

    ground that the applications judge erred in finding that he was precluded 
    by the doctrine of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stare decisis</i> 
    from adopting the applicable English law. In response, Amberwood conceded 
    that no precedent, binding on Stinson J. or on this court, precludes the adoption 
    of the English exceptions. However, Amberwood argued, first, that this court, 
    for a number of reasons, should not adopt the English exceptions and second, 
    that even if any such exception was adopted into Ontario common law, it was 
    not applicable to the present case. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The rule that positive covenants do not run 
    with the land has been a settled principle of the English common law for well 
    over a century and it is undisputed that it has clearly been adopted in Canada: 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Parkinson v. Reid</i>, [1966] S.C.R. 
    162. It appears to be equally undisputed that the rule at times causes inconvenience, 
    that its application in some cases may even result in unfairness, and that 
    the present state of the law should be modified to meet the needs of modern 
    conveyancing. However, it is my view that the call for reform is not one for 
    the courts to answer but for the Legislature. Any change in the law in this 
    area could have complex and far-reaching effects that cannot be accurately 
    assessed on a case by case basis. The need to preserve certainty in commercial 
    and property transactions requires that any meaningful reform be achieved 
    by legislation that can be drafted with careful regard to the consequences.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Therefore, since positive covenants do not 
    run with the land, Amberwood is not bound by the positive covenant to pay 
    the interim expenses under the Reciprocal Agreement solely by virtue of having 
    acquired the Phase 2 lands with notice of its terms. The question remains 
    whether Amberwood is liable to pay the expenses under some other recognized 
    legal principle. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, DCC 123 places reliance on the doctrine 
    of benefit and burden in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. 
    Brizell </i>as a method of avoiding the application of the rule. The nature 
    and scope of this doctrine will be discussed more fully later in these reasons. 
    Suffice it to say for the purpose of this overview that, in my view, the benefit 
    and burden doctrine is not as wide or as settled in English law as contended 
    by DCC 123. Furthermore, the adoption of this doctrine as a recognized exception 
    to the rule in the common law of this province, in much the same way as the 
    abolition of the rule itself, would have complex, far-reaching and uncertain 
    ramifications that cannot be adequately addressed on a case by case basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The second method relied upon by DCC 123 is 
    the conditional grant of easement. The question whether or not a provision 
    in a conveyance is a conditional grant essentially turns on the construction 
    of the relevant instrument, in this case the Reciprocal Agreement. In my view, 
    there is no link between the easements conferred under the Reciprocal Agreement 
    and the positive covenant to pay interim expenses so as to create a conditional 
    grant within the meaning of this principle. The general clause of mutuality 
    and reciprocity of easements, rights and provisions contained in the Reciprocal 
    Agreement cannot be relied upon by DCC 123 to convert all positive obligations 
    into conditional grants of easement so as to defeat the rule. As stated earlier, 
    the rule that positive covenants do not run with the land applies despite 
    the parties’ express intention to the contrary. Hence, the applications judge 
    erred in finding that, by virtue of section 13.1(b) of the Reciprocal Agreement, 
    the grant of easements and benefits under section 2.3 and Article 3 was conditional 
    upon payment of the interim expenses set out under section 2.9. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the result, for different reasons than 
    those of the applications judge, I am of the view that he was nonetheless 
    correct in granting Amberwood’s application, and I would dismiss the appeal.

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rhone v. Stephens</i>, [1994] 2 All E.R. 65, 
    the House of Lords considered the question of the enforceability of positive 
    covenants between owners of freehold estates including, in particular, the 
    rule that positive covenants do not run with the land. The rule is commonly 
    referred to as the rule in<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Austerberry 
    v. Oldham Corp</i> (1885), 29 Ch. D. 750 (C.A.). It is unfortunate that this 
    case was not brought to the attention of the applications judge because the 
    judgment in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rhone v. Stephens</i> provides a convenient 
    framework for discussion of the issues raised in this case. Lord Templeman, 
    in his reasons delivered on behalf of the court, set out a useful and succinct 
    review of the law related to covenants, including the different rules governing 
    restrictive and positive covenants, its historical development, and its underlying 
    rationale. Lord Templeman also acknowledged the severe criticism of the present 
    state of the law on positive covenants and the call for legislative reform 
    made by the Law Commission in England. He also considered, and declined, the 
    invitation to abolish the rule in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry, 
    </i>finding that any need for reform was a matter for Parliament. Finally, 
    he considered and rejected the argument that the rule in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Austerberry</i> had been blunted by the benefit and burden principle. 
    Hence, many of the same issues that are raised by the parties in this case 
    were before the House of Lords in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rhone 
    v. Stephens</i>. It may be useful to set out the facts in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    of the purchasers and their successors in title. The conveyance also had the

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The House of Lords then noted that the rigours 
    of the common law, which do not allow covenants to be enforced by and against

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Spencer’s Case</i> (1583) 5 Co. Rep. 16a, [1558-1774] 
    All E.R. Rep. 68, and subsequently by statutory extensions of those doctrines, 
    resulting in different treatment being afforded at law to leaseholds. As a 
    result of this relaxation of the rule, as between landlord and tenant, both 
    the burden and the benefit of a covenant, which touches or concerns the land 
    demised and is not merely collateral, run at law with the reversion and the 
    term of the lease whether the covenant be positive or restrictive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>However, as between persons interested in land other than as landlord 
    and tenant, the law remained as established in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry</i>.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The different treatment afforded to leaseholds 
    over time was not relevant to the case in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Rhone v. Stephens</i>, hence the rationale behind it was not discussed 
    by Lord Templeman. That aspect of the law also goes beyond the scope of the 
    question to be decided by this court. However, for the sake of completeness, 
    a brief reference may be made to the decision in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Keppell v. Bailey</i> (1834), 2 My. &amp; K. 517, 39 E.R. 1042 (Ch.) where 
    the court expressed the reasoning for the different treatment afforded to 
    leasehold interests. This reasoning provides some insight into the rationale 
    behind the rule relating to positive covenants. The court in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Keppell v. Bailey </i>expressed the view that 
    while no harm arises from giving everyone the fullest latitude in binding 
    themselves and their representatives in contract, “great detriment would arise 
    and much confusion of rights if parties were allowed to invent new modes of 
    holding and enjoying real property, and to impress upon their lands and tenements 
    a peculiar character, which should follow them into all hands, however remote” 
    (at p.&nbsp;1049).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The court was of 
    the view, however, that the matter was very different in the case of covenants 
    in a lease where the lessor or his assignees continue in the reversion while 
    the term of the lease lasts and retain control over the land. Hence, in the 
    case of leaseholds, as opposed to freeholds, the court held that it was not 
    at all inconsistent with the nature of property that positive covenants affecting 
    the land bind those who take the term of the leasehold by assignment. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Hence, it would appear that the need for certainty 
    in the ascertainment of title and its incidental rights served to maintain 
    the traditional limits to the parties’ contractual freedom in the case of

    and the different approaches that should be adopted to effect it, informed 
    much of the argument advanced by the parties on this appeal. The determinative

    to the rule in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry</i> and their 
    potential application to this case. DCC 123 took the position that the English 
    exceptions were well established and it urged this court to adopt these principles 
    as an incremental and much needed change in the law. Amberwood, on the other 
    hand, took the position that the existence and scope of each exception was 
    a matter of much controversy in England and in other common law jurisdictions 
    and that, even if either exception was found to apply to the facts of this

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In its 1989 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Report on Covenants Affecting Freehold Land</i>, the OLRC dealt with both 
    positive and restrictive covenants affecting land, other than those between 
    landlord and tenant. It defined a positive covenant as “one that requires 
    a person to do something on his or her land.” (p.1 Executive Summary). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In an attempt to determine the rationale behind 
    the rule that positive covenants do not run with the land, the OLRC made reference 
    to the decision in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Keppell v. Bailey,</i> 
    referred to earlier, and deduced from this decision that there were two related 
    rationales. First, “such covenants would tend to render land inalienable” 
    and second, “persons dealing subsequently with the land would have great difficulty 
    in ascertaining the existence of such covenants, because they do not normally 
    have a physical manifestation” (at p.&nbsp;21).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The OLRC rejected both rationales as inapplicable 
    to the reality of conveyancing in Ontario. With respect to the concern for 
    inalienability, the OLRC observed that “it has now been generally recognized… 
    that [positive covenants] do not tend to render land inalienable. On the contrary, 
    positive and negative covenants tend to enhance alienability since they operate 
    to protect the amenities of neighbourhoods and the competitiveness of businesses” 
    (at pp.100-01). With respect to the concern for the difficulty in ascertaining 
    the existence of such covenants, the OLRC stated that it &quot;is not now, 
    and was not then, an obstacle in Ontario&quot; (at p.22) given Ontario’s land 
    registration system, a system that did not generally exist in England at the 
    time of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Keppell</i> decision. </span></p>

    of the difficulties that have arisen as a result. Indeed, this case provides 
    an example of the kind of difficulty described by the OLRC (at p.&nbsp;101):<span

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>As a practical matter, the use of affirmative covenants 
        is relatively common, particularly in connection with land developments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>Positive covenants, for example, are often contained in subdivision 
        agreements, entered into between developers and municipalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>In this context, however, positive covenants create few problems, 
        since they have the sanction of statute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>The situation is otherwise, however, with respect to covenants 
        given by builders to the subdivider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>Frequently these include positive obligations, for example, with 
        respect to paving, sodding, and the installation of street lights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>Even though builders’ covenants are usually limited in time to 
        ten or twelve years, the fact that the burden of a positive covenant does 
        not survive an assignment of the land by the builder can cause difficulties.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Similarly, covenants are often imposed upon the ultimate purchasers, 
        either by the subdivider or by the builder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again, they often contain positive as well 
        as negative obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once 
        again, however, even though these obligations are usually restricted in 
        time to ten or twelve years, the fact that the burden of a positive covenant 
        cannot run with the land may create difficulties.</span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Finally, we note that the running of the burden of positive 
        covenants is not a phenomenon entirely unknown to the law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
        </span>Since privity of estate exists between a lessor and a lessee, and 
        their respective assigns, the burden of certain leasehold covenants will 
        run, either with the term of the lease or with the reversion, irrespective 
        of whether the obligation is positive or negative.</span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>In addition, the burden of positive covenants are permitted 
        to run in the context of condominiums, which are governed in Ontario by 
        specific legislation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, 
        there are many situations in which condominium legislation might not be 
        appropriate – for example, in the case of a duplex, or other building 
        having more than one owner, that is not large enough to be made into a 
        statutory condominium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like the 
        owners of condominium units, the owners of the several units in such buildings 
        might wish to enter into positive covenants that run with the land, particularly 
        respecting such matters, for example, as the maintenance of common walls, 
        decoration and landscaping.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In light of the absence of any applicable 
    rationale for the rule and of the difficulties it posed, the OLRC was of the 
    view that the law required reform (at pp.&nbsp;101-02):</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>We have reached the conclusion that the

      upon a transfer of freehold land, operates to defeat the legitimate expectations 
      of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In our view, there 
      can be no principled rationale for a rule that would preclude neighbours 
      from agreeing, for example, to maintain a boundary fence, or, to keep certain 
      drains clear, such that the covenant would run with the land.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor is it justifiable, in our view, that, in 
      a property development providing for parks, open spaces, and other amenities, 
      obligations to pay for the maintenance of these amenities cannot be enforced 
      against the successors of the original contracting parties.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, to the extent that a variety of 
      methods have been developed to circumvent the undesirable effect of the 
      present law, it has been productive of much uncertainty and confusion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends 
      that the law should be reformed to permit the burden of affirmative obligations 
      to run upon a transfer of freehold land.</span></div>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The OLRC further concluded that the present 
    law of restrictive covenants was also in need of reform because it is unduly 
    complex and uncertain. Hence, the OLRC was of the view that the need for reform 
    arose both from the uncertain and complex state of the law with respect to 
    restrictive covenants, and the existing gap with respect to positive covenants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A similar need for reform has been identified 
    in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand. Recommendations were made by the 
    Committee on Positive Covenants Affecting Land in the United Kingdom in a 
    Report presented to the British Parliament in 1965 and by the Law Commission 
    in another Report laid before the British Parliament in 1984 entitled <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Transfer of Land: The Law of Positive and Restrictive 
    Covenants. </i>Recommendations for reform were made in New Zealand by the 
    Property Law and Equity Reform Committee in a document named <i

    which was presented to the Minister of Justice in 1985.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The OLRC proceeded to make specific recommendations 
    for reform. It expressed the view that it would not be sufficient simply to 
    import positive covenants into the common law of restrictive covenants because 
    that law “is inherently incapable of providing adequately for positive obligations” 
    (at p.104) and, in any event, the law on restrictive covenants itself is in 
    need of reform. The OLRC therefore recommended that a new type of servitude 
    should be created that would encompass both positive and negative obligations 
    and would provide for the differing requirements of each. A number of issues 
    are then discussed in the 1989 Report.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the sheer number and complexity 
    of issues that would have to be considered in order to address the various 
    concerns relating to such reform of the law make it abundantly clear that 
    any significant change requires a legislative initiative. A case by case approach 
    would create unmanageable confusion and uncertainty in the law. By way of

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US><br>
      In my view, there are such benefits. First, Amberwood is part owner of the

      </span>Second, those units are maintained for Amberwood by DCC&nbsp;123.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      Amberwood has the access benefits of the other easements provided for in 
      the reciprocal agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although 
      I agree with Amberwood that these benefits may be somewhat remote or artificial 
      and would certainly have more significance if a second condominium was actually 
      built on the Phase&nbsp;II lands, I do not interpret the doctrine from <i

      the extent or nature of the benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If 
      Amberwood chose to abandon its claim to these benefits, it would not be 
      bound to shoulder the burden of the interim costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
      </span>In my view, the fact that Amberwood does not wish to abandon these 
      entitlements confirms that they can be fairly and properly characterized 
      as true benefits flowing to the successor/owner.<br>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A third method of avoiding the rule is to 
      rely upon the doctrine in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall 
      v. Brizell</i>, [1957] Ch. 169, [1957] All E.R. 371. See, also, <i

      at 292 and 310, [1977] 3 All E.R. 129. This doctrine is based upon the old 
      rule, relating to deeds, that a person who claims the benefit of a deed 
      must also take it subject to the burdens. In the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall

      trust deed, to use private roads and other amenities. Each purchaser covenanted 
      to pay a share of the cost to maintain the amenities. The court held that 
      their successors were liable to pay their share of the cost. The usefulness 
      of the doctrine, however, is somewhat limited. It will operate only if there 
      is a benefit to be claimed under the deed, and further, it will operate 
      only so long as the assignee of the covenantor continues to claim that benefit.

    from a review of the relevant jurisprudence that the doctrine in <i

    by reference to the underlying general principle “that a person who claims 
    the benefit of a deed must also take it subject to the burdens”. Indeed, if 
    the doctrine were so wide as to obligate a successor in title to all the burdens 
    contained in the deed simply by reason of his acceptance of the benefit of 
    the deed, it would swallow the rule. Positive covenants <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    informed the reasoning underlying the concession of counsel in <i

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Before referring to the subsequent jurisprudence, 
    it is noteworthy that the decision in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Halsall v. Brizell</i> has been the subject of much debate and criticism. 
    A frequently published commentator on English property law, F.R. Crane, has 
    pointed out some of the weaknesses of the decision in a case comment at 21 
    [1957] The Conveyancer &amp; Property Lawyer 160. He noted that the court 
    in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. Brizell</i> effectively 
    by-passed both the decision in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry 
    </i>and the rule against perpetuities, citing as only authority for doing 
    so a brief remark by Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. during argument in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Elliston v. Reacher</i>, [1908] 2 Ch. 665 which did not form part of the 
    judgment<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>.</i> R. E. Megarry (as he then 
    was) also pointed out the frail underpinnings of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Halsall</i> in a 1957 case comment (1957), 73 L.Q.R. 154 at 155-56. He 
    noted that the observation of Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Elliston v. Reacher</i>, relied upon by Upjohn J., provided doubtful authority 
    for the proposition since it was simply made during the address by counsel 
    and did not form part of the judgment. Further, the passage relied upon from 
    Coke on Littleton confined the operation of the benefit and burden rule to 
    a party who is specifically named in a deed but who does not execute it.</span></p>

    in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. Brizell</i>, is of particular 
    relevance to DCC 123’s position. Indeed, the distinction sought to be made 
    by DCC 123 between the benefit and burden principle on the one hand, and the 
    conditional grant on the other, stems from the judgment of Vice-Chancellor

    it is not necessary for the purpose of this appeal to discuss it in any detail. 
    The only part of the decision that is relevant to this case is Megarry V-C’s 
    discussion of the doctrine in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall 
    v. Brizell</i>. Ironically, the frailty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall 
    v. Brizell</i> was the subject of substantial analysis in the judgment. However, 
    of particular relevance to the appellant’s position is Megarry V-C’s identification 
    of two aspects (amongst others) of the doctrine in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. Brizell </i>- the conditional grant, 
    and what Megarry V-C called the “pure principle of benefit and burden”. He 
    described the first as a function of the creating instrument that in effect 
    attaches conditions to the exercise of a right and thereby restricts the scope 
    of the benefit itself, and the second as a general category where the benefit 
    and burden, although arising under the same instrument, are independent of 
    each other. He stated as follows (at p.&nbsp;281): </span></p>

    the doctrine in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall v. Brizell </i>by 
    Megarry V-C in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tito's</i> case, was

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Further, the applications judge’s conclusion 
    that the benefit and burden principle would apply to the facts of this case 
    is not consonant with the English jurisprudence. He concluded that Amberwood 
    was bound by the burden of the covenant because it had received the following 
    benefits: part ownership of the recreational and utility units in the Phase 
    1 building; payment by DCC 123 for the maintenance of, and security over, 
    those units; and easements over the Phase 1 lands. However, the simple fact 
    that Amberwood received certain benefits upon obtaining title to the Phase 
    2 lands is clearly not sufficient, without more, under the English common 
    law to render it liable under the positive covenant contained in the same 
    instrument. In so far as the easements over the Phase 1 lands are concerned, 
    DCC 123 has not established <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> 
    correlation between those benefits and the burden of the positive covenant, 
    so as to justify the application of the English doctrine. In so far as the 
    benefits related to the recreational facilities are concerned, DCC 123 has 
    not shown any user or enjoyment of the benefit by Amberwood. While DCC 123 
    recognizes in its supplementary factum that those requirements cause difficulties 
    in this case, it purports to resolve the issue by submitting that an “all 
    or nothing” principle should be adopted in Ontario so as to bind Amberwood 
    to all the terms of the Reciprocal Agreement, whether or not there is any 
    direct link or any <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto </i>use or enjoyment of the intended 
    benefits. In my view, the adoption of such a wide exception would be tantamount 
    to abolishing the rule itself. Any successor in title would be bound by the 
    positive covenant by reason solely of its acceptance of the deed to the land.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I note further, with respect to the findings 
    of the applications judge, that whatever rights or obligations may flow from 
    the fact that the parties are presently co-owners of the recreational facilities 
    to which the costs are related are irrelevant to, and beyond the scope of, 
    the present application. The co-ownership, created not by the Reciprocal Agreement 
    but by a later conveyance between DCC 123 and one of Amberwood’s predecessors 
    in title, may well give rise to other issues that relate to the same interim 
    costs, but it has no bearing on the question whether Amberwood is liable on 
    the covenant contained in the Reciprocal Agreement. </span></p>

    expenses on that basis if the exception were adopted in Ontario law. In any 
    event, it is my view that, having regard to the uncertainties and the many 
    frailties of the existing common law in England in this area of the law, it 
    would be inadvisable to adopt these principles in Ontario. Indeed, a review 
    of the English experience with the doctrine of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall 
    v. Brizell</i>, lends further support to the conclusion that any reform to 
    the rule in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry </i>is best 
    left to the Legislature. It would appear from many of the commentaries that 
    the English adoption of the benefit and burden exception may have created

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Quite apart from the uncertainties that the 
    adoption of the exception could create in other existing commercial relationships, 
    it is my view that the application of the benefit and burden principle in 
    this case could give rise to a multitude of other issues, particularly in 
    the event of non-compliance. I pose but a few hypothetical questions by way 
    of example. What benefits would Amberwood lose if it failed to pay the interim 
    costs? Would it simply lose any right to use the shared facilities? Or would 
    all the easements be extinguished? Could any or all of these benefits be revived 
    upon paying the arrears? Could the benefits be revived at any time by payment 
    of the arrears whether it be by Amberwood or a subsequent purchaser? Or would 
    payment have to be made within a reasonable time? Would Amberwood be liable 
    to lose the benefit of the land itself because it did not pay the interim 
    costs? Are these interim costs to be paid indefinitely, even if no second 
    tower is ever built on the Phase 2 lands? </span></p>

    uncertainty when they arise by reason of a covenant that runs with the land

    has sold the Phase 2 lands. How then would the subsequent purchaser’s title 
    to the lands be affected by the answer to these hypothetical questions? These 
    questions exemplify some of the issues identified by the OLRC in its 1989 
    Report as matters that would need to be addressed by the Legislature under

  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Once again, this “conditional grant” 
      approach to circumventing the rule against positive covenants flowing with 
      the land, is an English innovation. Although there does not seem to be any 
      Canadian law which expressly recognizes or applies the conditional grant 
      exception, such an exception is consistent with the benefit/burden doctrine. 
      In my view, the conditional grant exception is essentially a form of the 
      benefit/burden doctrine. The only difference is that the burden is directly 
      annexed to the grant of the benefit, instead of the subject of an independent 
      covenant. The notion of a conditional grant exception is also consistent 
      with the recognition that the ancient rule against positive covenants flowing 
      with title has many problematic implications. Such an exception would also 
      function to protect legitimate party expectations. </span></div>

      submission that the cost-sharing obligations should be viewed as distinct 
      from the scheme for mutual easements. To the contrary, paragraph 13.1(b) 
      seems to envision a building project in which the owners would share costs 
      in exchange for shared access and ownership. To undermine this clear intention 
      by severing the cost obligations from the overall deal would amount to dismantling 
      part of an intricate, complex, and well-planned scheme, and defeating legitimate

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Hence, as a matter of construction of the 
    creating instrument itself, if a grant of benefit or easement is framed as 
    conditional upon the continuing performance of a positive obligation, the 
    positive obligation may well be enforceable, not because it would run with 
    the land, but because the condition would serve to limit the scope of the 
    grant itself. In effect, the law would simply be giving effect to the grant. 
    Indeed, as discussed earlier in this judgment at paragraphs 30 and 31, much 
    the same reasoning underlies the law of restrictive covenants. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However, none of the grants of benefit or 
    easement contained in the Reciprocal Agreement are framed in this way. Neither 
    section 2.3 nor Article 3 of the Reciprocal Agreement is expressed to be conditional 
    or dependant upon performance of all obligations under section 2.9. Further, 
    it is my view that section 13.1(b) is far too general to create a conditional 
    grant within the meaning of the principle stated in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsbury’s Laws of England. </i>At its highest, 
    it can be said that the parties to the Reciprocal Agreement have attempted 
    to write in, as a term of their agreement, essentially the same general benefit 
    and burden principle, the adoption of which was urged upon this court as a 
    first exception to the rule. In my view, section 13.1(b) achieves no more, 
    and its application would give rise to the same difficulties that I have discussed 
    earlier. The attempt to create a contractual exception to the rule in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austerberry, 
    </i>while binding on the original parties to the Reciprocal Agreement, cannot 
    displace the rule that positive covenants do not bind successors-in-title. 
    It is undisputed in English and Canadian law that the rule that positive covenants 
    do not run with the land governs despite any express intention to the contrary 
    contained in the agreement. Indeed, if the applications judge was correct 
    in his conclusion that section 13.1(b) effectively created an exception to 
    the rule, it would be open to anyone to simply abolish the rule at the stroke 
    of a pen. All that would be required would be a general statement of intent 
    that the continuing right to the use and enjoyment of all the benefits in 
    an agreement was conditional upon the acceptance of the burden contained in 
    any of the covenants. The recognition of such a wide exception would constitute 
    a profound change in the law. </span></p>

      such as an obligation to make certain payments.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      to each other ab initio, and so the benefit is only a conditional benefit.<span

      burden, although arising under the same instrument, are independent of each

      covenants with X to do some act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 
      such cases, although Y is of course bound by his covenant, questions may 
      arise whether successors in title to Y’s right can take it free from the 
      obligations of Y’s covenant, or whether they are bound by them under what 
      for want of a better name I shall call the pure principle of benefit and

      only justifiable distinction between the principle of benefit and burden

    Megarry V.-C. was particularly candid on this point.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In spite of problems and uncertainties, in

    which it would be required to assume.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, 
    before the litigation was commenced, there were extensive negotiations about 
    the burdens and, at one point, Amberwood’s counsel informed DCC’s counsel,

    the benefits are “real and substantial”.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    when it accepted the benefits under the agreement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It has never disclaimed its entitlement to 
    the benefits; indeed it has openly asserted that entitlement and an intention

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, I do not think there is an inconsistency 
    between the introduction of the benefit-burden exception into the law of Ontario 
    and the continuation of the general rule that positive covenants do not run 
    with the land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Put another way, I 
    do not think that the exception swallows the rule.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Professor Davis, in her article <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Principle of Benefit and Burden</i>, stated 
    that with respect to the “pure principle of benefit and burden . . . [e]nforcement 
    is only possible in certain circumstances, not generally” (p. 552).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The Ontario Law Reform Commission, in its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Report 
    on Covenants Affecting Land (1989)</i>, said that the usefulness of the exception 
    in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall</i> “is somewhat limited.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It will operate only if there is a benefit 
    to be claimed under the deed, and further, it will operate only so long as 
    the assignee of the covenantor continues to claim that benefit” (p. 23).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Professor Eileen Gillese, in her text <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Property Law</i> (2nd. ed., 1990), made a similar 
    observation: “The doctrine in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Halsall 
    v. Brizell</i> . . . is of limited application, however, since it only applies 
    if the assignees claim or use the benefit” (p.&nbsp;20:10).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I agree with these comments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The exception will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    for the assignee to receive or if the assignee elects not to accept the benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>These are important factors; their presence will allow the general 
    rule to continue to be applied in many appropriate cases.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, I do not think that the benefit-burden 
    exception will hinder the alienability of land.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Market forces will deal with the exception, 
    just as they deal with all other relevant factors in a purchase and sale context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As explained by Professor Ziff in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Positive

    (p. 369).<span

    costs that are in issue in this appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, 
    since Amberwood had notice of the burdens and elected to accept the benefits 
    (even though their full value will not be realized until Amberwood either 
    builds Phase 2 or sells the land, presumably for a price that would reflect 
    the benefits of the easements), it must also accept the linked burden of paying 
    its share of the interim costs.</span></p>

    and the academic and professional commentary about that reasoning persuade

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As to whether the courts can introduce the 
    exceptions into the law of Ontario, I recall again what Justice Cardozo said 
    about the role of the common law in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The 
    Nature of the Judicial Process</i>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There
