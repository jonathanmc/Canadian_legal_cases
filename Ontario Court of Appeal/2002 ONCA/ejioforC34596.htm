<p class=headingtitle>On appeal from the conviction entered and sentence imposed

  </span> The appellant was convicted of one count of importing cocaine and one 
  count of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A package containing cocaine was mailed to Mr. Michael Charles, a friend 
  of the appellant.  The police intercepted the package before it reached Mr. 
  Charles and decided to make a controlled delivery of the package.  Mr. Charles 
  picked up the package and drove away in his vehicle.  He was under police surveillance.  
  Mr. Charles parked his vehicle in a plaza.  The package containing the cocaine 
  was in the trunk.  A few hours later, the appellant approached Mr. Charles’ 
  vehicle, opened the trunk, looked in and then closed the trunk.  A short time 
  later, he drove away in Mr. Charles’ vehicle.  He was followed for about an 
  hour and, according to the police, was acting very suspiciously.  After the 
  appellant parked the car and left the vehicle, it became apparent to the police 
  that the cocaine was no longer in the trunk.  The appellant was arrested a short 
  time later.  The package containing the cocaine was never recovered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue at trial was whether the appellant knew that there was cocaine 
  in the package in the trunk.  He testified that he had no such knowledge.  Mr. 
  Charles who pled guilty prior to trial also testified that the appellant had 
  no knowledge of the cocaine in the trunk.  The case for the Crown was entirely 
  circumstantial and while it could support the convictions, the case was far 
  from overwhelming.  The appellant raises several grounds of appeal.  Two have 
  merit.  </p>

  </span> In his examination-in-chief, the appellant described his first months 
  in Canada as a refugee claimant.  He testified that he was befriended by Mr. 
  Charles who came from Nigeria as did the appellant.  The appellant also met 
  and was befriended by Mr. Okeke and Mr. Azukakwu.  They were also from Nigeria 
  and lived near the appellant.  According to the appellant, these men helped 
  him find a place to live, and introduced him to other people.  </p>

      </span> The impugned cross-examination is set out below:</p>
    <p>Q.        Okay.  So within the span of a few months you met Mr. Okeke, 
      Mr. Azukakwu and Mr. Charles, right?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And you know Mr. Okeke has been convicted of drug importing?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>Yes.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And you know Mr. Azukakwu has been convicted of drug importing?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>Yes.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And you also know from the charges you’re facing today and 
      from Mr. Charles’ evidence, he’s also been convicted of drug importing?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>Yes.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        So here you find yourself in a new country, you’d never outside 
      of your homeland in Nigeria, right?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        You find yourself in a strange country, you don’t know much about 
      the system, you’re talking to people at the shelter, learning about Legal 
      Aid, learning about welfare, right?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And within the span of a few months, you become friends with 
      three convicted drug importers, right?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>What I will say to that is when I came in here, those were 
      the three Africans that I met.  Okeke was the first African that I really 
      met almost from Nigeria.  You know, when he was talking to me it was as 
      if I was talking to a brother of mine.  So what they were doing, dealing 
      drugs, I never knew they were dealing drugs.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        <u>So it’s just a mere coincidence that within the first three 
      months of being in Canada, you associate yourself with three convicted drug 
      importers?</u></p>
    <p>A.        Miss, you could go to 159 Wallace or Campbell Street, that was 
      first house I live in Toronto, the landlord there is going to tell you opposite 
      the room I was staying at, there was a Nigerian living there and that is 
      where I met Okeke.  I never … that was a coincidence.  I came and I live 
      there and I met him.  The landlord can bear testimony to that.</p>
    <p>Q.        Okay.  Coincidence that you met Mr. Okeke within the first couple 
      of months?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        Coincidence that you met Mr. Azukakwu?</p>
    <p>A.        Okeke introduced me to them.</p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And that was just a coincidence that the two of them being 
      friends were drug importers and you lived with both of them, right?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>I don’t know what they were doing.  I didn’t know what they 
      were doing.  He introduced me to somebody, how am I meant to know what the 
      guy was doing.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        <u>And a coincidence that you met Mr. Charles, right, another 
      drug importer?</u></p>
    <p>A.        <u>Yes.</u></p>
    <p>Q.        And you stay in all three of their homes?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        You came to know many things about them?</p>
    <p>A.        I never … I knew, yes, I knew them.  I knew they were living 
      in Canada, I knew where they lived, but I can’t … I don’t really get into 
      any of their business.  I’m someone who mind my own business.</p>
    <p>Q.        Oh, I see.  And they take you into their homes.  They help you 
      out.  They help you find, not only did they let you stay in their homes, 
      they help you find other places to live and they introduce you to fellow 
      Nigerians, right?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was no suggestion that either Mr. Okeke or Mr. Azukakwu were connected 
  in any way to the allegations made against the appellant.  There was also no 
  allegation that the appellant had any involvement in the drug dealings that 
  had led to the convictions of Mr. Okeke or Mr. Azukakwu.  There was no evidence 
  of when these convictions occurred.  The appellant also testified that he had 
  no knowledge of the convictions when he was associating with Mr. Okeke and Mr. 
  Azukakwu.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There will be situations in which association with other drug dealers 
  will be relevant to a fact in issue in the prosecution for the importation of 
  narcotics.  There will also be cases where that relevance is sufficiently significant 
  to warrant the admissibility of such evidence despite its potential prejudicial 
  effect.  Crown counsel referred us to some of those cases, but conceded that 
  evidence that Mr. Okeke and Mr. Azukakwu had been convicted of drug importation 
  had no relevance to any issue raised in the appellant’s trial.  I agree with 
  Crown counsel’s assessment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Not only were the questions irrelevant, they were potentially very prejudicial.  
  I can think of no reason for putting these questions to the appellant other 
  than to suggest the inference that because the appellant associated with drug 
  importers, he was a drug importer and, therefore, had to know that there was 
  cocaine in the vehicle.  Counsel for the appellant properly described this line 
  of reasoning as suggesting guilt by association.  It offends one of the most 
  fundamental principles of the criminal law.  People can only be convicted for 
  what they do, not for the company they keep.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant at trial did not make an immediate objection 
  to these questions.  The trial judge had previously cautioned both counsel against 
  interrupting cross-examination with objections.  Counsel for the appellant did, 
  however, raise the issue prior to the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  He 
  indicated that the cross-examination implied “guilt by association” and asked 
  the trial judge for “some rousing charge”.  The trial judge acknowledged that 
  the questions concerned him and indicated that he wanted to think about what, 
  if anything, he would say to the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ultimately, the trial judge made no reference to this cross-examination 
  in his charge to the jury.  Counsel for the appellant renewed his request that 
  the jury be cautioned about the risk of improperly inferring guilt from the 
  association with persons who had been convicted of similar offences.  The trial 
  judge declined to give the jury the instruction requested by counsel for the 
  appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was a real risk of significant prejudice to the appellant flowing 
  from the improper questions put by Crown counsel.  A firm instruction from the 
  trial judge was required.  He should have told the jury that it should never 
  have heard the evidence concerning the convictions of Mr. Okeke and Mr. Azukakwu, 
  and he should have specifically told them that they must guard against drawing 
  any adverse inference against the appellant because of his association with 
  these two persons.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s association with Mr. Charles, given that Mr. Charles 
  was allegedly involved in this offence with the appellant, stands on a different 
  footing than the appellant’s association with the other two men.  The trial 
  judge did deal to some extent with the evidence of Mr. Charles’ involvement 
  in the importation of narcotics.  I need not consider whether those instructions 
  were adequate.  </p>
<p> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am satisfied that the improper cross-examination of the appellant 
  by Crown counsel, combined with the trial judge’s failure to caution the jury 
  against drawing the inference that the questions so strongly invited, resulted 
  in a miscarriage of justice and necessitates the quashing of the convictions 
  and the ordering a new trial.</p>

  </span> While the format of the questions was not ideal, I do not think there

  that the trial judge should have told the jury, as many trial judges do, that 
  the evidence comes exclusively from the answers given to the questions by witnesses 
  and not from the contents of the question.  The trial judge should have reminded 
  the jury that the appellant’s girlfriend had not testified and that no statements 
  attributed to her by the Crown could have any evidentiary value.</p>
