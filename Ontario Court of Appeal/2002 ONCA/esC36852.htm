    </span> The charges all related to the appellant’s ex-girlfriend. The allegations, 
    which related to several incidents over the course of a number of months, 
    were serious, including forced sexual intercourse, forcible confinement, assault 
    with a weapon, threats and criminal harassment. The appellant raised numerous

    </span> The central issue at trial was credibility. The case for the Crown 
    was by no means overwhelming. This is readily apparent from the trial judge’s 
    conclusory remarks following his detailed review of the evidence. He stated:

    <div class=Section1>It has given me a lot of difficulty to look at all the 
      circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      these circumstances there may be doubt in my mind as to the accused’s guilt 
      or innocence because of his own testimony, but what I have found is this; 
      the testimony of the victim and the Crown’s witnesses is forthright, clear, 
      believable and I believe it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
      testimony of the accused is glib. There are a large number of areas which 
      he has not explained and I have come to the conclusion that there may be 
      some scintilla of suspicion in my mind that he may be telling the truth, 
      but it is not a reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
      a matter of fact, I have no doubt that he committed these offences.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></div>

<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Having regard to the context of the evidence at trial, it is our view 
    that the following errors are fatal to the conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, the trial judge erred in excluding the testimony of the appellant’s 
    spouse, concerning a telephone conversation between the appellant and the 
    complainant, on the basis that it was hearsay. The witness had overheard this 
    conversation from an extension line. The evidence as to the contents of the 
    conversation was not introduced for the truth of its contents and, Crown counsel 
    concedes, did not constitute hearsay. Although the complainant and the appellant 
    both gave testimony about this conversation, their respective versions were 
    clearly at odds with one another and the spouse’s testimony could have shed 
    further light on the matter. The telephone conversation in question, in particular 
    because of the time when it took place, was important. If the appellant’s 
    testimony was supported on this point by his spouse, and believed by the trial 
    judge, this evidence may well have affected the verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, the trial judge erred in admitting the testimony of the police 
    officer with respect to her conversation with the complainant’s aunt during 
    which the aunt had expressed fear of the appellant. This evidence which portrayed 
    the appellant as a dangerous person was not admissible for the truth of its 
    contents and to the extent that it was led to explain the aunt’s absence, 
    its prejudicial effect far exceeded its probative value. Significantly, it 
    is apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that he may have made some substantive 
    use of this evidence to support the complainant’s testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In the conclusory remarks to his judgment noted above, he made express 
    reference to the evidence of the “victim and the Crown’s witnesses” as a basis 
    for his verdict. Apart from the complainant, the police officer was the only 
    other Crown witness. The trial judge also referred to the officer’s testimony 
    elsewhere in his judgment in reference to the timing of the complaint. However, 
    the nature of the officer’s testimony was such that it could not lend support 
    to the complainant’s testimony, and furthermore, at least in so far as the 
    reference to the conversation with the aunt was concerned, was highly prejudicial 
    to the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Third, the trial judge repeatedly stated that there was “no evidence” 
    before him that there were tenants in the basement of the appellant’s house. 
    In fact, there was evidence to that effect from both the appellant and his 
    mother and it is clear that the trial judge was aware of this evidence because 
    he reviewed it. This evidence had been introduced in an attempt to show the 
    unlikelihood that one of the alleged incidents had occurred. The trial judge 
    gave no reasons why he rejected that testimony beyond stating that there was 
    no receipt or documentation showing that there were tenants. Hence, his reasons 
    can only be interpreted as an outright rejection of the evidence on this point 
    because there was no other, or more independent, confirmation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> There is no question that it was entirely within his purview to reject 
    this evidence. However, it is the trial judge’s approach to that aspect of 
    the defence’s case, when compared to his assessment of those aspects of the 
    complainant’s testimony that were equally unsupported by other evidence, that 
    leaves us with a concern that he may have applied a different standard in 
    assessing the evidence of the Crown and that of the defence. The trial judge 
    made no reference to the total absence of any confirmatory evidence of the 
    complainant’s testimony despite the fact that it would have been reasonable 
    to expect some form of confirmation to have been available on several aspects 
    of her testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, 
    the reasons of the trial judge for rejecting the appellant’s testimony raise 
    a further concern that a double standard may have been used.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The complainant’s testimony raised a number 
    of issues that were important to her credibility, yet they were not addressed 
    by the trial judge. While it was not incumbent upon the trial judge to review 
    all aspects of the evidence, his reasons disclose a much higher, and in our 
    view, questionable, level of scrutiny when it came to the assessment of the 
    appellant’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge expressly rejected the appellant’s testimony on the 
    basis of an inconsistency in the appellant’s evidence over whether he had 
    only one bad friend or more than one (as the plural form “friends” found in 
    a letter would indicate), his evasive answers on what these friends were like, 
    and on his apparent inability to recall why he would have been suspended from 
    school. The trial judge found those matters “very significant” on the question 
    of the appellant’s credibility. Although the trial judge was entitled to consider 
    these matters in his assessment of the appellant’s credibility, they were 
    of no great significance to the issues in the case. In the circumstances, 
    it would appear that, in placing such emphasis on these weaknesses in the 
    appellant’s testimony, the trial judge applied a more stringent standard in 
    his assessment of his evidence than he applied to that of the complainant. 
    Further, as disclosed in the excerpt from his reasons referred to earlier, 
    the trial judge’s ultimate rejection of the appellant’s testimony, in a case 
    that he has himself identified as very close, appears to have been based to 
    a significant extent on demeanour. When the reasons are reviewed as a whole, 
    we are not satisfied that the trial judge has applied the proper standard 
    of proof. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> It is for these reasons that the verdict cannot stand. Consequently, 
    the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside, and a new trial is ordered. 
    In light of this result, it is not necessary to deal with the sentence appeal. 
    However, we note that the sentence was illegal because it exceeded the maximum 
    cumulative disposition available under the <i
