<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice William J. Festeryga of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated August 10, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises four issues.</p>
<p>
  [2] First, the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  Mr. George was constructively dismissed. We disagree. In our view, the February 
  1995 correspondence and the respondent's evidence of his subsequent telephone 
  call with Mr. Epstein reasonably support the trial judge's finding. In substance, 
  the appellant unilaterally changed the terms of the respondent's employment 
  contract from one of indefinite hiring to a fixed-term contract, terminable 
  after one year.</p>
<p>
  [3] Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that 
  it was required to assign the keyman insurance policy. On this issue, we agree 
  with the reasoning of the trial judge in paragraph 80 of his reasons.</p>
<p>
  [4] Third, the appellant makes two points on damages. First, it contends that 
  we should calculate the dismissal damages on the basis of Mr. George's reduced 
  salary. But, as the trial judge stated at paragraph 64 of his reasons, because 
  there was no new agreement, Mr. George's damages must be calculated on the basis 
  of his previous employment contract as company president. Second, the appellant 
  attacks the Wallace extension. However, the trial judge's award of an extension 
  is fully justified on the record.</p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, the appellant asks to be reimbursed for the lieu time payments 
  made to the respondent. We think it is too late for the appellant to assert 
  this claim. The appellant condoned the payments and cannot now be heard to reclaim 
  them.</p>
<p>
  [6] One final matter arose during oral argument and that is whether the respondent 
  should be required to account for the pension payments he has received after 
  September, 1995. We do not think he should be because paragraph 5 of the policy 
  required the appellant to assign the policy on the date of his termination. 
  Only following the assignment was the appellant discharged from further liability. 
  As the appellant did not do so, it would now be inequitable to require the respondent 
  to account for these payments.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent is entitled to his 
  costs. However, we see no basis to award these costs on a substantial-indemnity 
  basis. We think the appropriate scale is partial indemnity. Taking into account 
  not only the preparation and argument of the appeal, but as well the fees incurred 
  in connection with the stay, a fair figure for costs is that proposed by the 
  appellant - $35,000 plus disbursements and G.S.T. That money will be paid out 
  of the money in court to the credit of the solicitors for the respondent. The 
  remaining money in court will be paid out to the credit of the solicitors for 
  the appellant. Finally, an order shall also issue in accordance with paragraph 
  55(c) of the respondent's factum.</p>
