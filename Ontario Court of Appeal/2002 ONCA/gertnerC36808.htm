<p>On appeal from the Judgment of Justice Blenus Wright dated May 3, 2001</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant solicitor appeals from an order requiring him to fulfill 
  his solicitor’s undertaking, given on January 30, 1997, to repay to the respondent 
  a loan in the amount of $50,000 “on or before February 11, 1997, without fail”. 
  Pursuant to the terms of the undertaking, the monies were to be taken from mortgage 
  financing which was being completed by the appellant on behalf of the debtor, 
  Mr. Messina. Contrary to the terms of the undertaking, the mortgage funds were 
  paid directly to Mr. Messina. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant readily conceded at the hearing before the applications 
  judge that he did not fulfill his undertaking. He took the position, however, 
  that the respondent was wrongfully claiming that he had not been paid the $50,000 
  directly by the debtor, Mr. Messina, and that he was now seeking, years after 
  the fact and following Mr. Messina’s assignment in bankruptcy, to obtain double 
  recovery of that amount. In response to the respondent’s application and in 
  support of his contention that the debt had been paid, the appellant relied 
  on his own affidavit. Contrary to the provisions of Rule 39.01(5), his affidavit 
  was based entirely on information and belief, even with respect to contentious 
  facts. The appellant, however, sought an adjournment of the application to allow 
  him to summons Mr. Messina to give evidence. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The applications judge refused to grant an adjournment. He held that 
  the appellant had had ample time since his breach of undertaking in February 
  1997 to obtain evidence that the debt had otherwise been paid. He held further 
  that there was “no direct evidence” that such payment had been made. He therefore 
  granted the respondent’s application and ordered the appellant to pay the sum 
  of $50,000 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $12,757.50.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the applications judge erred in refusing 
  him an adjournment and in deciding the matter summarily, in the face of conflicting 
  evidence on whether the debt had been paid. He sought leave from this court 
  to file fresh evidence in support of this latter contention. He further argued 
  that the material gave rise to an issue whether the undertaking in question 
  was a solicitor’s undertaking or a personal one only. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We see no reason to interfere with the applications judge’s decision. 
  We see no merit to the submission that this undertaking was anything other than 
  a solicitor’s undertaking. Further, the evidence was uncontroverted that the 
  appellant breached his undertaking. His contention that the debt had been otherwise 
  repaid was not supported by any admissible evidence before the applications 
  judge. The proposed fresh evidence puts him in no higher position. The evidence, 
  even if admitted, remains confusing, contradictory in several respects, and 
  largely inadmissible. Moreover, the appellant has not obtained any evidence 
  from Mr. Messina nor has he offered any explanation for his failure to do so. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is of paramount importance that solicitors be strictly accountable 
  for their undertakings. The appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed at  $5000.</p>
