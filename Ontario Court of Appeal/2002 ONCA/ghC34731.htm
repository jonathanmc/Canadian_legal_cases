<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his three young granddaughters.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>*</span></a>  The Crown’s 
  case rested entirely on the evidence of the three complainants.  The appellant 
  testified and denied that he assaulted any of his granddaughters.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal;
line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainants made various statements concerning the alleged assaults.  
  Some of these statements were inconsistent with the evidence given by the complainants 
  at trial.  Counsel for the appellant cross-examined on these inconsistencies 
  at some length.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was evidence that the three sisters discussed the events surrounding 
  the allegations and that two of the three significantly changed their stories 
  some nine months after their initial statements to the police.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his instructions, the trial judge made it clear that the credibility 
  of the complainants and the reliability of their evidence were crucial.  He 
  properly instructed the jury on the burden of proof as it applies where conflicting 
  versions of events are given.  The trial judge also instructed the jury as to 
  the law applicable to prior inconsistent statements and reviewed the various 
  statements made by the complainants.  In the course of his review of the complainants’ 
  evidence, the trial judge referred to the evidence which the appellant says 
  demonstrates collusion amongst the three complainants.  The trial judge did 
  not specifically tell the jury that a finding that the complainants had jointly 
  concocted or changed their version of the events would diminish their credibility 
  and the reliability of their evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A trial judge is not required to repeat every argument made by counsel.  
  The claim that the complainants had concocted and jointly revised their version 
  of events was one of the many arguments counsel advanced in support of his position 
  that the evidence of the complainants was not credible or reliable.  Counsel 
  made only brief reference to collusion in his closing address.  As a matter 
  of common sense, the jury would understand the effect of collusion on the complainants’ 
  credibility and reliability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Defence counsel did not object to the trial judge’s failure to relate 
  the allegation of collusion to the complainants’ credibility.  No doubt, counsel 
  was satisfied that his position was made clear in his closing address and that 
  nothing said by the trial judge diminished the force of the argument he had 
  put to the jury.  The trial judge is entitled to look to counsel for assistance 
  when determining which of various factual features pertinent to the issues are 
  sufficiently important to the position of the defence to require their review 
  by the trial judge.  In the absence of any specific request that the trial judge 
  relate the allegation of collusion to the complainants’ credibility, it cannot 
  be said that he committed reversible error in failing to do so.  </p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>II</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the course of their closing addresses, counsel for the appellant 
  and the Crown made certain comments concerning the absence of evidence of any 
  medical examination of the three complainants.  The submissions by both counsel 
  contained an element of speculation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant objected to Crown counsel’s remarks.  The 
  trial judge told the jury that there was “probably no evidence” to support Crown 
  counsel’s remarks.  The trial judge made no reference to the speculation underlying 
  counsel for the appellant’s remarks.  The trial judge also told the jury that, 
  “I don’t think anything turns on it”.  We agree with the trial judge’s assessment 
  of the relative insignificance of the comments made concerning the absence of 
  any medical examination of the complainants.  We also think that his instructions 
  concerning Crown counsel’s submissions were satisfactory and were consistent 
  with the state of the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>III</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also seeks leave to appeal sentence.  The trial judge 
  imposed sentences totalling 8 years.  We see no error in principle in his reasons 
  and we cannot say that the totality of the sentences imposed is clearly excessive.  
  The appellant was the grandfather of the three young victims and was in a position 
  of trust.  While the children were under his care, he abused that trust in an 
  egregious way.  The assaults were among the most serious that can be committed.  
  One involved rape and another, the penetration of the victim’s anus.  The appellant 
  was convicted in 1990 of gross indecency with his own daughter and sentenced 
  to 17 months in jail.  These factors combine to justify the lengthy sentence 
  imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is 
  granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
