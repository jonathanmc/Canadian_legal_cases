<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lucien A. Beaulieu dated August 10, 
  2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> O’Connell J. found that the order of Speigel J. was obtained on incomplete 
  financial statements resulting in non-disclosure.  He found that it was evident 
  that the appellant had a beneficial interest in the property at 19 Ruden Crescent.  
  He therefore held that there was a genuine issue for trial with respect to equalization 
  of the parties’ respective Net Family Property and ordered a trial of that issue.  
  The order of O’Connell&nbsp;J. was not appealed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial came before Beaulieu J.  The appellant submits that the trial 
  judge erred in finding that the property at 19 Ruden Crescent had any value 
  since during the marriage, although he and the respondent were living in the 
  home, he did not have legal title to it.  In our view, the trial judge properly 
  rejected that submission.  There was evidence, especially from the appellant’s 
  own affidavit filed in other proceedings, that he was not only the beneficial 
  owner of the home but that this interest had some value on valuation day.  It 
  was open to the trial judge to make this finding even if the appellant had to 
  pursue litigation to obtain legal title.  The definition of “property” in the 
  <i>Family Law Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. F.4 is very wide and <i>inter alia</i> 
  includes any interest “present or future, vested or <u>contingent</u>” [emphasis 
  added.].  This definition is wide enough to include a beneficial interest.  
  See <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk</i> (1989), 23 R.F.L. (3d) 337 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant adduced no credible evidence to rebut the evidence of 
  the respondent as to the value of this beneficial interest.  It was therefore 
  open to the trial judge to accept the respondent’s evidence as to value and 
  thereby calculate the equalization payment as contemplated in the order of O’Connell 
  J.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the respondent has explained the apparent error in paragraph 
  10 of the reasons for judgment, which in any event was not carried over into 
  the judgment.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are also not persuaded that there is any basis for interfering with 
  the trial judge’s conclusion that the respondent was entitled to pre-judgment 
  interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.  Counsel for the respondent 
  sought costs on a substantial indemnity basis.  At the request of counsel for 
  the appellant we did not hear costs submissions at the hearing of the appeal.  
  Counsel for the appellant will have seven days to serve and file written submissions 
  with respect to the scale of costs and quantum.  Counsel for the respondent 
  will have seven days to respond to those submissions and counsel for the appellant 
  will have three days to reply.  </p>
