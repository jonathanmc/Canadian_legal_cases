    <span
lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>The case arose out of an 
    undercover operation set up by the police to determine whether retail outlets 
    which sold certain starter pistols that could be converted to fire live ammunition 
    were selling them with knowledge that they would be used in criminal events. 
    King Sol’s was one of the stores targeted by the police. The appellant was 
    an employee of King Sol’s, a sporting goods store that sold real and replica 
    guns as well as starter pistols that fired blank cartridges. Guns, including 
    starter pistols, were kept in a separate room and displayed behind a locked 
    glass case.</span></p>

    at King Sol’s on July 7, 1999. He asked the appellant to see a Baretta starter 
    pistol. The appellant responded that they do not take them out of the case. 
    The officer told him he was looking to buy one or more for himself and his 
    friends, that he wanted to drill it out but did not know how to do it and 
    asked the appellant if he knew. The appellant responded that he did not know, 
    that he did not want to talk about it and said: “That’s a lot of trouble.” 
    The trial judge inferred that he meant trouble with the police. The officer 
    inquired about getting a deal on seven starter pistols and some .32 calibre 
    ammunition, indicated that he wanted to ask his friends if they wanted to 
    make the purchase that day, and left. </span></p>

    officer directed him to purchase only one pistol and some ammunition that 
    day. He then returned to King Sol’s and told the appellant he wanted to purchase 
    one Kimar 92 (the Baretta) and some ammunition. He asked the appellant to 
    show him where the screw was that had to be removed before drilling the pistol. 
    The appellant removed a red tab out of the barrel with pliers, then handed 
    the pistol back with the muzzle up. The officer looked into the barrel, saw 
    a metal piece, and asked if that was what had to be screwed out. The appellant 
    did not respond and only shrugged his shoulders. The appellant sold the officer 
    the pistol and was prepared to sell him the .32 calibre ammunition, but refused 
    to sell the ammunition because the officer did not have a driver’s license 
    which was required.</span></p>

    the pistol because his friends wanted to drill out the guns, and the appellant 
    said he did not know how, that he did not do that and that “whatever they

    blank ammunition and that he was concerned about its integrity if live ammunition 
    were fired from it, although on testing with live ammunition, the pistol did 
    not crack. He also explained that the red plug in the pistol must be removed

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The issue in this case therefore came down 
    to whether the starter pistols that the appellant sold to the undercover officer 
    were deemed not to be firearms in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the defence, finding 
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the pistols sold to the officer were not designed 
    exclusively for firing blank cartridges and therefore did not meet the first 
    requirement of the section. He also made a finding beyond a reasonable doubt 
    that the appellant knew he was not authorized to sell the pistols to the officer 
    without a proper government license to purchase, because the officer had told 
    him that he intended to drill out the pistols for use as real guns.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On appeal the appellant argues that the trial 
    judge erred in finding that the Kimar 92 starter pistols were not designed 
    exclusively for firing blank cartridges. He points to the evidence of the 
    Crown expert who said that, although the pistols were easily convertible, 
    they were designed and intended to fire blanks. Furthermore, their structure 
    was such that they were not built to withstand the pressure of firing live 
    ammunition.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s position is that the trial judge’s 
    finding was correct because the test for exclusive design is an objective, 
    not a subjective one, and is determined by the convertibility of the starter 
    pistols to real guns. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the Crown’s submission does not 
    take account of the definition of “firearm” in s. 2 of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Code</i>, which includes the convertibility 
    feature. Clearly the fact that a starter pistol is easily convertible into 
    an operating gun cannot by itself determine that the pistol was not designed 
    exclusively to fire blanks. If that were the case, then no firearm caught 
    by the adaptability portion of the definition in s. 2 could ever be deemed 
    not to be a firearm under s. 84(3)(b), making that section ineffective and 
    redundant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However, even if the trial judge erred in 
    the test he applied for determining that the evidence established that the 
    pistols were not designed exclusively for firing blank cartridges, the position 
    of the appellant cannot be sustained in any event because of the second component 
    of s. 84(3)(b). The trial judge made a specific finding, amply supported by 
    the evidence, that the appellant knew that the officer intended to drill out 
    the pistols for use as real guns. As the requirements of s. 84(3)(b) are conjunctive, 
    even if it can be said that the pistols were designed exclusively to fire 
    blank cartridges, the appellant fails to benefit from the operation of s. 
    84(3)(b) because, at the time he sold the pistols, he did not intend that 
    they would be used exclusively to fire blanks. On the contrary, he knew the 
    officer was going to convert them to be able to fire live ammunition.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant also argues that he did not 
    have the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mens rea</i> to commit the 
    offences because he could not have known that the trial judge would find that 
    the pistols were not designed exclusively for firing blanks and were therefore 
    firearms within the s. 2 definition. Again the appellant has focused on the 
    wrong portion of s. 84(3)(b). Because he sold the starter pistols to the undercover 
    officer knowing the officer’s intent to convert them to real guns, he had 
    the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mens rea</i> for trafficking in 
    firearms and possession of firearms for the purpose of trafficking.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However, one can postulate a case where the 
    evidence is: (a) an accused salesperson reasonably believed that the starter 
    pistols were designed exclusively for firing blanks; (b) the accused intended 
    to sell the starter pistol to a person for use only as a starter pistol; (c) 
    at trial, a finding is made that in fact the starter pistols were not designed 
    exclusively to fire blanks. Consequently, although both subsections of s.&nbsp;84(3)(b) 
    are not met, it could be argued that the accused has no criminal knowledge 
    or intent and therefore no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mens rea</i> to commit an offence. Such circumstances 
    might well form a proper basis for raising the argument that the appellant 
    sought to raise with regard to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mens rea</i> requirement in the operation of s. 83(3)(b). I do not, however, 
    have to deal with the argument on the evidence and findings made by the trial 
    judge in this case.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s second ground of appeal is 
    that the trial judge made interjections in the proceedings by making comments 
    to the Crown Attorney and questioning Crown witnesses, which either deprived 
    the appellant of a fair trial or destroyed the appearance of a fair trial. 
    While I agree that it would have been preferable for the trial judge to refrain 
    from interjecting and making comments on extraneous matters, it is clear that 
    his interjections were innocuous and essentially harmless and in no way affected 
    the fairness or the appearance of fairness in this case. </span></p>
