<p><b>On appeal from order of Justice Thomas R. Lofchik dated March 28, 2000.</b></p>
<p><b>BORINS J.A.:</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue in this appeal is the effect of an unsuccessful motion to 
  discharge a certificate of pending litigation (“CPL”) on a subsequent action 
  for damages under s. 103(4) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. C.43 (“CJA”) by the prospective purchasers of the land against which the 
  CPL had been registered.  On a motion under s.&nbsp;103(6)(a)(ii) to discharge 
  the CPL, which had been registered by Allan Beattie, the respondent in this 
  appeal, McTurk J., declined to discharge the CPL on the basis of his finding 
  that Mr. Beattie had “a reasonable claim to an interest in [the] land”.  Lofchik 
  J. dismissed the prospective purchasers’ claim for damages against Mr. Beattie 
  under s.&nbsp;103(4) of the CJA on the ground that the order of McTurk J., being 
  <i>res judicata</i>, precluded their action.  The prospective purchasers have 
  appealed from the dismissal of their action.  For the reasons that follow, I 
  would allow the appeal.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>The facts</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The facts are brief and are contained in an agreed statement of facts. 
  At the opening of trial, in reliance on the agreed facts the respondent moved 
  under rule 21.01(1)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> for the determination 
  of a question of law that he contended was determinative of the appellants’ 
  claim for damages under s. 103(4) of the CJA.  The question of law was whether 
  of McTurk J.’s finding that Mr. Beattie had “a reasonable claim to an interest 
  in [the] land” was determinative of the appellants’ s.&nbsp;103(4) claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The real property in issue had been the matrimonial home of the respondent 
  and his estranged wife, Nellie May Moore, which they owned as joint tenants.  
  Pursuant to the terms of their separation agreement, Mr. Beattie transferred 
  his interest in the property to Ms. Moore.  However, he retained a right of 
  first refusal to purchase the property in the event that Ms. Moore decided to 
  sell it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Moore decided to sell the property to the appellants. Their agreement 
  of purchase and sale was conditional upon Mr. Beattie declining to exercise 
  his right of first refusal prior to a specific time and date.  A dispute arose 
  between Mr. Beattie and Ms.&nbsp;Moore over his purported exercise of the right 
  of first refusal.  This resulted in a legal proceeding between them commenced 
  by Mr. Beattie in which he sought to enforce his right to first refusal to purchase 
  the property.  Consequent to that proceeding he obtained and registered a CPL 
  on the title to the property prior to the closing date for the appellants’ purchase 
  of the property.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the appellants would not complete the transaction while the CPL was 
  registered against the property, Ms. Moore moved, unsuccessfully, for an order 
  discharging the CPL.  Subsequently, arising from circumstances irrelevant to 
  this appeal, Mr. Beattie purchased the property.  As a result, the appellants 
  commenced this proceeding against Ms. Moore and Mr. Beattie, seeking damages 
  for breach of contract against her and damages under s. 103(4) of the CJA against 
  him.  Lofchik J. awarded the appellants damages of $50,430 against Ms. Moore, 
  who did not defend the action and, as I have indicated, dismissed their claim 
  against Mr. Beattie.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>The relevant legislation</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The relevant legislation is s. 103(1) (4) and (6) of the CJA, which 
  reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>103. – (1) The commencement of a proceeding in which an interest in land 
      is in question is not notice of the proceeding to a person who is not a 
      party until a certificate of pending litigation is issued by the court and 
      the certificate is registered in the proper land registry office under subsection 
      (2).</p>
    <p> (4)  A party who registers a certificate under subsection (2) without 
      a reasonable claim to an interest in the land is liable for any damages 
      sustained by any person as a result of its registration.</p>
    <p> (6)  The court may make an order discharging a certificate<i>,</i></p>
    <p>(a) where the party at whose instance it was issued,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> (i) claims a sum of money in place of or as an alternative to the interest 
        in the land claimed,</p>
      <p> (ii) <i>does not have a reasonable claim to the interest in the land 
        claimed</i>, or</p>
      <p> (iii) does not prosecute the proceeding with reasonable diligence;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(b) where the interests of the party at whose instance it was issued can 
      be adequately protected by another form of security; or</p>
    <p> (c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>on any other ground that 
      is considered just,</p>
    <p>and the court may, in making the order, impose such terms as to the giving 
      of security or otherwise as the court considers just. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p><b>Reasons of McTurk J.</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It was in the context of the action brought against her by Mr. Beattie 
  that Ms.&nbsp;Moore moved under s. 103(6)(a)(<i>ii</i>) to discharge the CPL 
  that Mr. Beattie had registered against the title to the property.  The motion 
  was heard one week before Ms. Moore’s transaction with the appellants was to 
  be completed.  Mr. Beattie filed an affidavit in response to the motion in which 
  he provided facts in support of his claim against Ms. Moore.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> McTurk J. endorsed the following reasons for refusing to discharge the 
  CPL:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I find that the Plaintiff has a reasonable claim to an interest in land.  
      Furthermore on the equities and considering the particular circumstances 
      including the unique interest of the Plaintiff in the land; that there is 
      no alternative claim for damages by the Plaintiff; that damages could adequately 
      compensate the Defendant if she was successful at Trial; that to vacate 
      the Certificate of Pending Litigation would virtually erase the Plaintiff’s 
      claim, I hold that the Application to discharge the Certificate of Pending 
      Litigation be dismissed. Costs in the cause.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is significant to observe that Mr. Beattie’s responding affidavit 
  contained this acknowledgment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>41. I am aware of the provisions of Section 116(4) [now s. 103(4)] of the 
      <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, S.O. 1984, c. 11 as amended which provides 
      that I can be held liable for any damages sustained by <u>any</u> person 
      (including GPI Greenfield Pioneer Inc.) as a result of the registration 
      of the Certificate of Pending Litigation if this Honourable Court should 
      later determine that the Certificate was registered without a reasonable 
      claim to the interest in the land.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Reasons of Lofchik J.</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants’ claim for damages against the respondent is based on 
  two causes of action: (1) the statutory claim created by s. 103(4) of the CJA, 
  and (2) the tort of inducing a breach of contract or intentional interference 
  with contractual arrangements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the opening of trial the respondent moved for the determination of 
  two questions of law, which the trial judge described as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)   Is the finding of McTurk, J., that the plaintiff has a reasonable 
      claim to an interest in the land binding on the plaintiffs in this action 
      so as to preclude a claim for damages under s. 103(4) of the <i>Courts of 
      Justice Act</i>.</p>
    <p>(ii) Is a claim for damages founded on the tort of inducing breach of contract 
      or intentional interference with contractual arrangements arising from a 
      registration of a Certificate of Pending Litigation sustainable on the facts 
      of this case as stated above.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge gave these reasons for deciding the first question in 
  favour of the respondent:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>RES JUDICATA</i></p>
    <p>The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> or <i>issue estoppel</i>, in the context 
      of an interlocutory motion, is limited to issues which the motions judge 
      is required to decide in order to dispose of the motion before him.  <i>VK 
      Mason Construction Ltd. v. Canadian General Insurance Group Ltd.</i> 42 
      OR (3d) 618.</p>
    <p>In deciding whether or not to vacate the Certificate of Pending Litigation, 
      McTurk, J. was required to decide whether Beattie had a reasonable claim 
      to an interest in land.  Having made this finding, his decision is a decision 
      <i>in rem</i> and the matter is <i>res judicata</i> in respect of any claims 
      for damages under s. 103(4) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, and it 
      is not open for the plaintiffs in this action to re-litigate the issue.  
      Therefore, any claim for damages in this action based on s.&nbsp;103(4) 
      of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> must fail.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also answered the second question in favour of the respondent.  
  Although the appellants have appealed from both findings, in oral argument their 
  counsel conceded that the appellants’ real attack is upon the correctness of 
  the trial judge’s answer to the first question.  Although counsel contended 
  that the trial judge had also erred in his answer to the second question, he 
  did not pursue this ground of appeal indicating that if the appellants were 
  successful on the first ground they would only pursue their claim for damages 
  under s. 103(4) of the CJA.  Accordingly, I will express no opinion on the second 
  ground of appeal.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>Analysis</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the trial judge erred in finding that the decision of McTurk 
  J. was a decision <i>in rem</i> and that “the matter is <i>res judicata</i> 
  in respect of any claims for damages under s. 103(4)” of the CJA.  A brief review 
  of the nature and purpose of a CPL and the nature of a motion to discharge a 
  CPL will be helpful in explaining why I have reached this conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 103(1) of the CJA entitles a plaintiff, who has commenced a 
  proceeding in which an interest in land is in question, to obtain a CPL and 
  to register it against the title to the land.  The registration of the CPL protects 
  the plaintiff by effectively preventing disposition of the property prior to 
  judgment.  As such, a CPL can be as effective as an interlocutory injunction 
  in restraining dealings with the property as, generally speaking, it is considered 
  to be an encumbrance on the land.  See <i>Brock v. Crawford</i> (1908), 11 O.W.R. 
  143 at 146 (H.C.).  No rights are given by a CPL.  The effect of registration 
  of a CPL on the title to land is to give notice that rights in respect to the 
  land are being claimed in a pending court proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As severe hardship may result to the owner of the land as the result 
  of the registration of a CPL, s. 103(6) confers a broad discretion on the court 
  to discharge a CPL and, depending on the circumstances, to impose appropriate 
  terms.  As the practical effect of a CPL is similar to that of an interlocutory 
  injunction restraining dealing with the land, to discourage abuse s. 103(4) 
  imposes liability for damages resulting from the registration of a CPL where 
  the registrant is “without a reasonable claim to an interest in the land”.  
  For an historical discussion of a certificate of <i>lis pendens</i>, which was 
  the term by which a CPL was previously known, see W.B. Williston and R.J. Rolls, 
  <i>The Law of Civil Procedure</i>, (Toronto: Butterworths, 1970) Vol. 2, at 
  599-607 and <i>Brock v. Crawford, supra</i>, at pp. 145-147.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Subsection 103(6) confers a broad discretion upon the court to discharge 
  a CPL upon a demonstration by the defendant in the action in which the CPL was 
  obtained of any of the grounds contained in the subsection, the last of which 
  invites an examination of the equities as between the parties.  How such discretion 
  is to be exercised was described by Steele J. in <i>Clock Investments Ltd. v. 
  Hardwood Estates Ltd.</i> (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 671 at 674 (Div. Ct.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am of the opinion that the governing test is that the Judge must exercise 
      his discretion in equity and look at all of the relative matters between 
      the parties in determining whether or not the certificate should be vacated.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, Ms. Moore based her motion to discharge the respondent’s 
  CPL on s. 103(6)(a)(ii), contending that he did not have a reasonable interest 
  in the land claimed.  In <i>Procopio v. D’Abbandanza</i>, [1970] 1 O.R. 127 
  at 128, this court stated that a certificate of <i>lis pendens</i> should not 
  be discharged where “there is a triable issue as between the parties as to an 
  interest in the lands in question”.  It is significant for the purpose of the 
  issue raised in this appeal that at p. 128 the court went on to make it clear 
  that in finding that there was a triable issue as to an interest in the lands 
  it was “not in any way deciding the rights of the parties in any respect, either 
  as to the lease, the assignment of the lease or the right to register the assignment 
  of the lease”, which were the issues to be decided in the pending action.  See, 
  also, <i>Brock v. Crawford, supra</i>, at p. 147; <i>Inwood v. Ivey</i>, [1939] 
  O.W.N. 56 at 58 (H.C.); <i>Re Willoughby and Knight</i> (1974), 1 O.R. (2d) 
  184 at 195 (H.C.); <i>Galinski v. Jurashek</i> (1976), 1 C.P.C. 68 (Ont. H.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the cases to which I have referred were concerned with the 
  test to be applied on a motion to discharge a certificate of <i>lis pendens</i> 
  obtained under the relevant provisions of the <i>Judicature Act</i> prior to 
  its replacement by s. 103(1) of the CJA, which introduced the term CPL, there 
  is no reason in principle why the earlier jurisprudence should not apply to 
  a motion under s. 103(6) of the CJA.  Indeed, cases which have been decided 
  since the CJA came into force in 1984 continue to apply the earlier jurisprudence.  
  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Graywood Developments Ltd. v. Campeau Corporation</i> (1985), 
  8 C.P.C. (2d) 58 (Ont. Master); <i>Chiu v. Pacific Mall Development Inc.</i> 
  (1998), 24 C.P.C. (4th) 67 (Ont. Gen. Div.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It follows that on the motion to discharge the CPL the onus was on the 
  moving party, Ms. Moore, to demonstrate that there was no triable issue in respect 
  to whether the respondent had “a reasonable claim to the interest in the land 
  claimed”.  As such, the onus is analogous to that of a defendant seeking a summary 
  judgment dismissing a plaintiff’s claim under Rule 20 of the <i>Rules of Civil 
  Procedure</i>.  As on a Rule 20 motion, the role of the motion judge was not 
  to find as a fact whether the respondent had, or did not have, “a reasonable 
  claim to the interest in the land” which was the subject of the claim in his 
  action against Ms. Moore.  That issue remained to be determined at the trial 
  of the pending action.  Just as the finding of a motion judge on a Rule 20 motion 
  that a genuine issue for trial exists in respect to a plaintiff’s claim cannot 
  support a plea of <i>res judicata</i> at the trial of that issue, neither can 
  a finding of a motion judge on a s. 103(6) motion to discharge a CPL that there 
  is a triable issue in respect to whether the registrant has a reasonable claim 
  to the interest in the land support a plea of <i>res judicata </i>at the trial 
  of a claim for damages under s. 103(4) of the CJA.  This is because no adjudication 
  of the registrant’s interest in the land is required on a motion to discharge

  </span> Moreover, to preclude a claim for damages under s. 103(4) of the CJA 
  on the basis of a ruling under s. 103(6) would be contrary to the principles 
  on which a plea of <i>res judicata</i> is based.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>420093 
  B.C. Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal</i> (1995), 128 D.L.R. (4th) 488 (Alta. C.A.).  
  If a ruling on a motion to discharge a CPL could properly be considered as determinative 
  of whether a registrant had a reasonable claim to an interest in the land, this 
  would render meaningless a claim for damages under s. 103(4).</p>

  </span> Although in his reasons for declining to discharge the CPL McTurk J. 
  appears to have made a finding that the respondent had a reasonable claim to 
  an interest in land, it was not necessary for him to do so.  Read as a whole, 
  his reasons indicate that he appreciated that in ruling on the motion he was 
  exercising the discretion conferred by s.&nbsp;103(6).  In my view, it is clear 
  that in declining to discharge the CPL McTurk J. correctly applied the test 
  on a motion under s. 103(6)(a)(ii), namely, whether there is a triable issue 
  as to the reasonableness of the registrant’s claim to an interest in the land.  
  There is no doubt that the evidence in the respondent’s affidavit opposing the 
  motion to discharge the CPL supports such a result.  The functional effect of 
  McTurk J.’s ruling was to permit the registration of the CPL to remain on the 
  title to the property pending the trial of the respondent’s claim against Ms. 
  Moore.  As he did not adjudicate the issue raised by the appellants in this 
  action, his ruling cannot preclude the appellants from doing so.  </p>

  </span> It follows that the trial judge was incorrect in holding that McTurk 
  J.’s decision gave rise to a successful plea of <i>res judicata</i> in this 
  action.  It appears that the trial judge, in concluding that “McTurk J. was 
  required to decide whether Beattie had a reasonable claim to an interest in 
  land”, did not appreciate that the role of the court on a motion to discharge 
  a CPL under s.&nbsp;103(6)(a)(<i>ii</i>) of the CJA is limited to deciding whether 
  there is a triable issue in respect to whether the registrant has a reasonable 
  claim to the interest in the land claimed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This conclusion conforms with the caution issued by this court in <i>Procopio, 
  supra</i>, at p. 128 that the result of a motion to discharge a certificate 
  of <i>lis pendens</i> is not determinative of the issue of whether the registrant 
  in fact has a reasonable interest in the land claimed.  This was also the opinion 
  of Henry J. in <i>Mormick Investments Inc. v. Khoury</i>, [1985] O.J. No. 1072 
  (H.C.), which was a claim for damages arising out of the registration of cautions 
  against the plaintiffs’ lands.  Prior to the action, Linden J. had vacated one 
  of the cautions on the ground that the defendant had no interest in the land.  
  Henry J. rejected the submission that the issue decided by Linden J. was <i>res 
  judicata</i>.  At para. 37, Henry J. stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While [Linden J.] clearly found that the plaintiff had no interest in the 
      lands the proceeding before him was interlocutory in nature, designed to 
      decide only whether the cautions ought to remain on title until trial, or 
      be vacated.  The motion to vacate them was not appropriate to dispose of 
      the issue finally; to say that it had that effect would have the result 
      that, because the motions court judge found on affidavit evidence that the 
      plaintiff could not succeed as the material before him disclosed no interest 
      in the land, it would foreclose to the plaintiff the resolution of the action 
      on its merits at a full trial.</p>
  </blockquote>

  </span> It would also appear that the respondent, in paragraph 41 of his affidavit 
  in response to the motion to discharge the CPL which I have set out in paragraph 
  9, was of the opinion that the purpose of the motion was not to adjudicate whether 
  he had a reasonable claim to an interest in the land.  In his affidavit he acknowledged 
  his potential liability under what is now s. 103(4) of the CJA should the court 
  “later determine that the Certificate was registered without a reasonable claim 
  to the interest in the land”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, I would add that the trial judge also erred in characterizing 
  the order of McTurk J. as “a decision <i>in rem</i>”.  As McTurk J. was not 
  adjudicating whether the respondent had a reasonable claim to an interest in 
  land, his ruling did not amount to a judgment upon the rights and claims to 
  the land asserted by the parties to the action in which the CPL had been obtained.  
  Indeed, no rights are given by a CPL; its entire effect is only to serve as 
  notice that rights in land are being claimed.  Although obtaining and registering 
  a CPL may have the effect of turning the action in which it was obtained from 
  an action <i>in personam</i> into an action <i>in rem</i>, it is only if the 
  result of the action is a determination of the title to the property, or some 
  interest therein, that the action would result in a judgment <i>in rem</i>.  
  See <i>McTaggart v. Toothe</i> (1884), 10 P.R. 261 at 262 (Ont. Ch.).</p>

  </span> For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment 
  of the trial judge dismissing the appellants’ action and order that the respondent’s 
  motion made at the outset of the trial be dismissed insofar as it pertains to 
  the appellants’ claim for damages under s. 103(4) of the CJA with the costs 
  of the motion reserved to the judge hearing the appellants’ claim.  The appellants 
  are entitled to their costs of this appeal.</p>
