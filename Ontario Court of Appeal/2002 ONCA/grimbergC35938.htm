<p class=headingtitle><b><u><span
lang=EN-US>FELDMAN J.A.</span></u></b><span lang=EN-US>:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant pled guilty to 5 counts of making a false statement 
  and 5 counts of tax evasion involving collection and failure to remit $617,940.66 
  of GST, contrary to the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>. He was sentenced to a conditional 
  sentence of 12 months, a fine of $617,940.66, and 9 months imprisonment in default 
  of payment of a portion of the fine within 12 months. The appellant appealed 
  from two aspects of the sentence: (1) certain of the strict house arrest conditions 
  imposed for the first 8 months of the sentence; and (2) the imprisonment in 
  default of payment of the fine.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>After serving 5 months on the stricter conditions of house 
  arrest imposed by the trial judge, the appellant was granted bail pending appeal, 
  which did not include house arrest. In the circumstances, Crown counsel did 
  not press the court to retain those terms for a further three months of the 
  conditional sentence once the appellant recommences service of that sentence. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant is a widower, 80 years old. In his reasons 
  for sentence, the trial judge noted that the seriousness of the offences, including 
  the deliberate retention of such a significant amount of GST collected as agent 
  for the government, warranted a penitentiary sentence. It was because of the 
  age and circumstances of the appellant that the trial judge imposed the 12-month 
  conditional sentence but with the strict terms of house arrest. However, the 
  trial judge was satisfied that the state of the law was that a conditional sentence 
  was not available in respect of a term of imprisonment in default of payment 
  of a fine. As a result, having concluded that a term of imprisonment in default 
  was a necessary part of the sentence in this case, he imposed a 9-month term 
  of imprisonment in default, if $101,472.53 of the fine was not paid within 12 
  months.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>When this appeal was argued, counsel were aware that the 
  argument in the case of <i>R. v. Wu</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 4885 (C.A.) was scheduled 
  to be heard within a short time before another panel of the court. That case 
  involved the issue of the availability of a conditional sentence in default 
  of payment of a fine. Counsel took two alternative positions on this appeal: 
  the first was that the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant had 
  the ability to pay a portion of the fine, and therefore no term of imprisonment 
  in lieu of payment should have been imposed; in the alternative, depending on 
  the result in <i>Wu</i>, the term of imprisonment in lieu of payment of the 
  fine should be converted to a conditional sentence for the same reasons that 
  the original term of imprisonment was imposed as a conditional sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>For the reasons which follow, I would allow the appeal, convert 
  the term of imprisonment in default of payment of $101,472.53 of the fine to 
  a 9-month conditional sentence on the same terms and conditions as those imposed 
  by the trial judge for the last 4 months of the original 12-month conditional 
  sentence and, as further described below, direct that the appellant complete 
  his 12-month sentence by serving the remaining 7 months of the sentence on the 
  house arrest conditions imposed by the trial judge for the last 4 months of 
  the original sentence.</p>

  <span>      </span>Subsections (4) and (5) of that section provide for a deemed 
  period of incarceration in default of payment of a fine, together with a prescribed 
  method of calculation of the period of incarceration. The sections that follow 
  s. 734 form a new scheme recently enacted by Parliament which allows a convicted 
  person with a sentence which includes the payment of a fine to have every opportunity 
  to pay the fine or make arrangements to pay it, with imprisonment in default 
  to be used only as a last resort in circumstances where a person effectively 
  refuses to pay a fine which he or she is able to pay.</p>

  <span>      </span>The trial judge was concerned about the duration of the deemed

  to follow the decision of Donnelly&nbsp;J. in <i>R. v. Terracina</i>, [1999] 
  O.J. No. 5404 (S.C.) where he held that the deeming provision only applied when 
  the trial judge did not state otherwise. Donnelly&nbsp;J. then went on to use 
  s. 718.3(3) of the <i>Code</i>, which gives a trial judge discretion with regard 
  to the imposition of imprisonment in default. <a href="#_ftn1"

  </span></span> On the appeal, Crown counsel has pointed out that because these 
  offences occurred before the deemed imprisonment provisions of s. 734 applied 
  to offences under the Excise Tax Act (July 1, 1999), the deeming provisions 
  of that section were not retroactively applicable in this case and, for that 
  reason, the trial judge was entitled to proceed under s. 718.3(3) of the Code 
  on the issue of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge recognized that although he 
  was obliged to impose the minimum fine, he could not impose a term of imprisonment 
  in default unless he was satisfied that the appellant had the ability to pay 
  the fine. See: <i>R. v. Nattrall </i>(1972), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 390 B.C.C.A.,<i> 
  R. v. Rasper </i>(1978), 1 C.R. (3d) S-45 (Ont. C.A.), <i>R. v. Q.I.X. Computer 
  Corp.</i>,<i> </i>[1992] B.C.J. No. 1046 (B.C.C.A.). The guilty plea had proceeded

  hearing, although submissions were made by counsel for the appellant and for 
  the Crown. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The agreed statement of facts disclosed that 
  the appellant controlled the two jewellery companies which collected the GST, 
  and that he had collected it and deposited it into the corporate bank accounts 
  for which he had signing authority. He had failed to co-operate with revenue 
  authorities in the investigation. Finally, “the GST collected, but not remitted, 
  remained with the corporations as profit. As sole shareholder, Grimberg was 
  the beneficiary of the annual profits enjoyed by the accused corporations.”

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At the sentencing hearing, defence counsel submitted 
  on behalf of Mr. Grimberg that he was unable to pay any fine. Although he could 
  not demonstrate and prove where and when the money had gone, he no longer had 
  any of the GST funds as he had spent the money in two ways, on his wife whom 
  he took to the United States for medical treatments, and to pay very high interest 
  to private lenders from whom he had borrowed when he started up the business. 
  In submissions, Crown counsel confirmed to the trial judge that the accountant 
  who conducted the investigation could find no entries in the books indicating 
  that any of the funds in issue had been expended. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is clear from reviewing the transcript of 
  the sentencing hearing that the trial judge was concerned about the state of 
  the evidentiary record before him on the issue of ability to pay, as well as 
  the onus of proof. For example, toward the end of the transcript, the trial 
  judge had this exchange with defence counsel:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT: I think I’ve asked you both about the ability 
      to pay, i.e. what happened to the $600,000. So, if that’s an issue before 
      I could make a default order that I have to be satisfied about an ability 
      to pay, I’m just wondering is - satisfied on a balance of probabilities 
      that he has an ability to pay, is that the standard that I’m to meet if 
      I’m to make that order. If so, Mr. Veltri, I asked him why that number as 
      opposed to some other number, and I heard what he had to say, and I would 
      ask you the same thing. Your client has admitted in the facts that he had 
      these monies, you say there is nothing left, and I’m told it went to interest 
      payments, to business expenses, and to paying for his wife’s health. Am

    <p><span lang=EN-US>MR. FYSH: Yes.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT: What happened to it, it seems to be a great 
      mystery in this case, but if there is no evidence am I just to make an inference 
      or make a determination and if so on what standard of proof, there is no 
      evidence from the Crown, the Crown hasn’t filed a schedule saying here we 
      went through the books, here’s all the cheques to cash, you know, that – 
      here’s clearly what came out of the company that isn’t, we can’t really 
      identify. I don’t have anything like that from the defence, what do you 
      say the judge is supposed to do? And on what standard?</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel informed the court that the 
  appellant had only $1,000 per month as a government pension and therefore was 
  not able to pay the fine. Crown counsel was prepared to concede that some of 
  the impugned funds had been spent and that the appellant lived a thrifty lifestyle 
  so that there was no evidence of conspicuous consumption. The Crown took the 
  position, based on fairness and the fact that some but not all of the money 
  had been spent, that the appellant could pay 1/6 of the fine:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT: Is it fair to say that it’s what you, as the 
      prosecutor in charge of the case, feel comfortable with as submitting to 
      the court is reasonable and fair?</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>MR. VELTRI: Yes. It may be that – it may be that more 
      of that money is left and maybe – it may be that less of that money is left 
      but it’s more likely that more of the money is left than less is the best 
      way I can summarize it for you.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons for sentence on 
  this issue, the trial judge said the following:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Coming back to my earlier remarks, I am satisfied that 
      Mr.&nbsp;Grimberg has not been candid with the court regarding the whereabouts 
      of these monies and his ability to either make restitution or pay fines…In 
      my view, in light of the inquiry made during the sentencing hearing, it 
      cannot be said that Mr. Grimberg has no ability to pay either some or all 
      of these fines. In the absence of any plausible explanation and in view 
      of what I find to be the indisputable evidence that he received these funds 
      and the evidence that there is no paper trail, some degree of imprisonment 
      in default is required. In my view, the position submitted by Mr. Veltri 
      on behalf of the Crown is extremely fair. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then proceeded to impose separate 
  fines in respect of the separate counts, and to impose concurrent 9 month terms 
  of imprisonment in default of 5 of the fines totalling $101,472.53. He concluded 
  by noting that he considered that he was unable to impose a conditional sentence 
  for the term of imprisonment in default, but that had he been able to, he would 
  have done so on the same terms imposed for the first 8 months of the sentence. 
  Finally, although in his submissions counsel for the appellant advised the court 
  that the appellant would not benefit from time to pay the fine, after hearing 
  the sentence of the court he was invited to change that position and did so. 
  He asked for 24 months to pay, and the judge ordered 12 months to pay.</span></p>

  </span></span> The appellant says that the trial judge erred by putting the 
  onus on the appellant to satisfy the court that he did not have the ability 
  to pay the fine, whereas it was the Crown  who had the onus to satisfy the court 
  that the appellant did have the ability to pay, before a term of imprisonment 
  in default of payment could be imposed.</p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As stated in paragraph 11 above, the trial judge recognized that 
  although he was obliged to impose the minimum fine, he could not impose a term 
  of imprisonment in default unless he was satisfied that the appellant had the 
  ability to pay the fine. Where the trial judge can be satisfied, based on the 
  evidence adduced at the trial or on the guilty plea, that the accused has the 
  ability to pay the fine, then the evidentiary onus will shift to the accused 
  to lead evidence to the contrary. In <i>R. v. Desjardins</i> (1996), 182 N.B.R. 
  (2d) 321 (N.B.C.A.), a tobacco trafficking case,  Bastarache J.A. made the following 
  observation at para. 29:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>. . . Courts are not ignorant of the ease with which many 
      convicted persons can prove their financial incapacity by showing their 
      lack of legal financial resources at the moment of sentencing. It is for 
      this reason that, where traffickers are concerned, the courts will infer 
      financial capacity on the basis of the illegal profits realized from trafficking 
      and impose a term of imprisonment in default of payment. In this regard, 
      see <i>R. v. Jung </i>(1976), 1 C.R.(3d) S-1<i> </i>(B.C.C.A.), and <i>R. 
      v. Dow </i>(1976), 1 C.R. (3d) S-9 (B.C.C.A.). I also believe that it is 
      up to the offender who claims to be unable to pay the fine to adduce evidence 
      of his financial circumstances: see <i>R. v. Calvin</i>, [1993] R.J.Q. 1596 
      (Qué. Ct.), at p. 1602.</span></p>

  </span></span> From my review of the record,  it cannot be said that defence 
  counsel was under any misapprehension of the onus or of the fact that the Crown 
  had proved that the appellant received all of the impugned funds and that the 
  records did not disclose any disbursement of those funds. The evidential onus 
  was therefore on the appellant to explain where the funds had gone. He chose 
  to do so through submissions of his counsel. The trial judge did not accept 
  the veracity of the position taken on Mr. Grimberg’s behalf. Nothing was tendered 
  to substantiate his position. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It was open to the trial judge to accept that 
  some of the funds may have been expended by the appellant in the normal course 
  or as submitted by his counsel, and to therefore impose a term of imprisonment 
  in default of payment for only a portion of the minimum fine. The evidential 
  onus remained on the appellant to refute the evidence that he had received the 
  funds and that they had not been expended. It was open to the trial judge to 
  reject the submissions of appellant’s counsel that he no longer had the funds 
  and to find that the appellant had not displaced the proof on the record that 
  he had retained them. I note that the appellant sought to tender some fresh 
  evidence on the appeal, but that did not include any evidence to prove the disposition 
  of the impugned funds.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s alternative submission on the 
  appeal is that the trial judge erred by holding that a conditional sentence 
  was not available in law in default of payment of the fine. Since the trial 
  and the argument of this appeal, this court has decided in <i>Wu, supra,</i> 
  that where the trial judge gives no time to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment 
  in default is a sentence of immediate imprisonment which can therefore be served 
  as a conditional sentence, if so ordered by the court.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this case, the trial judge stated that he 
  would have made the 9-month term of imprisonment in default of payment a conditional 
  sentence had he had the authority in law to do so. In my view, this was the 
  correct approach to take. Where the circumstances of the appellant are such 
  that the trial judge is satisfied that a conditional sentence is the proper 
  sentence for the accused person for the offence, in my view it is both inconsistent 
  and clearly inappropriate for that person to be in jeopardy of imprisonment 
  in respect of the same offence for failure to pay the fine imposed as part of 
  that sentence. This appellant is 80 years old. It was for that reason that the 
  trial judge determined that a conditional sentence of 12 months should be imposed 
  when the crime otherwise warranted a penitentiary sentence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At trial defence counsel originally advised 
  the court that he was not asking for time to pay any fine, consistent with his 
  position that the appellant did not have the ability to pay and would not as 
  he only had $1,000/month income. After the trial judge imposed the term of imprisonment 
  in default, the judge asked counsel if he wished to modify that position. Counsel 
  then asked for 24 months to pay. The trial judge allowed 12 months. I think 
  it can be inferred that had the trial judge had the benefit of the <i>Wu</i> 
  decision, he would have ordered no time to pay with the conditional sentence 
  in default. An order of no time is consistent with the trial judge’s conclusion 
  that the appellant has the ability to pay 1/6 of the total minimum fine.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Therefore, following this court’s decision in 
  <i>Wu</i>, it was open to the trial judge to impose a conditional sentence instead 
  of a term of imprisonment in default of payment of the designated portion of 
  the fine. I note, however, that the trial judge was not obliged to order imprisonment 
  in default. If the circumstances are such that the trial judge is of the view 
  that imprisonment is not appropriate for the particular offender, for example, 
  because of his age, and if a conditional sentence is either not available or 
  in the trial judge’s view, also not appropriate, a judge may decline to order 
  any fine, or when there is a minimum fine, decline to order a term of imprisonment 
  or conditional sentence in </span>default.  The Crown can be left with its civil 
  remedies to recover the amount of the fine if it is not paid:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

      which were to be in place for the first 8 months of the sentence. In the 
      circumstances, the appellant shall complete his 12-month sentence by serving 
      the remaining 7 months on the less onerous house arrest conditions which

      following the intended disposition of the trial judge in this case, substitute 
      an order that the appellant has no time to pay the fine and in default of 
      payment, will serve  a conditional sentence of 9 months on the same conditions

    That section has been interpreted in Terracina, supra, as only applicable 
    where the judge does not make a discretionary order. Although the trial judge 
    relied on Terracina, supra, Crown counsel on the appeal clarified that this
