  </span> This appeal arises from a prosecution under the <i>Occupational Health 
  and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (“<i>OHSA</i>”).  An employee of the 
  respondent was fatally injured by a reversing dump truck.  After five days of 
  evidence, the trial judge granted the respondent’s motion for a directed verdict.  
  The charges particularized the duty of the employer under s. 104 of <i>Ontario 
  Regulation 213/91</i> (the “Regulation”) to provide a signaller in certain circumstances.  
  The trial judge ruled that while there was evidence that a signaller was required, 
  the evidence also established that the deceased worker was acting as the signaller 
  on the day in question.  The trial judge ruled that in view of the wording of 
  the charge, it was not open to the Crown to prove the offence by showing that 
  the signaller failed to carry out the duties prescribed by s. 106 of the Regulation.  
  The Crown’s appeal to the Superior Court of Justice was dismissed.  The Crown 
  appeals, with leave, to this court. </p>
<h3>FACTS</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On July 17, 1997 Paolo Faustini, an employee of the respondent, was 
  killed when he was run over by a reversing dump truck.  At the time of the accident, 
  Faustini was the lead hand on a construction crew resurfacing a road.  The resurfacing 
  work included the deposit of a layer of crushed stone from a spreader attached 
  to the back of a dump truck.  The spreader was used while the truck reversed.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence at trial established that on the day in question, Faustini 
  was acting as both signaller and as the operator of the spreader.  There was 
  evidence that when the truck is reversing and stone is being laid, the attention 
  of the operator of the spreader must be on the flow of the crushed stone.  The 
  rate of flow of the stone has to be adjusted, using the lever at the side of 
  the spreader, to compensate for changes in the speed of the truck.  There are 
  also levers at the back of the spreader used to adjust the width of the spread.  
  These levers are ordinarily adjusted when the truck is stationary, but occasionally 
  they are adjusted by hand or with a shovel while the truck is reversing.  To 
  operate or adjust these levers, the worker has to stand directly behind the 
  spreader where the driver cannot see him.  The box of the truck obstructs the 
  truck driver’s view of the path of travel in reverse.  In particular, the driver 
  can see nothing behind the box, including the spreader.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The driver of the truck testified that on the day in question Faustini 
  was operating the spreader and giving him signals.  As the truck reversed for 
  the final time, the driver could see Faustini in the driver’s side rear view 
  mirror.  Faustini was standing on an embankment within one foot of the spreader.  
  He had one hand on the handle of the spreader and one hand on the lever controlling 
  the gate of the spreader.  He appeared to be looking underneath the spreader 
  to regulate the flow of the stone.  The driver reversed on Faustini’s signal.  
  The road turned to the left and the driver looked at his passenger side mirror.  
  As the truck reversed, the driver looked back through the driver’s side mirror.  
  He saw no one and continued to reverse.  No one actually saw the truck strike 
  Faustini.  The driver felt a bump, but only realized the truck had run over 
  Faustini when another worker saw Faustini’s body laying fifteen to twenty feet 
  in front of the truck.</p>

  </span> The respondent was charged on an information containing the following 
  three counts:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)… failing, as an employer, to ensure that the measures and procedures 
      prescribed by section 104 of Ontario Regulation 213/91, were carried out 
      at a project located in a laneway known as Jackson’s Lane, running off Lake 
      Avenue, in the City of Hamilton, contrary to section 25(1)(c) of the <i>Occupational 
      Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.</p>
    <p><u>Particulars</u>: The accused failed to ensure that the operator of a 
      dump truck was assisted by a signaller. A worker, Paolo Faustini, was killed.</p>
    <p>(2)… failing, as an employer, to take every precaution reasonable in the 
      circumstances for the protection of a worker at a workplace located in a 
      laneway known as Jackson’s Lane, running off lake Avenue, in the City of 
      Hamilton, contrary to section 25(2)(h) of the <i>Occupational Health and 
      Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.</p>
    <p><u>Particulars</u>:            The accused failed to take the reasonable 
      precaution of implementing procedures whereby a worker operating levers 
      at the back of a dump truck would not be endangered by the truck reversing.  
      A worker, Paulo Faustini, was killed.</p>
    <p>(3)… failing, as an employer, to take every precaution reasonable in the 
      circumstances for the protection of a worker at a workplace located in a 
      laneway known as Jackson’s Lane, running off Lake Avenue, in the City of 
      Hamilton, contrary to section 25(2)(h) of the <i>Occupational Health and 
      Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.</p>
    <p><u>Particulars</u>:            The accused failed to take the reasonable 
      precaution of having a signaller assist the operator of a dump truck where 
      the operator did not have a clear view of the intended path of travel.  
      A worker, Paolo Faustini, was killed.</p>

  </span> After five days of evidence, the respondent brought a motion for a directed 
  verdict.  The trial judge found that the evidence was clear that the deceased, 
  Paul Faustini “was, at all material times, a signaller. That was his job and 
  that is what he was doing.”  The trial judge rejected the Crown’s submission 
  that a signaller in s. 104 means a signaller performing the duties defined by 
  s. 106, and ruled that evidence that Faustini was also doing the work of a spreader 
  could not be relied upon as evidence of the offence charged.  The trial judge 
  held that s. 106 was a different offence and that as the charges had been laid 
  under s. 104, the Crown could not ask for a conviction on the basis of a departure 
  from the requirements of s. 106:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The accused could have been charged that the signaller was doing other 
      work, such as spreader, that the vehicle was not clear of the intended path 
      of travel, etcetera.  These are all under Section 106, not 104. …</p>
    <p>In my view there is no ambiguity in Section 104.  There is no ambiguity 
      what the word “signaller” means … I do not agree with the Crown that I should 
      read in Section 106 in order to find what the duties of signaller are because 
      the witnesses told me.  The section [104] is clear, “a signaller”.  The 
      deceased was giving the truck driver, Mr. Carducci, signals at various times 
      on the relevant day of July the 17th, 1997.</p>

  </span> Count 3 made no reference to s. 104, but the Crown had particularized 
  that charge in terms of failure to have a signaller.  The trial judge ruled 
  that as the evidence demonstrated that Faustini was the signaller on the day 
  in question, there was no evidence to support that charge.</p>

<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>

line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I respectfully disagree with the way the trial judge and the summary 
  conviction appeal judge interpreted the Regulation and the charges faced by 
  the respondent.  It is my view that on a proper construction of the Regulation 
  and the charges the respondent faced, there was some evidence upon which a properly 
  instructed trier of fact could make a finding of guilt and as such the motion 
  for a directed verdict should have been dismissed.  I arrive at that conclusion 
  for the following reasons. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>OHSA</i> is a remedial public welfare statute intended to guarantee 
  a minimum level of protection for the health and safety of workers.  When interpreting 
  legislation of this kind, it is important to bear in mind certain guiding principles.  
  Protective legislation designed to promote public health and safety is to be 
  generously interpreted in a manner that is in keeping with the purposes and 
  objectives of the legislative scheme.  Narrow or technical interpretations that 
  would interfere with or frustrate the attainment of the legislature’s public 
  welfare objectives are to be avoided. </p>

      The broad purpose of the statute is to maintain and promote a reasonable

  truck wheels” in <i>Ontario (Minister of Transport) v. Ryder Truck Rental Canada 
  Ltd.</i> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 171 at 174:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The modern approach to statutory interpretation calls on the court to interpret 
      a legislative provision in its total context.  The court should consider 
      and take into account all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative 
      meaning.  The court’s interpretation should comply with the legislative 
      text, promote the legislative purpose, reflect the legislature’s intent, 
      and produce a reasonable and just meaning [Sullivan, <i>Driedger on the 
      Construction of Statutes</i>, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994), at 
      p. 131.]  The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed this approach to statutory 
      interpretation, most recently in <i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 
      at p. 704, 171 D.L.R. (4th) 385, where Cory and Iacobbucci JJ. wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As this Court has frequently stated, the proper construction of a statutory 
        provision flows from reading the words of the provision in their grammatical 
        and ordinary sense and in their entire context, harmoniously with the 
        scheme of the statute as a whole, the purpose of the statute, and the 
        intention of Parliament.  The purpose of the statute and the intention 
        of Parliament, in particular, are to be determined on the basis of intrinsic 
        and admissible extrinsic sources regarding the Act’s legislative history 
        and the context of its enactment…</p>

  </span> In<i> Ontario (Workplace Safety and Insurance Board) v. Hamilton Health 
  Sciences Corp</i>. (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 83 at p. 87, Rosenberg J.A. adopted 
  a similar approach when interpreting the <i>Workplace Safety and Insurance Act</i>, 
  1997, S.O. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The starting point for the interpretation of the statutory provisions involved 
      in this appeal is s. 10 of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
      I. 11.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>10. Every Act shall be deemed to be remedial, whether its immediate 
          purport is to direct the doing of anything that the Legislature deems 
          to be for the public good or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing 
          that it deems to be contrary to the public good, and <i>shall accordingly 
          receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation 
          as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according 
          to its true intent, meaning and spirit</i>.</p>
        <p>(Emphasis added)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By its terms, s. 10 applies to penal statutes.  Iacobucci J. considered 
      the application of s. 10 in <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>, [1998] 
      1 S.C.R. 27, 154 D.L.R. (4th) 193.  He held that s. 10 directs the court 
      to not only consider the plain meaning of the specific provisions in question, 
      but the scheme of the Act as a whole, its object and the intention of the 
      legislature.</p>

  </span> It remains true, of course, that penal legislation, even of the public 
  welfare variety, must also be interpreted in a manner consistent with the procedural 
  rights of the accused.  The accused is entitled to have full and fair notice 
  of the charges and to make full answer and defense to those charges.  In the 
  end, a balance must be struck to arrive at an interpretation that promotes the 
  larger objects of the legislation and at the same time respects the procedural 
  rights of the accused. </p>

  </span> Guided by these interpretive principles, I cannot accept the respondent’s 
  submission that ss. 104 and 106 of the Regulation should be read as, in effect, 
  creating two distinct offences, each of which must be read and prosecuted without 
  reference to the other section.  In my view, both provisions reflect the legislature’s 
  intention to deal with precisely the same occupational risk of harm, and on 
  a fair reading of their terms, they are properly read together as complementing 
  each other.  This interpretation best promotes the public safety and welfare 
  purpose of the legislation, while fully respecting the procedural rights of 
  the accused.</p>

  </span> [23] Section 104 creates a duty on employers to provide a signaller 
  in certain very well defined situations. Section 106 prescribes the duties of 
  a signaller where one is required. While I agree with the respondent that s. 
  106 is not, strictly speaking, a definition section, I cannot read it as reflecting 
  a legislative intent to create a separate and distinct offence that must be 
  prosecuted without reference to s. 104. It is, rather, a provision that explains 
  and amplifies the duty created by s. 104 and the other sections of the Regulation 
  that require a signaller. Section 106 does not, standing by itself, create an 
  offence distinct from and independent of s. 104 or some other provision creating 
  a duty to have a signaller. Unless a signaller is required by some other provision, 
  there is no basis for charging an accused for failing to have a signaller perform 
  the duties prescribed by s. 106. Thus, if a charge were laid or particularized 
  under s. 106, it would be necessary to have reference to s. 104 or some other 
  provision requiring a signaller. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this feature of s. 106 seriously undermines the foundation 
  of the respondent’s argument that ss. 104 and 106 prescribe different and distinct 
  duties and are therefore separate and distinct charging sections that must be 
  read independently from one another.  If the charge were particularized under 
  s. 106, as the respondent says it should have been, it would be necessary also 
  to have reference to s. 104 or to some other section that creates a duty to 
  have a signaller.  If a charge under s. 106 could only be made out by reference 
  to some other section, I fail to see why it is not proper to read a charge that 
  particularizes s. 104 in the light of the requirements of s. 106.  </p>

  </span> In the circumstances of the present case, it is my view that the charge 
  was properly laid with reference to s. 104 as that section is the source of 
  an employer’s duty to have a signaller.  We are not dealing with independent 
  offences, each of which has its own definition and each of which must be separately 
  and distinctly charged to avoid confusion or unfairness to the accused.  We 
  are dealing with a single duty that is created by s. 104 and more fully elaborated 
  by reference to s. 106, and that can give rise to an offence by reference to 
  either section.</p>

  </span> This feature of the relationship between ss. 104 and 106 distinguishes 
  the decision of this court in <i>R. v. Art Ellis Construction (St. Catherines) 
  Ltd</i>., [1968] 1 O.R. 491.  In that case, the accused was charged with failure 
  to<i> furnish</i> prescribed equipment and materials, but the evidence proved 
  the different offence, created in a different subsection, of failing to<i> use</i> 
  and to <i>maintain</i> materials in the manner prescribed.  There, the statute 
  created two separate and distinct duties giving rise to separate and distinct 
  offences.  Here, as I have indicated, the same duty created by one section is 
  elaborated by another section. </p>

  </span> There is no suggestion that the respondent was in any way misled by 
  the wording of the information as to the nature of the charge it faced.  Nor 
  would reading s. 104 together with s. 106 cause the respondent any prejudice 
  in the preparation of its defense.</p>

  </span> Given the relationship between ss. 104 and 106, it is my view that the 
  principle expressed in cases such as <i>R. v. Saunders</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 
  1020 that the Crown must prove the charge as particularized is not applicable.  
  In <i>Saunders,</i> the Crown particularized the offence as conspiracy to traffic 
  in heroin, but proved a conspiracy to traffic in a different drug.  The Supreme 
  Court of Canada found that the accused could only be convicted of the offence 
  as particularized.  In the case at bar, the Crown has not alleged one offence 
  and then proved another to the prejudice of the accused.  Here the Crown led 
  evidence on the very same offence that was charged with no prejudice to the 
  accused.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Quite apart from s. 106 and its use to explain or amplify the extent 
  of the duty created by s. 104, it seems to me that there was some evidence of 
  an offence under s. 104 alone.  I would read the charges against the respondent 
  as relating to a specific moment in time, namely, the point at which the dump 
  truck was reversing with the driver’s view of the intended path of travel obstructed 
  when the fatal accident occurred.  If there had been a signaller assigned to 
  the job that day who had gone off for a break while the truck was reversing 
  without watching to make sure the movement could be safely made, surely the 
  respondent would have been in breach of s. 104.  The respondent was required, 
  at that precise and critical moment, to have a signaller directing the reversing 
  dump truck.  In my view, there is no meaningful distinction between the example 
  I have just given and the situation where the signaller ceases to act as signaller 
  and turns his attention to spreading the stone. The driver’s evidence was that 
  while the deceased signalled him to reverse the truck, as he reversed, he could 
  see no one behind the truck.  This amounted to some evidence that at the precise 
  moment the accident occurred, no one was acting as the signaller. In my view, 
  it was open to a properly instructed trier of fact to make a finding on that 
  evidence that the employer failed to live up to its duty to provide a signaller 
  as required by s. 104. </p>

  </span> In any event, even if there is a defect in count 1 on account of the 
  specific reference to s. 104, the same cannot be said of count 3.  That count 
  does not refer to s. 104, and is not based upon an allegation that a specific 
  regulation was breached, but rather that the respondent failed “to take every 
  precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker” contrary 
  to s. 25 (2)(h) of the Act.  As there was, in my view, some evidence that the 
  employer failed to provide a signaller at the relevant time, I do not agree 
  that there was a complete absence of evidence of the charge as particularized 
  by the Crown.</p>

  </span> Finally, I turn to the question of amendment.  Although the appellant 
  did not seek an amendment at trial or in its factum, we invited counsel to provide 
  us with written submissions as to whether it would be appropriate at this stage 
  of the proceedings to allow the appellant to amend the information to include 
  further particulars related to the requirements of s. 106.  While the appellant 
  maintains that no amendment is required, it submits that if necessary, the information 
  should be amended in the following manner.  Count 1 should be amended by adding 
  the words &quot;who was not performing other work while acting as a signaller:” 
  after the word “signaller”.  Count 3 should be amended by adding the words “as 
  described in Ontario Regulation 213/91” after the word “signaller”. </p>

  </span> I reject the submission of the respondent that we lack the power to 
  amend the information in the circumstances of this appeal.  The <i>Provincial 
  Offences Act </i>makes generous provision for the powers of an appellate court: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>s.121            Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court may, by

          in its opinion, the person who has been accused of the offence should 
          have been found guilty, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>s.125             Where a court exercises any of the powers conferred by 
      sections 117 to 124, it may make any order, in addition, that justice requires.</p>

  </span> These provisions are essentially the same as the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  provisions considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Elliott v. The Queen</i> 
  (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 177.  There it was held to be appropriate to amend a 
  charge to conform with the evidence adduced at trial and to order a new trial 
  on the amended charge.  Ritchie J., writing for the majority, stated at p. 204 
  that an order allowing an amendment could be made even where the order for a 
  new trial depended upon the amendment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view, When Parliament authorized the Court of Appeal, in the exercise 
      of its power, to order a new trial, to “make any order, in addition, which 
      justice requires” it must be taken as having authorized that Court under 
      those circumstances to make <i>any additional order</i> which the ends of 
      justice require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the 
      additional order or not.  I do not think that the wide powers conferred 
      on the Court of Appeal by s. 613(8) are to be narrowly construed but rather 
      that they are designed to ensure that the requirements of the ends of justice 
      are met, and are to be liberally construed in light of that overriding consideration.</p>

  </span> I accept the respondent's submission that an amendment should not be 
  allowed under s. 125 where the effect would be to charge a completely different 
  offence.  However, in this case, as in <i>Elliott</i>, the effect of the amendment 
  is not to substitute a different charge, but rather to provide further particulars 
  of the same charge: namely, failure to provide a signaller as required by the 
  Regulations, contrary to <i>OHSA</i> s. 25(1)(c), and failure to take every 
  precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker, contrary 
  to <i>OHSA</i> s. 25(2)(h).  </p>

  be unfairly prejudiced by amending the information at this stage.  Accordingly, 
  while it is my view an amendment is not, strictly speaking required, for the 
  avoidance of any possible uncertainty, I would allow the appellant to amend
