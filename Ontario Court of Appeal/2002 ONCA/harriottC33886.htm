<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the convictions by Justice Hugh R. Locke, 
  sitting with a jury, on July&nbsp;6,&nbsp;1998, and from the sentence imposed 
  on September&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1998.</p>

  </span> In 1996, the appellant, Allan Harriott, was convicted of six criminal 
  offences arising out of a home invasion robbery at the residence of Ricardo 
  and Maria Iraheta.  He was convicted of two counts of robbery, two counts of 
  forcible confinement, one count of possession of a weapon for the purpose of 
  committing an indictable offence, and one count of wearing a disguise with the 
  intent to commit an indictable offence.  The trial judge sentenced the appellant 
  to four years in prison.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial which 
  proceeded in 1998, before a judge and jury, with Locke J. presiding.  The appellant 
  was again convicted of all six offences.  The trial judge determined that the 
  sentence at the first trial was inadequate.  He sentenced the appellant to a 
  total of eight years in prison, in addition to the 19 months and 10 days the 
  appellant had spent in custody after the first trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals from the convictions on four grounds, all relating 
  to the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  He also seeks leave to appeal his 
  sentence and, if  leave is granted, a reduction in the sentence.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            <u>FACTS</u></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On May 27, 1994, Ricardo Iraheta dropped his children at school and 
  returned home to his apartment building.  In the hallway, he had a brief look 
  at a black man outside the stairwell door.  He entered his apartment where his 
  wife, Maria, was waiting.  He started to undress to take a shower.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mrs. Iraheta headed for the door, since she was planning to go to her 
  sister-in-law’s house.  As soon as she unlocked the door, two men pushed it 
  open and directed her towards the couch.  Her husband soon joined her there.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The intruders were wearing stockings over their heads.  The Irahetas 
  recognized, from the intruders’ bare hands, that one of them was white and the 
  other was black.  The black intruder was wielding a gun.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The intruders told the Irahetas that they wanted to take money, drugs 
  and jewellery.  Mrs. Iraheta informed them that they were no longer in the jewellery 
  business, so there was not much to steal.  The black intruder led Mr. Iraheta 
  into the bedroom where he collected a few pieces of jewellery.  The intruders 
  took money from both complainants, totalling approximately $1300 - $1500.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At one point, Mrs. Iraheta’s mouth was taped because she was screaming 
  and hysterical.  The black intruder knelt her on the floor and told her that 
  if at the count of “5” he did not have the jewellery he was going to shoot her.  
  The intruder started counting but, at the count of “3”, the other intruder said 
  they had to leave.  The black intruder kicked Mrs. Iraheta in the back and she 
  fell to the floor.  The intruders left.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The white intruder left behind his fingerprints.  As a result, Alexsis 
  Hansen, a young offender, was apprehended several days later.  He was identified 
  at a line-up by both complainants.  Hansen testified that the police told him 
  he would receive a lighter sentence if he co-operated.  He identified the appellant 
  as the other intruder, and his cousin, Ruben Rayo, as the driver of the getaway 
  car.  Hansen pleaded guilty and received a sentence of four months closed custody 
  and 10 months open custody followed by two years probation.  Rayo also pleaded 
  guilty and was sentenced to a term of two years imprisonment.  Both Hansen and 
  Rayo also served three months in pre-trial custody.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the appellant’s second trial, the main Crown witnesses were Hansen 
  and Theresa Vagadia, the appellant’s former girlfriend, both of whom testified 
  about the appellant’s role in the robbery.  The appellant testified and denied 
  any involvement in the offences.  </p>

<h4 style='line-height:normal'>D.            <u>ANALYSIS</u></h4>
<p>            <b>(1)            <u>Alibi</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the appellant’s first trial, the defence led alibi evidence in support 
  of his testimony.  The appellant’s girlfriend, Teresa Divito, testified that 
  the appellant was with her in their apartment at the time of the robbery.  The 
  appellant’s landlord at the time, Sam Kovak, also testified that he saw the 
  appellant in his apartment around 8:30 a.m. on the morning of the robbery.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the second trial, events unfolded in a different way.  The girlfriend 
  Teresa Divito had become a former girlfriend and married another man, thus becoming 
  Teresa Vagadia.  Vagadia testified as a Crown witness implicating the appellant 
  in the robbery.  Vagadia further testified that the alibi she provided at the 
  first trial was untrue, that it was given at the behest of the appellant, and 
  that Kovak had also testified for the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defence wanted to call Kovak as a witness at the second trial but 
  Kovak was unwilling to appear.  Following a <i>voir dire,</i> which included 
  medical evidence that Kovak had been suffering from a major depressive disorder 
  for about five years and could not presently testify, the trial judge ruled 
  that “however suspicious the odour may be surrounding the failure of Mr. Kovak 
  to be here in person... to exclude the Kovak evidence given at his first trial 
  would present apparent unfairness.”  Accordingly, Kovak’s brief testimony at 
  the first trial was read in as part of the defence case.  The gist of his evidence 
  was that he remembered the day in question because he had sold a house and had 
  to go sign some papers at his lawyer’s office. He stated that he saw the appellant 
  that morning, “I can’t recall the right time, maybe 8:30 a.m. or so.” In cross-examination, 
  when asked if he had seen the appellant “at approximately 8:30”, Kovak replied: 
  “I think it was before that.  I said I have gone down to the basement apartment, 
  that would be correct, around that time”. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also testified.  He denied any involvement in the robbery 
  and said that for “basically the whole day I was in the apartment” and that 
  he saw his landlord during the morning. He denied asking his girlfriend or Kovak 
  to lie for him although he conceded that his girlfriend had lied in court from 
  time to time to help him on other charges.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the issue of alibi was central to his defence 
  and that the trial judge’s instruction to the jury on Kovak’s testimony was 
  inadequate.  Specifically, the appellant contends that the trial judge should 
  have given an instruction relating the alibi evidence to the principle of reasonable 
  doubt along the lines suggested by this court in <i>R. v. Parrington</i> (1985), 
  20 C.C.C. (3d) 184. In <i>Parrington</i>, the appellant testified that he could 
  not have committed the offences with which he was charged because, on the night 
  in question, he was at his girlfriend’s residence. The girlfriend and two other 
  witnesses testified to this effect. On appeal, this court held that the instruction 
  to the jury was not adequate because the trial judge made no attempt to relate 
  the principle of reasonable doubt to the evidence adduced at trial.  Cory J.A., 
  speaking for the court, commented further as follows, at p. 187: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It would have been preferable if the judge had directed the jury along 
      these lines:</p>
    <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> that if they believed 
      the alibi testimony given then, of course, they must acquit;</p>
    <p> (2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> that if they did not 
      believe such testimony, but were left in reasonable doubt by it, once again 
      they must acquit the accused;</p>
    <p> (3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> that even if they were 
      not left in reasonable doubt by this testimony, then on the basis of all 
      the evidence they must determine whether they were convinced beyond a reasonable 
      doubt of the guilt of the accused. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant concedes that the trial judge properly instructed the 
  jury along these lines on the approach they should take in considering the appellant’s 
  testimony. That instruction was as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Harriott has testified. He has stated to you his explanation of these 
      charges. As I understand his evidence, he has stated that he was not at 
      this robbery at all. He has stated he was elsewhere. He has stated he was 
      in his apartment, the basement apartment of the home on Amaron, with his 
      then girlfriend, Ms. Divito. If you believe and accept that explanation, 
      <i>after you have considered it along with all of the other evidence</i>, 
      then you must return a verdict of not guilty to all of the counts in the 
      indictment. You do not decide your verdict on whose version of events that 
      you prefer, or whose version of events you do not prefer. You approach the 
      issue in this way: if you believe the accused’s explanation, he must be 
      acquitted; even if you do not believe his explanation, but it leaves you 
      in reasonable doubt, then you still must return a verdict of not guilty. 
      If you reject Mr. Harriott’s evidence in its totality, and if you disbelieve 
      him, that is not the end of the matter. If that is the case, you then must 
      go back to the evidence that you do accept and believe, and you must then 
      decide, on the basis of the evidence, whether or not the Crown has proven 
      guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and if that is the case, it is then and 
      only then that it is open to you to return a verdict of guilty with respect 
      to the counts in this indictment. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the general reference to “all of the other 
  evidence” in conjunction with the appellant’s alibi evidence was inadequate 
  and that it was incumbent on the trial judge to specifically relate Kovak’s 
  evidence to the principle of reasonable doubt. Rather than doing so, the trial 
  judge made only one specific reference to Kovak’s testimony later in his charge 
  in the course of summarizing the defence position, where he said: “Further, 
  if Mr. Kovak is to be believed, when he saw Mr. Harriott at his house at 8:30, 
  and, if that is the case, Mr. Harriott could not have been at the robbery scene.” 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge further erred in failing 
  to instruct the jury that alibi evidence, which is disbelieved but not concocted, 
  has no evidentiary value. The appellant concedes, however, that there was evidence 
  of concoction in this case and that proof that an alibi is deliberately fabricated 
  by an accused may constitute affirmative evidence of guilt: see <i>R. v. Davison, 
  DeRosie and MacArthur </i>(1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 424 at 428-430 (Ont. C.A.) 
  and<i> R. v. Coutts and Middleton</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For several reasons, I do not agree with the appellant’s submissions.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, in my view the trial judge effectively charged the jury in accordance 
  with the guidance provided by this court in <i>Parrington, supra</i>. The language 
  suggested by Cory J.A. in that case is virtually identical to the now famous 
  wording he set out, after he had become a judge on the Supreme Court of Canada, 
  in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 409.  The trial judge 
  faithfully gave the <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction in this case.  Importantly, he 
  did not limit it to only the appellant’s testimony; he said: “If you believe 
  and accept that explanation, after you have considered it along with all the 
  other evidence. . . .”  In my view, “all the other evidence” included Kovak’s 
  evidence to which the trial judge later made specific reference in his charge.</p>

  </span> Second, Kovak’s alibi evidence did not play a central role in the theory 
  of the defence at trial. The main issue was the identity of the black intruder 
  described by the complainants. While the appellant is correct in stating that 
  alibi was an important part of the defence’s attack on the Crown’s case on identification, 
  the alibi evidence consisted mainly of his own testimony, and the Kovak evidence 
  played but a minor role in supporting it. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> During the <i>voir dire </i>to determine its admissibility, it was the 
  position of defence counsel at trial that the Kovak evidence “sort of pointed 
  to the direction of Mr. Harriot being at home around 8:30,” and that this contradicted 
  “the time at which Alexsis Hansen, at least, says he was outside the door preparing 
  [for the robbery].” As noted by counsel, according to Hansen (and Vagadia as 
  well), the appellant was no longer at the apartment around 8:30 a.m. Vagadia 
  testified that the two men left shortly after 7:30 a.m. Hansen testified that 
  he picked up the appellant at his apartment sometime “between seven and eight” 
  and that, after no more than five minutes, they left to go to the location  
  of the robbery. The evidence is not clear on how long it took to get there, 
  but Hansen testified that they arrived at the apartment building before 8:00 
  a.m. and that they then waited half an hour to an hour before committing the 
  robbery. Hence, to the extent that the Kovak evidence contradicted the Crown 
  evidence on this aspect of the timing, it tended to support the appellant’s 
  testimony.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, it becomes clear on considering the evidence as a whole that 
  the timing issue arising from the Kovak evidence was of limited probative value 
  to the defence. There was a great deal of differing testimony from all witnesses 
  at the trial about the time the various events occurred. Hansen himself, whose 
  evidence was contradicted by Kovak’s on this point, was very vague and at times 
  inconsistent with respect to the timing of the various events that took place 
  that morning. More significantly, on everyone’s account there is no real conflict 
  between Kovak’s sighting of the appellant at approximately 8:30 a.m. or earlier 
  and his being at the scene of the crime at the time the actual robbery took 
  place sometime later that morning.  In other words, even if the members of the 
  jury had a reasonable doubt on whether the appellant was at his own apartment 
  around 8:30 a.m., or even if they were <i>satisfied</i> that he was there, it 
  would still be open on the evidence for them to be convinced beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant committed the crime. When considered in context, Kovak’s 
  evidence was a very weak link in the chain of events. Hence, had the trial judge 
  linked Kovak’s evidence to the appellant’s testimony in his <i>W.D. </i>instruction 
  as suggested, it could have left the jury with the impression that the credibility 
  of one was somehow tied to the other, thereby undermining the defence. As matters 
  stood, the trial judge probably put the defence in the best light by focussing 
  mainly on the appellant’s testimony in the <i>W.D. </i>part of the charge and 
  then referring to the Kovak evidence at its highest from the defence’s perspective 
  when he told the jury without further elaboration “if Mr. Kovak is to be believed, 
  when he saw Mr. Harriott at his house at 8:30, and, if that is the case, Mr. 
  Harriott <i>could not have been at the robbery scene</i>.”  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is particularly noteworthy that defence counsel at trial did not 
  object to the trial judge’s instruction on this point. Defence counsel mentioned 
  the Kovak evidence in his objections to the charge, noting that the trial judge 
  had failed to remind the jury that the source of this evidence was to be found 
  in one of the transcripts, but made no objection relating to the substance of 
  the instruction. Counsel did not suggest that the jury should be instructed 
  in the manner that is now contended on appeal. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, I do not think that the appellant was prejudiced by the trial 
  judge’s failure to instruct the jury on the inference that could be drawn from 
  the evidence of concoction in the particular circumstances of this case. Normally 
  such an omission would result in an objection from the Crown. However, in this 
  case, the evidence of concocted alibi came from Vagadia who also testified that 
  the appellant committed the robbery. Therefore the main issue for the jury was 
  whether they believed her testimony. In these circumstances, the trial judge’s 
  decision not to charge the jury on the use that could be made of a concocted 
  alibi made sense since it would have added little to their fact finding function 
  and may have confused them. Again, it is noteworthy that no objection was made 
  on this point. This is perhaps not surprising because, in my view, the non-direction 
  on this point, if anything, benefitted the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, the trial judge’s instruction on the alibi issue was appropriately 
  brief, sound in law and, if anything, favourable to the appellant. I would not 
  give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

  </span> Teresa Vagadia testified for the appellant, her then boyfriend and the 
  father of their unborn child, at the first trial, and provided alibi evidence 
  for him.  At the second trial, she admitted that she had perjured herself at

  masks and gloves which potentially made her an accomplice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span

  “clear and sharp warning” about relying on the testimony of accomplices required 
  by <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at 17 (S.C.C.) and its progeny.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision of a trial judge to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is discretionary.  
  There is also a good deal of discretion with respect to the form the warning 
  should take.  The discretion as to whether, and how, to give a warning is reviewable, 
  but an appellate court must show deference to the trial judge and not lightly 
  interfere with his or her decision:  see <i>Vetrovec</i> at 17-18; <i> R. v. 
  Bevan </i>(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 at 325-27 (S.C.C.); and <i> R. v. Brooks</i>

  </span> The appellant does not contend that the trial judge gave no warning 
  to the jury about relying on Hansen’s testimony.  Rather, the appellant’s submission 
  is that the warning he gave was inadequate.  The appellant further submits that 
  the trial judge gave no warning at all about the risks in adopting Teresa Vagadia’s 
  testimony.  Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge, rather than 
  cautioning the jury against accepting their testimony, actually tried to rehabilitate 
  both Hansen and Vagadia when he dealt with their testimony.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree with these submissions.  I think it is useful to set out 
  the instruction which the appellant now challenges as both inadequate and tilted 
  against him:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>From the evidence that Mr. Hansen gave, to the effect that as a young person, 
      in 1994, he was one of two persons who robbed the two complainants named 
      in the indictment of their money and jewellery<i>.  It is open to you as 
      jurors to conclude, if you wish to do so, that Mr. Hansen was then a disreputable 
      person.  It is open to you to bear in mind that the evidence of such a person, 
      before it is acted upon, should be treated by you, as jurors, with great 
      care and with great caution.</i>  On the other hand, you have listened to 
      the evidence of Alexsis Hansen when he testified last week, 1998, four years 
      later.  You have very recently heard him give evidence in detail of how, 
      where and when and with whom the robbery was planned and executed, and what 
      happened after.</p>
    <p>He was cross-examined vigorously.  The differences in evidence that he 
      gave at various times in the past and the statements that he has made in 
      the past, and what he said to you at trial where Mr. Harriott is the accused 
      on trial, is all before you.  In short, it seems to me that you have a clear 
      portrait of what occurred when Mr. Hansen was age 15, what occurred in the 
      intervening four years, and what you see of Mr. Hansen 48 months later at 
      age 19, when he testified here.</p>
    <p><i>The very same thing applies to Ms. Divito</i>, except that the time 
      period is much shorter concerning what she said at the bail hearings and 
      other court appearances, and what she said here at this trial.  This subject 
      is important, because the issue of credibility or the weight that each of 
      you as jurors is prepared to give to the evidence of any witness, and especially 
      that of Mr. Hansen and that of Ms. Divito is a vital and important issue 
      in this trial.  You, as jurors, have had an excellent opportunity to assess 
      the credibility as it relates to each of these witnesses on the basis of 
      what you know of Alexsis Hansen at age 15 and what you have seen of him 
      now, four years later.  The same thing applies, to a lesser extent, to Ms. 
      Divito.</p>
    <p>For example, you heard Ms. Divito quite clearly and frankly state that 
      in her life as Mr. Harriott’s girlfriend and lover, she was a person who 
      was prepared, having been given up by her family, under oath on other occasions 
      to have been untruthful in order, as she said, to protect Mr. Harriott in 
      his difficulties with the criminal justice system.  You heard her again, 
      under cross-examination, give you the reasons why she was prepared to do 
      this.  As I understood her evidence, fear of him was the reason she described, 
      and that was a leading factor compelling her to be untruthful under oath 
      in the past.  You also heard her evidence of what kind of a person she was 
      then, and how she regards herself now, in what she described as a much different 
      way of life as she is living at present.</p>
    <p>In the result, each you as jurors is in the best position to decide the 
      weight or the credibility, if any, that you are prepared to give to the 
      evidence of any witness who testified in this trial, and certainly that 
      of Mr. Hansen and Ms. Divito.  <i>Examine their testimony with care</i>.  
      Consider the evidence of each, along with all of the other evidence led 
      in the trial, when you deliberate.  Again, please remember the evidence 
      of what Mr. Harriott said when he testified when you are assessing the weight, 
      if any, that you will accord to any witness who testified in the trial.  
      You will please consider any previous statements that were given by either 
      Mr. Hansen or Ms. Divito, or both.  I remind you, if they adopt the previous 
      inconsistent statement, then it becomes part of the evidence at the trial.  
      If they do not adopt the previous inconsistent statement or statements, 
      then you may not employ what was said previously for the truth of its content, 
      but you may employ it to assess credibility; that is for you, and no one 
      else to say. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, it was within the trial judge’s discretion to instruct the 
  jury in the manner that he did. His review of the relevant features of Hansen’s 
  and Vagadia’s evidence was fair and balanced. He also instructed the jury that 
  Hansen’s evidence “should be treated by you, as jurors, with great care and 
  with great caution”.  He said:  “The very same thing applies to Ms. Divito [Vagadia]”.  
  He told the jury that it was for them to decide the weight or the credibility 
  they would assign to the evidence of all the witnesses.  However, he singled 
  out Hansen and Vagadia for special caution: “Examine their testimony with care”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, I do not see how the above passage supports the contention 
  that the trial judge’s instruction on this issue was tilted against the appellant 
  because it tried to rehabilitate Hansen and Vagadia in the eyes of the jury.  
  It did no such thing. This was the second trial for the appellant and the jury 
  was made aware of earlier testimony by the witnesses.  The robbery took place 
  in 1994, the first trial in 1996.  The jury was hearing evidence in 1998.  All 
  the trial judge was trying to do was provide the jury with a proper frame of 
  reference within which to consider Hansen’s and Vagadia’s testimony.  In my 
  view, he did this in a brief, clear and neutral fashion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I also note that the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> warning should not 
  be reviewed by an appellate court in isolation.  As expressed by Osborne A.C.J.O. 
  in <i> R. v. Winmill</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 380 at 405 (Ont. C.A.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The sufficiency of the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution cannot reasonably be assessed 
      by an isolated review of that part of the charge that one can identify as 
      the “<i>Vetrovec </i>warning”.  That is to say, the charge must be read 
      as a whole. The <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is a special part of the charge 
      on credibility.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the present case, the trial judge gave careful and correct instructions 
  regarding the assessment of credibility and the use and misuse of prior inconsistent 
  statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I make one final observation on this issue.  In <i>R. v. C.D.</i> (2000), 
  145 C.C.C. (3d) 290 at 306, Morden J.A. stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I need not say much about the submission that the trial judge, given the 
      evidence of collaboration and prior inconsistent statements, did not caution 
      the jury on the danger of acting on the evidence of T.  The giving of a 
      caution is, generally, a matter of discretion <i>(R. v. Brooks)</i> [citations 
      omitted] and <i>it is difficult to accept that the discretion was wrongly 
      exercised when the giving of it was not requested by either counsel, as 
      was the case in this proceeding.</i>   [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with this passage.  Trial counsel play an important role in 
  suggesting whether, and in what form, a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning should be given.  
  That is because a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning can be a two-edged sword, drawing 
  attention not only to the disreputable character and/or conduct of the accomplice, 
  but also to evidence that might confirm the accomplice’s testimony.  As Dickson 
  J. observed in <i>Vetrovec</i>, at p. 7:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The accused is in the unhappy position of hearing the judge draw particular 
      attention to the evidence which tends to confirm the testimony the accomplice 
      has given.  Cogent prejudicial testimony is thus repeated and highlighted.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The clearer and sharper a trial judge’s warning about the testimony 
  of an accomplice, the more likely it is that it will be accompanied by a full 
  and robust review of potential confirming evidence.  Thus, although the ultimate 
  responsibility for deciding whether, and in what form, to make a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
  warning  rests with the trial judge (<i>Brooks, supra</i>, at p. 229), trial 
  counsel is in a particularly good position to assess whether, from the perspective 
  of an accused, the trial judge has given an inadequate warning.  The absence 
  of an objection, especially on such a well-known matter, should be regarded 
  as a strong sign that the language employed by the trial judge was appropriate, 
  at least from the perspective of the accused.  In my view, that is especially 
  so in the circumstances of this case where defence counsel made several objections 
  to the contents of the jury charge, but said nothing about a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
  warning.</p>

  </span> The appellant contends that the trial judge failed to charge the jury

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  During the course of his review of the testimony of Ricardo 
  and Maria Iraheta, the trial judge pointed out many potential frailties, including: 
  (1) neither of the victims had seen the intruders before the day of the robbery; 
  (2) Mrs. Iraheta identified the male person in photo number 8 but said “I wasn’t 
  too sure”; (3) Mrs. Iraheta testified that all black people look alike facially; 
  (4) Mrs. Iraheta could not give facial characteristics; (5) Mrs. Iraheta knew 
  that the two robbers would be at the courthouse on Jarvis St. on the day she 
  says she saw the appellant in a car near the courthouse; (6) Mrs. Iraheta’s 
  identification of the appellant in the car was limited to the clothes he was 
  wearing (the same as on the day of the robbery); (7) Mr. Iraheta had only a 
  brief look at a man standing in the stairwell of his apartment building on the 
  day of the robbery; (8)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Iraheta could see the face of the white 
  intruder through his pantyhose mask more clearly than the face of the black 
  intruder through his pantyhose mask; (9) Mr. Iraheta told police that he did 
  not pay much attention to the black intruder; and (10) Mr. Iraheta could not 
  identify the appellant in police photographs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to this comprehensive list of potential frailties, the trial 
  judge gave the traditional strong instruction about the dangers of relying on 
  identification evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  identification in this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> During the cross-examination of Teresa Vagadia, defence counsel asked 
  many questions about the appellant’s abusive behaviour towards her.  He did 
  this, apparently, to attack her credibility.  During the examination-in-chief 
  of the appellant, defence counsel elicited responses denying physical abuse 
  of Ms. Vagadia.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge gave a strong caution to the jury against making an 
  improper use of the appellant’s criminal record.  Subsequently, when he reviewed 
  Ms. Vagadia’s evidence, he did not discuss the abuse she had described during 
  her cross-examination.  Rather, he mentioned it in only a tangential way as 
  her explanation for why she had lied during previous court appearances:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You heard her again, under cross-examination, give you the reasons why 
      she was prepared to do this.  As I understood her evidence, fear of him 
      was the reason she described, and that was a leading factor compelling her 
      to be untruthful under oath in the past.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the trial judge’s caution about improper use of the appellant’s 
  criminal record, coupled with this restrained use of the evidence relating to 
  abusive conduct, was sufficient to remove from the jury any notion that they 
  could use the evidence of prior bad acts committed by the appellant as evidence 
  of his guilt in relation to the robbery charges.  I note again that defence 
  counsel did not object to this component of the jury charge.  Presumably, this 
  reflected his view that the trial judge’s charge conveyed the requisite point 
  without highlighting the evidence relating to prior abusive conduct engaged 
  in by the appellant.</p>

  </span> Following his first trial, the appellant received a sentence of four 
  years imprisonment.  The trial judge at the second trial regarded this sentence 
  as inadequate.  He thought that a sentence of 10 years was appropriate.  He 
  took into account the fact that the appellant had served 19 months and 10 days 
  of the sentence imposed at the first trial and sentenced the appellant to eight 
  years in prison.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The other intruder, Alexsis Hansen, pleaded guilty.  He was a young 
  offender at the time of the robbery.  In addition to three months served in 
  pre-trial custody, he received a sentence of four months closed custody, 10 
  months open custody and two years probation.  The driver of the getaway car, 
  Ruben Rayo, was sentenced to a two-year term in the penitentiary in addition 
  to the three months of pre-trial custody he served.</p>

  </span> The appellant argues that the sentence imposed following the second 
  trial is unfit for two reasons:  it is too high given the sentence imposed at 
  the first trial, and it is disproportionate to the sentences imposed on the 
  other two offenders.  I disagree with these submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is true that the imposition of a sentence imposed after a re-trial 
  should not be regarded as a matter entirely <i>de novo</i>.  If the trial judge 
  at the second trial decides to impose a greater sentence than the original sentence, 
  he or she must first determine that the original sentence was unfit, or that 
  new facts have emerged, and then consider all the relevant factors before imposing 
  the new sentence:  see <i>R. v. B. (L.)</i>; <i>R. v. G. (M.A.)</i> (1997), 
  116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 512 (Ont. C.A.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That is what the trial judge did in the present case.  Between the two 
  trials, this court had upheld sentences of eight years and nine years imprisonment, 
  in addition to a credit of 18 months for pre-trial custody, in <i>R. v. Soares</i>, 
  [1998] O.J. No. 3274, a home invasion robbery and unlawful confinement case 
  with facts not dissimilar to those in the present case.  The Crown brought <i>Soares</i> 
  to the attention of the trial judge and submitted that the sentence for the 
  appellant “should be significantly higher … than the <i>Soares</i> case”.  The 
  trial judge imposed a sentence about one month greater than the sentence imposed 
  on one accused and about 11 months less than the sentence imposed on the other 
  accused in <i>Soares</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span

  </span> In light of <i>Soares</i>, I cannot say that the trial judge erred in 
  concluding that the original sentence was inadequate.  He was, therefore, entitled 
  to increase the sentence.  His further determination that the horrible circumstances 
  of the home invasion robbery, the previous criminal conduct of the appellant, 
  and the devastating effects of the robbery on the complainants warranted a sentence 
  of 10 years imprisonment (from which he deducted about five months) is, in my 
  view, also supportable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, I see no merit in the appellant’s disparity agreement.  Alexsis 
  Hansen was 15 years old at the time of the robbery.  Ruben Rayo did not enter 
  the apartment and terrorize the complainants.  There is simply no basis on which 
  to compare the appellant’s sentence with those imposed on Hansen and Rayo.</p>

  </span> The review of trial judges’ instructions to juries is a mainstay of 
  appellate judging in criminal matters.  Proper appellate review of jury instructions 
  requires a functional approach which focuses on the purposes to be served by 
  jury instructions.  A proper instruction must set out the issues to be determined, 
  the legal principles to be applied, the respective positions of the parties 
  and must relate the evidence to those issues and positions:  <i>R. v. Cooper</i> 
  (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301 (S.C.C.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Jury instructions can significantly affect the outcome of a trial.  
  They are the last word heard by the jury before deliberations begin and they 
  emanate from a person who the jury will usually see as neutral and authoritative.  
  The fairness of a trial often hangs in the balance when the trial judge delivers 
  his or her instructions.  In addition to meeting the functional needs described 
  above, those instructions must strive for a balance which will equip the jury 
  with the tools needed to fashion a proper verdict, but will not direct the jury 
  towards a particular verdict:  <i>R. v. Ferguson</i> (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 
  353 (Ont. C.A.), per Laskin J.A. in dissent at p. 376, rev’d., (2001), 152 C.C.C.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, identity was the central issue at trial.  The defence 
  mounted a two-fold attack on the Crown’s contention that the appellant was one 
  of the robbers.  First, through the evidence of the appellant and his landlord, 
  Mr. Kovak, the defence advanced an alibi placing the appellant at his apartment 
  when the robbery occurred.  Second, the defence vigorously challenged the credibility 
  of the two main Crown witnesses, Alexsis Hansen, an accomplice in the robbery, 
  and Teresa Vagadia, an admitted perjurer.  These two witnesses gave evidence 
  that directly implicated the appellant in the robbery.  Their evidence constituted 
  the bulk of the Crown’s case against the appellant.  It was essential that the 
  trial judge address both components of the defence in a manner that was legally 
  correct and presented the defence in a balanced and fair manner.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the able and experienced trial judge, I must conclude 
  that his instructions were not correct in law and effectively undermined the 
  force of both prongs of the defence advanced at trial.</p>

  </span> Although the time at which the robbery commenced could not be fixed 
  precisely, it would appear that the robbery started at 9:00 a.m. or shortly 
  thereafter.  The robbers were at the scene of the robbery for some time before 
  it actually commenced.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Hansen testified that he awoke at 6:30 a.m. and immediately phoned 
  the appellant to get directions to his apartment.  Hansen drove to the appellant’s 
  apartment with his cousin, the third participant in the robbery, arriving there 
  between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.  According to the plan, Hansen and the appellant 
  were to be outside the victims’ apartment by 8:00 a.m.  Hansen said that he 
  was at the appellant’s apartment for a few minutes and then left with the appellant 
  and proceeded to the victim’s apartment.  Hansen testified that he and the appellant 
  were in the building where the victims’ apartment was located for about an hour 
  before the robbery actually commenced.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Vagadia testified that she was staying with the appellant on the 
  day of the robbery and that Hansen arrived at the apartment at 7:30 a.m.  He 
  and the appellant left ten or fifteen minutes later on their way to the victims’ 
  apartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified that he remained in his apartment for most of 
  the day of the robbery and never went to the victims’ apartment.  The defence 
  read in the evidence of the appellant’s landlord, Sam Kovak, given at the first 
  trial.  Mr. Kovak was suffering from depression and was unable to testify at 
  a second trial.  According to his evidence, he got up at 7:50 a.m. and saw the 
  appellant at the apartment at about 8:30 a.m. or perhaps a little earlier.  
  Mr. Kovak left the apartment building about 9:15 a.m.  He had to see his lawyer 
  about a real estate closing that was to occur later that day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was evidence that the appellant’s apartment was 8.5 kilometres 
  from the victims’ apartment.  According to defence evidence, it took about half 
  an hour in rush hour to drive from the appellant’s apartment to the victims’ 
  apartment.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  
  Consequently, Kovak’s evidence could not exclude the possibility that the appellant 
  was at the victims’ apartment at 9:00 a.m. or shortly thereafter.  His evidence 
  was, however, completely inconsistent with the evidence given by the two main 
  Crown witnesses, both of whom had the appellant leaving his apartment by 8:00 
  a.m.  Hansen placed the appellant at the scene of the robbery well before 9:00 
  a.m.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his instructions, the trial judge highlighted identity as the “main” 
  issue at trial.  He told the jury that it was the appellant’s position that 
  he was at home when the robbery occurred.  Remarkably, however, in a case where 
  identity was the central issue and the defence had put forward an alibi, there 
  is no separate treatment of the defence of alibi anywhere in the charge to the 
  jury.  The legal principles applicable to that defence were not provided to 
  the jury and the alibi evidence was not reviewed by the trial judge.  The only 
  reference to Mr. Kovak’s evidence appears in the trial judge’s summary of the 
  defence position.  In reviewing counsel’s submission with respect to Mr. Kovak, 
  the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Further, if Mr. Kovak is to be believed, when he saw Mr. Harriott at 
      his house at 8:30, and if that is the case, Mr. Harriott could not have 
      been at the robbery scene. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While this brief reference was no doubt an accurate summary of counsel’s 
  submission, it did not properly state the legal effect of Mr. Kovak’s evidence.  
  That evidence had value even if it was not believed, as long as it was not rejected.  
  The trial judge was required to specifically relate the burden of proof to the 
  alibi defence.  He should have told the jury that the appellant was under no 
  obligation to prove that defence, but that if his evidence, or Mr. Kovak’s evidence, 
  or their evidence taken in combination left the jury with a reasonable doubt 
  as to the appellant’s whereabouts at the time of the robbery, he was entitled 
  to be acquitted.  In <i>R. v. Parrington</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 184 at 187 
  (Ont. C.A.), Cory J.A. suggested that the linkage between the defence of alibi 
  and the burden of proof should be drawn in the following way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It would have been preferable if the judge had directed the jury along 
      these lines:</p>
    <p>that if they believed the alibi testimony given then, of course, they must 
      acquit;</p>
    <p>that if they did not believe such testimony, but were left in reasonable 
      doubt by it, once again they must acquit the accused;</p>
    <p>that even if they were not left in reasonable doubt by this testimony, 
      then on the basis of all the evidence they must determine whether they were 
      convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did instruct the jury in accordance with the three-step 
  approach set out in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 409 (S.C.C.).  
  That instruction, however, contains no specific reference to the defence of 
  alibi and no reference to the evidence of Mr. Kovak and its potential value 
  in assessing either the appellant’s evidence or whether the Crown had established 
  guilt on the entirety of the evidence.  I cannot agree that this instruction 
  makes up for the total absence of any alibi instruction.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In one respect, the instruction exacerbated the absence of the alibi 
  instruction.  When the trial judge reached the third step in <i>R. v. W.(D), 
  supra</i>, he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you reject Mr. Harriott’s evidence in its totality, and if you disbelieve 
      him, that is not the end of the matter.  If that is the case, <u>you then 
      must go back to the evidence that you do accept and believe, and you must 
      then decide, on the basis of that evidence, whether or not the Crown has 
      proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt</u> …  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this instruction, the jury could not consider Mr. Kovak’s alibi evidence 
  unless they believed it.  This instruction is wrong in law.  Even if Mr. Kovak’s 
  evidence was not believed, it remained a part of the evidentiary mix as long 
  as it was not rejected as false and had to be considered in determining the 
  appellant’s ultimate guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The failure to specifically relate the burden of proof to the defence 
  of alibi constitutes misdirection.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am also satisfied that even though Mr. Kovak’s evidence was brief 
  and heard by the jury at the end of the trial, there should have been some review 
  of that evidence, particularly given that the trial judge did review the evidence 
  of the Crown witnesses and relate it to the issues at trial.  Mr. Kovak had 
  given a statement to the police concerning the appellant’s whereabouts within 
  a short time of the relevant events, he had a reason to remember the events 
  of the morning, and his evidence was not shaken on cross-examination.  He had 
  no apparent motive to give the appellant a false alibi.  Some, if not all, of 
  these factors deserved some mention by the trial judge.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nor can I agree with my colleague that Mr. Kovak’s evidence was not 
  central to the defence.  While he could not provide a definitive time at which 
  he saw the appellant, his evidence was completely inconsistent with the evidence 
  given by the two main Crown witnesses.  On their evidence, the appellant had 
  left the apartment by 8:00 a.m.  While it may have been physically possible 
  for the appellant to be at home at about 8:30 a.m. and at the victims’ apartment 
  when the robbery started, that was not the theory of the Crown advanced at trial.  
  Given the evidence of the main Crown witnesses, I think it is fair to describe 
  Mr. Kovak’s evidence as crucial to the defence position that the Crown had failed 
  to prove that the appellant was one of the robbers.  Nor would I dismiss Kovak’s 
  evidence as unimportant because it was brief.  Independent confirmation of an 
  accused’s alibi is a precious commodity to the defence and is crucial where 
  identification is the main issue.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with my colleague’s observation that had an alibi instruction 
  been given in this case, it would have been appropriate for the trial judge 
  to also instruct the jury on the potential evidentiary value of a fabricated 
  false alibi.  I cannot agree, however, that the absence of any objection to 
  the alibi instruction reflects a tactical decision whereby counsel sought to 
  avoid the potential risk of a fabricated alibi instruction.  A fabricated alibi 
  instruction would not have been of any significant benefit to the Crown in this 
  case.  The jury could only find that the alibi was fabricated if they believed 
  Ms. Vagadia’s evidence that the appellant made her put forward a false alibi 
  at the first trial.  If the jury believed that part of her evidence, it seems 
  to me that they would have inevitably believed her evidence that the appellant 
  was involved in the robbery.  If the jury believed her evidence as to the appellant’s 
  involvement in the robbery, he would inevitably have been convicted without 
  resort to the circumstantial value of evidence of a concocted alibi.  </p>

  </span> Mr. Hansen testified that he agreed to commit the robbery with his cousin 
  and then recruited the appellant to assist him.  He was a full participant in 
  the robbery.  The police found Hansen’s fingerprints at the scene and arrested 
  him.  He was on probation at the time.  When the police questioned Hansen, they 
  told him that he would get a lighter sentence if he co-operated.  The police 
  knew that at least two people were involved in the robbery, but had not been 
  able to identify the other person.  Hansen testified that he knew from his previous 
  contacts with the police that they always promised a more lenient sentence in 
  exchange for co-operation, but that the sentence was ultimately determined by 
  the trial judge.  On at least one prior occasion, Hansen had agreed to plead 
  guilty to certain charges in exchange for having other charges dropped.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hansen knew the appellant and he knew that the appellant had been in 
  jail “a lot of times”.  It was the position of the defence that Hansen had falsely 
  identified the appellant because of his criminal background and because he was 
  afraid of the person who had actually engaged in the robbery with him.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to Hansen, he was terrified when he was arrested and questioned 
  by the police.  He gave a statement to the police admitting his role in the 
  robbery and identifying the appellant as his co-perpetrator.  Hansen believed 
  that he could be charged with perjury if he gave testimony which was different 
  than his statement.  He admitted that he was “terrified” of being charged with 
  perjury.  In an unrelated matter, the police had charged Hansen with attempting 
  to obstruct justice based on alleged lies told by Hansen to the police.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hansen’s involvement in the robbery, the circumstances in which he gave 
  his statement implicating the appellant, his fear that any deviation from the 
  statement could result in a criminal charge, and the importance of his evidence 
  to the Crown’s case combined to require that the jury receive a clear and sharp 
  caution about the danger inherent in relying on the unconfirmed evidence of 
  Hansen:  <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811;  <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (2000),

  </span> MacPherson J.A. has set out the relevant part of the trial judge’s instructions 
  to the jury at paragraph 33 of his reasons.  I cannot agree with his conclusion 
  that the trial judge told the jury that Hansen’s evidence should be treated 
  with great care and caution.  Instead, he told the jury that it was open to 
  it:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… to conclude, <u>if you wish to do so</u>, that Mr. Hansen was <u>then</u> 
      a disreputable person.  It is open to you to bear in mind that the evidence 
      of such a person, before it is acted upon, should be treated by you, as 
      jurors, with great care and with great caution. …  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge treated the caution as optional and not mandatory and 
  left it to the jury to decide whether to apply that caution.  It is for the 
  trial judge to decide whether a “<i>Vetrovec</i>” caution should be given.  
  I think a “<i>Vetrovec</i>” caution was mandatory in so far as Hansen was concerned.  
  The trial judge erred in leaving it to the jury to decide whether to proceed 
  with caution in considering Hansen’s evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge further depreciated the value to the defence of even 
  the optional caution he gave to the jury by suggesting that Hansen’s status 
  as a “disreputable person”, and hence a witness whose evidence should be viewed 
  with caution, may have somehow evaporated in the four years between the robbery 
  and Hansen’s testimony.  The trial judge was wrong to suggest that Hansen’s 
  status as a disreputable person was in the past tense and that the events between 
  the robbery and his testimony could diminish the need to proceed with caution 
  in considering his evidence.  The passage of time had no effect on the reasons 
  underlying the need for that caution.  Hansen had implicated the appellant in 
  a statement at a time when it was very much in his interest to appear to be 
  fully co-operating with the police.  The appearance of co-operation necessitated 
  that he identify the second robber.  Hansen also believed that any deviation 
  from his statement could result in a criminal charge against him.  The passage 
  of four years between the robbery and Hansen’s testimony did nothing to diminish 
  the strong self-interest Hansen had in maintaining the position he had taken 
  in his initial statement to the police.  By suggesting otherwise, the trial 
  judge obscured the reason underlying the need to treat Hansen’s evidence with 
  caution and improperly invited the jury to conclude that the passage of time 
  could somehow eliminate the need for that caution.</p>

  the police by herself and gave a statement indicating that the appellant was

  eventually met someone, and married him in February 1998.  In that same month, 
  she received a subpoena from the police requiring her to testify at the second

  She decided to go to the police and tell them that she had committed perjury.  
  When she did so, the police told her that she could be in serious trouble for

      state that in her life as Mr. Harriott’s girlfriend and lover, she was a 
      person who was prepared, having been given up by her family, under oath 
      on other occasions to have been untruthful in order, as she said, to protect 
      Mr. Harriott in his difficulties with the criminal justice system.  …  [Emphasis

  </span> In my view, where a crucial witness for the Crown has committed perjury 
  on several previous occasions, it is essential that the trial judge tell the 
  jury in the clearest terms that it is dangerous to act on the unconfirmed evidence 
  of that witness:  <i>R. v. Binet</i>, [1954] S.C.R. 52;  <i>R. v. Rosenberg</i>, 
  [1969] 2 O.R. 54 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1969] 2 O.R. 60n;  
  <i>R. v. Crosby</i> (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 367-69 (N.S.C.A.), rev’d. 
  on a different issue (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.).  The witness’s explanation 
  for the previous perjuries and the reasons why the Crown contends that the witness’s 
  present evidence should be believed must, of course, be reviewed with the jury.  
  The trial judge did that.  Those explanations and reasons cannot detract from 
  the need for caution, but do provide a basis upon which to accept the witness’s 
  evidence having exercised that caution.  The trial judge’s instructions stressed 
  the excuses offered for the witness’s perjury, but did not provide a clear caution 
  with respect to accepting her evidence in the light of her perjury.</p>

  </span> Counsel for the appellant at trial (not Mr. Hicks) raised several objections 
  to the charge.  None touched on the instruction with respect to alibi or the 
  adequacy of the “<i>Vetrovec</i>” warning.  For me, the absence of any objection 
  on these issues is the most troublesome aspect of this appeal.  The failure 
  to object at trial is not a bar to raising an objection to a charge to the jury 
  on appeal.  The absence of any objection will, however, be an important consideration.  
  As Lamer C.J.C. said in <i>R. v. Jacquard</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 19 
  (S.C.C.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [D]efence counsel’s failure to object to the charge says something about 
      both the overall accuracy of the jury instructions and the seriousness of 
      the alleged misdirection.</p>

  </span> Arguments raised for the first time on appeal should be viewed with 
  suspicion.  Quite frankly, many arguments that are made for the first time on 
  appeal are not made at trial because counsel quite reasonably views them as 
  inconsequential to the result at trial.  They emerge on appeal because they 
  are seen as having more attraction in the rarefied atmosphere of the appellate 
  court. </p>

  </span> The significance on appeal of the failure to have raised the objection 
  at trial will depend in large part on the nature of the objection.  Silence 
  at trial will be particularly damaging on appeal if it is alleged on appeal 
  that the trial judge erred in the exercise of a discretion or failed to adequately 
  put some aspect of the defence to the jury:  <i>R. v. Brooks, supra</i>, per 
  Bastarche J. at pp. 210-212;  <i>R. v. Mullins-Johnson</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 117 at 123 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 977.  Where, however, the 
  alleged errors relate to misdirection or non-direction on important legal principles, 
  the failure to object at trial will have much less significance in determining 
  the merits of that ground of appeal:  <i>R. v. Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 
  1293, per Cory J. at 1319-20;  <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 
  289 at 299 (S.C.C.).  If a trial judge gave the jury the wrong law on a central 
  feature of the case, it cannot matter that he or she did so with the acquiescence 
  or even the support of counsel for an accused.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

  </span> The errors I have identified in the jury instructions, with one exception 
  (the review of the alibi evidence), fall into the category of errors relating 
  to legal principles.  The errors concern principles that were central to the 
  two-pronged defence put forward by the appellant.  Trial counsel’s failure to 
  object is unfortunate but in my view, does not diminish the force of the arguments 
  made on appeal.  </p>
