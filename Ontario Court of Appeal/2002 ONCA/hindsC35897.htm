<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgments of the Ontario Superior Court 
  of Justice (Divisional Court) (J.&nbsp;L. MacFarland, E.&nbsp;P. Hartt and P.&nbsp;J. 
  Cosgrove JJ.) dated November&nbsp;17&nbsp;and&nbsp;29, 2000.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>MacPherson J.A.:</span></h4>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.       <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When a company sells its business and assets to another company, one 
  of the components of the sale is often a transfer of the vendor company’s pension 
  plan liabilities and assets to the purchaser company.  In turn, this will often 
  lead to a merger of the pension plans of the two companies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The transfer of the pension plan from the vendor company to the purchaser 
  company must be approved by the Superintendent of Pensions (the “Superintendent”).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  The Superintendent must withhold consent to a 
  transfer “that does not protect the pension benefits . . . of the members and 
  former members of the employer’s pension”: s. 80(5) of the <i>Pension Benefits 
  Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 8 (the “<i>PBA</i>”).  In other words, the Superintendent 
  has a statutory responsibility to consider and protect the accrued pension benefits 
  of the employees of the vendor or <i>exporting</i> company before approving 
  the transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principal question posed by this appeal is whether the Superintendent 
  has any duty to consider the interests of the employees of the purchaser or 
  <i>importing</i> company before approving the transfer.  Specifically, is the 
  Superintendent required to give notice of the proposed transfer to the employees 
  of the importing company so that they will have the opportunity to inform the 
  Superintendent of their views on the proposed transfer?</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            <u>FACTS</u></h4>
<p class=Heading> <span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The parties and the events</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In 1990, Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada Inc. (“Bristol-Myers”) sold its 
  Javex business to Colgate-Palmolive Canada Inc. (“Colgate”).  As part of the 
  transaction, Colgate agreed to assume the accrued pension liabilities for the 
  Javex employees upon the transfer of $4,047,705 from the Bristol-Myers Pension 
  Plan to the Colgate Pension Plan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In July 1991, the Superintendent was advised that Colgate had purchased 
  the Javex operations from Bristol-Myers in April 1990 and that certain pension 
  assets and liabilities were proposed to be transferred from the Bristol-Myers 
  plan to the Colgate plan.  Bristol-Myers made an application for the Superintendent’s 
  approval of the transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For some reason not clear from the record, the Superintendent took more 
  than four years to make his decision.  His initial decision, made on October 
  3, 1995, was a refusal to consent to the transfer on the basis that “I am not 
  satisfied that the proposed transfer of assets protects the pension benefits 
  and other benefits of the members and former members”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Bristol-Myers responded almost immediately in a letter dated October 
  17, 1995, and explained its actuarial assumptions in support of a transfer amount 
  of $4,047.705.  It would appear that the Superintendent accepted this explanation 
  because on December 21, 1995 he approved the transfer of assets in this amount.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That could have been the end of the matter.  Bristol Myers and its employees, 
  who knew of the proposed transfer, were satisfied.  So was Colgate.  However, 
  that left the employees and former employees of Colgate.  On December 21, 1995, 
  they knew nothing about the transfer; no one had informed them about it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> John Hinds was an employee at Colgate from 1951 to 1989 when he retired.  
  In 1997, when he became aware of the transfer, he decided to investigate its 
  implications for members of the Colgate Pension Plan.  He formed the view that 
  the liabilities potentially attributable to the Javex employees were more than 
  $6 million, approximately $2 million more than the amount of the transfer.  
  This differential had the potential, he thought, to reduce the surplus in the 
  existing Colgate plan which might be available for distribution to the current 
  and former employee members of the plan.</p>
<p class=Heading> <span style='text-decoration:none;

  </span></span> The litigation</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Based on Mr. Hinds’ analysis, he and the other appellants brought an 
  application to the Divisional Court seeking to quash the decision of the Superintendent 
  dated December&nbsp;21, 1995.  They also sought an order requiring Bristol-Myers 
  and Colgate to provide appropriate notice of the application to them and an 
  order requiring the Superintendent to provide them with an opportunity to make 
  submissions on the amended application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In support of their application, the appellants filed an affidavit sworn 
  by Mr. Hinds in which he set out his involvement in the matter and attached 
  various exhibits, including an internal Colgate actuarial valuation dated February 
  1991 which he believed supported his concern about a potential $2 million shortfall 
  in the amount transferred from the Bristol-Myers plan to the Colgate plan.  
  The respondent Bristol-Myers filed an affidavit by Leo Pygiel, an actuary who 
  had prepared the report establishing a transfer value of $4,047,705.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants brought a motion seeking to strike out the Pygiel affidavit.  
  The respondents Bristol-Myers and Colgate brought contingent cross-motions seeking 
  to strike out virtually all of the Hinds affidavit.  In a decision dated November 
  17, 2000, the Divisional Court (MacFarland, Hartt and Cosgrove JJ.) granted 
  all three motions.  The Pygiel affidavit was struck in its entirety and most 
  of the Hinds affidavit was struck.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The application for judicial review of the decision of the Superintendent 
  was then heard by the same panel of the Divisional Court on November 29, 2000.  
  On the same date, the panel dismissed the application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants appeal from both of the Divisional Court’s decisions.  
  The respondents make a contingent cross-appeal.  They say, as they did in the 
  Divisional Court, that if the Hinds affidavit should have been admitted on the 
  application, then so too should the Pygiel affidavit have been admitted.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As part of its application record in the Divisional Court, the appellants 
  filed an affidavit sworn by John Hinds, a former Colgate employee.  In the affidavit, 
  Mr. Hinds described his investigation of the transfer of pension plan assets 
  and liabilities from Bristol-Myers to Colgate.  He also attached as exhibits 
  a copy of the formal amendment to the Colgate Pension Plan assuming the liabilities 
  accrued under the Bristol-Myers plan and an internal Colgate actuarial report 
  which, on its face, cast doubt on the solvency of the Colgate plan after the 
  transfer.  He also described the closure of a Colgate plant in Toronto in 1992 
  and challenged the partial wind-up of the pension plan that flowed from that 
  event, including its approval by the Superintendent in 1994.  Finally, he detailed 
  the fact that he and other members of the Colgate Pension Plan received no notice 
  of any of these developments and were given no opportunity to make submissions 
  to the Superintendent about his decision on December 21, 1995 to approve the 
  transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In response to the Hinds affidavit, Bristol-Myers filed an affidavit 
  sworn by Leo Pygiel, the actuary who had prepared the report in support of the 
  transfer application to the Superintendent.  Mr. Pygiel’s affidavit responded 
  to only one of the matters dealt with in the Hinds affidavit, namely, the actuarial 
  basis for the transfer amount of $4,047,705.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants brought a motion to strike out the Pygiel affidavit in 
  its entirety.  Bristol-Myers and Colgate brought motions to strike out the Hinds 
  affidavit on all matters except the inability of the appellants to make submissions 
  to the Superintendent before the Superintendent made his approval decision pursuant 
  to s. 80(4) and (5) of the <i>PBA</i>.  These companion motions were made with 
  an eye to this court’s decision in <i>Re Keeprite Workers’ Independent Union 
  et al and Keeprite Products Inc.</i> (1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 513 (<i>“Keeprite”</i>) 
  which had cautioned against the admissibility of affidavit evidence on a judicial 
  review application.  As expressed by Morden J.A., at p. 521:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I would express the view . . . that the practice of admitting affidavits 
      of this kind should be very exceptional, it being emphasized that they are 
      admissible only to the extent that they show jurisdictional error.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants took the view that there was nothing in the Pygiel affidavit 
  relevant to any jurisdictional error committed by the Superintendent.  Bristol-Myers 
  and Colgate submitted that the only admissible portions of the Hinds affidavit 
  were those paragraphs which laid a foundation for the appellants’ claim that 
  they should have been afforded an opportunity to make submissions before the 
  Superintendent made his decision whether or not to approve the transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court agreed with these submissions and struck out all 
  of the Pygiel affidavit and all but paragraphs 1 and 11 and part of paragraph 
  8 of the Hinds affidavit.  In doing so, the court referred to <i>Keeprite</i> 
  and analyzed the affidavits in terms of their relevance to the appellants’ jurisdictional 
  argument anchored in receipt of notice and opportunity to make submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants challenge two components of the Divisional Court's decision.  
  First, they submit that all of paragraph 3 of the Hinds affidavit and Exhibit 
  “A” attached to the affidavit should have been admitted because they placed 
  before the Divisional Court a copy of the amendment of the Colgate plan to assume 
  the liabilities under the Bristol-Myers plan.  In oral argument, counsel for 
  the Superintendent conceded that this document should have been part of the 
  record the Superintendent put before the Divisional Court.  Since he did not 
  do so, it would be appropriate, counsel acknowledged, for the document to be 
  introduced through paragraph 3 of the Hinds affidavit and Exhibit “A” attached 
  thereto.  Accordingly, I would allow this aspect of the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the appellants challenge the component of the Divisional Court’s 
  order striking out several words from paragraph 8 of the Hinds affidavit.  In 
  its original form, paragraph 8 stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I was not notified of any of the matters set out in paragraphs 3 to 7 above, 
      nor was I given an opportunity to make submissions with respect to the Superintendent’s 
      decision dated December 21, 1995.  Based on my conversations with other 
      members and retirees of the Colgate Salaried Plan, I understand that none 
      of the members or retirees were notified of the matters set out in paragraphs 
      3 to 7 above, nor were they given an opportunity to make submissions with 
      respect to the Superintendent’s decision dated December 21, 1995.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court struck out the words “I was not notified of any 
  of the matters set out in paragraphs 3 to 7 above” but left intact the rest 
  of paragraph 8.  I can see why the court made this excision; most of paragraphs 
  3 to 7 of the Hinds affidavit deal with background leading up to, or matters 
  completely extraneous to, the Superintendent’s decision on December 21, 1995.  
  In any event, and in my view importantly, the remaining portion of paragraph 
  8 is sufficient to set out the appellants’ factual foundation for this appeal, 
  namely that they did not receive notice of the transfer application being considered 
  by the Superintendent and did not have an opportunity to make submissions to 
  the Superintendent before he made his decision.  Accordingly, in my view, the 
  Divisional Court's understanding and application of <i>Keeprite</i> were correct.  
  I would, therefore, dismiss this aspect of the appeal.  The contingent cross-appeals 
  by Bristol-Myers and Colgate do not then arise.</p>

  1995 approving the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Bristol-Myers 
  plan to the Colgate plan.  Their position is that their interests in their pension 
  plan were affected by the transfer.  Hence the Superintendent had a legal duty 
  to give them notice of the transfer application and to provide them with an 
  opportunity to make submissions about the proposed transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Transfers of pension assets and liabilities are dealt with in s. 80 
  of the <i>PBA</i>.  Section 80(1) permits such transfers.  Section 80(4) requires 
  the Superintendent to provide prior consent to the transfer.  Section 80(5) 
  provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>80(5)</b>  <i>The Superintendent shall refuse to consent to a transfer 
      of assets that does not protect the pension benefits</i> <i>and any other 
      benefits</i> <i>of the members and former members of the employer’s pension 
      plan</i> or that does not meet the prescribed requirements and qualifications. 
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is common ground that the word ‘employer’s’ in this provision means 
  the vendor or exporting company, in this case Bristol-Myers.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is also common ground that in many cases, including this one, an 
  approved transfer of pension assets and liabilities from one employer’s plan 
  to another employer’s plan will be followed by an application to amend the plan 
  of the importing employer.  The Superintendent must approve an amendment to 
  an existing pension plan: <i>PBA</i>,&nbsp;ss.&nbsp;12-18.  Section 26 of the 
  <i>PBA</i> deals with the notices the Superintendent must or may (depending 
  on the circumstances) give concerning an application for a proposed amendment 
  of a plan.  Colgate has in fact made an application to amend its pension plan 
  in light of the transfer of Bristol-Myers employees and their pension entitlements 
  into the Colgate orbit.  There is no suggestion that the appellants, current 
  and retired Colgate employees, will not receive notice of the Colgate application 
  and will not have an opportunity to make submissions about the proposed amendment 
  to the Superintendent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the appellants say that submissions at this second stage might 
  be too late, especially if insufficient funds are transferred to cover the liabilities 
  for the transferred Bristol-Myers employees.  They want to be able to challenge 
  <i>the transfer</i>, not just the amendment to their plan which will flow later.  
  Accordingly, they contend that the Superintendent was required to provide them 
  with notice of the transfer and an opportunity to make submissions relating 
  to it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court rejected this argument.  The crux of its reasoning 
  on this point was:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In our view, there was no breach of natural justice on the record before 
      us.  The Superintendent, in approving the transfer of assets and liabilities 
      for the Javex employees under s.&nbsp;80 of the P.B.A., was only obliged, 
      <i>at that stage</i>, to consider the interests of the exporting employer, 
      here Bristol-Myers.</p>
    <p>The proposal could have no impact on the applications until a request was 
      made for the amendment of the Colgate Plan (here the importing employer) 
      under s. 26 of the Pension Benefits Act. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I begin my analysis with a brief word about the standard of review of 
  decisions of the Superintendent.  The Divisional Court said: “The issue of the 
  standard of review was not seriously argued before us”.  The appellants did 
  not argue this issue before us, either in their factum or in oral argument.  
  All of the respondents submit that the standard of review of the decision of 
  the Superintendent on the questions of notice and submissions should be reasonableness 
  <i>simpliciter</i>, which is a standard between correctness and patently unreasonable:  
  see <i>Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.</i>, 
  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at 775-77.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with this submission.  In <i>Gencorp Canada Inc. v. Ontario 
  (Superintendent of Pensions)</i>, (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 38 (C.A.) (<i>“Gencorp”</i>), 
  this court held that a decision of the Pension Commission of Ontario upholding 
  an order of the Superintendent should be reviewed on a reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> 
  standard.  Robins J.A. said, at p. 44:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Given the purposes of this Act, the public policy ramifications inherent 
      in its administration and regulation, the experience and expertise of the 
      Commission and the broad regulatory authority conferred upon it, decisions 
      of the Commission clearly warrant a considerable degree of curial deference.  
      The purposes of the Act are best served by deference to the decision of 
      the Commission which, by and large, is in a better position than the courts 
      to decide issues arising under the statute in a manner consistent with and 
      in furtherance of the policy underlying the statute.</p>
    <p>An expert tribunal of this nature, charged as it is with this kind of legislative 
      mandate, is as the Supreme Court of Canada determined in <i>Southam, supra</i>, 
      at pp. 775-77, to be held to a standard of reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i>.  
      A court reviewing the tribunal’s decision must therefore inquire whether 
      the decision was reasonable.  If it was, the decision must stand.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, what Robins J.A. said in <i>Gencorp</i> about decisions 
  of the Commission applies with equal force to decisions by the Superintendent.  
  There is a great deal of overlap in the <i>PBA</i> between the decision-making 
  role of the Superintendent and the Commission.  Indeed, the Superintendent’s 
  decision in the present case could have been reviewed by the Commission.  The 
  identity of the decision-maker under the <i>PBA</i> is not a distinguishing 
  feature for purposes of standard of review analysis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As well, I do not think that the fact that the Superintendent’s decision 
  in the present case related, at least in part, to procedural and even natural 
  justice considerations should elevate the standard of review relating to that 
  decision.  In <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 
  [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, L’Heureux-Dubé J. said, at p. 840:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he analysis of what procedures the duty of fairness requires should 
      also take into account and respect the choices of procedure made by the 
      agency itself, particularly when the statute leaves to the decision-maker 
      the ability to choose its own procedures, or when the agency has an expertise 
      in determining what procedures are appropriate in the circumstances: Brown 
      and Evans, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 7-66 to 7-70.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this passage is applicable to the present case.  The Superintendent 
  must make a wide array of decisions relating to the pension plans of many employers 
  and employees.  There are a few procedural provisions in the <i>PBA</i>, including 
  notice provisions.  As long as the Superintendent complies with those provisions, 
  he should be given some leeway with respect to the procedures he adopts to assist 
  him in fulfilling his statutory decision-making mandate.  A standard of review 
  of these decisions of reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> strikes an appropriate 
  balance.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In making the decision to approve the transfer of pension assets and 
  liabilities from the Bristol-Myers plan to the Colgate plan, the Superintendent 
  focussed on s.&nbsp;80(5) of the <i>PBA</i>, the relevant portion of which I 
  set out again for ease of reference:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>80(5)</b>  The Superintendent shall refuse to consent to a transfer 
      of assets that does not protect the pension benefits and any other benefits 
      of the members and former members of the employer’s pension plan . . . .

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Superintendent took his own steps to give some effect to this statutory 
  mandate by issuing a policy statement dealing with, <i>inter alia</i>, notice.  
  The document, dated July 28, 1988 and entitled <i>Transfer of Assets from Sale 
  of a Business (Policy Statement 2)</i>, provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> (6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Prior to the proposed 
      transfer of assets and liabilities from the employer’s pension plan, notice 
      by the employer shall be transmitted to the transferred members . . . the 
      notice shall contain, at least, the following information:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> (a)<span

        of the employer’s pension plan and its provincial registration number;</p>
      <p> (b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the name of the 
        successor employer’s pension plan and its provincial registration number,

      <p> (c)<span

        of the report filed with the application;</p>
      <p> (d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> notice that copies 
        of the report, filed with the Superintendent, in support of the transfer 
        of asset request . . . are available for review at the offices of either 
        the employer or the successor employer and information on how copies of 
        the report may be obtained; and</p>
      <p> (e)<span

    </blockquote>
    <p> (7)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Superintendent 
      shall not permit a transfer of assets from a pension plan of an employer

      together with a statement that subsection (6) has been complied with, and 
      indicating the last date the notice was transmitted.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no suggestion that Bristol-Myers did not comply with these 
  notice requirements.  Moreover, it is clear that the Superintendent’s focus 
  on his mandate to protect the members of the Bristol-Myers plan was, on the 
  record, a real, not a cursory focus.  There was a fair amount of correspondence 
  between the Superintendent and Bristol-Myers about the amount of money Bristol-Myers 
  would transfer to Colgate to protect the pensions of the transferring Bristol-Myers 
  employees.  Indeed, at one juncture the Superintendent refused his consent when 
  he was not satisfied about the amount of money Bristol-Myers proposed to transfer.  
  The Superintendent’s approval on December 21, 1995 came only after he was convinced 
  on this score.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants, members of the importing Colgate pension plan, say that 
  the Superintendent paid no attention to their interests.  On the record, I am 
  prepared to accept this factual assertion, limited to the Superintendent’s decision 
  on the transfer application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants then assert that, as a matter of law, the Superintendent 
  was required to take their interests into account before approving the transfer 
  because the transfer would inevitably lead to an amendment to their (the Colgate) 
  plan.  Accordingly, the Superintendent was required, in effect, to consider 
  the interests of both the Bristol-Myers and Colgate employees before approving 
  the transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In making this submission, the appellants rely heavily on <i>Re Collins 
  and Pension Commission of Ontario</i> (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 274 (Div. Ct.) (<i>“Collins”</i>), 
  in which the court quashed a decision of the Pension Commission allowing the 
  employer to remove surplus funds from a pension plan funded in part by employee 
  contributions.  The employees received no notice of the employer’s application 
  and attempts by the employees to obtain information about the application from 
  the Commission failed.  The court criticizied this conduct.  Reid J. concluded, 
  at pp. 289-90:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The result must be, in my opinion, that the commission owes a duty of fairness 
      to those whose interest may, or will, be affected by its decision.  What 
      that duty requires, in procedural terms, will depend on the circumstances, 
      as Dickson J. points out [in <i>Martineau v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary 
      Board</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602].  The appropriate procedure in any given 
      case might run from a full and formal hearing, at one end of the spectrum, 
      down to simple, even informal notice, and an opportunity to respond, as 
      in <i>Nicholson, supra</i>.  In my opinion, at the very least, the commission 
      should have required Dominion to give notice of its application to the members 
      of their plan or their union . . . .</p>
    <p>The object of requiring notice, would be, of course, to give the union 
      or plan members an opportunity to defend their interest.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants submit that similar reasoning in the present case should 
  lead to the conclusion that the Superintendent, and/or Bristol-Myers, is required 
  to provide notice of the transfer application to the employees of <i>both</i> 
  the exporting and importing companies so that they will have “an opportunity 
  to defend their interest”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the appellants that the Superintendent owes a high duty 
  to employees with Ontario pension plans.  Indeed, on that issue I would adopt 
  the particularly eloquent language used by Reid J. in <i>Collins</i>, at p. 
  285:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[I]t appears that the commission was established to ensure that certain 
      interests were protected.  While there is no doubt that those interests 
      included the employer’s, there appears to be equally no doubt that the commission 
      was established to safeguard the plan members’ interests as well . . . While 
      the commission may not, strictly speaking, be a trustee for the members, 
      for it holds no money belonging to the plan, it would be artificial to conclude 
      that the commission’s obligation to members is lower than the high standard 
      of fiduciary obligation imposed on trustees.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> My problem, however, with the appellants’ argument is that I do not 
  see how either the provisions of the <i>PBA</i>, especially s. 80(4) and (5), 
  or the procedure followed by the Superintendent in making a decision on a transfer 
  application, infringes on the appellants’ rights or interests.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>PBA</i> deals in entirely separate parts with pension asset transfers 
  in a sale of business context and amendments to pension plans.  The statutory 
  focus of the former is s.&nbsp;80 of the Act, and especially s.&nbsp;80(5) which 
  requires the Superintendent to pay strict attention to <i>the pension rights 
  of the employees of the exporting employer</i>.  The statutory focus of the 
  latter is ss.&nbsp;12-18 and 26 of the Act which require the Superintendent 
  to protect the pension rights of <i>all</i> employees who will be subject to 
  an amended pension plan if the Superintendent approves the application for an 
  amendment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is true that in many cases, including this one, there will be an 
  overlap between or, perhaps more accurately, a flow through from transfer to 
  amendment.  Obviously, once a transfer takes place, the importing plan will 
  almost always require amendment.  Therefore, there would be nothing wrong if 
  the <i>PBA</i> required, or even if the Superintendent decided as a matter of 
  procedure, that transfer and amendment applications be dealt with together.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the <i>PBA</i> is not structured in that fashion.  It envisions 
  and establishes separate applications, procedures and decisions in the two domains 
  of transfer and amendment.  The procedure adopted by the Superintendent, as 
  reflected in the 1988 policy statement, is entirely consistent with the structure 
  of the <i>PBA</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the end, this case is different from <i>Collins</i> in a fundamental 
  respect.  In <i>Collins</i>, the Commission’s procedure gave no role at any 
  point to the employees.  Their voices would not be heard on a major issue affecting 
  their pensions.  In the present case, the voices of the appellants, the Colgate 
  employees, will be heard at, in effect, the second stage of the process, in 
  the context of Colgate’s application to amend its plan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants say that this might be too late because if the Superintendent 
  approves a transfer with insufficient funds, the insolvency of the merged plan 
  may be irreparable.  This strikes me as nothing more than speculation.  In the 
  context of an amendment application, the Superintendent will have the same high 
  duty to protect the interests of the Colgate employees - <i>all of them</i> 
  - that the Superintendent had when the interests of only the Bristol-Myers employees 
  were before  him on the transfer application.  Pursuant to s.&nbsp;26(1) of 
  the <i>PBA</i>, the appellants will receive notice of the proposed amendment 
  and they will be able to make submissions concerning it.  If the Superintendent 
  accepts those submissions, he has broad authority under s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>PBA</i> 
  to make an appropriate order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, it would be entirely reasonable for the Superintendent to 
  decide, as a matter of procedure, that he will consider transfer and amendment 
  applications together.  In many cases, that might make good sense.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, I cannot say that a decision by the Superintendent to consider 
  transfer and amendment applications separately, in effect in two stages, is 
  unreasonable.  Indeed, this procedure is supported by the structure of the <i>PBA</i> 
  which deals quite separately with transfers and amendments, including different 
  interests to be protected and different notice requirements.</p>
