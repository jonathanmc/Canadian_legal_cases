<p>On appeal from the Judgment of Justice J.C. Kent dated July 14, 2000.</p>

  </span> The appellant, Hogg Fuel &amp; Supply Limited, commenced an action seeking 
  foreclosure pursuant to a mortgage given by the respondents, Eric Mohr and Gertrude 
  Mohr. The appellant also claimed the sum of $48,736.43 plus interest owing under 
  the mortgage. The respondents, in defence of the action, alleged that the mortgage, 
  given as security for a guarantee with respect to the debts of a company operated 
  by their son, was subject to certain collateral assurances made by the appellant. 
  They further contended that these assurances gave rise to a fiduciary duty, 
  that the appellant had breached this duty, and that they had suffered damages 
  as a result. The respondents counterclaimed for damages for breach of fiduciary 
  duty. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge held that none of the terms of the guarantee assisted 
  the respondents, and that the evidence of collateral assurances was inadmissible 
  to contradict the express written terms of the guarantee. Consequently, the 
  trial judge did not give effect to the respondents’ defence to the claim and 
  granted judgment to the appellant for the full amount owing under the mortgage. 
  The trial judge held, however, that the evidence of collateral assurances was 
  admissible in support of the respondents’ claim for damages for breach of a 
  fiduciary duty. He held that the relationship between the parties gave rise 
  to a fiduciary duty, that the appellant had breached this fiduciary duty in 
  its handling of the debtor company’s affairs, and that the respondents were 
  entitled to a set off in the amount of $25,278.8 plus interest on their counterclaim. 
  In the circumstances, he awarded no costs of the action or the counterclaim. 
  The appellant appeals from the judgment granted on the counterclaim and from 
  the costs disposition. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the trial judge was correct in finding that the 
  guarantee in this case was valid, that the evidence of alleged collateral assurances 
  was inadmissible to contradict its terms, and that, consequently, the defence 
  raised to the action on the mortgage failed. <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>However, the trial judge erred in finding that those 
  same alleged collateral assurances could support a finding that there was fiduciary 
  relationship between the parties. In our view, there was no basis whatsoever, 
  on the facts or at law, to support this finding. The relationship between the 
  parties had none of the characteristics giving rise to a fiduciary duty: see 
  <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377.17 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 161 
  (S.C.C.)</span></p>

  </span> The appeal is allowed and the judgment, except for paragraph 1, is set 
  aside. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the trial and the appeal. We 
  are not satisfied that the appellant’s claim for costs on a solicitor and client 
  basis was substantiated on the record. Consequently, the costs award is on a 
  party and party basis. </p>
