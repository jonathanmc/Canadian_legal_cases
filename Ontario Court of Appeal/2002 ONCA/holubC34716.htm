style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants, Peter Holub and Sanda Kufrin, were each convicted of 
  committing the offence of fraud exceeding $5000.  In fact, in 1995 and 1996 
  they defrauded several hundred people of at least $400,000 - $600,000 in an 
  elaborate scam involving a modelling agency which Mr. Holub owned and in which 
  Ms. Kufrin was the most important employee.  Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin were subsequently 
  married in 1999 and now have a 13 month old daughter, Petra.  Their illegal 
  scheme seriously hurt, both financially and emotionally, many innocent people, 
  including seniors, recent immigrants and children.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> During the third week of their trial, after 39 of the complainants had 
  testified, the appellants decided to plead guilty.  A full sentence hearing 
  followed.  On July 26, 2000, Locke J. sentenced Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin to 
  terms of imprisonment of two years less a day and 15 months respectively.  Each 
  was also sentenced to a period of probation of two years.  A co-accused, Pavel 
  Krimsky, was given a 12 month conditional sentence.  He did not appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The principal ground of appeal advanced by Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin 
  is that the trial judge erred by not imposing conditional sentences on them.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.        <u>FACTS</u></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Peter Holub (“Holub”), Sanda Kufrin (“Kufrin”) and Pavel Krimsky (“Krimsky”) 
  were charged with fraud during the period from January 23, 1995 to September 
  16, 1996 in relation to a business owned by Holub, the Holub Modelling Agency 
  (“the agency”).  The agency had two office locations, one on Bathurst Street 
  operated by Holub and the other in Scarborough operated by Kufrin.  Krimsky 
  was the chief sales agent at the Bathurst Street office.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The main elements of the fraud were dishonest representations designed 
  to induce persons to obtain modelling services from the agency.  Kufrin and 
  Krimsky, with the approval and assistance of Holub, lied to several hundred 
  members of the public by telling them that the agency had lucrative modelling 
  work available and that they were prime candidates for this work.  In fact, 
  the agency had virtually no modelling work available for these people.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fraud operated in this fashion.  People received cold calls from 
  the agency or responded to advertisements in newspapers.  When they attended 
  one of the agency offices, they were told (usually by Kufrin or Krimsky) that 
  they were ideal candidates for major modelling assignments.  However, they were 
  also informed that, before they could obtain those assignments, they had to 
  purchase various services from the agency, including photo portfolios, modelling 
  lessons, internet exposure and magazine profiles.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some complainants turned over hundreds or even thousands of dollars 
  during this first encounter to pay for these services.  However, for hundreds 
  of people, the appellants made no effort to find modelling assignments for them.  
  Instead, they engaged in a variety of dishonest practices to take more money 
  from the victims.  These dishonest practices included:  using credit cards to 
  make an immediate sale, sometimes contrary to the instructions of the cardholder; 
  advising the victims that agency clients had been shown their photographs and 
  loved them, even though no photographs had been shown to clients; advising victims 
  that portfolios were needed, when this was not true; staging auditions in front 
  of fake clients; promising large contracts when they did not exist; and showing 
  fake faxes to victims to corroborate the claims of large contracts, when in 
  fact the faxes were sent from Holub’s luxury lakefront condominium with false 
  fax headlines suggesting foreign locations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the sentencing hearing, the Crown relied on summaries of the evidence 
  along the above lines from some of the witnesses who had testified, as well 
  as summaries of the statements of other complainants who had not yet testified. 
  These were not disputed by the appellants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Locke J. heard submissions on sentence for three days.  He delivered 
  comprehensive reasons for sentence on a fourth day.  He began by describing 
  the crime:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The accused are here to be sentenced for having defrauded over three hundred 
      members of the Canadian public of various sums of their hard-earned money.  
      The aggregate dollar amount fleeced by all accused amounts to a sum well 
      in excess of four hundred thousand dollars.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge described the appellants 
  as “well educated, ambitious, cunning and materialistically avaricious”.  He 
  viewed the fraudulent scheme as “elaborate and sophisticated”.</p>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge read the hundreds of victim impact statements that were 
  submitted. He observed:<br>
  Without question, the fraudulent process, employed by all three accused, caused 
  proven deprivation and the loss of hard-earned money, as well as embarrassment 
  and humiliation, all in return for no money's worth.<br>
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt; The trial judge read the hundreds of victim impact statements that 
    were submitted.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He observed:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=Doubleindent-quote&gt;Without question, the fraudulent process, employed 
    by all three accused, caused proven deprivation and the loss of hard-earned 
    money, as well as embarrassment and humiliation, all in return for no money’s

  &lt;p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0pt;text-indent:0pt;line-height:normal'> 
  [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge summarized the role of the three accused in the fraudulent 
  scheme in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Peter Holub was the captain of this pirate ship, if I can call it that, 
      and Ms. Kufrin was his first executive officer.  He must take the total 
      responsibility for the criminal acts of fraud that occurred while he was 
      in command.  That is so because he, I find, was intimately aware of each 
      and every move that both he, Ms. Kufrin and Mr. Krimsky were making during 
      the extraction process of money from the victims of the fraud.  Ms. Kufrin 
      was almost equally culpable.  She was in charge of the Scarborough operation 
      while Mr. Holub was downtown.  Mr. Krimsky, at all material times, was an 
      employee who followed orders when he knew those orders were criminal in 
      nature and amounted to fraud, as is charged here.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As to the appropriate sentences, the trial judge considered the submissions 
  of counsel and the various sentencing options open to him.  He was aware of 
  the conditional sentencing option and the relevant case law, including the leading 
  case, <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), which counsel 
  and he had discussed extensively during the submissions stage of the sentence 
  hearing.  In the end, he decided that a conditional sentence was appropriate 
  for Krimsky, but not for the appellants.  He concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the case of Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin, the imposition of a conditional 
      sentence in these circumstances, in this sophisticated fraud, having the 
      consequences to the victims that I have described, would be quite, in my 
      respectful view, inappropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Accordingly, the trial judge imposed 
  sentences of two years less a day and 15 months on Holub and Kufrin respectively, 
  plus two years probation for both of them.  The appellants seek leave to appeal 
  those sentences and, if leave is granted, seek variation of the custodial portions 
  of the sentences to conditional sentences with strict conditions.</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants complain about this passage in the trial judge’s reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[Holub and Kufrin] in my view still represent a danger to the public and 
      especially to those like-minded persons in the same line of business – namely, 
      modelling, entertainment and acting – who might be inclined to take the 
      same risk taken by Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin if the result would appear to 
      be mainly an out of jail conditional sentence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants contend that this passage links the danger to the public 
  component of s. 742.1 with general deterrence and that this is an error because 
  the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>Proulx, supra</i>, that “the focus 
  of the analysis at this point should clearly be on the risk posed by the individual 
  offender while serving his sentence in the community” (p. 481). See also: <i>R. 
  v. Knoblauch</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 16 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not agree with this submission.  Even if in a single paragraph 
  the trial judge linked his consideration of danger to the public with general 
  deterrence, in this case it does not matter, for two reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the trial judge dealt explicitly with the danger to the community 
  <i>posed by Holub and Kufrin.</i>  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Holub and Ms. Kufrin, in my view, are two very dangerous, greedy people, 
      who remain dangerous to the public, and especially to the modelling business 
      at this time.  What they have done to a large segment of that public merely 
      confirms the dangerousness of each.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This conclusion was strongly supported by the record in this case.  
  Not only did the appellants defraud hundreds of people during the 21 month period 
  covered by the indictment; remarkably, after they were charged and had been 
  released on bail, they continued to operate the same type of fraudulent business 
  under a new name, Anu Productions.  Charges were laid under the <i>Business 
  Practices Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.18, against the company (with Holub being 
  its principal and a director) and, <i>inter alia</i>, Kufrin.  The activities 
  of the company were virtually identical to those engaged in previously by the 
  Holub Modelling Agency.  The company pleaded guilty to all 30 counts, was fined 
  $8000 and paid restitution to many of the complainants.  The plea was entered 
  and the sentence was imposed while the present matter was proceeding before 
  Locke J. and before he imposed his sentences.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, even if the danger to the community component of s. 742.1 is 
  limited to a consideration of the danger potentially posed by the specific offender, 
  that does not mean that considerations of general deterrence play no role in 
  deciding whether to impose a conditional sentence.  This point was clearly made 
  in <i>Proulx</i>.  Referring to the debate about whether the safety of the community 
  meant only the threat posed by the specific offender or whether it also incorporated 
  considerations of general deterrence, Lamer C.J. remarked, at p. 481:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think the debate has been rendered largely academic in light of an amendment 
      to s. 742.1(b) . . . which clarified that courts must take into consideration 
      the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 
      to 718.2 in deciding to impose a conditional sentence.  This ensures that 
      objectives such as denunciation and deterrence will be dealt with in the 
      decision whether to impose a conditional sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, the trial judge concluded that the appellants themselves 
  posed a continuing threat to the community.  He also took into account the other 
  principles of sentencing, including general deterrence.  I see no basis on which 
  to interfere with his conclusions on these matters.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants submit that the safety of the public could have been 
  ensured by the imposition of strict conditions in conjunction with conditional 
  sentences.  They point out that a condition of both bail pending appeal and 
  the probation orders was a prohibition against working in the modelling and 
  entertainment industries.  They suggest that a similar prohibition as a term 
  of a conditional sentence order would have provided sufficient protection to 
  the public.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  The protection of the public is not the only factor to 
  be taken into account when imposing a sentence.  Denunciation, general deterrence 
  and rehabilitation must also be considered.  The trial judge considered all 
  of these factors.  He concluded that only a custodial sentence could satisfy 
  the need for general deterrence and denunciation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no reason for disagreeing with the trial judge’s conclusion.  
  The appellants’ fraud was well-planned, cruelly executed, and lasted for 21 
  months.  Several hundred people were defrauded.  The vast majority of the victims 
  were under no delusion that they were the typical model type.  The appellants 
  assured them, however, that their particular look was different and would be 
  attractive to prestigious clients.   Seniors were told that there was good work 
  for mature models.  Overweight victims were told that there was work for plus-size 
  models.  Non-white people were told that the ‘ethnic look’ or ‘exotic look’ 
  was in demand.  Parents, including single mothers struggling on social assistance, 
  were promised modelling work for their babies and children.  Most of these victims 
  lost money that they could not afford to lose.  They also lost their ability 
  to trust people and, in some cases, their confidence and self-respect.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hundreds of victim impact statements were prepared for the trial.  They 
  make for very sad reading.  To cite but one example, in the teenager category, 
  a father said this about his family’s experience with the agency:</p>

            <p>Thanks to Holub Modelling Agency my daughter [T] has lost her confidence.  
              She had her heart set on being a model, getting a job to pay both 
              my wife and myself back the money we paid to the accused agency.  
              She was told when I signed the advertising contract that she would 
              receive $22,0000 dollars.  She was so proud showing her portfolio 
              to family and friends.  It was hard for her to face the fact that 
              our family had become fraud victims after seeing the accused on 
              T.V. News.  She took it so hard she could not talk to her friends 
              or family for a long time after this happened.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not do this in this case.  During submissions, Holub’s 
  counsel asked if his client could address the court and the trial judge responded 
  “not now”.  This was an appropriate response because the submissions from various 
  counsel were not complete.  However, after all of the submissions, which lasted 
  three days, were finished it appears that the trial judge forgot to ask the 
  accused if they wanted to say anything.  Instead, he adjourned court until the 
  next day at which point he delivered his reasons for sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown concedes that this was an error, but in the nature of an inadvertent 
  slip.  I agree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Interestingly, the remedy the appellant seeks is, as expressed in his 
  factum, “to permit the Appellant to submit a written statement for consideration 
  of this Honourable Court”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has in fact done this.  He filed, with the consent of 
  the Crown, a letter dated September 20, 2001 which begins: “I am writing to 
  express to the Court the feelings that I wanted to convey at the time of my 
  sentencing in this case”.  I have considered this letter, which describes the 
  appellant’s feelings of remorse and shame.  These were well-expressed by his 
  two counsel at the sentence hearing.  There is nothing in the appellant’s letter  
  that could possibly have changed the trial judge's mind if he had heard the 
  appellant express his views in court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the letter, the appellant also expressed his concern about being 
  separated from his young daughter if he must serve a custodial sentence. The 
  separation is, of course, unfortunate for father and daughter.  However, separation 
  from a child is a consequence of incarceration for many offenders.  </p>
<p ><b><U>Sanda Kufrin</U></b></p>
<p ><b>(4)       <u>Disparity of sentence</U></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge imposed a custodial sentence of 15 months on Kufrin 
  and a conditional sentence of 12 months on Krimsky.  The appellant contends 
  that both Kufrin and Krimsky were essentially salespeople; accordingly, there 
  is an unfair disparity in their sentences.  I disagree for two reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, Kufrin was more than a mere employee.  She managed the Scarborough 
  office.  It is also clear that she reaped a much greater financial reward that 
  Krimsky, presumably because of her long relationship with Holub which culminated 
  in their marriage in 1999.  Moreover, in the months before her sentencing Kufrin 
  sent $17,000 to Croatia, bought a piano for $16,000 and paid $30,000 - $40,000 
  for her wedding.  She offered $10,000 by way of restitution.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, Kufrin’s conduct as a salesperson was so appalling that it would 
  have justified a custodial sentence even if she was not also engaged in the 
  enterprise in a managerial role.  The testimony and victim impact statements 
  of scores of victims document Kufrin’s high-pressure and remorseless sales tactics.  
  I cite but three examples from this material.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>My feelings towards the action of Holub Modelling Inc. is mistrust.  That 
      Sandra gain this child trust at 12 years old and played this child for a 
      fool.  She has psychologically destroyed my child confidence in adults and 
      she lied to so many other children.  This is very unethical and low to be 
      extorting money from children.</p>
    <p align="center"><b>. . . . .</b></p>
    <p>It was and still is horrible.  My seven year old daughter and I have suffered 
      terribly for almost two years now, ever since my first dealing with Holub 
      Modelling Inc., on February&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1996 . . . I told Sanda that I 
      was on government assistance and that I could not pay for everything right 
      away, but she did not have any sympathy for my situation and just kept pushing 
      me to pay right away.  So I used all my credit with VISA, borrowed over 
      $1000.00 from my parents, and sacrificed money for food and bills to pay 
      for the runway course, DBS, and the portfolio . . . .</p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><b>. . . . 
  .</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a result of what Sanda Kufrin did to me, I am a financial wreck.  I 
      paid $1000.00 cash directly to Holub for the magazine/advertising package, 
      $300.00 for clothes and $200.00 for my portfolio along with expenses incurred 
      on my credit cards . . . The money I kindly gave to Sanda was for my children’s 
      Christmas.  My children had a terrible Christmas that year . . . What happened 
      to me in the summer of 96 has scarred me for life emotionally.  The fact 
      that Sanda Kufrin tried to use my 5 yr. old son to get more money from me 
      is unjust.  She knew my situation and she showed no mercy.  She deliberately 
      took advantage of a bad situation; a single mother with two children doing 
      the best to look after her children.  She had the audacity to ask me for 
      more money telling me to borrow thousands of dollars from friends and family.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, I see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion 
  that Kufrin’s role in the enterprise, her behaviour, and the rewards she reaped 
  justified a harsher sentence than the one he imposed on Krimsky.</p>
<p><b>(5)     <u>Pregnancy </U> </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by not taking into 
  account her pregnancy when he imposed a custodial sentence.  In addition, the 
  appellant has tendered fresh evidence indicating that a daughter was born and 
  is now 13 months old and living at home with her parents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge was aware that the appellant was pregnant at the time 
  of sentencing; her counsel had referred to her condition in his submissions.  
  There is no obligation on a trial judge to mention every factor when a sentence 
  is imposed.  I cannot say that the trial judge erred by not explicitly mentioning 
  the appellant’s condition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The current situation, as reflected in the fresh evidence, is, I confess, 
  a cause for concern.  The father will be serving a custodial sentence.  If the 
  mother serves an overlapping custodial sentence, a young child will be deprived 
  of both parents at a crucial stage of her development.  The fact that an offender 
  is a sole provider or caregiver is one that can operate as a mitigating factor 
  in sentencing:  see <i>R. v. Bunn</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 505 at 517 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, in the circumstances of this case, I conclude that Kufrin’s 
  current situation does not justify varying her custodial sentence to a conditional 
  sentence.  Her role in the fraud and the devastating effects of the fraud on 
  hundreds of people amply justified a custodial sentence.  In this case, it is 
  fortunate that there are maternal grandparents who are willing and able to look 
  after the child until Kufrin is released.  </p>
