      appellant employer, Sutton Group Incentive Realty Inc. (“Sutton”), had
      a real estate sales office in Barrie, Ontario run by its principal, Don
      Jerry (“Jerry”).  The respondent employee,  Linda Leigh Hunt (“Hunt”),
      worked there as a secretary and receptionist.</span></p>

      Friday, December 16, 1994, beginning at about 1:00 p.m., Sutton held an
      office party in its premises for employees, agents, brokers, customers
      and others with whom it had business relationships.  Guests served themselves
      from an open bar.  No one was designated to monitor alcohol consumption.  Jerry
      was in charge.</span></p>

      attended the event both as an employee and as a guest.  As expected, she
      cleaned up the premises at the end of the party and left with several others
      at about 6:30 p.m.  She lived in Wasaga, about a half hour drive from the
      office, and customarily drove herself to and from work.  Instead of driving
      home from work on this occasion, she went with several others to a nearby
      establishment called P.J.’s Pub.</span></p>

      left P.J.’s about 8:00 p.m., again with several people who had been at
      Sutton’s.  At about 9:45 p.m. Hunt was very seriously injured in a motor
      vehicle accident about 12.2 kilometres away from P.J.’s, on the way towards
      Wasaga.  She appeared to have lost control of her motor vehicle on a slushy
      downhill slope and to have slid into the opposite lane where the left side
      of her motor vehicle was hit by an oncoming vehicle.  Hunt has no memory
      of the accident nor of any event in the week before it.  Apart from the
      time required to drive the 12.2 kilometres, there is no evidence as to
      how she spent the period from 8:00 to 9:45 p.m.</span></p>

      for Sutton served a jury notice and the trial was commenced with a jury,
      in Barrie, on October 2, 2000.  The case was something of a cause célèbre
      locally and on two occasions, at the beginning and during the course of
      the hearing, the trial judge, at the request of the plaintiffs’ counsel,
      instructed the jury to ignore the public comments the trial attracted.  On
      two other occasions, Sutton’s counsel asked the trial judge to declare
      a mistrial by reason of remarks of plaintiffs’ 
    counsel.  In the alternative, Sutton’s counsel asked that the jury be discharged.  None
    of these requests was granted and there is no appeal from those decisions.</span></p>

      for Hunt conceded that she was partly to blame; he suggested a 70% allocation
      of responsibility to her.  The trial judge found Hunt 75% responsible.  P.J.’s
      Pub did not defend the action.  The facts pleaded against P.J.’s were accordingly
      deemed admitted.  The trial judge found it impractical to quantify the
      respective degrees of negligence as between Sutton and P.J.’s and accordingly
      applied the <i>Negligence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. N.1, s. 4 and found them
      jointly and severally liable for 25% of the damages.  Damages were assessed
      at a total of $1,124,916 and judgment was given in Hunt’s favour for $288,104

      two witnesses in question were Fred McColman and Bruce Sutherland.  They
      were called by the defence to testify as to their observations of Hunt
      at the party, and in McColman’s case, at P.J.’s.  McColman had been a bar
      owner and Sutherland was a bartender.  The trial judge permitted plaintiffs’ counsel,
      over the objections of defence counsel, to cross-examine these witnesses
      about the “server intervention program” offered through the Liquor Licence
      Board of Ontario.  That program was designed to make professional servers
      of alcohol conscious of their responsibility to monitor the intake of patrons

      and to take steps, where appropriate, to refuse to serve further alcohol
      and to ensure the safety of patrons and persons with whom they came in
      contact after leaving the licensed premises.  Neither witness was qualified
      as an expert to give the evidence in question and no report by either had
      been provided to opposing counsel.  No reasons appear in the transcript
      for the admission  of this evidence.  The purpose of the evidence appears
      to have been to provide an evidentiary basis for what was said to be the
      standard of care for persons working in licensed premises and therefore
      arguably, a standard against which the conduct of Sutton could be measured.</span></p>

      objection raised by defence counsel was that lay witnesses were being asked
      to give opinion evidence as opposed to simply stating facts relating to
      their observations.  Sopinka, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed.
      (1999) deals with this at p. 609 as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>Courts now have greater freedom to receive lay witnesses’ opinions
        if: (1) the witness has personal knowledge; (2) the witness is in a better
        position than the trier of fact to form the opinion; (3) the witness
        has the necessary experiential capacity to make the conclusion; and (4)
        the opinion is a compendious mode of speaking and the witness could not
        as accurately, adequately  and with reasonable facility describe the
        facts she or he is testifying about.  But as such evidence approaches
        the central issues that the courts must decide, one can still expect
        an insistence that the witnesses stick to the primary facts and refrain
        from giving their inferences.  It is always a matter of degree.  As the
        testimony shades towards a legal conclusion, resistance to admissibility
        develops.</span></div>

        hours spent at The Pub, they ate and also consumed approximately one
        or two servings of liquor.  Fred McColeman, an associate realtor sharing
        office [space] at the defendant, Sutton’s, business enterprise, testified
        on its behalf.  In chief, he testified that he had more than four drinks
        and less than ten at The Pub.  He is convinced that the plaintiff did
        consume much more than two drinks while at The Pub without being certain
        as to how many additional drinks she might have consumed.  <i>I find
        that I cannot rely on Mr. McColeman’s testimony.  It is apparent to me
        that he did not wish to compromise the defendant’s case</i>.  He admits
        that during the afternoon and the subsequent attendance at the premises
        of the defendant, Pub, he might have consumed as much as twenty-two drinks.  He
        was argumentative in his testimony and his recollection of the time when
        the office party ended is inconsistent with that of the other witnesses
        whose evidence I accept.  He doesn’t recall how he got to The Pub nor
        does he remember how his colleagues got there.  He doesn’t remember what
        he had to drink nor how much the others had to drink either.  He admits
        that his main concern upon leaving The Pub was the weather conditions
        and confirms that no one should have been driving, especially if one
        resided out of town as the plaintiff did.  He confirms that freezing
        rain had fallen while at The Pub but at the time of departure, it had
        turned to snow.  I find that after the plaintiff had consumed two drinks
        at The Pub, the party broke up at approximately 8:00 p.m.  [Emphasis

</div>

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Causation is an expression of the relationship

<div class=Section1>
  <p class=Nopara><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for Sutton argues that if Sutton was

      the type of harm that occurs.  If an intervening act, <i>eg.</i> the visit
      to P.J.’s, “is such that it might reasonably have been foreseen or anticipated
      as the natural and probable result of the original negligence, then the
      original negligence will be regarded as the proximate cause of the injury,

      the instant case, the plaintiffs argued that Hunt became intoxicated at
      the office party, had more to drink at P.J.’s Pub and was still intoxicated
      at the time of the accident, three and one-quarter hours after leaving
      the office.  The plaintiffs also argued that Sutton was negligent in having
      an open bar (as a result of which it was more difficult to monitor alcohol
      intake), in letting Hunt leave by herself and in failing to anticipate
      further drinking by Hunt at a nearby pub.  The plaintiffs argued that the
      state of inebriation was such that it continued up to the time of the accident.  It
      was argued therefore that there was no breach or interruption in the chain

        duty of care to patrons, and as a result, may be required to prevent
        an intoxicated patron from driving where it is apparent that he intends

        alcohol supplied by Sutton, that Sutton knew or should have known that
        she was intoxicated, that Sutton knew she intended to drive and that
        in those circumstances Sutton should have taken more steps than it did

      Although the weather might certainly have contributed to the accident,
          I find that the preponderance of evidence satisfies me that her degree
          of intoxication played a major role in the accident.  I find that the
          likelihood of such an accident occurring in her state of intoxication
          was foreseeable and is a direct consequence of the failure on the part
          of the defendant Sutton in discharging his duty owed to his employee
          at the workplace.  I find that it is a reasonable inference to draw
          that the plaintiff’s failure to engage the four-wheel drive in her
          motor vehicle in the road conditions existing at the time contributed
          to her loss of control of the motor vehicle.  I find that her degree
          of impairment inevitably impaired her judgment in putting the motor
          vehicle in four-wheel drive.</span></div>

      but did not stand out as being any more affected by alcohol than the other
      guests towards the end.  He testified that he did not see Hunt drink anything

      no consideration appears to have been given to the discussion which took
      place at P.J.’s as to whether Hunt would go on with others to McColman’s

      other error was in failing to deal with the presumptions underlying the
      toxicologist’s opinion evidence.  As noted earlier, the trial judge first
      reviewed in summary fashion the evidence of some of the witnesses as to
      Hunt’s condition.  Instead of then stating his conclusions, the trial judge
      turned immediately to the evidence of the toxicologist who was, in the
      trial judge’s language:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span

      gist of the toxicologist’s evidence is set out in paragraph 8 of these
      reasons.  Fundamental to her opinion are the assumptions that Hunt had
      had nothing to drink before the party, that she had two drinks at P.J.s,
      and that she had had nothing further to drink before the accident.  The
      finding with respect to the consumption of two drinks at P.J.’s is fully
      explained in the reasons.  The trial judge, however, offered no explanation
      as to why the assumption of no consumption of alcohol during the period
      from 8:00&nbsp;to&nbsp;9:45&nbsp;p.m. should be accepted.  If the assumption
      is erroneous or cannot be made out on a balance of probabilities, the foundation
      for the toxicologist’s conclusion as to the amount of alcohol consumed
      at the Sutton party collapses and the trial judge’s finding in that regard
      cannot stand. </span></p>

      the evidence before this court, I am unable to make a determination as
      to the validity of the assumption and therefore cannot make the requisite
      findings of fact as to Hunt’s degree of intoxication at the time she left
      the Sutton party.</span></p>

      b) an invitation Hunt received at P.J.’s to spend the night with others;
      and c) where and how Hunt might have spent the missing one and three-quarter
      hours.  These matters are relevant to the chain of causation and without
      the trial judge’s findings on them and in the absence of evidence upon
      which to make those findings, this court is unable itself to decide the
      matter of causation.</span></p>

      appellant also invites this court to hold that, even accepting the findings
      of fact of the trial judge and whether or not the appellant had more drinks
      after she left P.J.’s, the trial judge ought to have found a break in the
      chain of causation by virtue of the lapse of time between the end of the
      party at Sutton’s and the accident. I am not prepared to make that finding.  In
      my view, the trial judge’s findings of fact concerning the chain of causation
      are incomplete and prevent this court from making an independent determination
      of the issue of causation.  Even accepting the findings of negligence made
      by the trial judge, as well as his findings of fact relating to causation,
      and assuming that all outstanding factual issues would be resolved in favour
      of the respondents, I am not prepared to hold that a trier of fact would
      be precluded from finding that the negligence of the appellant was a proximate
      cause of the accident.</span></p>

      remaining issue in the appeal challenges the trial judge’s discharge of
      the jury upon the grounds of complexity and public commentary.  The law
      in this regard is clear.  The right to trial by jury is a statutory right
      and a substantial one.  A judge, on the motion of a party, may strike out
      a jury notice or discharge a jury.  The trial judge is in the best position
      to determine how to exercise that power.  The decision of the trial judge
      to keep or to discharge a jury is an exercise of a discretionary power.  An
      appellate court may not interfere with that exercise unless it has been
      carried out arbitrarily, capriciously or on wrong or inapplicable principles: <i>Courts
      of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. 43 s. 108(1) and (3), Rule 47.02(2)

      appellant’s first point is that many of the matters relied upon by plaintiffs’ counsel
      are matters of law and as such are the concern of the trial judge, not
      the jury.  As an example, the question whether Sutton owes Hunt a duty
      of care is a question of law:  <i>Stewart v. Pettie</i>, <i>supra,</i> <i>per</i> Major
      J. at pp. 144-45, citing Fleming, <i>The Law</i> <i>of Torts</i> 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.
      (1992) at pp. 105-6.  In any event, it was conceded by Sutton from the

      relationship.</span></p>

</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US>It is for the court to determine the existence of a duty relationship
        and to lay down in general terms the standard of care by which to measure
        the defendant’s conduct; it is for the jury to translate the general
        to a particular standard suitable for the case in hand, and to decide
        whether that standard has been attained.</span></div>

      reasons of Finlayson J.A. in <i>John v. Flynn,</i> <i>supra,</i> indicate
      that where an employer serves alcohol to its employees, the scope of the
      duty of care may extend beyond the workplace.  That was the case in <i>Jacobsen
      v. Nike Canada Ltd</i>. (1996), 133 D.L.R. (4th)  377 (B.C.S.C.) in which
      the court found the employer owed the same duty owed by commercial drinking
      establishments to take “positive steps” to prevent the employee from driving
      while impaired.  In general terms, the standard of care that the law imposes
      is to act reasonably to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm.  What is “reasonable” may
      vary from one community to another.  Accordingly, it is particularly appropriate
      that this “finding of fact” be made by a jury.</span></p>

      the motion to discharge the jury, the plaintiffs’ 
    particular concern was “questions of mixed law and fact” and the trial judge
    addressed the matter on that basis.  This does not strike me as a helpful
    approach.  The determination of the standard of care in any given case is <b><i>always</i></b> a
    question of “mixed fact and law”.  As Iacobucci J. stated for the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Southam Inc. v.</i> <i>Director of Investigation and
    Research</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at 766-7:</span></p>

    <div class=Section1><span

        legal test is; questions of fact are questions about what actually took
        place between the parties; and questions of mixed law and fact are questions
        about whether the facts satisfy the legal tests.  A simple example will
        illustrate these concepts.  In the law of tort, the question what “negligence” 
      means is a question of law.  The question whether the defendant did this
      or that is a question of fact.  And, once it has been decided that the
      applicable standard is one of negligence, the question whether the defendant

      upon a trial judge’s inability to explain the law to the jury as a basis
      for discharging the jury.</span></p>

        resolve the question of onus and put the appropriate question to the

      it bears repeating that the right to trial by jury is a substantial right
      and one which is not to be taken away lightly.  The onus is upon a party
      moving to discharge a jury and that onus must also be substantial.  The
      arguments of counsel on the motion are fully recorded, as are the reasons
      of the trial judge.  With respect, none of these reflect any substantial
      reason for discharging the jury.</span></p>

      motion to discharge the jury was brought on two bases – complexity and
      public commentary.  With regard to the latter, the affidavit of Robert
      M. Durante, one of the plaintiffs’ counsel, sworn October 17, 2000 was
      filed.  The affidavit indicates that there had been extensive media coverage
      of the trial from the outset, that it was one-sided and prejudicial, that
      Hunt was aware of the coverage and concerned about getting a fair trial,
      that she had been subjected to rude comments from the public by way of
      telephone calls and e-mail messages from persons unknown, that there had
      been letters to the editor criticizing her lawsuit and negative comments
      on radio talk shows, and her claim had been ridiculed on a television program
      called The Royal Canadian Air Farce.</span></p>

      outset of the trial to instruct the jury in this regard.  At counsel’s

      trial judge concluded his ruling on the discharge motion as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Because of the aforementioned complexities
        submitted by the plaintiff and reproduced above, I have come to the conclusion
        that it would be inappropriate in this instance for this court to continue
        to proceed with the jury, and in the circumstances, I have discharged
        same.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-US><br>
      In the light of my aforementioned ruling, the question as to whether I
          would have discharged the jury on the secondary grounds, namely, that
          the adverse publicity in the local media is such that it would be unreasonable
          to believe that the jury would be absolutely ignorant thereof, and
          would be unprejudiced by it, has now become moot.  However, I do accept
          as a fact, the undisputed evidence of the affiant, Robert M. Durante,
          an associate of the plaintiff law firm, that the media has covered
          this action extensively from the outset and continues to cover it and
          report it in several newspapers and radio.  It has even been featured
          briefly on a television airing of the Royal Canadian Air Farce on October
          13<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>.  I accept that generally, the
          editorial comments and the letters to the editor are very negative
          and could possibly have the effect adversely prejudicing the jurors
          if brought to their attention.  On that ground alone, I would not however,
          have discharged a jury, but added to the aforementioned grounds, it
          supports my decision.</span></div>

      without deciding, that the disposition of the motion respecting publicity
      adds to the weight of the argument in favour of discharging the jury, in
      the absence of any evidence that any member of the jury had seen or heard
      of any of the publicity in question, the trial judge erred in giving any
      weight whatever to this consideration.  Had there been any concern whatever,
      the jurors could and should have been asked whether any of them had seen
      or heard of the material in question.</span></p>

      summarize, I would give no effect to the grounds of appeal respecting the
      evidence of McColman and Sutherland and the issue of causation.  As to
      the discharge of the jury, I find the trial judge erred in considering
      the length of time it would take to prepare to charge the jury, in failing
      to consider splitting the trial, and in giving weight to the difficulty
      he would have in instructing the jury as to matters of law.  These are
      errors of law.  I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial on both
      liability and damages.  The costs of this appeal I would leave for disposition
      by the judge at the new trial.</span></p>
