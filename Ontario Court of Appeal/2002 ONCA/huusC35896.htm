  </span> When a company wants to transfer pension assets from an existing pension 
  plan to a different pension plan, it must obtain the consent of the Superintendent 
  of Pensions (the “Superintendent”)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> to the transfer.  The Superintendent must withhold consent to 
  a transfer “that does not protect the pension benefits of the members and former 
  members of the pension plan”: see s.&nbsp;81(5) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;P.8&nbsp;(the&nbsp;<i>“PBA”</i>). </p>

  </span> In the present case, a company proposed a transfer of pension assets

  by its affiliates in Canada and the United States.  The company applied for 
  consent to the transfer by the Superintendent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span

  </span> At about the same time, a Pension Advisory Committee (the “PAC”) representing 
  the retired salaried members of the existing pension plan took a different view 
  of the transfer.  Concerned that the transfer might remove their potential right 
  to a distribution of the substantial surplus that had accumulated in the plan, 
  the PAC applied to the Superintendent for a partial wind-up of the pension plan 
  pursuant to s.&nbsp;69 of the <i>PBA</i>.</p>

  </span> The appellant, Weavexx Corporation (“Weavexx”), a Canadian corporation, 
  is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of products used in the pulp 
  and paper production process.  At all times relevant to this litigation, Weavexx 
  was a majority-owned subsidiary of the appellant BTR Canada Holdings Inc., which 
  in turn was a Canadian affiliate of the appellant BTR Inc., a Delaware corporation 
  (together, “BTR”).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On October 26, 1995, the PAC, which had got wind of BTR’s plan to consolidate 
  the pension plans of all of its affiliates in Canada and the United States, 
  wrote a letter to the Superintendent requesting that the Weavexx Pension Plan 
  be wound up.  The letter, signed by the respondent Eystein Huus, stated, <i>inter 
  alia</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>We in the committee strongly believe that this plan now should be wound 
      up.  The main reason for this is the severe downsizing which has taken place 
      during the last four years, including two “early retirement windows” – one 
      in early 1992, and one in 1994.  The ratio of “Actual Members” to “Retirees” 
      has dropped from 93/46 at the end of 1991 – to 49/72 at the end of 1994.  
      There has also been further downsizing in 1995.</p>
    <p>The plan has a very healthy surplus as shown in the enclosed “Report of 
      Operations – for Plan Year ended December 31, 1994”.  This in spite of the 
      fact that the Company has not contributed to the plan for about 20 years.  
      The surplus therefore comes from employee contributions, wise investments, 
      and a nearly total lack of improvements to the plan.  The latter can best 
      be exemplified by the fact that there have been no improvements for the 
      retirees in the last 20 years – in spite of hefty inflation rates in several 
      of those years!</p>
    <p>Our committee believes that this surplus should primarily benefit those 
      who have contributed to it, and who in many cases now live in dire circumstances 
      – rather than end up as an asset for a company which hasn’t contributed 
      to it for such a very long time!  And for that reason we recommend the plan 
      be wound up.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Almost a year later, on October 7, 1996, Mr. Huus again wrote to the 
  Superintendent, informing him that Weavexx had announced that it would close 
  its plant in Arnprior in 1996.  He continued: “All production has now ended, 
  and the dismantling of the plant is well under way”.  On behalf of the PAC, 
  he concluded by urging the Pension Commission to order a partial wind-up of 
  the Weavexx pension plan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the same 1995-1996 time frame, the appellants had been moving on 
  an entirely different track.  In September 1995, Weavexx notified its employees 
  and retirees of BTR’s intention to consolidate the pension plans of all its 
  affiliates, including Weavexx.  More than a year later, on December 30, 1996, 
  Weavexx made a formal application to the Superintendent to transfer its pension 
  assets into the consolidated BTR plan.  The proposed effective date of the transfer 
  was January 1, 1996 (almost a year earlier).  The surplus in the Weavexx plan 
  on January 1, 1996 was $4,216,300.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In considering the appellants’ application for a transfer, the Superintendent 
  was required to consider s.&nbsp;81(5) of the <i>PBA</i> which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>81(5) </b><i>The Superintendent shall refuse to consent to a transfer 
      of assets that does not protect the pension benefits and any other benefits 
      of the members and former members of the original pension plan</i> or that 
      does not meet the prescribed requirements and qualifications. [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On August 15, 1997, the Superintendent approved the transfer of pension 
  funds from the Weavexx plan to the BTR plan.  The amount of the approved transfer 
  was $14,661,282.  The Superintendent communicated his consent to the transfer 
  to the appellants but not to the respondents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span> On June 30, 1998, the respondents brought an application for judicial 
  review of the Superintendent’s decision dated August 15, 1997 approving the 
  transfer of the assets of the Weavexx pension plan to the consolidated BTR pension 
  plan.  In a decision dated May 30, 2000, the Divisional Court (Flinn, Jennings 
  and Ferguson JJ.) set aside the Superintendent’s consent and ordered the return 
  of the assets to the Weavexx plan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span

  dealing with the question of remedy, the court said that any new decision of 
  the Superintendent dealing with the wind-up or partial wind-up of the Weavexx 
  plan was to be referred to the Financial Services Tribunal (the “Tribunal”), 
  the successor since 1997 of the Pension Commission.</p>

  </span> The appellants contend that the Divisional Court made several errors 
  when it set aside the Superintendent’s decision dated August 17, 1997 approving 
  the transfer of pension assets from the Weavexx plan to the consolidated BTR 
  plan.  They submit that the Divisional Court erred by holding that the Superintendent 
  exceeded his jurisdiction by failing to give adequate consideration to the trust 
  provisions of the Weavexx plan and to the accrued surplus in the prior plan.  
  The appellants also submit that the Divisional Court erred by holding that the 
  Superintendent exceeded his jurisdiction by approving the transfer without taking 
  account of a post-transfer development, namely the closure some months later 
  of the Arnprior plant.  The appellants also contend that the Divisional Court 
  erred by concluding that the Superintendent did not accord the respondents their 
  rights of procedural fairness.  Finally, the appellants contend that the Divisional 
  Court erred by concluding that BTR owed, and breached, a duty of procedural 
  fairness to the appellants.  In summary, the appellants contend that the Divisional 
  Court erred in its interpretation of substantive pension law and erred in its 
  analysis of the process issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that the appellants have accurately characterized the 
  decision of the Divisional Court.  My reading of the decision is that the Divisional 
  Court disposed of the application <i>entirely</i> on the process issue.  It 
  is true that the court referred to the substantive pension law issues, including 
  the trust provisions of the Weavexx plan and the legal nature of a surplus.  
  However, these references were made in the context of explaining the arguments 
  the appellants wanted to make to the Superintendent.  In my view, this is clear 
  from the final two paragraphs of the court’s reasons on the validity of the 
  Superintendent’s decision.  The court stated its conclusion in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly, the court concludes that the Superintendent exceeded his jurisdiction 
      when he did not give adequate consideration to the question of wind-up and 
      the trust provisions of the Weavexx plan with its surplus and further failed 
      to observe their fiduciary duties to the applicants.</p>
    <p>Without deciding how far the Superintendent had to go with respect to procedural 
      fairness in dealing with the request of the applicants and a number of members 
      of the pension plan of Weavexx, procedural fairness was not accorded to 
      these members of the plan by either the Superintendent or BTR.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not read this passage as representing a decision by the Divisional 
  Court on the substantive pension law issues arising from the fiduciary duties 
  of pension administrators, the interpretation of the trust provisions of the 
  Weavexx pension plan or the legal nature of, and entitlement to, a pension plan 
  surplus.  Rather, the court is saying that because the PAC was not accorded 
  procedural fairness, it was not able to argue, and the Superintendent did not 
  therefore “give adequate consideration to”, those substantive issues.  It goes 
  without saying that if the PAC had been given the opportunity to advance these 
  arguments, the Superintendent might well have decided them against the PAC.

  clear that it was applying a reasonableness standard to its review of the merits

  “The court takes the view that the standard to be applied  to the Superintendent

  </span> The Superintendent’s decision approving the transfer of assets from 
  the Weavexx pension plan to the consolidated BTR pension plan was made pursuant 
  to s.&nbsp;81 of the <i>PBA</i>.  Section 81(5) of the <i>PBA</i> requires the

  </span> I start with this observation: pension plans are for the benefit of 
  the employees, not the companies which create them.  They are a particularly 
  important component of the compensation employees receive in return for their 
  labour.  They are not a gift from the employer; they are earned by the employees.  
  Indeed, in addition to their labour, employees usually agree to other trade-offs 
  in order to obtain a pension.  As explained by Cory J. in<i> Schmidt v. Air 
  Products Canada Ltd.</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611 at 646:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the case of pension plans, employees not only contribute to the fund, 
      in addition they almost invariably agree to accept lower wages and fewer 
      employment benefits in exchange for the employer’s agreeing to set up the 
      pension trust in their favour.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span

  In <i>Gencorp Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pensions)</i> (1998), 
  39 O.R. (3d) 38 at 43 (C.A.), Robins J.A. said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he <i>Pension Benefit Act</i> is clearly public policy legislation establishing 
      a carefully calibrated legislative and regulatory scheme prescribing minimum 
      standards for all pension plans in Ontario.  It is intended to benefit and 
      protect the interests of members and former members of pension plans . .

  1 O.R. (3d) 122 at 127 (C.A.) (<i>“Firestone”</i>), Blair J.A. stated that the 
  <i>PBA</i> “is clearly intended to benefit employees” and “[i]n particular . 
  . . evinces a special solicitude for employees affected by plant closures”.  
  In the present case, it was the downsizing and then closure of the Arnprior 
  plant which clearly played a role in the retirees’ concern and in the employer’s 
  transfer application.</p>

  </span> The implication of these authorities is that the Superintendent owes 
  a high duty to employees with Ontario pension plans.  As for the nature and 
  consequences of this duty, I would adopt, as I did in <i>Hinds</i>, the eloquent 
  language used by Reid J. in <i>Re Collins and Pension Commission of Ontario</i> 
  (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 274 at 285 (Div. Ct.) (<i>“Collins”</i>):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[I]t appears that the commission was established to ensure that certain 
      interests were protected.  While there is no doubt that those interests 
      included the employer’s, there appears to be equally no doubt that the commission 
      was established to safeguard the plan members’ interests as well . . . While 
      the commission may not, strictly speaking, be a trustee for the members, 
      for it holds no money belonging to the plan, it would be artificial to conclude 
      that the commission’s obligation to members is lower than the high standard 
      of fiduciary obligation imposed on trustees.</p>

  </span> The chronology and contents of the record establish that the Superintendent 
  focussed almost exclusively on the employers’ transfer application made pursuant 
  to s.&nbsp;81 of the <i>PBA</i>, but ignored almost entirely the retirees’ request

  </span> All of these sub-sections were in play in the 1995-1997 period. The 
  corporate appellants admitted that the employer made no contributions to the 
  pension plan after 1983:  see the affidavit of Emily Van Vleet, Director of 
  Employee Benefits at BTR, paragraph 13.  Thus s.&nbsp;69(1)(a) of the <i>PBA</i> 
  was a potential source for a wind-up order by the Superintendent.  As well, 
  throughout the early 1990s there was significant downsizing at Weavexx’s Arnprior 
  plant and it was closed in late 1996.  Accordingly, s.&nbsp;69(1)(d) and (e) 
  were also potential bases for a wind-up order.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span>

  </span> Against the backdrop of the availability of both transfer and wind-up 
  of the Weavexx pension plan, I turn to the chronology of events and the Superintendent’s 
  role and responses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The PAC moved first.  It wrote to the Superintendent in 1993, alerting 
  him to the substantial downsizing at the Arnprior plant.  It wrote again on 
  October 26, 1995 informing the Superintendent that it had been notified by BTR 
  of its proposal to consolidate various pension plans, including the Weavexx 
  plan.  The PAC informed the Superintendent that they “strongly believe that 
  this plan now should be wound up”.  The Superintendent acknowledged their letter 
  on November 28, 1995 and said: “I would like to assure you that your representation 
  on behalf of the Pension Advisory Committee will be taken into consideration 
  when we review any application that is filed in respect of the proposed consolidation”.  
  On October 7, 1996, the PAC again wrote to the Pension Commission and requested 
  that the Commission order a partial wind-up.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The corporate appellants did not make their transfer application until 
  December&nbsp;30, 1996, more than a year after  the first  request  by  the 
  PAC  for a  wind-up.  The appropriate documents were sent to the Superintendent.  
  However, the corporate appellants did not send them to the PAC until May 7, 
  1997, even though the subject matter of the application was <i>employee and 
  retiree pensions</i>, there was a $4,216,300 surplus in the plan, there was 
  a PAC which had been established pursuant to s.&nbsp;24 of the <i>PBA</i>, and 
  the PAC had corresponded extensively with Weavexx and BTR about the proposed 
  transfer and consolidation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because the PAC was having difficulty communicating with the Pension 
  Commission, it contacted the area M.P.P., W. Leo Jordan, and asked for his assistance. 
  The result was a letter from the Superintendent to Mr. Jordan dated June 11, 
  1997, stating, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We have reviewed the reported annual membership for the above named pension 
      plan and other related documents filed with the Pension Commission of Ontario 
      for the periods between January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1995 and cannot 
      establish any reason why the plan should have been wound up or even partially 
      wound up at any time during the above described period.</p>
    <p>We have also reviewed the documents filed for the plan consolidation (merger) 
      effective January 1, 1996 and conclude that the consolidation meets the 
      requirement of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>. . . . </p>
    <p>A letter has been sent to the plan administrator [Ms.&nbsp;Van&nbsp;Vleet 
      at BTR] requesting confirmation of the closure of the Arnprior Plant of 
      Weavexx Corporation since a partial wind up may be warranted under subsection 
      69(1) of the Act.  This would not have any effect on the consolidation . 
      . . as the partial wind up of the plan would be subsequent to the consolidation 
      of the plans.  To date we have not received confirmation that a partial 
      wind up is warranted.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The timing and the contents of this letter are a cause of concern.  
  On June 11, 1997, the Superintendent is informing an M.P.P. that a wind-up or 
  partial wind-up based on downsizing is not warranted.  This decision was not, 
  however, formally communicated to the PAC which made the formal request for 
  a wind-up.  In the same letter, the Superintendent is informing an M.P.P. that 
  the proposed consolidation complies with the <i>PBA</i>.  This was not, however, 
  communicated to the corporations which made the application until the Superintendent 
  made his formal decision on August 15, 1997.  Moreover, the decision made on 
  that date was never communicated formally to the PAC, even though it was its 
  members’ pensions which lay at the heart of the application and even though 
  the PAC had corresponded extensively with the Superintendent about the proposed 
  transfer and consolidation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third paragraph of the Superintendent’s letter (set out above) is 
  also interesting.  It refers to a letter that Steve Young, the Pension Officer 
  with carriage of the file, had sent to Ms.&nbsp;Van&nbsp;Vleet on May 30, 1997 
  requesting information about the closure of the Arnprior plant.  In the letter 
  Mr. Young said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>If certain conditions are met, the Superintendent of Pensions may order 
      the wind up of a pension plan, in whole or in part, pursuant to authority

    <p>Please provide us with the name and registration number of any pension 
      plan in which employees affected by the above event [the plant closure] 
      participated.  Also advise us as to your company’s intentions with respect 
      to these pension plans and the affected members.  If it is not your company’s 
      intention to voluntarily declare a wind up of the plan, either in whole 
      or in part, we would ask that you provide us with details of the events 
      affecting the members.  The information is being requested to determine 
      if any of the conditions under section 69 of the Act for the Superintendent 
      to exercise his authority to order a wind up have been satisfied.</p>

  </span> Ms. Van&nbsp;Vleet responded to this letter on June 19, 1997.  She indicated 
  that Weavexx had initiated a full wind-up with respect to hourly employees.  
  She said: “the Arnprior Hourly Plan is significantly overfunded with a surplus 
  of $2.9 million.  We have approached the Union and are currently negotiating 
  with them regarding a proposed distribution of that surplus”.  In other words, 
  for the hourly workers, BTR was contemplating a wind-up, acknowledged a surplus, 
  and was negotiating a distribution of the surplus with the members of that plan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the salaried employees, Ms.&nbsp;Van&nbsp;Vleet communicated 
  the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The closure also affected seven salaried employees who are participating 
      in the <i>BTR Pension Plan for Canadian Employees</i> registration number 
      0559716.  We do not intend to declare a formal partial windup of this plan 
      in respect of the seven individuals involved, but we will grant these members 
      full vesting and growth rights.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It will be recalled that the surplus in the Weavexx pension plan for 
  salaried employees was approximately $4.2 million.  There is nothing in Ms.&nbsp;Van&nbsp;Vleet’s 
  letter to explain why a surplus of $2.9 million in the pension plan for hourly 
  workers suggests a full wind-up, whereas a surplus of $4.2 million in the pension 
  plan for salaried workers does not suggest any kind of wind-up.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Superintendent made his formal decision approving the transfer application 
  on August 15, 1997.  There is nothing in that decision about the PAC’s request 
  for a wind-up or partial wind-up of the pension plan.  The Superintendent’s 
  decision was not sent to the respondents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Based on this review, mostly chronological, of the major events, I share 
  the Divisional Court’s discomfort with the process adopted by the Superintendent 
  in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the transfer side of the equation, the Superintendent engaged in 
  a review of the application and made a formal decision.  However, I question 
  whether this decision was anything more than a formality given that the Superintendent 
  presaged his final decision in a letter to an M.P.P. two months before the formal 
  decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the wind-up side of the equation, the Superintendent’s performance 
  was genuinely troubling.  There was little and poor communication with the PAC, 
  even though the PAC was established pursuant to s.&nbsp;24 of the <i>PBA</i> 
  and requested the Superintendent to consider a wind-up more than a year before 
  the corporate appellants made their transfer application.  The only substantive 
  communication the Superintendent ever made about the merits of the PAC’s request 
  was in a letter to the M.P.P. from the PAC’s constituency.  The Superintendent 
  appears never to have made a formal decision about the wind-up request.  Indeed, 
  it is unclear whether the Superintendent was seriously considering the wind-up 
  issue.  Pension Officer Young’s letter to Ms.&nbsp;Van&nbsp;Vleet at BTR on 
  May 30, 1997 seems to suggest that he was:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The information is being requested to determine if any of the conditions 
      under section 69 of the Act for the Superintendent to exercise his authority 
      to order a wind-up have been satisfied.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in his letter to the M.P.P. just 11 days later, on June 11, 1997, 
  the Superintendent stated that a partial wind-up would be subsequent to the 
  consolidation and that “[t]o date, we have not received confirmation that a 
  partial wind up is warranted”, which seems to suggest that the Superintendent 
  regarded his role on the wind-up issue as reactive – and, indeed, reactive to 
  the employer, not the requesting PAC.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was a good deal at stake in this merger/consolidation/wind-up 
  matter.  There was a surplus of more than $4.2 million in a plan to which, on 
  its own evidence, the employer had not contributed for 13 years previous to 
  its consolidation application.  I do not say that this is unlawful.  Rather, 
  I do say that the Superintendent ignored the PAC’s request for a wind-up decision 
  as he considered that application.  Moreover, on the record, it is unclear how 
  the Superintendent viewed the relationship between the employers’ s.&nbsp;81 
  transfer and consolidation application and the employees’ s.&nbsp;69 wind-up 
  request.  Finally, it appears that the Superintendent never made a decision 
  on the employees’ request.  All of this was, in my view, starkly contrary to 
  the observation of Blair J.A. in <i>Firestone, supra,</i> that the <i>PBA</i> 
  “is clearly intended to benefit employees” and “[i]n particular . . . evinces 
  a special solicitude for employees affected by plant closures”.  Accordingly, 
  I think that the Divisional Court was correct to conclude that the Superintendent’s 
  decision of August 15, 1997 was unreasonable.  The Superintendent’s failure 
  to consider the partial wind-up request prior to, or in conjunction with, deciding 
  the transfer application rendered unreasonable his consent to the transfer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to a different issue, the Divisional Court also concluded that 
  BTR had not accorded procedural fairness to the respondents.  In my view, this 
  conclusion is in error.  The decision that is the subject matter of the application 
  for judicial review and this appeal is the Superintendent’s decision.  BTR was 
  the applicant, not the decision-maker. Hence it did not owe the respondents 
  any duty of procedural fairness related to that decision.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the subject of remedy, the Divisional Court ordered that the consent 
  of the Superintendent to the transfer of assets be set aside.  The court also 
  ordered that the pension assets be returned to the Weavexx plan.  Finally, the 
  court ordered the Superintendent to consider the wind-up issue.  Any decision 
  by the Superintendent (or failure to make a decision) would then be referred 
  to the Tribunal.  The appellants challenge the second and third components of 
  this decision – i.e. the return of the assets to the Weavexx plan and the compulsory 
  role of the Tribunal in the resolution of the wind-up issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the return of the assets issue, the appellants contend that the Divisional 
  Court only had jurisdiction to quash the Superintendent’s consent to the transfer; 
  it did not have the authority to take the additional step of returning the assets 
  to the Weavexx plan.  Specifically, the appellants contend that the Divisional 
  Court’s order breached s.&nbsp;81(6) of the <i>PBA</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>81(6) </b>The Superintendent by order may require the transferee to 
      return to the pension fund assets . . . transferred without the prior consent 
      of the Superintendent . . . .</p>
    <p>According to the appellants, this provision requires that the Superintendent, 
      not the Divisional Court, decide whether the pension assets should be returned 
      to the Weavexx plan.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  On the specific point, I agree with the analysis of the 
  Divisional Court:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Insofar as the transfer of assets is concerned the argument that s.&nbsp;81(6) 
      and (7) apply, is, in our view, in error.  These sections refer to the situation 
      where assets are transferred “without the prior consent of the Superintendent 
      . . . .”  That is not the case here, the assets were transferred with the 
      consent of the Superintendent.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the general point, I see no principled basis for interfering with 
  the Divisional Court’s decision to order the return of the pension assets to 
  Weavexx.  Once the Superintendent’s decision was set aside, an order which had 
  the effect of returning the parties to their original positions can hardly be 
  viewed as frustrating the purposes of the <i>PBA</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the component of the decision according a compulsory role to the 
  Tribunal on any future decision on the wind-up issue, the respondents in effect 
  concede in their factum that the Divisional Court erred:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 65.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> The Superintendent has pointed out that interpreted liberally, the 
      reasons of the Divisional Court would require that any future decision by 
      the Superintendent on the request for a partial wind up must be referred 
      to a Tribunal hearing, regardless of whether any party requests a hearing.  
      This could not reasonably have been intended by the Divisional Court.  All 
      parties agree that the decision of the Superintendent with respect to the 
      wind up request should be referred to the Tribunal only at the request of 
      one of the affected parties.</p>

  </span> This is a fair concession.  Section 89 of the <i>PBA</i> permits a party 
  affected by a potential wind-up order by the Superintendent to <i>request</i> 
  a hearing by the Tribunal.  The Divisional Court erred by making such a hearing 
  mandatory.</p>

  </span> The Divisional Court awarded costs on a solicitor and client scale “for 
  a number of reasons”:</p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p> a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> The matter was indeed a complex one made more complex by the lack 
      of support given by both the office of the superintendent and BTR.</p>
    <p> b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> This attitude was demonstrated by the manner in which the assets 
      were finally merged, notwithstanding the original representation that they 
      would be kept separate and apart and the lack of information given to the 
      applicants by the Superintendent and, indeed, to their counsel when it appeared 
      that litigation was being contemplated.</p>
    <p> c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> The fact that it is not clear whether or not the Superintendent 
      had taken any position with respect to the wind-up of the Weavexx plan.</p>
    <p> d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> Finally, by the fact that BTR would not support these retirees by 
      providing them with funds in order to retain counsel to make submissions 
      on their behalf.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the record supports these four reasons.  The Superintendent 
  appears never to have made a decision on the wind-up request made by the respondents.  
  The appellant corporations also did not treat the respondents properly.  They 
  did not send a copy of the valuation report to the PAC until almost five months 
  after the transfer application was filed, even though they knew that the PAC 
  was deeply concerned  about the matter.  They did not assist the PAC with legal 
  representation, even though the pension plan had a surplus of $4.2 million and 
  Weavexx had not contributed a penny to it for 13 years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, although solicitor and client costs should be awarded only 
  in exceptional cases, I can see no basis for interfering with the Divisional 
  Court’s conclusion that this was such a case.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'><b>E.            <u>DISPOSITION</u></b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would allow the appeal in part.  I would set aside those components 
  of the Divisional Court’s decision in which the court concluded that the corporate 
  appellant BTR had not accorded procedural fairness to the respondents and ordered 
  that any future decision made by the Superintendent on the wind-up issue be 
  automatically referred to the Financial Services Tribunal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents have been substantially successful on the appeal.  I 
  would award them costs of the appeal payable by all of the respondents.</p>

    [5] </span></a> I note in passing that none of the appellants takes the position 
    that a wind-up order can flow only from an application by the employer.  Although 
    s. 68 of the <i>PBA</i> envisions a wind-up process initiated by the employer, 
    s.&nbsp;69 is not limited in this fashion.  Indeed, the steps the Superintendent 
    took in this case, to be discussed below, indicate that the Superintendent 
    regarded it as his duty to deal with a wind-up request from the respondent 
    retirees.</p>
