<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p><b>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Pitt dated April 20, 2001.</b></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mesbur J. decided at the trial directed by Somers J. that the 
  evidence did not support the claims based on interference with contractual or 
  economic relations.  In our view, these findings give rise to an issue estoppel 
  against the plaintiff with respect to those claims.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We do not accept the argument that by successfully setting aside 
  the judgment against it for damages and an injunction, the appellant must be 
  taken to have also set aside the findings made in its favour.  With respect 
  to the motions judge, we see no logical or policy basis for requiring the appellant 
  to forego the decisions in its favour as the price of setting aside the judgment 
  which was, wrongly, granted against it.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents submit that they might have been assisted by 
  admissions in the pleadings or from documentary and oral discovery in making 
  out their claim for interference with contractual and economic relations had 
  the action had proceeded as a defended action in the ordinary manner.  In our 
  view, the respondents can hardly complain about any disadvantages of proceeding 
  by default.  Knowing that the appellant intended to defend the action, the respondents 
  deliberately proceeded by default and went to trial on the basis of the evidence 
  they had.  Having failed to prove the claims for interference with contractual 
  and economic relations, the respondents are now precluded by the doctrine of 
  issue estoppel from proceeding again to trial on those claims.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, with respect to the claims based on misleading and false 
  advertising of various products, Mesbur J. made findings in favour of the respondents.  
  On those claims, she found that the actions of the appellant had caused harm 
  and damage to the respondents, and she awarded a broadly worded injunction, 
  enjoining the appellant from using certain phrases “relating to any product 
  carried by the plaintiffs.”  As well, she awarded $10,000 damages with respect 
  to the product “Beauty Parlour Night Kit”.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In view of those findings and the remedies awarded, we do not 
  accept the appellant’s submissions that only the “Beauty Parlour Night Kit” 
  claim for false and misleading advertising should be allowed to proceed to trial.  
  It is apparent from the injunction she awarded that Mesbur J. did not reject 
  or dismiss the cause of action for false and misleading advertising in relation 
  to the other products.  While the damages award was limited to the “Beauty Parlour 
  Night Kit” claim, the injunction was premised on a finding that the respondents 
  had suffered harm in relation to other products as well.  This finding supports 
  rather than extinguishes the false and misleading advertising claims.  As the 
  respondents are entitled to proceed on these claims for an injunction, it would 
  not serve the ends of justice to preclude them from claiming the remedy of damages.  
  We do not accept the submission that the conduct of the respondents in relation 
  to these claims supports a plea of abuse of process.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.  The order of Pitt 
  J. is varied by the addition of a paragraph dismissing the claims for unlawful 
  interference with contractual and economic relations.  As there has been divided 
  success, we would also set aside Pitt J.'s order of costs and order that there 
  be no order as to costs, either here or before Pitt J.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appeal from the 
  order dismissing the motion to consolidate is interlocutory in nature and is 
  quashed without costs.</span></p>
