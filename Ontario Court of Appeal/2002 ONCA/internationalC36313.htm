<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Anne Molloy dated April 11, 2001.</p>

  </span> This appeal concerns the enforceability of a one-year limitation period 
  set out under an insurance policy in respect of a claim for loss of income occasioned 
  by a theft at the insured’s premises.  The motion judge granted summary judgment 
  in favour of the insurer on the basis that the insured’s claim was proscribed 
  by the limitation period.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the 
  insured’s appeal from that decision, with costs.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>FACTS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On January 5, 1995, International Movie Conversions Ltd. (“IMC”) suffered 
  a theft of audio-video equipment at its business premises.  IMC is insured under 
  a policy of insurance issued by ITT Hartford Canada (“Hartford”) which provides 
  coverage for loss of income for business interruption, as well as for stolen 
  equipment.  The relevant “conditions” section of the insurance policy includes 
  a limitation period requiring that actions brought under the policy be commenced 
  within one year of the occurrence of loss or damage.  The relevant policy wording 
  is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE VARIOUS COVERAGES PROVIDED 
      HEREIN</p>
    <p>Otherwise, all of the Conditions set forth under the titles Statutory Conditions 
      and Additional Conditions apply with respect to all of the perils insured 
      by this Policy except as these Conditions may be modified or supplemented 
      by the Forms or Endorsements attached.</p>
    <p align="center">STATUTORY CONDITIONS</p>
    <p align="center">…</p>
    <p>ACTION  14.  Every action or proceeding against the Insurer for the recovery 
      of any claim under or by virtue of this contract is absolutely barred unless 
      commenced within one year next after the loss or damage occurs.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In February 1995, IMC retained professional adjusters, National Fire 
  Adjustment Co. Inc. (“NFA”), to assist it with its claims arising from the theft.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A claim by IMC for the loss of the stolen equipment was paid by Hartford 
  in four instalments, ending in September 1995.  That month, a Hartford representative 
  told a NFA representative that Hartford would consider a claim for loss of income 
  based on the reasonable amount of time it should have taken IMC to replace the 
  stolen equipment.  No mention was made then of a limitation period.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In February 1996, no loss of income claim having been received from 
  IMC, Hartford proceeded to close its file.  Seven months later, in September 
  1996, NFA informed Hartford’s representative for the first time of IMC’s intention 
  to make a loss of income claim.  Hartford then reopened its file, although it 
  immediately informed NFA of its position that clause 14 of the policy proscribed 
  the claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Notwithstanding notice to NFA of Hartford’s position regarding the limitation 
  period, NFA did not submit an accountant’s report to Hartford, quantifying IMC’s 
  loss of income claim, until January 1997.  Hartford formally denied this claim 
  in early April 1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some seventeen months later, on November 19, 1998, IMC commenced an 
  action against Hartford to recover its income losses occasioned by the theft 
  which had occurred almost four years earlier.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC’s policy was first issued in 1993, for the period from August 20, 
  1993 to August 20, 1994.  It was subsequently renewed for the period from August 
  20, 1994 to August 20, 1995.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hartford steadfastly maintained from September 1996 onwards, that IMC’s 
  claim for loss of income was proscribed by the one-year limitation period set 
  out in clause 14 of the policy.  In turn, IMC insisted, through NFA, that a 
  six-year limitation period applied and, as discussed later in these reasons, 
  that its loss of income claim was exempt from the limitation provision in clause 
  14 in consequence of s. 143(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  I.8.  As noted by the motion judge:  “Both parties were adamant in maintaining 
  these conflicting positions through a series of letters and communications right 
  up to the time of this action”.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>            (1)       <u>The Suggestion of Prejudice</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the summary judgment motion, IMC alleged that it had not been provided 
  with a copy of the insurance policy until sometime in the summer or fall of 
  1996, well after the theft was reported to Hartford in January 1995 and expiry 
  of the one-year limitation period.  However, IMC’s insurance broker provided 
  evidence that it had furnished IMC with copies of the policy in October 1993 
  following its issuance, and in October 1994 following its renewal.  Thus, on 
  the materials before the motion judge, there was conflicting evidence concerning 
  the date of IMC’s receipt of a copy of the policy.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although it is difficult to conceive that IMC or its agents did not 
  receive a copy of the policy for almost three years after its issuance, the 
  motion judge concluded, rightly in my view, that for the purpose of the summary 
  judgment motion she was required to accept that IMC did not receive a copy of 
  the policy until after the date of the loss.  She assumed, for her analysis, 
  that IMC did not receive a copy of the policy prior to October 1996.  On any 
  view of the evidence, this was a generous interpretation of the policy receipt 
  date.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC argues that the late delivery of the insurance policy prejudiced 
  it in relation to the expiry of the one-year limitation period.  It asserts 
  that had a copy of the policy been provided to it prior to expiry of the limitation 
  period, either it or NFA would have known of the limitation period before the 
  claim for loss of income was proscribed, leading to the earlier initiation of 
  proceedings against Hartford or, alternatively, other measures challenging the 
  wording of the policy.  It suggests that all of these options were foreclosed 
  because of its untimely receipt of a copy of the policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In respect of IMC’s assertion of prejudice, the motion judge concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>There are two points which I believe are fatal to the plaintiff’s position 
      on this issue:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(i)        The plaintiff did not file a claim within one year after it 
        had the insurance policy, nor within one year after the defendant had 
        suggested the possibility of a loss of income claim to NFA.</p>
      <p> (ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> [IMC] was guided throughout by NFA.  NFA was firmly of the view 
        that the language of the policy did not create a one-year limitation period.  
        Even if [IMC] had the policy before the theft, and even if NFA had the 
        policy at the outset of its retainer, NFA would still have taken the position 
        that the one-year limitation period in paragraph 14 of the conditions 
        did not apply to a loss of income claim and would have seen no reason 
        to file the claim within the one-year period.  This point was conceded 
        by counsel for the plaintiff during the argument of the motion.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The factors identified by the motion judge are compelling.  IMC retained 
  its adjuster in February 1995, within one month of the theft.  It followed its 
  adjuster’s advice throughout its dealings with Hartford.  Even assuming that 
  IMC did not receive a copy of the policy until October 1996, it did not commence 
  proceedings against Hartford until November 19, 1998, more than two years later.  
  This was so, notwithstanding that a Hartford representative had raised the prospect 
  of a loss of income claim with NFA in September 1995.  Hartford was not informed 
  until September 1996 that IMC was even considering such a claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although IMC asserts that it <i>may</i> have conducted itself differently 
  had it received a copy of the policy on a timely basis, it is clear that its 
  adjuster, NFA, was provided with a copy of the policy by at least October 1996.  
  Even then, it did not accelerate submission to Hartford of the information necessary 
  to support a loss of income claim and did not deliver same until January 1997.  
  Proceedings were not commenced for another twenty-two months.  Thus, even when 
  NFA knew of the existence of the limitation period and Hartford’s reliance on 
  it, it persisted in the view that clause 14 of the policy did not apply and 
  no steps were taken to seek an early resolution to the conflicting interpretations 
  of the policy.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In all of these circumstances, as found by the motion judge, IMC cannot 
  rely on the timing of the delivery of the policy to avoid the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>            (2)       <u>Incorporation in the Policy of Statutory Condition 
  14</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC’s policy with Hartford insures it against multiple perils, including 
  theft.  At the end of the policy, the conditions which apply to all insured 
  perils are set out, except as modified or supplemented by the forms or endorsements 
  to the policy.  The preamble to the conditions, set out in paragraph 2 above, 
  provides, “Otherwise, all of the Conditions set forth under the titles Statutory 
  Conditions and Additional Conditions apply with respect to <i>all of the perils 
  insured by this Policy</i> …”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Immediately thereafter in the policy, under the heading “Statutory Conditions”, 
  various conditions are set out, including clause 14.  That clause is identical 
  to statutory condition 14 set out in s. 148 of the <i>Act</i> which appears 
  in Part IV of the statute, entitled “Fire Insurance”.  Section 148(1) of the 
  <i>Act</i> provides that the conditions set forth in s. 148 are deemed to be 
  part of every contract in force in Ontario, and stipulates that “no variation 
  or omission of or addition to any statutory condition is binding on the insured”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By operation of s. 143(1) of the <i>Act</i>, Part IV does not apply 
  to theft or loss of profits insurance.  Sections 143(1)(a) and (b) read as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>143. – (1)  This Part applies to insurance against loss of or damage to 
      property arising from the peril of fire in any contract made in Ontario 
      except, </p>
    <p>(a)       … theft insurance;</p>
    <p>(b)       where the subject-matter of the insurance is … loss of profits;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC relies upon s. 143(1) to argue that statutory condition 14, replicated 
  in clause 14 of Hartford’s policy, does not apply to IMC’s  loss of income claim.  
  It submits that had Hartford intended a contrary result, its incorporation of 
  the statutory conditions in the insurance policy should have been more clearly 
  and explicitly accomplished.  IMC argues that to be effective, clause 14 should 
  state that s. 143(1) of the <i>Act</i> does not apply to the policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hartford submits that this argument is misconceived.  It asserts that 
  by incorporating the statutory conditions into the policy, to apply to all coverages, 
  and by including statutory condition 14 providing for a one-year limitation 
  period, the limitation restriction became a contractual term which does not 
  depend upon the <i>Act</i> for effectiveness.  Hartford, therefore, does not 
  rely on application of the <i>Act</i> for enforcement of the limitation period 
  but, rather, on the terms of the contract itself.   Hartford also argues that 
  it sought to avoid confusion regarding interpretation of the relevant provisions 
  of the policy by stipulating in the preamble to the conditions that they apply 
  to “all of the perils insured by [the] policy”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 148 of the <i>Act</i> provides that the statutory conditions 
  set out in that section are part of every fire insurance contract in force in 
  Ontario.  It does not stipulate, however, that the statutory conditions cannot 
  also apply to other insured perils, such as theft, at the election of the insurer.  
  In this case, Hartford elected to include the statutory conditions, including 
  statutory condition 14, as terms of the contract of insurance.  As Hartford 
  argues, there is nothing in the <i>Act</i> which prohibits an insurer from introducing 
  a one-year limitation period for a claim for loss of profits or theft.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario courts have recognized that it is not uncommon for insurers 
  in this province to incorporate the s. 148 statutory conditions into policies 
  of insurance to attract their application to one or multiple coverages.  (<i>Matte 
  v. Canadian General Insurance Co.</i> (1997), 3 C.C.L.I. (3d) 62 (Ont. Gen. 
  Div.); <i>Northwestern Insurance Co. v. Continental Insurance Co.</i> (1996), 
  16 O.T.C. 321 (Ont. Gen. Div.); and <i>George A. Demeyere Tobacco Farms Ltd. 
  v. Continental Insurance Co</i>. (1984), 46 O.R. (2d) 423 (H.C.), affirmed (1986), 
  53 O.R. (2d) 800 (C.A.)).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a)       Use of the Heading “Statutory Conditions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, we are not concerned on this appeal with whether the one-year 
  limitation period was imported, by direct or indirect reference, into the insurance 
  policy by operation of statute.  That did not occur because IMC’s policy with 
  Hartford was not a fire insurance policy.  Accordingly, the statutory conditions 
  set out in s.148 of the <i>Act</i> are not deemed to be included in the policy 
  by operation of law.  In this case, Hartford elected to incorporate the statutory 
  conditions, including condition 14, into the policy.  In consequence, the issue 
  is whether clause 14 was clearly and unambiguously included in the policy as 
  a matter of contract, so as to bind the insured under the normal rules of contract 
  law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC argues that Hartford’s use of the heading “Statutory Conditions” 
  in the policy, is misleading and, on proper interpretation of the policy, compels 
  the conclusion that an insured is to have reference to Part IV of the <i>Act</i>, 
  including ss. 143 and 148.  IMC submits that once regard is had to s. 143 of 
  the <i>Act</i>, an insured would necessarily  conclude that clause 14 in the 
  policy does not apply to a claim for loss of income or business interruption.  
  At the very least, it is said, regard to s.143 renders the policy confusing 
  and potentially misleading to an insured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In considering IMC’s position on this issue, the motion judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Section 143 of the Act clearly applies only to the deemed application 
      of the statutory conditions to contracts for fire insurance.  <i>The language 
      in the insurance policy itself is clear.  The conditions listed in the policy 
      under the heading “Statutory Conditions” are stipulated to apply to “all 
      of the perils insured by” the policy.  This language does not require any 
      reference to the statute for clarification</i>.  Accordingly, I do not see 
      how s. 143 of the Act creates any confusion as to the applicability of the 
      limitation period in this case.  [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> She further observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no evidence in this case that the plaintiff [IMC] was itself misled 
      by the inclusion of the heading “Statutory Conditions”. … the fact that 
      the plaintiff’s professional adjuster did not understand the distinction 
      between conditions that arise by operation of statute and conditions directly 
      incorporated into the insurance policy does not render the contractual language 
      ambiguous.  Professional adjusters are expected to know the difference.  
      The fact that the plaintiff’s adjusters misinterpreted the statute is not 
      Hartford’s fault and is not the fault of the language used in the Hartford 
      policy.  Hartford should not be deprived of the protecton of a clear and 
      unambiguous contractual provisions [sic] merely because the plaintiff got 
      mistaken advice from its own adjuster.  Accordingly, I find that the use 
      of the heading “Statutory Conditions” does not make the contractual terms 
      which follow ambiguous.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

  </span> I agree with these conclusions by the motion judge.  Clause 14 is clear 
  and unambiguous.  Indeed, in my view, it is difficult to conceive how it could 
  have been made more explicit.  Use of the heading “Statutory Conditions” does 
  not render it ambiguous or confusing.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC also argues that Hartford’s use of the word “otherwise” in the preamble 
  to the recitation of the applicable conditions creates or exacerbates previously 
  existing confusion regarding the application of the statutory conditions under 
  Part IV of the <i>Act</i> to the policy.  IMC argues that it is reasonable to 
  assume that the word “otherwise”, as used in the policy, means “in all other 
  respects”, thus referring to s. 143 of the <i>Act</i>.  If so, the policy would 
  be subject to s. 143, thereby excluding application of the subsequently recited 
  conditions, including clause 14, to a loss of income claim.  In effect, IMC 
  invites us to “read” s. 143 into the preamble to the contractual conditions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, there is simply no reasonable basis upon which it should 
  be concluded that the word “otherwise” is intended, without more, to serve as 
  an inferential reference to s. 143 of the <i>Act</i>, or to invite a reader 
  of the policy to import s. 143 into the policy.  I agree with the motion judge’s 
  conclusion that there is no foundation for such an interpretation.  As she observed: 
  “Section 143(1)(b) of the <i>Act</i> is not referred to anywhere in the policy 
  and it simply makes no sense that the word ‘otherwise’ could possibly be taken 
  as referring to that section”.  To this I would add that the relevant conditions 
  section of the policy makes no reference to any part of s. 143 of the <i>Act</i> 
  or, indeed, to any section in Part IV of the <i>Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> IMC also argues that there is nothing in the context of the policy to 
  which the word “otherwise” might refer, thus supporting the conclusion that 
  it refers, by inference, to s. 143 of the <i>Act</i>.  I disagree.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The word “otherwise” appears at the beginning of the first sentence 
  following the heading “Conditions Applicable to the Various Coverages Provided 
  Herein”.  A review of the policy as a whole demonstrates that other conditions 
  applicable to various sections of the policy are set out earlier.  The motion 
  judge concluded: “One possible rational interpretation of the word ‘otherwise’ 
  is … that ‘otherwise’ at the beginning of the statutory conditions refers back 
  to other policy conditions set out earlier in the contract”.  In my view, the 
  motion judge was correct in concluding that it is possible that the word “otherwise” 
  refers back to other sections of the policy dealing with other conditions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As observed by the motion judge, another possible explanation for the 
  presence of the word “otherwise” is that it was inadvertently included in the 
  Hartford policy during drafting, based on reference to a precedent insurance 
  policy that contained a preceding sentence.  This was the case in <i>Matte v. 
  Canadian General Insurance Co., supra</i>, in which the court considered an 
  insurance policy containing language similar to the language employed in the 
  Hartford policy.  If the language of a precedent insurance policy was used for 
  preparation of the Hartford policy, without complete replication of all related 
  sentences, it would follow that the word “otherwise” was included in the Hartford 
  policy in error and without specific purpose.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The result is the same under either approach to the meaning of the word 
  “otherwise” as it appears in the Hartford policy. As stated by the motion judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whether the word “otherwise” is superfluous (such that it has no real meaning) 
      or is to be interpreted [as referring back to other sections of the policy 
      dealing with other conditions], there is no ambiguity as to the applicability 
      of the conditions that follow.  The important point is that there is nothing 
      about the word “otherwise” that would make it unclear whether or not the 
      one-year limitation period applies to a loss of business income claim.  
      While there may be some question about what “otherwise” means, there is 
      no rational interpretation that would make its application in this case 
      ambiguous.  It is clear from the language used that a one-year limitation 
      period applies for the commencement of an action in respect of all claims 
      under the insurance policy.</p>

    [1] </span></a> It is not uncommon, of course, for proceedings to be commenced 
    to protect a party’s position once expiry of a limitation period is raised 
    against it.  That protective step was not taken in this case.  Moreover, although 
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>provide various means by which contractual 
    interpretation questions may be dealt with speedily, none of these options 
    was pursued by IMC.  There is no suggestion, on the record before this court, 
    that NFA was not keeping IMC informed of developments with Hartford.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span> 
    [2] </span></a> On this appeal, IMC argued that the motion judge, in concluding 
    that there was no evidence that IMC had been misled by the use of the heading 
    “Statutory Conditions” in the policy, had failed to consider the evidence 
    of Robert Watson, adduced by IMC on the summary judgment motion, to the effect 
    that describing the conditions in the policy as statutory conditions was misleading.  
    I disagree.  Mr. Watson was a representative of NFA, IMC’s adjuster.  It was 
    NFA who took the position throughout, on behalf of IMC, that a six-year limitation 
    period applied to the loss of income claim.  It was to NFA that the motion 
    judge referred when she stated: “… the fact that the plaintiff’s professional 
    adjuster did not understand the distinction between conditions that arise 
    by operation of statute and conditions directly incorporated into the insurance 
    policy does not render the contractual language ambiguous.  Professional adjusters 
    are expected to know the difference”.  Thus, the motion judge did specifically 
    take into account the evidence adduced by IMC from its adjuster.  Moreover, 
    Mr. Watson testified on cross-examination that the insurance industry has 
    not adopted a common position on the appropriate limitation period applicable 
    to a loss of income claim.  In effect, as asserted by Hartford on this appeal, 
    Mr. Watson acknowledged under cross-examination that there is no statutory 
    rule or industry practice that a one-year limitation period does not apply.</p>
