<p style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Stanley R. 
  Kurisko dated October 24, 2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellants, Weechi-It-Te-Win Child and Family 
  Services, Louise Morrison and Reggie Morrison, appeal from a judgment of Justice 
  Kurisko based on the verdict of a jury.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the appellants made a submission to the effect that 
  the defendant Lorraine Kirkrude was solely responsible for the accident, their 
  basic argument was that the jury erred substantially in its apportionment of 
  liability among the defendants.  In this part of the appeal, Mr. Wojciechowski 
  submitted that there was no basis on which Reggie Morrison could be found liable.  
  We note that appellants’ counsel at trial, after all of the defence evidence 
  had been given, did not make a motion for a non-suit on the basis that there 
  was no evidence on which his clients could be found liable.  In this regard, 
  he informed us that the issue that he addressed before the jury was confined 
  to the weight to be given to the evidence before them.  We are satisfied that, 
  on the evidence, it was open to the jury to find that Mr. Morrison had given 
  permission for the young children to use the rock slide in the absence of proper 
  supervision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants have a particularly heavy burden.  It is accepted 
  that “a very strong and exceptional case” is required before an appellate court 
  may interfere with a judge’s apportionment (<i>Sparks v. Thomson</i>, [1975] 
  1 S.C.R. 618 at 625-26) and the view has been expressed that this principle 
  applies with greater force to an apportionment fixed by a jury (<i>Deshane v. 
  Deere &amp; Co. </i>(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.) at 238).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s basic challenge is that the jury seriously erred 
  in finding Lorraine Kirkrude only ten percent responsible for the accident.  
  Counsel have extensively reviewed with us portions of the evidence bearing on 
  her role in the accident.  Based on this evidence, we think that it was clearly 
  open to the jury to find that, before and at the time of the accident Ms. Kirkrude 
  was driving at a walking speed, three to four miles an hour (or even more slowly 
  at the time of the accident), that her view of the rock slide was obstructed 
  as she approached it, and that just before the accident she had looked to her 
  right and seen nothing.  She first saw the infant plaintiff as a purple blur 
  virtually at the time of the accident when the plaintiff slid into the rear 
  portion of her car on the right hand side.  It could be considered to be a sudden, 
  almost unavoidable, accident.  Having regard to the standard of review to which 
  we have referred, we cannot interfere with this conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The next issue raised is the matter of the premium of $25,500 
  included in the costs awarded to the plaintiffs.  It is carefully considered 
  in the reasons of the trial judge  ([2000] Carswell Ont. 4969 (S.C.J.)), and 
  for the reasons which he gave, we agree with him that this was a proper case 
  to award the premium.  In this regard we say, with respect, that we think that 
  he was right to follow <i>Roberts v. Morana</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 157 (C.A.) 
  rather than <i>Finlayson v. Roberts</i> (2000), 136 O.A.C 271.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Turning to a new point raised by the appellant at the opening 
  of the appeal, we think that, in the interest of justice, we should grant leave 
  for the appellants to amend the notice of appeal to argue that the judgment 
  against them should be reduced by $10,921.44 on the basis of the judgment of 
  this court in <i>Sullivan Estate v. Bond</i> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 97.  Mr. Somerleigh 
  fairly conceded that, if the amendment were allowed, there is no answer to this 
  particular ground of appeal.  We give effect to it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Leave to appeal costs is granted, the appeal 
  is dismissed, with costs, subject to the reduction of the judgment against the 
  appellants by $10,921.44.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having heard further submissions we fix the costs of the respondent/plaintiffs 
  at $10,000 and of respondents Kirkrude and Gibbons at $7,500.  We fix the plaintiff/respondents 
  costs of the motion before the Registrar at $500.00.</p>
