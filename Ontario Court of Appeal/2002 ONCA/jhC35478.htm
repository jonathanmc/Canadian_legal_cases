<p style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the judgment of Justice C.N. Herold 
  dated November 16, 2000, sitting as a summary conviction appeal judge from the 
  judgment of Justice J.D. Karswick dated July 19, 2000.</p>
<h3>CRONK J.A.:</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue on this appeal is whether a disposition in the nature of a 
  probation order validly made under s.&nbsp;20(1)(j) of the <i>Young Offenders 
  Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 (the “<i>YOA</i>”) is enforceable against a young 
  person under s.&nbsp;26 of the <i>YOA</i>, where compliance with s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) 
  is not achieved by virtue of the failure to provide a copy of the disposition 
  to the young person’s counsel.  In consequence of the imperfect compliance with 
  s. 20(6)(a), the youth court judge dismissed a charge of wilfully failing to 
  comply with a probation order.  On summary conviction appeal, Herold J. dismissed 
  an appeal by the Crown.  The Crown now seeks leave to appeal to this court from 
  that dismissal.  For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave to appeal, 
  but dismiss the appeal.</p>
<h3>A.        BACKGROUND FACTS</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent, a young offender, was found guilty of robbery and received 
  a disposition of 18 months probation and 70 hours of community service.  One 
  of the terms of his probation required that he report to a probation officer 
  at stipulated times.  The probation order was reviewed with the respondent and 
  his parents at a meeting with the probation officer, and the respondent was 
  informed of the consequences of breaching a condition of the order.  He signed 
  a form entitled “Disposition Acknowledgment” confirming that he had been so 
  informed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For some time the respondent reported to his probation officer as required, 
  but subsequently failed to do so.  In consequence, he was charged under s. 26 
  of the <i>YOA </i>with wilful failure or refusal to comply with the probation 
  order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The order of disposition was prepared in a standard form known as “Form 
  11”, provided for by O. Reg. 86-818 of the <i>YOA Forms Regulations.</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>  The probation order was prepared in a “Form 12”, also a standard 
  form provided for by the same regulation.  Both forms were furnished to the 
  respondent and his parents, but neither form was provided to his counsel at 
  the robbery trial.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6)(a) of the <i>YOA</i> requires that the respondent’s counsel 
  be provided with a copy of the disposition.  The relevant regulation under the 
  <i>YOA</i> provides that where the disposition is a probation order, the order 
  may be in Form 12.  Under the same regulation, an order of disposition under 
  s. 20(1) may be in Form 11.  In this case, the language of Form 11 contemplated 
  that a copy of it would be furnished to the respondent’s counsel, among others.  
  It did not refer, however, to the terms of the respondent’s probation save for 
  the community service component.  In that limited connection, it also mentioned 
  the respondent’s probation officer.  In contrast, the probation order in Form 
  12 referenced all terms of the probation disposition, including the requirement 
  for performance of community service.  Accordingly, in this case, Form 12 reflected 
  the actual disposition within the meaning of s. 20(6)(a) of the <i>YOA.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial on the charge of wilful breach of probation, counsel for the 
  respondent argued that the charge should be dismissed because of the failure 
  to fully comply with s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) of the <i>YOA</i>.  The youth court judge 
  accepted this submission, holding that the failure to provide a copy of the 
  disposition to the respondent’s counsel at the robbery trial was a fundamental 
  breach of the respondent’s statutory rights under s.&nbsp;20(6)(a).  Herold 
  J. dismissed an appeal from that decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal to this court, the submissions of counsel focus on the narrow 
  issue of the proper interpretation of s. 20(6)(a).  The Crown argues that it 
  should be given a directory rather than an imperative construction, while the 
  respondent relies upon the decision of this court in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i> 
  (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 562 (Ont. C.A.) as supporting an obligatory construction.  
  If the latter interpretation governs, strict compliance with s. 20(6)(a) is 
  required in relation to the respondent’s legal counsel, unless a contrary result 
  is otherwise contemplated by the <i>YOA</i>.</p>
<h3>B.        ANALYSIS </h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>YOA </i>contains no provision setting out the consequences of 
  a failure to comply with any part of s. 20(6).  That section reads as follows: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>20 (6)  <i>Where a youth court makes a disposition under this section, 
      it</i> shall state its reasons therefor in the record of the case and <i>shall</i></p>
    <p><i>(a)</i>    <i>provide</i> <i>or cause to be provided </i><i>a copy of 
      the disposition</i>, and</p>
    <p><i>(b)</i>   on request, provide or cause to be provided a transcript or 
      a copy of the reasons for the disposition</p>
    <p><i>to</i> the young person in respect of whom the disposition was made, 
      <i>the young person’s counsel</i> and parents, the provincial director, 
      where the provincial director has an interest in the disposition, the prosecutor 
      and, in the case of a custodial disposition made under paragraph (1)(k) 
      or (k.1), the review board, if a review board has been established or designated. 
      [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>(1)       The Mandated Approach to Interpretation of Section 20(6)(a)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To ascertain the intended meaning of s. 20(6)(a), it is necessary to 
  refer to the principles declared under s. 3(1) and the rule of construction 
  established by s. 3(2) of the <i>YOA</i>, which govern interpretation of all 
  provisions of the statute.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the principles set out in ss. 3(1) (a.1), (b), (c) (e) and 
  (g) of the <i>YOA</i> are of particular relevance on this appeal. These provisions 
  emphasize the accountability of young persons for their illegal behaviour, and 
  the need to protect society from such behaviour (ss. 3(1)(a.1) and (b)).  The 
  principles declared under s.&nbsp;3(1) also afford particular rights and protections 
  to young persons, and recognize that they have special needs and require guidance 
  and assistance.  To this end, young persons have special guarantees of their 
  rights and freedoms and, in every instance where their rights or freedoms might 
  be affected by the <i>YOA</i>, are to be informed as to what those rights and 
  freedoms are (ss. 3 (1)(c), (e) and (g)).  Indeed, the right to be so informed 
  is itself a right under the principles enshrined within the <i>YOA</i> (s. 3(1)(g)).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 3(2) requires that young offenders be dealt with in accordance 
  with the principles declared in s.&nbsp;3(1) and, for that purpose, provides 
  that the <i>YOA</i> is to be liberally construed.  However, the normal principles 
  of statutory interpretation apply, and resort may be had to the ordinary meaning 
  of words as they appear in the statute (<i>R. v. S. (S.)</i> (1990), 57 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 115, at 129, per Dickson C.J.C. and <i>R. v. Z. (D.A.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 
  1025, at 1042, per Lamer C.J.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The contemporary approach to the construction of statutes has been described 
  in  <i>Driedger </i><i>On the Construction of Statutes</i>, 3rd ed. (Butterworths: 
  1994) at 131:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is only one rule in modern interpretation, namely, courts are obliged 
      to determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard 
      to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, 
      the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible 
      external aids.  In other words, the courts must consider and take into account 
      all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning.  After taking 
      these into account, the court must then adopt an interpretation that is 
      appropriate.  An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified 
      in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its compliance with the legislative 
      text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion of the legislative purpose; 
      and (c) its acceptability, that is, the outcome is reasonable and just.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This approach mandates a full contextual analysis of a statute to determine 
  the intended meaning of a word in the context in which it appears, having regard 
  to the purpose and objects of the legislation (<i>R. v. Mac</i> (2001), 152 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), per Doherty J.A., relying on <i>R. v. Goulis</i> 
  (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 347 (Ont. C.A.), at 351, per  Martin J.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This approach is also directed by the general subject-matter of the 
  <i>YOA</i>.  Section 26 of the statute directly engages the criminal law power.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  The dominant focus 
  of the <i>YOA</i> as a whole is on the criminal law as applied to young persons, 
  and not on the welfare of young persons <i>per se</i> (<i>R. v. S. (S.)</i>, 
  at 132-133).  This contrasts with the child welfare focus of the former statute, 
  the<i> Juvenile Delinquents Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, and the statutory 
  regimes for juvenile courts which existed in the first half of this century, 
  which emphasized informality for determining the “best interests” of young persons.  
  The introduction of the <i>YOA</i> thus signalled a significant change, and 
  a shift towards a criminal law orientation, in Canada’s national policy for 
  young offenders (<i>R. v. M. (J.J.),</i> at 428 and 430, per Cory J.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under traditional rules of statutory interpretation, ambiguity in the 
  meaning of criminal law statutes was to be resolved by strict construction of 
  the enactment so that any uncertainty was determined by choosing the meaning 
  which was most favourable to the accused.  This rule has been significantly 
  moderated in recent jurisprudence to require examination of the context in which 
  the relevant words or provisions appear in order to ascertain the true intention 
  of Parliament (<i>Marcotte v. Canada (Deputy A.G.)</i> (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 
  257; <i>R. v. Hasselwander</i> (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 471 and <i>R. v. Mac</i>).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, any contextual analysis of s. 20(6)(a) must recognize the 
  principles declared under s. 3(1) and the rule of construction established by 
  s. 3(2) of the <i>YOA</i>, as well as the criminal law emphasis of the statute.</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>            (2)       The Particular Context of Section 20(6)(a)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(1) of the <i>YOA</i> empowers youth courts to make various 
  types of dispositions, including probation orders, in proceedings under the 
  <i>YOA</i>.  Under s.&nbsp;20(1)(j), a probation order made in accordance with 
  s. 23 of the <i>YOA</i> for a specified period not exceeding two years, is but 
  one type of authorized disposition.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Sections 20(2) to 24.5 establish limitations on, or requirements for, 
  dispositions made under s. 20(1).  Many of these sections are linked to particular 
  types of dispositions, as are ss. 26.1 to 26.6.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a>  Through these linkages, 
  ss. 20(2) to 24.5 and ss. 26.1 to 26.6 particularize the rules governing, or 
  content of, dispositions under s. 20(1).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 26, in turn, establishes an offence punishable on summary conviction 
  for a wilful failure or refusal to comply with identified types of dispositions, 
  including probation dispositions made under s. 20(1)(j).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Orders of disposition and probation orders are not identical.  All dispositions 
  under s. 20(1) of the <i>YOA</i>, including custodial or probation dispositions, 
  are subject to the requirements of s. 20(6). In contrast, s. 23 is specific 
  to probation orders. It identifies the required and optional contents of a probation 
  order and provides statutory rules designed to ensure that the conditions of 
  a probation order are read to, and understood by, the affected young person 
  and, further, are brought to the attention of the parent of the young person, 
  if the parent is in attendance at the proceedings against the young person.  
  Accordingly, the scope of s. 20(6) is wider than that of s. 23.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Within this framework, and having regard to the purpose and objects 
  of the <i>YOA</i> as a whole, it is necessary to consider all relevant indicators 
  of the legislative meaning of s.&nbsp;20(6)(a).  In my view, several factors 
  favour an imperative interpretation of s. 20(6)(a).</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>            (3)       Indicators of Legislative Meaning</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the ordinary signification of the word “shall”, when it is used 
  in a statute or legal instrument, connotes an imperative meaning.  Thus, s. 
  11 of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-21 provides that “the 
  expression ‘shall’ is to be construed as imperative and the expression ‘may’ 
  as permissive.”   This is consistent with the ordinary dictionary definition 
  of the word “shall” (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 6th ed. (West Group: 1990)).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the word “shall” may also be construed as merely permissive 
  or directory, that is, as equivalent to “may”, where the context so requires 
  to carry out the intention of Parliament (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>).  Accordingly, 
  use of the word “shall” alone, is not determinative of whether an imperative 
  obligation is imposed by s. 20(6)(a).  It is, however, some evidence of legislative 
  meaning.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A second important aid to interpretation of s. 20(6)(a) concerns the 
  absence in the <i>YOA</i> of a curative provision relating to non-compliance 
  with the section.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>YOA</i> contains a number of curative provisions designed to 
  address the consequences of failure to perform an act otherwise mandated under 
  the statute.  For example, s. 9(8) provides that the failure to give notice 
  to a parent of a young person in accordance with s. 9 will not in all circumstances 
  “affect the validity of proceedings under the Act”.  A similar saving provision 
  is contained in s.&nbsp;13.2(3) of the <i>YOA</i> in connection with the failure 
  to provide a parent of a young person with the notice required under s. 13.2(2) 
  in relation to provisions of Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Section 
  23(6) also provides a limited form of saving provision.  It states: “The failure 
  of a young person to endorse a probation order pursuant to subsection (5) does 
  not affect the validity of the order”.<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>   Given the presence in the <i>YOA</i> 
  of other curative provisions, the absence of such a provision in connection 
  with s. 20(6)(a) is one marker of the intention of Parliament.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span> 
  [6] </span></a>  It argues for an imperative construction of the section and 
  suggests that strict compliance with it is intended.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A third indicator of Parliament’s intention is the fact that certain 
  curative provisions existing under the <i>YOA </i>do not apply when notice to 
  legal counsel, as opposed to a parent, is required.  For example, as noted, 
  s.&nbsp;13.2(3) affords relief for the failure to provide notice to a parent 
  of a young person under s. 13.2(2).  However, it does not provide the same relief 
  in connection with notices in relation to provisions of Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> required to be given in certain circumstances to counsel representing 
  a young person.  Thus, the saving provision does not operate to obviate the 
  need to provide required notices to counsel.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span

  </span> The respondent argues that <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i> also supports an imperative 
  construction of s. 20(6)(a).  In that case, this court considered the consequences 
  of a failure to comply with the requirement under s. 23(3)(c) of the <i>YOA</i> 
  that a copy of a probation order be provided to a young person’s parent, if 
  the parent was in attendance at the proceedings against the young person, and 
  concluded that the failure to comply with s. 23(3)(c) was more than a mere procedural 
  irregularity.  In result, strict compliance with the section was necessary to 
  accord with the purpose of the <i>YOA</i> and the principles enshrined within 
  it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span

  </span> Although <i>R. v. M. (L.A.),</i> has been followed in Ontario in a number 
  of subsequent cases,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span> [8] </span></a> 
  it has not been adopted in some other jurisdictions.  In <i>R.&nbsp;v. A. (D.C.)</i> 
  (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 302 (Alta. C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court 
  of Canada refused (2001), 147 C.C.C. (3d) vi,  the Alberta Court of Appeal also 
  considered the consequences of a failure to comply with s. 23(3)(c), but reached 
  a different conclusion.  That court was of the view that non-compliance with 
  s. 23(3)(c) will not prejudicially affect in every case a young person’s entitlement 
  to the guidance and assistance of his parents, and that non-compliance alone 
  ought not to immunize a young person from prosecution for breach of probation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Similarly, in <i>R. v. H. (K.) </i>(1997), 153 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 
  28,  (Nfld. Youth Ct.), no causal connection was demonstrated between the failure 
  to provide the parents of a young person with copies of probation orders and 
  the breach of disposition by the young person.  The youth court concluded, therefore, 
  that it could not have been Parliament’s intention that a young person could 
  “ignore” a probation order simply because his parents had not yet received a 
  copy of the order. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i> was limited to consideration 
  of the failure to comply with s. 23(3)(c) of the <i>YOA</i>.  In that case, 
  Arbour J.A. expressly did not address the consequences of a failure to comply 
  with the duty imposed on youth courts by s. 20(6)(a).  While <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i>, 
  therefore, is not dispositive of this appeal, in my view, it is of assistance 
  in interpreting s. 20(6)(a) for two reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the analysis in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i> of the role and responsibilities 
  of parents under the <i>YOA </i>is instructive concerning both the purpose and 
  objects of the <i>YOA</i> and the role and responsibilities of legal counsel 
  for young persons in the <i>YOA</i> process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i> Arbour J.A. concluded with regard to s. 23(3)(c) 
  of the <i>YOA, </i>at 575-576:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… Both the young offender and the parent who was present at the proceedings 
      have a statutory entitlement to receive a copy of the probation order.  
      <i>The purpose behind the parent’s entitlement is to give effect to the 
      general principles expressed in the statute that parents have a responsibility 
      for the supervision of their children, and that young persons are entitled 
      to the guidance and assistance of their parents. In my opinion, this is 
      particularly so when the young offender is compelled to perform community 
      service and is otherwise bound by the conditions of a probation order.  
      The Act contemplates that more than self-discipline may be called upon to 
      ensure compliance. Parental guidance and supervision is an entitlement designed 
      to facilitate that compliance</i>.  It seems to me that the consequences 
      of failing to comply with the duty to inform the entitled parent is on equal 
      footing with the failure to inform the young person of what is expected 
      of him or her.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>… <i>with a copy of the probation order in hand, the parent would no doubt 
      be in a better position to encourage and supervise the youth’s compliance.  
      The failure in compliance with the mandatory terms of s. 23(3)(c) is therefore 
      more than a mere procedural irregularity. Rather, it offends an important 
      principle in the Act and may make compliance with the probation order more 
      onerous to the immature youth than it would have been had the parent been 
      properly notified</i>.  [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbour J.A. thus emphasized the role of parents under the <i>YOA</i>, 
  and their special responsibility to supervise their children and to provide 
  them with guidance and assistance in relation to probation orders including, 
  particularly, those orders which impose performance of community service.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The youth court and summary conviction appeal judges in this case endorsed 
  the extension of this reasoning to the role of counsel for a young person in 
  relation to probation orders under the <i>YOA</i>.  In my view, they were correct 
  to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the parents of young persons and defence counsel do not have identical 
  roles in relation to young persons, they both have a responsibility to provide 
  guidance and assistance to young persons.  The principles declared in s. 3(1)(c) 
  of the <i>YOA</i> recognize that young persons have “special needs and require 
  guidance and assistance”.  Such guidance and assistance is not restricted to 
  only <i>parental </i>guidance and assistance.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the case of parents, the <i>YOA </i>specifically recognizes that 
  their role includes responsibility for the care and supervision of their children 
  (s. 3(1)(h)).  As noted by Arbour J.A. in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.),</i>  a young person’s 
  entitlement to parental guidance and supervision is an entitlement “designed 
  to facilitate … compliance”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While defence counsel are not responsible for the care and supervision 
  of young persons, they have a critical advisory role to play in furthering the 
  entitlement of young persons under s. 3(1)(g) of the <i>YOA</i> to be informed 
  of their rights and freedoms as may be affected by the <i>YOA</i>,<i> </i>and<i> 
  </i>in ensuring that young persons are equipped to participate in the processes 
  that lead to decisions that affect them, as envisaged by s. 3(1)(e)<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further, in my view, while the provision of legal guidance and assistance 
  is not an adjunct of a supervisory function by counsel, it cannot be regarded 
  as wholly unrelated to compliance.  Rather, the advisory, guidance and assistance 
  responsibilities of counsel should be seen as means to facilitate a young person’s 
  understanding of his or her rights and obligations under both the <i>YOA </i>process 
  and court orders, including the requirements and implications of dispositions.  
  Compliance with a disposition begins with an understanding of what is required 
  to achieve compliance and of what may follow if non-compliance ensues.  In this 
  sense, to use the language employed in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.)</i>, advice from counsel 
  and a young person’s entitlement to the guidance and assistance of counsel may 
  also be seen as measures “designed to facilitate compliance”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The special role of counsel for young persons is given prominence in 
  the <i>YOA</i>.<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span> [9] </span></a>   The statute contains several

  or to consult with, counsel.<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span> [10] </span></a>  In other instances, at various

  of documents affecting the interests or liberty of a youth.<a href="#_ftn12"

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The right of a young person to legal counsel is enshrined in the <i>Canadian 
  </i><i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, while the right to “retain and instruct 
  counsel without delay … at any stage of proceedings against the young person 
  …” is established by s. 11(1) of the <i>YOA</i>.  Further, the right to be “represented” 
  by counsel is recognized and confirmed under ss.&nbsp;11(2), 11(3), 11(4), 11(5) 
  and 11(8) of the <i>YOA</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By these provisions, the right to personal and full access to legal 
  advice and assistance is established as a base principle of the <i>YOA</i>.  
  This is consistent with the declaratory principles set forth under ss. 3(1)(c), 
  (e) and (g) of the statute, described above.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>YOA</i> seeks to balance concerns with due process and accountability 
  for illegal behaviour against the special needs and vulnerability of young persons.  
  Access to legal advice, guidance and assistance at all stages of a proceeding 
  under the <i>YOA</i>, including at the disposition and post-disposition stages, 
  engages both of these values.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A second aspect of the decision in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.) </i>is also of 
  some assistance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that Parliament 
  is presumed to use language carefully and consistently, so that within a statute 
  the same words have the same meaning and different words have different meanings 
  (Driedger, at 163 and <i>R. v. Zeolkowski</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1378, at para. 
  19, per Sopinka J.).  This “presumption of consistent expression”  applies particularly 
  “where the provisions in which the repeated words appear are close together 
  or otherwise related”<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span> [13] </span></a> (Driedger<i>, </i>at 164). Section 
  20(1)(j) requires that the placement of a young person on probation be “in accordance 
  with s. 23”.  In <i>R. v. M. (L.A.) </i>s.&nbsp;23(3)(c) was interpreted by 
  this court as bearing an imperative meaning.  Accordingly, unless a contrary 
  intention is clearly indicated by the context, a similar construction of s. 
  20(6)(a) as it relates to a young person’s counsel would accord with the presumption 
  of consistent expression.   It is of some significance in this regard, that 
  Arbour J.A. in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.) </i>described the duty imposed by s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) 
  as a “mandatory” duty (at 572, 574 and 575).</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The requirement under s. 20(6)(a) that a young person’s counsel be provided 
  with a copy of the disposition is intended, in my view, to support the general 
  principles declared in ss. 3(1)(c), (e) and (g) of the <i>YOA</i>, discussed 
  above.  Legal guidance and assistance serves these principles, just as parental 
  guidance and assistance does.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>R. v. M. (L.A.) </i>this court was concerned that a failure to 
  comply with the requirements of s. 23(3)(c) in connection with the parents of 
  a young person might render compliance with a probation order “more onerous”.  
  The failure to comply with s.&nbsp;23(3)(c) was regarded as an impediment to 
  the provision of parental supervision, guidance and assistance to a young person, 
  which is designed to facilitate compliance.  No requirement for the demonstration 
  of actual prejudice to the young person occasioned by the non-compliance with 
  s. 23(3)(c) was necessary to ground this concern.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A similar, although not identical, concern arises when impediments are 
  created to the provision of legal advice, guidance and assistance to young persons 
  in relation to probation orders.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As noted above, under s. 3(1)(g) of the <i>YOA</i>, a young person is 
  entitled, “in every instance where they have rights or freedoms that may be 
  affected by [the <i>YOA</i>], to be informed as to what those rights and freedoms 
  are”.  Under s. 20(6)(a) of the <i>YOA</i>, the young person is entitled to 
  the provision of a copy of the disposition to his or her counsel.  When this 
  occurs, and the disposition is a probation order, counsel is positioned to ensure 
  that the disposition has been prepared in accordance with the probation terms 
  actually ordered by the court, and to explain to the young person the terms 
  of the order and the young person’s rights and responsibilities in respect of 
  the order.  Provision of the probation disposition to counsel thus supports 
  the opportunity for legal advice, guidance and assistance regarding compliance 
  and remedies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Conversely, when compliance with this aspect of s. 20(6)(a) does not 
  occur, at least when the disposition is a probation order, this failure to facilitate 
  the provision of such legal advice, guidance and assistance may make the young 
  person’s understanding of, and compliance with, the probation order more onerous 
  than it would have been had the young person’s counsel been properly notified.  
  In my view, as in <i>R. v. M. (L.A.),</i> this failure is significant, even 
  in the absence of proof of actual prejudice to the young person occasioned by 
  the failure.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, in a statutory regime such as the <i>YOA</i>, where the importance 
  of advice, guidance and assistance to young persons is emphasized, the requirement 
  under s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) that a young person’s counsel receive a copy of the disposition 
  may be seen as designed to facilitate compliance with, and understanding of, 
  dispositions by supporting the opportunity for the receipt of  legal advice, 
  guidance and assistance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Both the youth court and summary conviction appeal judges in this case 
  concluded that counsel for a young person has a role to play at the post-disposition 
  stage of young offender proceedings, by advising the young person of the meaning, 
  propriety and consequences of the formal disposition.  For the reasons outlined 
  above, I agree that this function of counsel in relation to probation dispositions 
  is promoted by s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) and that this properly may be viewed as a result 
  intended by Parliament.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6)(a) may also be seen as having a second, collateral or 
  ancillary aspect in relation to counsel for a young person.  This concerns the 
  appeal and review processes under the <i>YOA</i> at the post-disposition stage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Disposition hearings in young offender proceedings are equivalent to 
  sentencing hearings in proceedings under the <i>Criminal Code</i> involving 
  adults.  A young person found guilty of an offence under the <i>YOA</i> enjoys 
  appeal rights under s. 27 in relation to both indictable and summary conviction 
  offences.  In addition, s. 28 provides for the review of custodial dispositions 
  after a young person has served a portion of his or her sentence.  This process 
  is significant because  it can result in the release of a young person from 
  custody prior to completion of the disposition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If the young person’s counsel receives a copy of the disposition, as 
  contemplated by s.&nbsp;20(6)(a), he or she will be positioned to advise a young 
  person regarding not only the meaning, propriety and consequences of the disposition 
  but, as well, appeal and review rights and mechanisms for varying the disposition.  
  These latter advisory activities are uniquely the function of counsel.  They 
  form an integral part of legal representation and assistance.  This conforms 
  with the principle set out in s. 3(1)(g) of the <i>YOA</i> that young persons 
  “have the right, in every instance where they have rights or freedoms that may 
  be affected by the [<i>YOA</i>], to be informed as to what those rights and 
  freedoms are”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It follows, in my view, that the requirement under s. 20(6)(a) for a 
  copy of the disposition to be provided to a young person’s counsel, is best 
  understood as a mechanism intended by Parliament to facilitate the provision 
  of legal advice, guidance and assistance to the young person, relating to the 
  disposition and its consequences, and, as an ancillary matter, post-disposition 
  rights.  In the absence of the clear expression of a contrary legislative intention, 
  in the form of a curative provision or by other language, this requirement cannot 
  be abrogated.  This compels the conclusion that the word “shall” as it appears 
  in s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) has an imperative meaning and, at least in relation to legal 
  counsel for a young person, strict compliance with it was intended by Parliament.</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown submits that where the disposition is a probation order, an 
  imperative construction of s. 20(6)(a) would place ss. 20(6)(a) and 23(3)(c) 
  in conflict or otherwise permit the former to override the latter.  I disagree.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6)(a) does not exempt dispositions made under s. 20(1)(j) 
  from its application, or otherwise refer to s. 23(3)(c).  If ss. 20(6)(a) and 
  23(3)(c) were seen to be in potential conflict, or duplicative, it would have 
  been an easy drafting matter to avoid this result by introducing words of limitation 
  to s. 20(6)(a).  The drafters of the <i>YOA</i> did not do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Legislative provisions are to be interpreted to avoid a conflict between 
  them (Driedger, at 176&#8209;177).  That is the result to be sought in this 
  case.  In my view, there is nothing in the <i>YOA</i> to militate against the 
  conclusion that ss.&nbsp;20(6)(a) and 23(3)(c) are intended to operate in a 
  complementary fashion, to ensure that a young person’s obligations and rights 
  in relation to a probation order are brought home to him or her.  For the same 
  reasons, I conclude that an imperative construction of s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) does 
  not render redundant the provisions of ss. 23(3)(c) or otherwise “elevate” s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) 
  above s.&nbsp;23(3)(c).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6)(a) provides that a copy of the disposition is to be provided 
  to various persons, including the young person, his or her counsel and parents 
  and the prosecutor, among others.  All of these persons arguably have an interest 
  in the disposition or in the post-disposition <i>YOA </i> process.  The Crown 
  submits that the wide scope of the class of identified recipients of a copy 
  of the disposition supports the conclusion that imperfect compliance with s. 
  20(6)(a) should not result, in every case, in the failure of a prosecution under 
  s. 26 of the <i>YOA</i> for wilful breach of probation.   For example, the Crown 
  argues that a failure under s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) to provide the prosecutor with 
  a copy of the disposition, cannot have been intended to permit a young person 
  to avoid the consequences of a wilful breach of a probation order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not disagree with these assertions.  Indeed, there is much to commend 
  them, in a proper case.  This may arise, for example, where the youth court 
  fails to provide a copy of the disposition to a recipient who does not have 
  a special role or responsibility under the <i>YOA </i>to directly assist, advise 
  or guide a young person.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition, in my view, the requirement that a prosecutor receive a 
  copy of the disposition serves a particular purpose.  Prosecutors have an interest 
  in ensuring that the actual disposition is in proper form and in accordance 
  with the disposition plan accepted by the court.  They are also involved in 
  the appeal and review processes under the <i>YOA</i>.  They must receive a copy 
  of the formal disposition to assess and meaningfully participate in those processes.  
  Provision of a formal copy of the disposition to them may be seen as but one 
  step in furtherance of such activities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, this appeal does not concern the failure to provide a copy 
  of the probation disposition to the prosecutor, or other persons who have no 
  direct advisory role in relation to the respondent.  Rather, we are concerned 
  with the failure to provide a copy of the probation disposition to the respondent’s 
  own counsel, a person who has a direct advisory role in relation to the respondent, 
  consistent with the declared rights of young persons under, and the objects 
  of, the statute.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is significant in this case that the disposition is probation.  Section 
  23(3)(c) of the <i>YOA </i>requires that a copy of a probation order be provided 
  to the young person and, in some circumstances, to a parent of the young person.  
  There is no requirement under s. 23(3)(c) that counsel for the young person 
  receive a copy of the probation disposition.  That notification is accomplished 
  by compliance with s.&nbsp;20(6)(a).  Thus, so long as s. 20(6)(a) is properly 
  interpreted to impose an imperative obligation in relation to legal counsel 
  for a young person, there was no need for the drafters of the <i>YOA</i> to 
  include in s. 23(3)(c) mention of counsel for a young person, because such counsel 
  would automatically receive a copy of a probation disposition upon compliance 
  with s. 20(6)(a).  In this case, in my view, the combined operation of ss.&nbsp;20(6)(a) 
  and 23(3)(c) require that the respondent’s counsel at the robbery trial receive 
  a copy of both Forms 11 and 12.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Non-compliance with the requirements of s. 20(6)(a) <i>in relation to 
  a young person’s counsel</i>, therefore, undermines a particular, and special, 
  object of the legislation.  In contrast, in my view, a failure to provide a 
  copy of a probation disposition to other persons identified in s. 20(6)(a) may 
  not yield a similar result if those persons have no role to play under the <i>YOA</i> 
  in advising, guiding and assisting the young person, including in connection 
  with the disposition and the requirements for compliance with it.  Thus, I conclude 
  that non-compliance with s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) need not defeat, in every case, a 
  subsequent prosecution under s. 26 for wilful failure or refusal to comply with 
  an order of disposition.  Rather, the type of non-compliance with s. 20(6)(a) 
  must be assessed in each case in light of the purpose underlying the notice 
  requirement established by the section, the nature of the order of disposition, 
  the role under the <i>YOA </i>of the intended recipient of a copy of the disposition, 
  and the declared principles and objects of the <i>YOA</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I conclude that the word “shall” as it appears in s. 20(6)(a) of the 
  <i>YOA</i>, according to its ordinary signification, is capable of bearing either 
  a directory or imperative meaning.  However, when it is read in the full context 
  in which it is used, in view of the purpose of s. 20(6)(a) in relation to legal 
  counsel for a young person and the objects of the <i>YOA</i>, it is intended 
  to receive an imperative interpretation, consistent with the rule of liberal 
  construction established by s. 3(2) and the principles enshrined within s. 3(1) 
  of the <i>YOA</i>.  This does not mean that the word “shall” bears a similar 
  meaning throughout the <i>YOA</i> when it is used in different contexts, for 
  different purposes, or even within s.&nbsp;20(6)(a) when different statutory 
  purposes or dispositions other than probation dispositions are in issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given this interpretation of s. 20(6)(a), and its purpose in relation 
  to legal counsel for a young person, described above, the consequence of non-compliance 
  with it in this case is clear.  Where the disposition is a probation order and 
  the affected young person is not accorded the opportunity to obtain advice, 
  guidance and assistance from his or her counsel concerning the probation disposition, 
  as provision of a copy of the disposition to such counsel is intended to facilitate, 
  a conviction cannot be entered on a charge under s.&nbsp;26 of the <i>YOA</i>  
  of wilful failure or refusal to comply with the probation order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span> The respondent, a young offender, pleaded guilty to robbery.  He was 
  found guilty and placed on probation for 18 months.  One of the terms of his 
  probation required the respondent to report to a probation officer.  He reported 
  as required for a while and then stopped reporting.  He knew he was required 
  to report to his probation officer and he knew the consequences of failing to 
  report when he chose to stop reporting to the probation officer.  The respondent 
  was charged with wilfully failing to comply with the probation order contrary 
  to s. 26 of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 (“<i>Y.O.A.</i>”).</p>

  counsel pointed out that the Crown had failed to prove that the respondent’s 
  lawyer at the robbery proceedings had been provided with a copy of the disposition 
  order as required by s. 20(6) of the <i>Y.O.A.</i>  He submitted that the failure 
  to provide the lawyer with a copy of the order entitled the respondent to escape 
  liability for his wilful and knowing breach of the terms of his probation.  
  The trial judge agreed and dismissed the charge.  The summary conviction appeal 
  court judge agreed and dismissed the Crown’s appeal.  My two colleagues also 
  agree and would dismiss the appeal.  I dissent.  I would grant leave to appeal

  </span> After the respondent was found guilty of robbery, the youth court judge 
  placed him on probation and set out the terms of that probation.  Subsequent 
  to the making of the probation order in court by the youth court judge, the 
  clerical staff of the youth court prepared two documents.  Both documents were 
  prepared by filling in blanks on pre-printed forms authorized for use under 
  a regulation passed pursuant to the <i>Y.O.A.</i><a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span> [14] </span></a>  One of the documents, 
  a Form 11, is described in the regulations as “an order of disposition” and 
  is said to be referable to s. 20(1) of the <i>Y.O.A</i>.  That is the section 
  that sets out all of the dispositions available under the <i>Act</i>, including 
  probation.  The Form 11, however, makes no reference to a probation disposition.  
  The Form 11 prepared in this case does not indicate that the respondent was 
  placed on probation and does not refer to any of the terms of the probation 
  order except the community service requirement.  Form 11 contains boxes showing 
  the distribution of that form.  The respondent’s Form 11 showed that his parents 
  got a copy of the document, but that counsel did not receive a copy.  The respondent 
  was represented by duty counsel and duty counsel’s name does not appear anywhere 
  in the material that would be available to the clerical staff when it completed 
  the forms.  This explains why counsel did not receive a copy of the Form 11.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span> 
  [15] </span></a> </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second document prepared by the clerical staff, a Form 12, is described 
  in the regulations as “a probation order” and is said to be referable to paragraph 
  20(1)(j) of the <i>Y.O.A</i>.  That is the section which provides for a probation 
  disposition.  The pre-printed Form 12 identifies the disposition imposed on 
  the respondent (probation for 18 months) and has attached to it a copy of the 
  probation order signed by the youth court judge setting out all of the terms 
  and conditions of the probation order, including the community service requirement.  
  The Form 12 is signed by the respondent who acknowledges that the document has 
  been explained to him.  The respondent also signed a document called a “disposition 
  acknowledgement” indicating he was aware that a failure to comply could result 
  in prosecution and that he had the right to a review under s. 32.  A copy of 
  the Form 12 was provided to the respondent and to his “parent in attendance”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The case has proceeded from the outset on the basis that the Form 11 
  was the “copy of the disposition” referred to in s. 20(6) and that the Form 
  12 was the probation order referred to in s. 23(3) of the <i>Act</i>.  While 
  it is irrelevant to my ultimate determination of this appeal, I do not think 
  that the Form 11 prepared in this case can be described as a “copy of the disposition” 
  imposed on the respondent.  The Form 11 makes no reference to probation at all.  
  I think the Form 12 which does indicate the actual disposition imposed on the 
  respondent and the terms of that disposition should be regarded as the “copy 
  of the disposition” referred to in s. 20(6).<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span>

<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>II</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with my colleague, Cronk J.A., that compliance with s. 20(6) 
  is mandatory.  I also agree that the <i>Y.O.A.</i> places special emphasis on 
  the availability of counsel to assist a young person at the various stages of 
  proceedings under the <i>Y.O.A.</i>  I do not agree that a failure to provide 
  counsel with a copy of the disposition renders the order unenforceable or otherwise 
  immunizes a young person from conviction where he or she wilfully breaches a 
  term of probation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As is often the case, the outcome of the analysis of the problem presented 
  on this appeal depends on one’s starting premise.  I begin from the principle 
  that the determination of criminal liability should not be akin to a game of 
  procedural “snakes and ladders” where the outcome is unconnected to the merits 
  of the allegation. Young persons, like anyone else, should not escape responsibility 
  for their criminal actions because of an administrative error that has nothing 
  to do with the merits of the allegation, and in no way compromises the young 
  person’s ability to defend against the charge or the fairness of the proceedings.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span> [17] </span></a>  In certain situations, our law recognizes that 
  policy concerns demand that criminal allegations should be disposed of on grounds 
  other than the merits.  The circumstances in which those policy considerations 
  will override the imperative to arrive at a disposition on the merits, however, 
  should be limited to situations where the applicable statutory language clearly 
  demands it, or the policies served by allowing a guilty person to escape responsibility 
  are compelling.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"
title=""><span> [18] </span></a>  Consequently, I do not begin my analysis by 
  asking whether Parliament has specifically provided that non-compliance with 
  s. 20(6) should not affect the respondent’s criminal liability.  Instead, I 
  ask whether Parliament has clearly indicated that non-compliance should preclude 
  a determination of a criminal charge on its merits, or whether the policy underlying 
  s. 20(6) demands that accused persons escape liability for their criminal conduct.</p>

  (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 562 (Ont. C.A.), a case in which this court held that

  </span> Although <i>R. v. M.(L.A.), supra</i>, has not been followed in other 
  jurisdictions,<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span> [20] </span></a> 
  its correctness is not challenged on this appeal.  The question to be decided 
  is whether the failure to provide a young person’s lawyer with a copy of the 
  disposition order as required by s. 20(6) should have the same effect as the 
  failure to give a young person’s parent a copy of the probation order as required 
  in s. 23(3).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The question is not resolved by the characterization of s. 20(6) as 
  “mandatory”.  Although Arbour J.A. described s. 23(3) as mandatory, she did 
  not hold that the failure to comply with the mandatory terms of that section 
  automatically rendered the probation order unenforceable or otherwise immunized 
  the young person from prosecution for failure to comply with the probation order.  
  She considered the enforceability of the order in the context of a subsequent 
  prosecution for breach of the order as a discrete question that was not answered 
  simply by reference to the mandatory nature of the section.  In deciding the 
  effect of failing to provide a copy of the probation order to parents who had 
  attended the proceedings as required by s. 23(3)(c), Arbour J.A. looked to the 
  purpose underlying the requirement that such parents receive a copy of the probation 
  order.  She said at pp. 575-76:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The purpose behind the parent’s entitlement is to give effect to the 
      general principles expressed in the statute that parents have a responsibility 
      for the supervision of their children, and that young persons are entitled 
      to the guidance and assistance of their parents.  In my opinion, this is 
      particularly so when the young offender is compelled to perform community 
      service and is otherwise bound by the conditions of a probation order.  
      The <i>Act</i> contemplates that more than self-discipline may be called 
      upon to ensure compliance.  Parental guidance and supervision is an entitlement 
      designed to facilitate that compliance.  It seems to me that the consequences 
      of failing to comply with the duty to inform the entitled parent is on equal 
      footing with the failure to inform the young person of what is expected 
      of him or her.</p>
    <p>… The failure in compliance with the mandatory terms of s. 23(3)(c) is 
      therefore more than a mere procedural irregularity.  Rather, it offends 
      an important principle in the <i>Act</i> and may make compliance with the 
      probation order more onerous to the immature youth than it would have been 
      had the parent been properly notified.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In her analysis, Arbour J.A. tied the requirement that the parent receive 
  a copy of the probation order directly to parents’ statutory obligation set 
  out in s. 3(1)(h) of the <i>Y.O.A.</i> to provide care and supervision for their 
  children.  For a young person on probation, that supervision was “an entitlement 
  designed to facilitate compliance” with the probation order.  Without that supervision, 
  compliance was “more onerous”.  Arbour J.A. saw s. 23(3)(c) as the means of 
  ensuring that parents were sufficiently aware of the terms of the probation 
  order to provide the supervision and guidance needed to facilitate compliance 
  with the probation order by the young person.  The direct link between compliance 
  with the probation order by the young person and the providing of a copy of 
  the probation order to the parent fashioned by Arbour J.A., drove her conclusion 
  that a failure to provide the parent with a copy of the probation order should 
  preclude a conviction for non-compliance with the probation order.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The connection between compliance by the young person with the probation 
  order and the providing of a copy of that order to his or her parent finds additional 
  support from two other sources.  First, s. 23(3)(a) and s. 23(3)(b) address 
  matters which are clearly intended to ensure that the young offender is in a 
  position to properly comply with the probation order.  Those subsections are 
  designed to make sure that the young person understands the terms of the order.  
  It is a fair inference that s. 23(3)(c), like the other two subsections, serves 
  the purpose of promoting the young offender’s compliance with the order.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, s. 23(3)(c), unlike s. 20(6), is addressed only to parents who 
  were in attendance at the proceedings or who are otherwise considered by the 
  youth court to have a sufficient interest in the proceedings.  Unlike some parents 
  who have not had any interest in the proceedings, but are still entitled to 
  receive a copy of the disposition order under s. 20(6), the subset of parents 
  identified in s. 23(3)(c) are presumably those who are seen as being sufficiently 
  involved in the young person’s life to be in a position to exercise the supervision 
  and guidance during the tenure of the probation order needed to facilitate compliance 
  with that order. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that the purpose underlying s. 23(3) as identified in 
  <i>R. v. M.(L.A.), supra</i>, is the same as the purpose underlying s. 20(6).  
  Section 23(3) is a very specific provision.  It targets only probation orders.  
  Probation orders by their nature impose limits and place requirements on the 
  young person over an extended period of time.  Those orders govern the young 
  person’s conduct.  During the tenure of the order, there is no direct state 
  control over the young person, but he or she is under the supervision of his 
  or her parents.  Section 23(3)(c) looks to parents who have a statutory duty 
  to supervise their children and are in a position to provide supervision and 
  guidance to their children to facilitate the young person’s compliance with 
  the probation order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6) refers to all dispositions, including custodial dispositions.  
  Custodial dispositions do not engage compliance concerns like those associated 
  with a probation order.  A young person sentenced to a custodial term falls 
  under the direct supervision of the state.  Parents have no role to play in 
  facilitating compliance with a custodial term.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 20(6) also requires that copies of the disposition be given 
  to persons who have no ability to supervise the young person and no responsibility 
  for the ongoing supervision of the young person.  For example, neither prosecutors 
  nor the review board have any role to play in ensuring that a young person complies 
  with any disposition that was imposed on the young person.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the requirement in s. 20(6) that the named persons receive 
  copies of the disposition is aimed at two things, both of which foster the proper 
  and effective operation of the disposition scheme created by the <i>Y.O.A.</i>  
  First, the requirement provides a means by which those present when the youth 
  court made the disposition can ensure that the order generated by the clerical 
  staff accurately reflects the disposition imposed.  Errors can be made and it 
  is crucial that the disposition order accurately reflect the disposition imposed 
  as that order will become the operative document in subsequent proceedings involving 
  the disposition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the persons referred to in s. 20(6) have various post-disposition 
  responsibilities and rights.  The fulfilment of these responsibilities and the 
  exercise of these rights is furthered by providing these persons with an accurate 
  copy of the disposition.  The prosecutor and counsel for the young person have 
  the responsibility of ensuring that the disposition order is accurate.  The 
  prosecutor and the young person have certain post-disposition rights of review 
  and appeal, eg. s. 27, s. 28, s. 28.1, s. 29(2), s. 32.  The provincial director 
  has numerous post-disposition responsibilities and rights of review, eg. s. 
  24.1(3), s. 24.2(9-12), s. 24.5, s. 26.1, s. 26.2, s. 28(1) and (2), s. 28(7), 
  s. 29.  The parents of a young person also have certain rights to initiate proceedings 
  to alter or review dispositions, eg. s. 25, s. 28(3), s. 28(6), s. 28.1, s. 
  29(2), s. 32.  The review board, where one exists, also has certain post-disposition 
  responsibilities, eg. s. 30.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By providing the persons identified in s. 20(6) with a copy of the disposition 
  order, s. 20(6) seeks to promote the co-ordinated and effective operation of 
  the overall disposition scheme established by the <i>Y.O.A.</i>  That scheme 
  begins with the imposition of the disposition, but extends beyond to potential 
  appeals, reviews, and variations.  Section 20(6) seeks to ensure that all involved 
  in this overall disposition scheme begin with an accurate record of the disposition 
  imposed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In holding that the reasoning in <i>R. v. M.(L.A.), supra</i>, should 
  be extended to s. 20(6) and to the failure to provide the young person’s lawyer 
  with a copy of the disposition order, my colleague refers to counsel’s obligation 
  to advise the young person of “the meaning, propriety and consequences” of the 
  disposition imposed.  She contends that counsel’s role as a legal adviser encourages 
  compliance by the young person with all dispositions and, in particular, with 
  probation orders.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While I can agree that counsel has a professional obligation to advise 
  the young person of the meaning and consequences of an order imposed by the 
  court, the <i>Y.O.A.</i> does not entrust that obligation to counsel in so far 
  as it affects the enforcement of probation orders.  Instead, s. 23(3) of the 
  <i>Y.O.A.</i> places that obligation squarely on the court.  If the court does 
  not fulfill its obligations the young person cannot be prosecuted for breach 
  of probation regardless of what counsel may have told him.  Equally, in my view, 
  if the court does comply with its obligations under s. 23(3), it is irrelevant 
  to the appellant’s liability for breach of probation what, if anything, his 
  lawyer told him about his obligations.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I also cannot agree that s. 20(6) is designed to facilitate the giving 
  of legal advice with respect to the meaning of dispositions or the remedies 
  available to challenge those dispositions.  Section 20(6) says nothing about 
  when or how counsel is to be provided with a copy of the disposition.  In the 
  normal case, I would think that counsel would not be present when the disposition 
  order is prepared.  Presumably, he or she will receive the copy at some later 
  time.  Nothing in the <i>Y.O.A.</i> compels any communication between counsel 
  and the young person after counsel receives a copy of the disposition order.  
  In many cases, counsel will not see his or her client after the court proceeding 
  is completed.  Certainly, this is the case where the young person is represented 
  by duty counsel.  If s. 20(6) was designed to facilitate the giving of legal 
  advice to a young person in respect of the disposition, I would think that it 
  would have put some obligation on counsel to at least communicate with the young 
  person after counsel received the copy of the disposition.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I also cannot read s. 20(6) as having any connection to the young person’s 
  right to legal advice as to post-disposition remedies which may be available 
  to the young person.  The young person is certainly entitled to that advice 
  and it may be that trial counsel has a professional obligation to offer it, 
  but nothing in s. 20(6) is directed to post-disposition remedies.  Nor, in my 
  view, can it be said that giving a copy of the disposition order to trial counsel, 
  who as I said above may never see the client after the disposition is made in 
  court, facilitates the giving of legal advice as to the available remedies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Lastly, 
  and perhaps most importantly, counsel does not have any supervisory role to 
  play in relation to the ongoing conduct of the young person after the disposition.  
  It is this supervisory role and its particular significance in the context of 
  a probation order that led Arbour J.A. to the conclusion she reached in <i>R. 
  v. M.(L.A.), supra</i>.  Unlike parents, counsel has no statutory obligation 
  to provide ongoing supervision and guidance to clients who happen to be young 
  persons.  This essential difference between the role of counsel and the role 
  of parents makes the reasoning in <i>R. v. M.(L.A.), supra</i>, inapplicable 
  to the failure to provide counsel with a copy of the disposition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There 
  are also significant practical difficulties with an interpretation of s. 20(6) 
  that makes compliance with that section a prerequisite to the validity of a 
  disposition.  Cronk J.A. alludes to one, the effect of a failure to provide 
  the prosecutor with a copy of the disposition.  While I agree with her observation 
  that the prosecutor has important post-disposition duties, I do not see any 
  connection between the performance of those duties and the young person’s obligations 
  under the disposition or his rights to either parental supervision and assistance 
  or legal advice.  If, however, s. 20(6) has the effect that the majority describes, 
  it must follow that a failure to provide the prosecutor (or the provincial director 
  or the review board) with a copy of the disposition will enable the young person 
  to breach that disposition with impunity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There 
  are other practical problems.  For example, s. 20(6) declares that the youth 
  court must give reasons for its disposition.  That requirement is also framed 
  in mandatory language.  If a youth court fails to give reasons, can the young 
  person simply ignore the disposition?  If a custodial disposition is imposed, 
  can the young person walk away from the institution, or successfully bring a 
  <i>habeas corpus</i> application?  I shudder at the suggestion that a young 
  person convicted of, for example, first degree murder is entitled to escape 
  any responsibility for that murder because the youth court judge failed to give 
  reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Section 
  20(6) also directs that persons named in the section shall, on request, be provided 
  with a copy of the reasons for the disposition.  In Ontario, it is not unusual 
  to wait weeks or even months for transcripts of reasons.  What is the status 
  of the disposition pending receipt of the transcript by a person named in s. 
  20(6) who has requested a copy of the transcript?  If compliance with s. 20(6) 
  is a prerequisite to the validity or enforceability of the disposition, it must 
  follow that a disposition cannot be enforced against the young person pending 
  receipt of the transcript.  Returning to the hypothetical example of the young 
  person convicted of first degree murder, there may be weeks or even months between 
  the making of the order and the availability of the transcript.  If s. 20(6) 
  has the effect described by my colleagues, the state will have no ability to 
  enforce that order against the young person pending receipt of the transcript.  
  During that time period, the young person could not be held in custody under 
  the authority of the disposition.  This result would hardly inspire confidence 
  in the operation of the <i>Y.O.A.</i> and perhaps more to the point, would run 
  directly against s. 20(2) of the <i>Y.O.A.</i> that provides that unless otherwise 
  ordered, a disposition comes into force on the day it is made.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>IV</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  the reasons set out above, I would not immunize a young person from responsibility 
  for non-compliance with a probation order because of a failure to provide his 
  lawyer with a copy of the disposition.  In so holding, I do not suggest that 
  compliance with s. 20(6) is not important or that it will never have any consequences.  
  The state has an obligation to comply with s. 20(6). Those to whom that obligation 
  is owed are entitled to insist upon compliance with s. 20(6) and to seek whatever 
  legal remedies are appropriate to enforce compliance.  Furthermore, if in a 
  given case non-compliance with s. 20(6) has some actual impact on a young person’s 
  ability to comply with the disposition, or adversely affects some post-disposition 
  entitlement of the young person, that non-compliance will give rise to legal 
  remedies and perhaps in the appropriate case a dismissal of a charge for non-compliance 
  with the order.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>V</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and quash the order dismissing 
  the charge.  As the Crown seeks only a new trial, I would direct a new trial 
  on the charge of failure to comply with the probation order.</p>

    the young person.  I agree that no distinction can be drawn.</p>

    appeal court, referred to the forms prescribed under the regulation as “somewhat 
    deficient” where the disposition is probation.  Others have made the same 
    point:  eg. see <i>R. v. L.C.</i>, unreported May 18, 1995 (Ont. Ct. (Prov. 
    Div.)) August J.;  <i>R. v. J.P.</i>, unreported April 11, 1995 (Ont. Ct. 
    (Prov. Div.)) Johnston J.  I agree with these comments.  As near as I can 
    tell, Form 11 as presently designed has no application where the disposition 
    is an order of probation standing alone.  The Form 11 prepared in this case 
    not only does not refer to probation, but is misleading to the extent that 
    it suggests that the community service order was a separate disposition made 
    under s. 20(g) of the <i>Y.O.A.</i> and not a term of the probation order.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref18"

    in which a stay of proceedings is an appropriate remedy under s. 24(1) of 
    the <i>Charter</i> for a constitutional violation reflect this strong presumption:  
    eg. see <i>R. v. Power</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601 at 615, <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, 
    [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411.</p>

    receive a copy of the probation order if the court is satisfied that those
