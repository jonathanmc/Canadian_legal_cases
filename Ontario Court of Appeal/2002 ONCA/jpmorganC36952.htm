  </span> The issue on this appeal is whether the interim receiver of an insolvent 
  assignee of a tenancy effectively terminated the lease pursuant to a court order 
  and thus freed the assignor tenant from liability under the terms of the lease. 
  Upon a motion by the landlord for advice and direction, the motions judge issued 
  a declaration that the action taken by the receiver did not have the effect 
  of terminating the lease. The tenant appeals from that finding.</p>

  </span> Clarica Life Insurance Company and Oxford Properties Group Inc. (collectively, 
  the landlord) are the owners of an office building at 3300 Bloor Street West, 
  Toronto. A portion of the premises was leased to a predecessor of Shaw Communications 
  Inc. (the tenant). That lease was assigned to 3617181 Canada Limited (the assignee) 
  by an agreement of assignment and consent dated July 30, 1999 executed by the 
  landlord, the tenant’s predecessor and the assignee. The agreement provides 
  that the tenant remains jointly and severally liable with the assignee for all 
  the tenant’s covenants and obligations.</p>

  </span> By <i>ex parte</i> order, made at the instance of J. P. Morgan Canada 
  and dated November 17, 2000, Jarvis J. appointed Ernst &amp; Young Inc. as interim 
  receiver of, among others, the assignee, pursuant to s. 47(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. Paragraph 2(f) of that order provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>2.         THIS COURT ORDERS that Ernst &amp; Young Inc. (the “Interim 
      Receiver”) be and is hereby appointed, pursuant to s. 47(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy 
      and Insolvency Act</i> (i) interim receiver, without security, of MaxLink 
      Canada Inc., MaxLink Holdings Inc., 3617181 Canada Limited, Regional Vision 
      Inc., and MaxLink Communications Inc., and all of their present and future 
      undertaking, property and assets and (ii) interim receiver, without security, 
      of Net only in respect of the shares of MaxLink Canada owned by Net, and 
      any notes or other documents evidencing indebtedness owed to Net by MaxLink 
      Canada or its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the “Assets”) and, 
      subject to the provisions hereof, the Interim Receiver is hereby empowered, 
      authorized and directed, but not obligated, to take possession of and control 
      the Assets and any and all proceeds, receipts and disbursements arising 
      out of or from the Assets, until further order of this Honourable Court, 
      and to act at once in respect of the Assets and carry on the business of 
      MaxLink and, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing 
      <i>and in furtherance thereof, the Interim Receiver is hereby expressly 
      empowered and authorized, but not obligated</i>:</p>

  </span> The landlord became aware of this order and for a time received rent 
  from the receiver. Then on June 1, 2001 the receiver wrote the landlord and 
  stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>By letter dated May 30, 2001, we advised you that [the tenant] vacated 
      the premises occupied by it at 3300 Bloor Street West (the “Premises”) effective 
      May 28, 2001. Pursuant to paragraph 2(f) of the Appointment Order, the Interim 
      Receiver is authorized to terminate existing agreements to which [the tenant] 
      is a party. This letter will serve as notice that the lease dated April 
      21, 1997 relating to the Premises is hereby terminated effective immediately. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thereafter, the landlord brought this motion pursuant to the order of 
  Jarvis J., which permitted any interested party to apply to the court for a 
  further order or a variation of that order. The motions judge endorsed the record 
  in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am of the view that the letter of June 1, 2001 from the Interim Receiver 
      insofar as it purported to terminate the lease dated April 21, 1997 did 
      not have that effect nor could it have that effect because the debtor was 
      not a party to that Lease and the Receiver would therefore have no authority 
      to do that which the letter purports to do. This conclusion is not intended 
      to restrict in any way the right of the parties to make any and all arguments 
      with respect to what the Receiver did or did not have the authority to do 
      or what the Receiver did or did not in fact do under the letter of June 
      1/01.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the general result achieved by this endorsement but my 
  reasoning is somewhat different.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The emphasis of the appellant’s submissions was upon the clear words 
  of empowerment in the order of Jarvis J. “to amend or terminate existing agreements” 
  and the jurisprudence supporting such broad authority to affect third party 
  rights under s. 47(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. </i>As the argument 
  was put, the judge had the authority and explicitly handed the power to the 
  receiver to terminate all agreements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I don’t see the issue as being the breadth of authority in Jarvis J. 
  Rather, the issue is one of determining what his order means. It most certainly 
  did not empower the receiver to terminate agreements by whim and outside the 
  context of the insolvency proceedings. Some limitation of scope must be implied 
  by the context that gave rise to the order. I place emphasis on the words of 
  paragraph 2 of the order of Jarvis J.: “<i>and in furtherance thereof, </i>the 
  Interim Receiver is hereby expressly empowered and authorized …” [Emphasis added]. 
  The powers granted by the order should be read as limited to those in furtherance 
  of the receiver’s intended purpose: to protect creditors by carrying on the 
  insolvent’s  business, protecting its assets, and limiting its liabilities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The assignment agreement was a burden to the assignee and would fall 
  within the receiver’s power of termination, as so defined, but the obligations 
  of the original tenant to the landlord have absolutely no relationship to the 
  insolvency. The landlord presumably negotiated the original lease in reliance 
  on the tenant’s apparent credit strength and business prospects. When the assignment 
  was executed, the landlord obtained an additional covenant, not a replacement. 
  It defies common sense to consider that the order of Jarvis J. was intended 
  to be used to extinguish obligations between the two original parties to the 
  lease with no pretence of benefit to the insolvent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge based his order on the fact that the insolvent was 
  not a party to the lease. That is a narrower approach than mine and is vulnerable 
  to the argument that the assignee was indeed a party by virtue of the assignment. 
  The assignment contains a covenant that the assignee will observe the covenants 
  in the lease as though it were named as tenant. That covenant disappears with 
  the termination of the assignment agreement, a measure that is therefore sufficient 
  to fulfil the receiver’s intended function to limit ongoing liabilities of the 
  insolvent. To go beyond the assignment agreement and terminate the lease serves 
  no purpose related to the insolvency. I therefore conclude that the interim 
  receiver had the power to terminate the assignment agreement but not the original 
  lease. In my view, defining the receiver’s power of termination by purpose is 
  a more natural interpretation than restricting the power to agreements to which 
  the insolvent is a party.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant referred to two authorities said to support its position. 
  They are <i>Crystalline Investments Ltd. v. Domgroup Ltd.</i> (2001), 39 R.P.R. 
  (3d) 49 (Ont. S.C.J.)<i> </i>and <i>Lava Systems Inc. (Receiver and Manager 
  of) v. Clarica Life Insurance Co., </i>[2001] O.J. No. 3365 (S.C.J.). Each of 
  these cases is currently under appeal to this court and although I see them 
  as distinguishable on their facts it is not appropriate in these circumstances 
  to comment further.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore allow the appeal, to the extent of varying the declaration 
  in the order of Nordheimer J. by deleting in paragraph 1 of the order the words 
  “nor could it have that effect because the debtor was not a party to that lease 
  and the Receiver would therefore have no authority to do that which the letter 
  purports to do”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  of the appeal.</p>
