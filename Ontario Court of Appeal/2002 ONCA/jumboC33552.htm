<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul U. Rivard dated 
  January 13, 2000.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants submit that the doctrine of waiver was not pleaded 
  and that the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellants waived their 
  right to sue for damages arising out of a secret $50,000 payment received by 
  the respondent.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Notwithstanding the apparent unfairness to the appellants from 
  the omission to plead waiver, the trial judge’s comments prior to argument alerted 
  the appellants to the fact that they may not succeed in their defence and counterclaim 
  because the corporate appellant subsequently made an arrangement that implicitly 
  affirmed the continuation of the agreement.  No objection was raised by the 
  appellants’ counsel and submissions were made on the question.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the hearing of this appeal, the appellants submitted that, 
  had the matter been properly pleaded, the evidence at trial would have been 
  more fully developed on this issue.  In these circumstances, the only appropriate 
  remedy that the appellants could request was a new trial and this was not requested.  
  On the whole of the evidence, it appears that the appellants tolerated the circumstances 
  of which complaint is now made for some three years.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our opinion, there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice and the appeal is therefore dismissed together with the motion to 
  amend the pleadings on appeal to plead waiver.  Costs of the appeal to the respondent.</p>
