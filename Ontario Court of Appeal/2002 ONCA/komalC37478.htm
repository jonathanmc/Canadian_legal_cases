<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Ellen M. Macdonald of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 30, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The main issue on this appeal is whether the motions judge erred in holding 
  that there was a concluded settlement between the parties. In our view, she 
  did not err.</p>
<p>
  [2] Assuming that the correspondence between Mr. Manes and Mr. Morton in December 
  1998 reflects some ambiguity about whether Mr. Morton agreed to compromise his 
  client's claim for only $12,000, that ambiguity was removed by the two letters 
  from Mr. Simpson to Mr. Morton on March 23, 2000. In those letters Mr. Simpson 
  confirms that the appellant's claim was settled for the amount of $12,000 in 
  exchange for terminating the notices of garnishment. Mr. Morton has never denied 
  the accuracy of Mr. Simpson's letters or the discussion between them that preceded 
  the second letter. Instead, Mr. Morton did not respond to Mr. Simpson's correspondence 
  and, on his evidence on the motion, conceded that this correspondence provided 
  for a payment of only $12,000. Therefore, the appellant's claim that he is entitled 
  to more than that amount must fail. </p>
<p>
  [3] However, even the respondent acknowledges that the appellant is entitled 
  to $12,000. The respondent has not yet paid this amount to the appellant. Although 
  the appellant did not ask the motions judge to order that this amount be paid 
  out of the money in court, we think it fair to make this order on appeal to 
  give effect to the settlement. </p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, the order of Macdonald J. dated November 30, 2001 is varied 
  by providing that of the money in court to the credit of this action, $12,000 
  plus accrued interest from March 31, 2000, be paid to the appellant and that 
  the remaining money in court be paid to the respondent. To this extent, the 
  appeal is allowed. Otherwise, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent, Bronfman, seeks leave to appeal the motions judge's refusal 
  to award him the costs of the motion. He seeks costs against either the appellant 
  or against the appellant and Mr. Jagtoo. Absent special circumstances, a successful 
  party is entitled to costs. See Bell Canada v. Olympia &amp; York Developments 
  Ltd. (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 135. </p>
<p>
  [6] The motions judge denied costs because of two factors or special circumstances. 
  First, Mr. Sozonchuk did not collect his loan from Mr. Bronfman and, second 
  Mr. Bronfman has not paid the $12,000 he acknowledges owing to the appellant. 
  Mr. Bronfman contends that in relying on those two factors to deny costs, the 
  motions judge erred in principle. We do not agree with that contention. Although 
  admittedly Mr. Sozonchuk compromised his claim, Mr. Bronfman never denied the 
  loan to him and said he would pay it when he had the money. He now has the money 
  because of the motions judge's order, upheld by this court, but he has never 
  offered to repay Mr. Sozonchuk. Moreover, until the argument of this appeal, 
  Mr. Bronfman even denied being obligated to pay $12,000 to Mr. Komal out of 
  the money in court. </p>
<p>
  [7] We agree with the motions judge that Mr. Bronfman has received a windfall 
  and, like her, we think it is in the interests of justice to deny Mr. Bronfman 
  costs against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [8] On the evidentiary record before us, we are not persuaded that it is appropriate 
  to order costs against Mr. Jagtoo. We are not satisfied that the evidence shows 
  that Mr. Jagtoo had an interest in the money in court apart from his claim for 
  legal fees. </p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, we conclude that the motions judge did not err in the exercise 
  of her discretion in refusing to order costs against the appellant or against 
  Mr. Jagtoo. Leave to appeal costs is therefore refused. </p>
<p>
  [10] We have considered the costs of the appeal in combination with the motion 
  and the results of each, including the offer to settle. </p>
<p>
  [11] Having regard to the background facts and history of these proceedings 
  and the conduct of the various parties, we think this is an appropriate situation 
  for each party to bear his own costs.</p>
