  </span></span> The three appellants were each convicted on three counts of kidnapping 
  and sentenced to life imprisonment on each of the counts.  They were also convicted 
  of forcible confinement and received concurrent five-year sentences.  They all 
  appeal their convictions and sentences.  The issue in this appeal relates to 
  the applicability of the defence of duress.</p>

  </span></span> On November 24, 1995, Fei Wing Tsang (also called Ah Fai) and 
  the three appellants forced their way inside a house in Scarborough.  The residence 
  was divided into two apartments.  Eva Yang and her parents Li Yang and Zin Chan 
  occupied the main floor apartment, while Choi Kong occupied the basement apartment.    
  The appellants Chen and Liu bound the basement tenant, Mrs. Kong, and she was 
  left with her hands tied to a pipe.  The appellants took Yang and her parents 
  (the hostages) into a van and drove them to an apartment.  Apart from one brief 
  trip to another location the day of the kidnapping, the appellants held the 
  three hostages in the apartment for some 22 days.  Their captivity came to an 
  end when the police mounted a surprise rescue operation, freed the hostages 
  and arrested the three appellants and a woman who had cooked for them during 
  the captivity.  Tsang was not in the apartment at the time of the rescue and 
  he has not been apprehended.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Eva Yang’s older brother, Lok, had acted as an informant against 
  a criminal organization in Hong Kong.  As a result of his information, a shipment 
  of drugs had apparently been seized in Vancouver.  The organization thus lost 
  the money it anticipated receiving from the sale of the illegal drugs.  The 
  family was abducted as part of a scheme to force Lok to come forward and to 
  extract a ransom from the victims’ family in China.  The appellants testified 
  and acknowledged their involvement in the abduction.  They claimed that their 
  participation in the kidnappings and confinement came about as a result of threats 
  of violence against themselves and their families by Tsang.  Tsang was a “Snakehead”, 
  a member of the criminal organization that had smuggled the appellants out of 
  China.  The appellants were indebted to the Snakeheads, and testified that Tsang 
  had forced them to participate in the abduction and had agreed to forgive their 
  debts in return.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was not disputed at trial that the appellants had many opportunities 
  to escape, both before and throughout the period of the captivity.  On November 
  24, the date when the kidnapping began, the appellants Li and Liu were staying 
  in an apartment provided by Tsang.  Tsang approached them and stated that he 
  wanted them to participate in a kidnapping.  No detailed plans were discussed.  
  While these appellants claimed they were threatened if they did not participate, 
  it was undisputed that Tsang left the two alone for a period of up to an hour 
  and a half to think it over.  They could have escaped at that time.  Instead 
  of escaping while Tsang was away or contacting the police, they agreed to participate 
  in the kidnapping.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In addition, it was not disputed that Tsang was in another car 
  and was not present when the appellants were transporting the hostages in the 
  van.  It was open to the appellants at that time to escape with or without the 
  van, either with the hostages or after releasing them. The treatment of the 
  bound and gagged Mrs. Kong borders on the heartless.  A simple anonymous telephone 
  call to the police would have secured her early release.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For nearly the entire three weeks of their confinement, the only 
  people present in the apartment with the hostages were the appellants, and an 
  unnamed woman who assisted the appellants with cooking.  It was not suggested 
  that the woman prevented the appellants from escaping or contacting the police.  
  Tsang was away from the apartment most of the time.  After the first day of 
  the captivity, Tsang’s visits were only about one or two hours long, and he 
  was not present for the final days of the captivity.  <i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants had access to at least two telephones, one located 
  down the hall in the superintendent’s apartment, and at least one cell phone, 
  which was kept in the apartment during the captivity.  There was no evidence 
  to suggest that the appellants were unable to get access to the phones to call 
  for help, particularly at times when Tsang was not in the apartment.  Each of 
  the appellants had relatives in either the United States, Canada or China whom 
  they could reach by telephone if they tried.  The appellants each testified 
  that they knew the whereabouts of their family members in China.  Furthermore, 
  the appellant Chen admitted that he and Liu made phone calls to friends or family 
  during the period of the hostages’ captivity.<i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to the uncontradicted evidence of the appellants, they 
  were at liberty to go out when they chose, in order to run errands such as purchasing 
  food.  They each did so, either alone or in combinations.  According to Liu, 
  he usually took a couple of hours to do such errands.  He testified that he 
  walked from the apartment to Chinatown to purchase medicine for one of the hostages.  
  The appellant Chen returned home at one point to get a change of clothing.  
  On one occasion, Chen went out for the entire day from 10:00 a.m. until around 
  11:00 p.m. to celebrate a friend’s birthday.  This included going to a restaurant 
  and then to a karaoke bar.  Chen persuaded the appellant Liu to join him at 
  the celebration partway through, telling the others that Liu was his friend.  
  Chen drank until he was under the influence of alcohol, participated in the 
  karaoke singing, and had a good time.  Liu went home, leaving Chen with the 
  others at the bar.  When Tsang found out from Liu that Chen was at the bar, 
  he came to the bar, confronted Chen and assaulted him.  Only after this did 
  Chen return to the apartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The three appellants deliberately entered Canada illegally.  
  Each freely and knowingly contracted with the Chinese smuggling operation, loosely 
  called the Snakeheads, to bring them to North America in exchange for money.  
  Each knowingly did not pay the full fee to the Snakeheads in advance.  Each 
  knew that on arriving in North America, they would owe the balance to the Snakeheads.  
  Liu claimed that he had previously availed himself of the Snakeheads’ services 
  to gain illegal entry to the U.S. four years before this offence, worked off 
  his debt to them, and opted to return to China.  In 1994, he then freely chose 
  to use the Snakeheads’ services again to return to North America.  There is 
  no suggestion on this record that the appellants were not aware of the nature 
  of the organization they hired to assist them and that those belonging to it 
  were not the sort of people to be trifled with when they sought payment for 
  their services. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants each testified that they did not want to participate 
  in this kidnapping.  They said that Tsang, whom they had not met until after 
  arriving here, forced them to do so, and that he had threatened them or their 
  families in China or elsewhere if they did not participate or if they escaped 
  or notified the police.  Each also testified that Tsang demanded their involvement 
  in this kidnapping because of their outstanding debt.  Tsang told each that 
  their debt would be forgiven if they participated in the kidnapping.  Li also 
  testified that the Snakeheads had been holding his wife for two years, and that 
  she would be released if he participated in this kidnapping.  While each appellant 
  claimed that he participated in this kidnapping due to these threats, they also 
  admitted in substance that they did so because of the debt they owed to the 
  Snakeheads.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The defence at trial was that the appellants were entitled to 
  be excused because they committed the crimes with which they were charged (kidnapping) 
  under compulsion of threats of death or immediate bodily harm to themselves 
  or their families.  This is the defence of duress that the appellants said was 
  available to them on the facts of this case.  It is codified in s. 17 of the 
  <i>Criminal Code</i> as follows:<b> </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>17.  A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate 
      death or bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed 
      is excused for committing the offence if the person believes that the threats 
      will be carried out and if the person is not a party to a conspiracy or 
      association whereby the person is subject to compulsion, but this section 
      does not apply where the offence that is committed is high treason or treason, 
      murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault, sexual assault with a 
      weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, aggravated sexual 
      assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault with a weapon 
      or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing  bodily harm, 
      arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and detention of 
      young persons).</p>

        for the purpose of this submission I accept that proposition.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>After reviewing the evidence the trial judge concluded:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span
lang=EN-US>This is the most clear case of an obvious means of escape that I can 
        think of and accordingly it seems to me that the case is crystal clear

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> Upon the completion of the evidence, in the absence of the jury, 
  the trial judge inquired as to the status of the constitutional challenge to 
  s. 17 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It was the position of the defence that 
  if the common law defence of duress was not available on the evidence, there 
  would be no point in proceeding with the constitutional challenge. </p>

  </span></span> On October 12 and 13, 2000, this appeal was argued before a differently 
  constituted panel of this Court.  In the course of the respondent Crown’s submissions, 
  the Court directed that the appeal be adjourned and rescheduled following the 
  release of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Ruzic</i> 
  [since released (2001), 153 C.C.C. (3d) 1].  The Court invited the parties to 
  reconsider their positions regarding the availability of the common law defence 
  of duress “without encumbrances of concessions at trial”.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After listening to the full argument on this hearing I believe 
  that the appeal should be decided on the same basis as did the trial judge in 
  making his ruling.  He proceeded from the assumption, most favourable to the 
  defence, that these appellants had the right to invoke the more generous common 
  law duress defence, and not the more exacting statutory s. 17 duress defence.  
  He assumed, without deciding the matter, that kidnapping was not an excluded 
  offence.  As such, the judge considered the merits of the question whether the 
  common law duress defence should be taken away from the jury on this record.  
  He ruled that even on the more liberal common law duress defence, there was 
  no air of reality to the appellants’ claims.  Therefore, it is only necessary 
  on this appeal to consider the legality of that ruling.  The subsidiary issue 
  of the admissibility of questions relating to the Snakeheads criminal organization 
  need not be pursued if the trial judge’s ruling on a safe avenue of escape is 
  correct.  He was prepared to accept, as I am, that threats were made.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>R. v. Ruzic, supra, </span></i>holds that 
  s. 17 of the <i>Code </i>is unconstitutional in so far as it restricts the defence 
  of duress to circumstances where the threats are of immediate death or bodily 
  harm and the threatener is present when the offences are committed.  The common 
  law defence of duress does not include such restrictions.  The Supreme Court 
  did not deal with the exceptions to s. 17 in its constitutional analysis since 
  the offence in <i>Ruzic</i> was smuggling which, like kidnapping in the case 
  in appeal, is not an enumerated exception.</p>

  </span></span> The analysis in <i>Ruzic </i>is interesting in that it places 
  such emphasis on moral blameworthiness and moral involuntariness as an essential 
  component of criminal liability, a component that is protected by s. 7 of the 
  <i>Charter:</i> see the discussion by Lebel&nbsp;J. for the court commencing 
  at p. 20.  This conclusion is set out at pp. 26-27:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Although moral involuntariness does not negate the <i>actus reus </i>or 
      <i>mens rea </i>of an offence, it is a principle which, similarly to physical 
      involuntariness, deserves protection under s.7 of the <i>Charter. </i>It 
      is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary conduct – behaviour 
      that is the product of a free will and controlled body, unhindered by external 
      constraints – should attract the penalty and stigma of criminal liability.  
      Depriving a person of liberty and branding her with the stigma of criminal 
      liability would infringe the principles of fundamental justice if the accused 
      did not have any realistic choice.  The ensuing deprivation of liberty and 
      stigma would have been imposed in violation of the tenets of fundamental 
      justice and would thus infringe s. 7 of the <i>Charter. </i></p>

  </span></span> These appellants are not like Ms. Ruzic who was clearly innocent.  
  She was not involved in any drug smuggling when she was selected by a bunch 
  of thugs on the streets of Belgrade to be their instrument in bringing heroin 
  illegally into Canada under threat of death or grievous bodily harm to her mother 
  living in Serbia.  The act that she was charged with was the act that she was 
  coerced into performing by the threats.  Compare this with the appellants who 
  voluntarily approached a criminal organization and agreed to its terms for smuggling 
  <i>them</i> into Canada.  It is undisputed that these appellants knew they were 
  purchasing the services of the Snakeheads before they left China.  The appellant 
  Liu even admitted that he previously used the Snakehead services to gain entry 
  to the United States, and had returned to China before embarking on this effort 
  at getting onto this continent.  The appellant Chen testified that he knew the 
  Snakeheads were “smugglers” and that their activity was illegal in China, but 
  added that others use them and so it is perceived as legal.  The appellant Li 
  testified that he chose to use the Snakeheads to obtain passage to the United 
  States, despite its high price.  None claimed to be surprised on learning of 
  the nature of the Snakeheads organization, nor did any of them claim to have 
  laboured under some belief that it was a benign organization prior to availing 
  themselves of its services.  In fact, the defence at trial was eager to bring 
  forward as much evidence as they could as to how much of a sweeping criminal 
  organization the Snakeheads were, whether or not specific information was in 
  the appellants’ personal knowledge.  In evaluating the appellants’ claim that 
  they had no safe avenue of escape, it is important to take into account their 
  voluntary decision to get involved with the Snakehead organization in the first 
  place.  The two concepts are inter-related by the authorities.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In my opinion, the voluntary activities of these 
  appellants in approaching the Snakeheads for passage and illegal entry bring 
  them within a recognized exception to the common law of duress that Lebel J. 
  acknowledged in <i>Ruzic </i>at p. 34:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Like s. 17 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>the English jurisprudence has 
      precluded resort to the defence where the threats are made by a criminal 
      organization which the accused voluntarily joined and knew might pressure 
      him to engage in criminal activity. (<i>R. v. Lewis </i>(1992), 96 Cr. App. 
      R. 412; <i>R. v. Heath, </i>[1999] E.W.J. No. 5092 (QL) (C.A.)).</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The nature of this exception was explained by the English Court 
  of Appeal in <i>R. v. Sharp </i>(1987), 85 Cr. App. R. 207.  In <i>Sharp</i>, 
  the appellant agreed to take part in a robbery, but insisted that he did not 
  wish any weapons to be used.  The appellant said that he wanted to withdraw 
  from the conspiracy when he saw guns being taken along, but had carried on with 
  the plan under duress from the gang leader, who had threatened to blow his head 
  off if he did not participate.  In dismissing Sharp’s appeal, Lord Lane C.J. 
  said at p. 210:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>No one could question that if a person can avoid the effects of duress 
      by escaping from the threats, without damage to himself, he must do so ... 
      It seems to us to be part of the same argument, or at least to be so close 
      to the same argument as to be practically indistinguishable from it, to 
      say that a man must not voluntarily put himself in a position where he is 
      likely to be subjected to such compulsion.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>And later at p. 214, he concluded:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span
lang=EN-US>…[W]here a person has voluntarily, and with knowledge of its nature, 
        joined a criminal organization or gang which he knew might bring pressure 
        to bear on him to commit an offence, and was an active member when he 
        was put under such pressure, he cannot avail himself of the defence of 
        duress.</span></p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>R. v. Lewis, supra</span></i>, is a decision 
  of the English Court of Appeal in which the appellant, a felon convicted for 
  robbery, was held in contempt for refusing to testify against a fellow prisoner 
  who had beaten him because he believed, without foundation, that it was Lewis 
  who had given the police the information that led to the assailant’s conviction 
  for the same robbery.  Lewis said he was afraid of reprisals if he testified 
  about the assault.  In considering the availability of the defence of duress, 
  Beldam L.J. quoted extensively from the judgment of Lord Lane C.J. in <i>Sharp, 
  supra</i>, and then added the following qualification at p. 417:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-GB>In short, to preclude a defendant from relying on the 
      defence, there must be evidence which satisfies the court that the defendant 
      knew or was aware that he was exposing himself to the risk of threats of 
      death or serious harm if he did not participate with, or conform to, the 
      wishes of his criminal associates.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the <i>Lewis </i>case, the appellant’s assailant was also 
  his co-perpetrator in the crime of robbery for which they both had been convicted.  
  The theory of the Crown was that this was the association that negated the defence 
  of duress.  The appellate court said, however, that the violence directed against 
  the appellant in jail and the fear of further reprisals if he gave evidence 
  against his assailant was not so closely associated with his participation in 
  the robbery that it could be said that he exposed himself to this violence by 
  agreeing to take part in the original robbery.</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>R. v. Heath, supra, </span></i>is a case 
  in the England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) that is closer 
  to the present case on the facts.  The appellant was a heroin addict and had 
  become indebted to his supplier in the amount of 1,500 pounds.  The debt was 
  assigned to a very hard man who demanded immediate payment.  The appellant feared 
  violence.  As he said in evidence: “It’s the drugs world.  It can be heavy.  
  People collect their debts in one way.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The man offered a way to clear 1,000 pounds, leaving 500 pounds 
  outstanding, which the appellant would get time to pay.  The proposal was that 
  the appellant would collect a consignment of “shampoo” and drive it back to 
  Bristol.  It was made clear to the appellant that in reality he had no choice, 
  the man knew where he lived, and knew about his girlfriend.  The appellant hesitated, 
  but when he went to his supplier for more heroin on credit, he met the man again.  
  By this time the appellant knew whom the man was and that he had a reputation 
  for violence, including breaking legs.  Accordingly he made the pick up and 
  delivery of what turned out to be 98 kilograms of cannabis resin.  He was later 
  arrested.  At trial he raised the defence of duress but the trial judge refused 
  to let the issue of duress go to the jury.  Heath appealed.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Court of Appeal was not sympathetic.  Lord Justice Kennedy 
  canvassed the authorities including, interestingly enough, s. 17 of our <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  He pointed out that while the appellant was not a member of any criminal 
  organization or gang, he conceded that he knew he became indebted to a drugs 
  supplier and by doing so he put himself in what he described as “a bad position” 
  because in the drugs world “people collect their debts in one way”, i.e. by 
  threatening and on occasion to inflict serious violence.  Kennedy L.J. quoted 
  from <i>Sharp, supra, </i>and from specimen directions published by the Judicial 
  Studies Board as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>If someone puts himself in the position where he is likely to be subjected 
      to threats of this kind, he cannot escape conviction if he is subject to 
      threats.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Kennedy L.J. then dealt with another reason the trial judge had 
  refused to allow the defence of duress to go to the jury: the evidence of a 
  safe avenue of escape.  In dismissing the appeal he said at para. 31:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span>      </span>The evidence given by the appellant represented the 
      high water mark of his case in relation to the issue of duress, but it also 
      showed that for two reasons he could not rely on the threats which he claimed 
      to have been made against him as an excuse for his criminal conduct:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span>      </span>(1) Because, as he recognized, by becoming indebted 
        to a drug supplier (a voluntary act) he exposed himself to unlawful violence 
        – in the drugs world “people collect their debts in one way”.</p>
      <p><span>      </span>(2) Because, as he recognized, he had available to 
        him between 18<sup>th</sup> March 1998 and the day of the offence more 
        than one safe avenue of escape.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the basis of <i>Ruzic, </i>it must now be accepted that duress 
  can arise from threats of future harm, not just immediate harm.  It can arise 
  from threats to third parties, not only threats to the accused himself or herself.  
  It is not necessary that the threatener be present when the actual offence is 
  committed: see <i>R. v. Ruzic, </i>supra, at pp. 29 and 40-41.  However, there 
  must be a close temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened.  
  The threat must be a real threat affecting the accused at the time of the offence: 
  see p. 43.  The duress defence is assessed by a mixed objective/subjective standard.  
  It is available where a reasonable person having reasonable firmness, sharing 
  the same characteristics as the accused such as his or her age or background, 
  would have acted on the threats: see pp. 31-32.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, it is still the law that the duress defence is not available 
  where the accused has a safe avenue of escape.  In applying this defence, the 
  law does not require an accused to seek the official protection of police in 
  all cases.  The requirement of objectivity must take into consideration the 
  special circumstances in which the accused finds himself or herself as well 
  as his or her perception of those circumstances (<i>R. v. Ruzic, supra</i>, 
  at pp. 31 and 40).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Supreme Court of Canada recently decided 
  that duress is a subset of necessity in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Latimer</i> (2001), 
  150 C.C.C. (3d) 129. According to <i>Latimer,</i> at pp. 143-144,<i> </i>necessity 
  requires three ingredients. First, there must be an urgent situation of clear 
  and imminent peril or danger that is virtually certain to occur. In this regard, 
  the Court said at p. 144: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Where the situation of peril clearly should have been foreseen and 
      avoided, an accused person cannot reasonably claim any immediate peril.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Second, the accused must have had no reasonable 
  legal alternative to the course of action undertaken.  This involves a realistic 
  appreciation of the available alternatives.  Third, viewed objectively, there 
  must be proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.  The 
  harm avoided must be either comparable to, or clearly greater than, the harm 
  inflicted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As can be seen, the Supreme Court recognized the juxtaposition 
  between a safe avenue of escape and the voluntary assumption of the risk in 
  the first place.  Both are front and centre in the case in appeal.  In considering 
  the appellants’ claim that calling the local police would have been ineffective 
  because they not only feared for themselves but also for their families in China 
  and elsewhere, the court should be reminded of their initiative in approaching 
  the Snakeheads in the first place, and the fact that the threats of retaliation 
  against them and their families was sweetened by the inducement of retiring 
  their debts to this organization.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There must be an air of reality to the defence of duress before 
  the trial judge can permit it to be considered by the jury:  see <i>Ruzic </i>at 
  p. 44.  However, where as here the proposition put forward by the appellants 
  is that they freely and without coercion placed themselves in the clutches of 
  their alleged tormentors, it would be a mockery of justice to place the issue 
  of the validity of the duress issue before the jury.  We have a matter of policy 
  here.  The appellants made a deal with the devil and say that they had no alternative 
  than to honour it.  They ask this court to place their safety above the liberty 
  and security of their innocent victims and thus encourage the Snakeheads to 
  continue their campaign of extortion through the agency of persons similarly 
  situated to the appellants. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants made no serious attempt to stand up to their oppressors, 
  if such they were.  They had ample opportunity to thwart Tsang both before and 
  after he asked them to participate in these crimes.  Their failure to seek a 
  safe haven gives rise to no innocent explanation.  It is more consistent with 
  the carrying out of their original agreement with the Snakeheads than it is 
  with succumbing to fear of the organization.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally there is the issue of proportionality.  This is not <i>Ruzic</i> 
  where a woman smuggled some drugs to spare her mother a beating or worse.  The 
  appellants ask to be excused from the consequences of their criminal conduct 
  because they feared for the safety of their families and themselves.  But what 
  about the family of three that they kidnapped and held for 22 days for ransom 
  and the woman they bound and left chained to a pipe.   Should the jury really 
  be asked to weigh the victims’ terror in the scales of justice against the fears 
  of the appellants and determine on that basis alone if the appellants should 
  be punished? </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my opinion the trial judge was correct in his ruling that 
  there was no air of reality to the defence of duress in this case.  He limited 
  his reasons to the presence of a means of escape but he could have justified 
  this decision on broader grounds.</p>
