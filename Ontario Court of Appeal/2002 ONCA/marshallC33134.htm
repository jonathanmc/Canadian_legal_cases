<p class=MsoFooter>On appeal from judgment of Justice Lynda C. Templeton, with 
  a jury, dated October 27, 1999.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b>LASKIN J.A.:</b></p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.            INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span

  </span> In December 1994 the appellant Watson Wyatt &amp; Co., a human resources 
  consulting firm, hired the respondent Shirley Marshall to head its organizational 
  communications practice in Canada.  A year later Watson Wyatt fired her.  Ms. 
  Marshall sued for wrongful dismissal and Watson Wyatt defended by alleging it 
  had just cause, an allegation it abandoned shortly before trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The case was tried before a jury, which awarded Ms. Marshall damages 
  of $516,242.82.  The jury found that Watson Wyatt was obligated to pay Ms. Marshall 
  compensation equivalent to twelve months’ notice – consisting of a nine month 
  reasonable notice period and a further three months for bad faith conduct in 
  the way it dismissed her.  The jury also awarded punitive damages of $75,000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Watson Wyatt appeals most aspects of the jury’s award.  It makes six 
  submissions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.          The jury’s award of nine months’ notice was unreasonable.</p>
    <p> 2.          The trial judge erred by refusing to permit Watson Wyatt to 
      lead evidence to show that Ms. Marshall’s compensation did not include revenues 
      generated by its Montreal office.</p>
    <p> 3.          The jury’s finding that Ms. Marshall’s base salary for the 
      year beginning July 1, 1996 was $225,000 contradicted the written terms 
      of her employment contract.</p>
    <p> 4.          The jury erred by awarding Ms. Marshall a $45,000 bonus after 
      it had found that the bonus was not payable.</p>
    <p> 5.          The jury’s award of a three month extension of the notice 
      period based on <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 
      701 should be set aside because of inadequate instructions to the jury and 
      the lack of conduct justifying the extension.</p>
    <p> 6.          The jury’s award of $75,000 in punitive damages should also 
      be set aside because of inadequate instructions and a failure to meet the 
      requirements for such an award.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>For the reasons that follow I would 
  allow part of the appeal by giving effect to submissions 2 and 6.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            BACKGROUND FACTS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Marshall is a communications consultant.  Before being hired by 
  Watson Wyatt, she worked for Towers Perrin for eight years as a senior consultant.  
  By the summer of 1994 she was “up for partnership” with Towers Perrin.  Around 
  the same time a search firm acting for Watson Wyatt asked to meet with her.  
  She declined.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Later in the fall of 1994 she decided not to pursue a partnership in 
  Towers Perrin.  Instead she called the search firm and asked to meet with its 
  representatives and their client.  By mid-November 1994, she had met with three 
  senior employees of Watson Wyatt, all of whom indicated a desire to hire her.  
  She was also being pursued by another company, the Juran Institute, which orally 
  offered her a position.  On November 16, 1994, Towers Perrin terminated her 
  employment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Marshall then had to decide between the Juran Institute and Watson 
  Wyatt.  The Juran offer was for $140,000 base salary, a percentage of sales, 
  and “other perks”.  She disclosed this offer to Ian Durrell, Watson Wyatt’s 
  Director for Canada and managing consultant for its Toronto office, who said 
  he would offer her an equity position, which Juran had not done, and a future 
  role internationally.  He said that Watson Wyatt’s new business direction would 
  bring her practice area to the forefront of the company’s business.  She decided 
  to accept Watson Wyatt’s offer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On December 22, 1994, Ms. Marshall and Watson Wyatt signed two letter 
  agreements – one dated December 8, 1994 and the other dated December 9, 1994 
  – setting out the basic terms of her employment. Her claim is based on these 
  two letters and a few other terms that she says were agreed to orally.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Marshall was given the title of Director of Organizational Communications 
  Practice Canada.  She was told to focus on setting up the Toronto office but 
  was also given responsibility for Watson Wyatt’s Montreal office, and later 
  for the company’s offices in Western Canada.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the first stage of her employment, which the jury found covered 
  the 18 month period January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996, Ms. Marshall was to be 
  paid a base salary of $120,000 “plus 10% of revenue generated directly and indirectly” 
  through her efforts and earned during the period.  Under the letter agreements, 
  this 10% of revenue was called Ms. Marshall’s “compensable revenue”.  For the 
  next stage of her employment. covering the period July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1997, 
  Ms. Marshall was to be paid a minimum base salary of $140,000, which could be 
  increased depending on her compensable revenue (or “initial year revenues”) 
  during the previous 18 months, plus a discretionary bonus up to a maximum of 
  40% of her base salary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Marshall started working for Watson Wyatt at the beginning of January 
  1995.   From mid-October to early December 1995 she was away from the office 
  with pneumonia.  She then took three weeks’ vacation, returning to the office 
  on January 8, 1996.  She was fired that day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By the time of trial, Watson Wyatt no longer disputed its liability 
  to Ms. Marshall.  Damages alone were in issue.  The jury assessed Ms. Marshall’s 
  damages by answering 14 questions.  They found that Watson Wyatt owed Ms. Marshall 
  $143,165.82 in compensable revenue for the first stage of her employment, $298,049 
  on account of her dismissal, which included a bonus of $45,000, and $75,000 
  in punitive damages for a total award of $516,214.82.  The amount awarded for 
  compensable revenue earned before she was fired is not in issue in this appeal.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>C.        THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before dealing with the six submissions raised by Watson Wyatt, I will 
  briefly discuss three general considerations that have a bearing on the outcome 
  of this appeal.  First, this was a jury trial, which means that an appellate 
  court is justified in intervening only if the jury’s verdict was “plainly unreasonable”.  
  In <i>McKinley v. BC Tel</i> (2001), 200 D.L.R. (4th) 385, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada recently reaffirmed the reasonableness standard of review for jury 
  verdicts in wrongful dismissal cases.  Iacobucci J. wrote at paras. 59&#8209;60:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This Court has repeatedly used a test of “reasonableness” when considering 
      whether to set aside a jury’s verdict.  In <i>Vancouver-Fraser Park District, 
      </i>[[1975] 2 S.C.R. 831], at p.&nbsp;839, de Grandpré J. held that while 
      jury verdicts must be treated with considerable respect and be accorded 
      great weight, they should not be regarded with awe.  Rather, where it is 
      found that the evidence “did not permit a jury acting judicially to reach 
      the conclusion” that it did, an appellate court is entitled to set it aside.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, in <i>McCannell v. McLean</i>, [1937] S.C.R. 
      341, [1937] 2 D.L.R. 639, Duff C.J. stated the reasonableness test as follows 
      at p. 343:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span lang=EN-US>[T]he verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against 
          the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust 
          as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole 
          and acting judicially could have reached it.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition, an appellate court that finds there was “no evidence” supporting 
      a particular verdict has “the right and the duty” to set aside that verdict 
      (see <i>Gray Coach Lines Ltd. v. Payne</i>, [1945] S.C.R. 614, at p. 618, 
      [1945] 4 D.L.R. 145).  Although these two tests are distinct, in neither 
      case may the appellate court set aside a verdict on “mere doubts [it] may 
      entertain” or on its “reaching on the reading of the evidence a conclusion 
      different from that the jury reached” (see <i>Scotland v. Canadian Cartridge 
      Co.</i> (1919), 59 S.C.R. 471, at p. 477,<i> </i>50 D.L.R. 666, <i>per</i> 
      Davies C.J.).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second general consideration is that in a civil case s. 134(6) of 
  the <i>Courts of Justice Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, precludes this court 
  from ordering a new trial “unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice 
  has occurred”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third general consideration concerns the effect of a party’s failure 
  to object to the trial judge’s charge to the jury or to some other aspect of 
  the trial proceedings.  Although the failure to object at a civil trial is not 
  always fatal to a party’s position on appeal, an appellate court is entitled 
  to give it considerable weight, indeed ordinarily more weight than the failure 
  to object at a criminal trial.  In most civil cases where a party’s failure 
  to object is in issue, the appellant seeks a new trial because of the alleged 
  error.  For this reason, civil cases on the failure to object have typically 
  focused on the question of whether a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice 
  has occurred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even apart from the question whether a new trial should be ordered, 
  however, a party in a civil case generally should not bring an appeal on the 
  basis of some aspect of the trial proceeding to which it did not object.  For 
  example, if no objection is made to the admissibility of evidence in a civil 
  trial, an objection on appeal will usually be unsuccessful:  see Sopinka, Lederman 
  &amp;Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada,</i> 2nd. Ed. (1999), at p. 47.  
  Similarly, an objection to the charge to the jury in a civil case will generally 
  be unsuccessful if raised for the first time on appeal.  Thus, this court has 
  held that where a party on appeal argues non-direction of the jury “in civil 
  cases, failure to object … is usually fatal”, <i>G.K. v. D.K. </i>(1999), 122 
  O.A.C. 36 at 42.  A failure to object at trial to an incomplete jury instruction 
  weighs heavily against a litigant bringing an appeal because “it is an indication 
  that trial counsel did not regard as important or necessary the additional direction 
  now asserted”, <i>Tsalamatas v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co. et al. (No. 2) 
  </i>(1982), 141 D.L.R. (3d) 322 at 326 (Ont. C.A.).  This court will relieve 
  against the failure to object only if the interests of justice require it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, both parties approved the trial judge’s charge before 
  it was given and counsel for Watson Wyatt did not object to the charge after 
  it was given.  Yet on three of its grounds of appeal – the reasonable notice 
  period, the “<i>Wallace”</i> extension and punitive damages – Watson Wyatt complains 
  about non-direction in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  In each 
  case, Watson Wyatt complains not about what was contained in the jury charge 
  but instead about what was omitted.   On a fourth ground of appeal – the jury’s 
  finding of an annual base salary of $225,000 beginning on July 1, 1996 – Watson 
  Wyatt questions the admissibility of Ms. Marshall’s oral evidence though it 
  did not object to her giving that evidence at trial.  I will now address Watson 
  Wyatt’s six grounds of appeal.</p>
<p> 1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <u>Was the jury’s award of nine months’ notice unreasonable?</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Marshall was entitled to reasonable notice of her dismissal and 
  to be paid compensation for that notice period.  Apart from the three months 
  extension awarded for Watson Wyatt’s bad faith, the jury found that the appropriate 
  notice period was nine months.  Watson Wyatt contends that this court should 
  set aside the nine months and substitute a period of two to six months.  It 
  makes two submissions:  first, the trial judge’s charge on reasonable notice 
  was inadequate; and second, nine months was unreasonable because Ms. Marshall 
  worked for Watson Wyatt for only one year.  We did not call on counsel for Ms. 
  Marshall to respond to these submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The first submission has no merit.  The trial judge instructed the jury 
  on the traditional factors that affect the notice period:  the nature of Ms. 
  Marshall’s employment, how long she worked for Watson Wyatt, whether she was 
  induced to leave her previous job or whether she was employed when hired by 
  Watson Wyatt, and whether she had enough expertise to not require further training.  
  The trial judge elaborated on these factors and set out the competing positions 
  of the parties.  But Watson Wyatt contends that the trial judge should also 
  have given examples of typical notice periods.  Examples were unnecessary.  
  Moreover, Watson Wyatt’s contention rings hollow in the light of its approval 
  of the trial judge’s charge in advance and its failure to object afterwards.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The more important question is whether nine months’ notice is excessive.  
  The reasonableness standard of review of a jury award dovetails with the standard 
  of appellate review of notice periods in wrongful dismissal cases.  As we said 
  in <i>Minott v. O’Shanter Development Company Ltd.</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 
  321 at 343-44:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Determining the period of reasonable notice is an art not a science.  In 
      each case trial judges must weigh and balance a catalogue of relevant factors.  
      No two cases are identical; and, ordinarily, there is no one “right” figure 
      for reasonable notice.  Instead, most cases yield a range of reasonableness.  
      Therefore, a trial judge’s determination of the period of reasonable notice 
      is entitled to deference from an appellate court.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>In short, an appellate court is not 
  justified in interfering unless the notice period fixed by the trier of fact 
  is unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, nine months’ notice was generous but not unreasonable.  Although 
  Ms. Marshall worked for Watson Wyatt for only a year, she held a senior and 
  responsible position within the company.  She was director of the organizational 
  communications practice for all of Canada, which at first included responsibility 
  for the Toronto and Montreal offices, and then for the offices in Western Canada.  
  She was the Canadian representative on the company-wide Canadian practice committee 
  and was appointed to the management committee of the Toronto office.  She had 
  17 professional staff reporting to her.  She brought a lot of business to the 
  company and generated substantial revenue in her one year on the job.  She was 
  hired in the face of a competing offer for her services on the promise of an 
  international role in Watson Wyatt’s business.  All these considerations demonstrate 
  that nine months’ notice was not outside of a reasonable range.  This ground 
  of appeal therefore fails.</p>

  </span> In calculating Ms. Marshall’s compensable revenue, the jury included 
  revenue generated by the Montreal office of Watson Wyatt.  Although Ms. Marshall 
  had responsibility for the Montreal office, Watson Wyatt contended that her 
  compensable revenue was to be calculated only on the revenue generated by the 
  Toronto office.  The trial judge ruled, however, that Watson Wyatt could not 
  lead evidence to establish this contention because of an answer given by it 
  on discovery.  Watson Wyatt submits that the trial judge erred in so ruling.  
  I agree with this submission.</p>

  </span> To put this submission in context, I will briefly review what occurred.  
  A representative of Watson Wyatt was examined for discovery in January 1999, 
  about nine months before the trial began.  When asked whether Ms. Marshall’s 
  compensable revenue should include revenue from both the Montreal and Toronto 
  offices, Watson Wyatt’s representative gave no answer.  Counsel for the company 
  undertook to advise Ms. Marshall’s counsel if Watson Wyatt did not agree that 
  the Montreal office revenues should be included:</p>

  </span> Although Watson Wyatt satisfied various undertakings given on discovery, 
  it never qualified this discovery answer on Montreal revenue.  But at the pre-trial 
  conference held in September 1999, Watson Wyatt filed a pre-trial memorandum 
  in which it expressly stated that Montreal revenues were not included in Ms. 
  Marshall’s compensation.  Then, at the beginning of October, Watson Wyatt’s 
  counsel delivered a witness statement to Ms. Marshall’s counsel reaffirming 
  the company’s position that Montreal revenues were excluded.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the beginning of the trial, both on a motion to strike the jury notice 
  and in opening to the jury, counsel for Ms. Marshall indicated that the inclusion 
  of Montreal revenues in his client’s compensation was disputed by Watson Wyatt.   
  Ms. Marshall was the first witness called at the trial and on her examination 
  in chief her counsel elicited evidence that her compensation was based on Montreal 
  revenues as well as on Toronto revenues.  But when Watson Wyatt’s counsel began 
  to cross-examine Ms. Marshall on whether the Montreal revenues were included, 
  he was met with the objection that his client’s discovery answer precluded questioning 
  on this issue.  The trial judge upheld the objection, ruling that Watson Wyatt 
  could not lead evidence contrary to the position it took on discovery.  Based 
  on the different purposes of pre-trial conferences and examination for discovery, 
  she found that “[n]otice within the format of a pretrial memorandum is not notice 
  in satisfaction of the undertaking”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Discovery and pre-trial settlement conferences do serve different purposes.  
  Yet it seems to me that, in ruling as she did, the trial judge took an overly 
  technical position and failed to take account of the knowledge of Ms. Marshall’s 
  counsel’s that the inclusion of Montreal revenues was disputed.  He had two 
  sources of this knowledge:  the statement in Watson Wyatt’s pre-trial memorandum 
  and the subsequent witness statement.  The trial judge was only made aware of 
  the first source, not the second.  Even so, from counsel’s argument on the motion 
  to strike the jury notice and from his opening address to the jury, it must 
  have been obvious that he knew Watson Wyatt did not accept the inclusion of 
  Montreal revenues in the calculation of Ms. Marshall’s compensation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Watson Wyatt should have corrected its discovery answer in a subsequent 
  letter to Ms. Marshall’s counsel.  But fairness should have been the trial judge’s 
  guide.  Although the purposes of discoveries and pre-trials differ, in the light  
  of what Ms. Marshall’s counsel knew, the trial judge’s ruling was fundamentally 
  unfair to Watson Wyatt.   Her ruling also ran counter to rule 1.04(1), which 
  requires that all rules be “liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious 
  and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits”; 
  and to rule 53.08(1)(d), which required the trial judge to permit the evidence 
  to be led unless doing so would have prejudiced Ms. Marshall or unduly delayed 
  the trial.  Ms. Marshall’s counsel claims to have relied on Watson Wyatt’s admission 
  that the Montreal revenues were included when he did not conduct further discovery 
  on this issue.  Yet any claim of prejudice is answered by his failure to request 
  further discovery even after the pre-trial and by his receipt of the witness 
  statement fully setting out Watson Wyatt’s position.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having concluded that the trial judge’s ruling was wrong, I am left 
  with determining the appropriate remedy.  A new trial is generally to be avoided 
  and should not be ordered unless the erroneous ruling caused a substantial wrong.  
  No substantial wrong would have been caused by the ruling if Watson Wyatt’s 
  position on the Montreal revenues had no merit.  But even Ms. Marshall did not 
  suggest that the company’s position was unmeritorious.  Thus, I see no alternative 
  but to order a new trial on this issue.  See s. 134(7) of the <i>Courts of Justice 
  Act</i>.  The parties agree that the amount of Ms. Marshall’s compensation attributable 
  to revenues generated by the Montreal office was $46,330.30.  I would order 
  a new trial to determine whether Ms. Marshall is entitled to this money.</p>

  </span> <u>Did the jury’s finding that Ms. Marshall’s base salary for the year

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The December 8, 1994 letter fixed Ms. Marshall’s base salary for the 
  year beginning July 1, 1996.  It provided in part: “If initial year revenues 
  (on an annualized basis) are at least $1,000,000, base salary will be $175,000”.  
  Ms. Marshall, however, testified that the parties supplemented this written 
  agreement by an oral agreement.  According to her evidence, the oral agreement 
  set her base salary on a sliding scale depending on her initial year revenues.  
  At revenues of $2,000,000, her base salary was to  be $225,000.  Her evidence 
  was not refuted by Watson Wyatt and was accepted by the jury.  The jury set 
  Ms. Marshall’s base salary from July 1, 1996 at $225,000, based on its estimate 
  that she would have generated revenues of $2,000,000 on an annual basis until 
  that date.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Watson Wyatt acknowledges that its agreement with Ms. Marshall was partly 
  written and partly oral.  But it submits that oral evidence on the amount of 
  Ms. Marshall’s base salary runs afoul of the parol evidence rule, which holds 
  that parol evidence contradicting the express words of a written contract is 
  inadmissible.  Here Watson Wyatt accepts the jury’s estimate that Mrs. Marshall’s 
  initial year revenues were $2,000,000 but argues that the December 8, 1994 letter 
  agreement unequivocally fixed her base salary at $175,000 for any amount of 
  revenues exceeding $1,000,000.  Therefore her evidence of a sliding scale of 
  base revenue conflicts with the parties’ written agreement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not accept Watson Wyatt’s argument.  Again, counsel for Watson 
  Wyatt did not object to Ms. Marshall’s oral evidence on how her base salary 
  was to be set.  Nor did he object to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury 
  that it could award a base salary greater than $175,000.  I therefore do not 
  think that on appeal Watson Wyatt can complain about the admissibility of Ms. 
  Marshall’s evidence.  Equally Watson Wyatt cannot complain about the jury acting 
  on this evidence.  Moreover, her evidence does not directly conflict with the 
  December 8, 1994 letter because that letter does not expressly preclude a base 
  salary higher than $175,000.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>

  </span> Under the terms of her employment agreement, for the 12 months beginning 
  July 1, 1996, Ms. Marshall was entitled to a bonus, at the discretion of management, 
  of up to 40% of her base salary.  The jury found her base salary to be $225,000.  
  Thus, she could earn an annual bonus of up to $90,000 and a bonus of up to $45,000 
  for the last six months of her notice period, July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996.

  </span> Watson Wyatt submits, however, that the jury’s award cannot stand because 
  it gave contradictory answers to two questions – questions 7 and 11 – and its 
  answer to question 7 must prevail.  Questions 7 and 11 and the jury’s answers 
  are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>7. After the period of time specified in the answer to question #1, what 
      fiscal year end bonus would Ms. Marshall have received had she still been

  </span> These two answers are not contradictory.  Question 7 asks what bonus 
  Ms. Marshall would have received “[a]fter the period of time specified in the 
  answer to question #1”.  The period of time specified in question 1 was the 
  18 months ending June 30, 1996.  The jury properly answered question 7 “Nothing.  
  Bonus not applicable” because, under the terms of her contract, Ms. Marshall 
  was not entitled to a bonus for this 18 month period.  Therefore I would not 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  </span> The jury found that Ms. Marshall was entitled to compensation equivalent 
  to 12 months’ notice.  Having first awarded her nine months’ reasonable notice, 
  the jury added a further three months’ notice because Watson Wyatt breached 
  its “obligation of good faith and fair dealing” in the way it dismissed her.  
  The three months extension is grounded in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision 
  in <i>Wallace, supra.</i>  Watson Wyatt argues that the trial judge failed to 
  adequately instruct the jury on the <i>Wallace</i> principles and that its conduct 
  did not merit extending the notice period.  I would not give effect to either 
  argument.  Before dealing with these arguments, however, I will briefly review 
  the duty imposed on employers by <i>Wallace</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Wallace</i> established that when an employer dismisses an employee, 
  it is obliged to deal with the employee fairly and in good faith.  Breach of 
  that obligation may be compensable by extending the period of reasonable notice 
  to which the employee is otherwise entitled.  Underlying the employer’s duty 
  of good faith and fair dealing is the recognition that employment relationships 
  differ from other commercial relationships because of the importance of work 
  to a person’s dignity and self worth and because of the power imbalance between 
  the parties and the corresponding vulnerability of the employee.  And employees 
  are most vulnerable and most in need of protection when they are dismissed.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Yet for many employees, the way they are dismissed is as important as 
  the fact of their dismissal.  Losing one’s job is traumatic enough; when an 
  employer compounds that loss by acts of bad faith and unfair dealing, the employee’s 
  self-esteem may be devastated.  Thus, in colloquial terms, <i>Wallace</i> is 
  a call for employers not to “play hard ball” with employees when dismissing 
  them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To ensure that employees are adequately protected, a court may extend 
  the notice period to compensate a dismissed employee for the intangible injuries 
  to the employee’s dignity and self-worth caused by the employer’s unfair or 
  bad faith manner of dismissal.  Although showing an adverse effect on future 
  job prospects would be a further reason for adding to the notice period, employees 
  may be awarded an extension even if the unfair way they were dismissed did not 
  adversely affect their ability to find other work.  I turn now to Watson Wyatt’s 
  two arguments on why the jury’s award of a three month extension should be set 
  aside.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Watson Wyatt submits that the trial judge’s charge on <i>Wallace</i> 
  was inadequate.  The trial judge instructed the jury on the employer’s duty 
  of good faith and fair dealing by quoting a long passage from the majority reasons 
  of Iacobucci J. in <i>Wallace</i> and by reviewing some of the evidence that 
  might support a finding of bad faith.  Watson Wyatt argues that she should also 
  have given some examples of when a <i>Wallace</i> extension could be granted.  
  I do not think this additional direction was required in this case.  The jury 
  understood the principle.  Both sides approved the charge before it was given 
  and did not object to it after it was given.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Watson Wyatt also submits that its conduct did not amount to bad faith 
  or unfair dealing.  By permitting the issue to go to the jury, Watson Wyatt 
  implicitly acknowledged an evidentiary basis for awarding a <i>Wallace</i> extension.  
  Thus, to set aside the extension, Watson Wyatt must show that the jury’s finding 
  was unreasonable.  This it cannot do.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The record at trial amply supports a finding of bad faith and unfair 
  dealing.  Although management told the human resources department that the reason 
  for Ms.&nbsp;Marshall’s dismissal was a corporate restructuring, in its statement 
  of defence Watson Wyatt claimed it had just cause to fire her.  Watson Wyatt 
  pleaded that Ms. Marshall “was insubordinate in her dealings with her superiors”, 
  that on several occasions she “wilfully disobeyed direct and specific instructions 
  from her superiors”, that she “was unable to deal properly, politely and effectively 
  with subordinates”, that she “did not succeed in achieving the level of performance 
  which was expected of her”, and that throughout her employment she “demonstrated 
  an inability to work as a team player, an inability to get along with her colleagues, 
  inadequate customer service methodology and generally unprofessional behaviour”.  
  Watson Wyatt maintained these allegations from at least the time it filed its 
  statement of defence in March 1997 until shortly before the trial began in October 
  1999.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition, Watson Wyatt refused to pay Ms. Marshall approximately 
  $80,000 in commission revenues acknowledged to be owing to her and delayed for 
  several months before sending her the record of employment required for her 
  unemployment insurance benefits.  Ms. Marshall testified that Watson Wyatt’s 
  conduct affected her ability to market herself and deprived her of money needed 
  to start her own business.  All of this evidence shows that a three month extension 
  of the notice period was justified.  Watson Wyatt practiced the kind of “hard 
  ball” the Supreme Court of Canada warned against in <i>Wallace</i>.  I would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>6.            <u>Should the jury’s award of $75,000 in punitive damages be

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to extending the notice period by three months, the jury 
  awarded Ms.&nbsp;Marshall $75,000 in punitive damages.  It found that the conduct 
  of Watson Wyatt was “so highhanded or egregious as to merit an award of punitive 
  damages”.  Watson Wyatt submits that this award cannot stand for two reasons.  
  First, the company argues that the trial judge’s instruction on punitive damages 
  were inadequate.  Second, it argues that Ms. Marshall has no legal entitlement 
  to punitive damages on the facts of this case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with these submissions.  The trial judge’s instructions were 
  inadequate.  And even if their inadequacy can be overlooked because Watson Wyatt 
  did not object to them, I have concluded that Ms. Marshall is not entitled to 
  punitive damages.  I doubt  Watson Wyatt committed an actionable wrong separate 
  from its breach of the employment contract and even if it did, punitive damages 
  would not serve any rational purpose in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Punitive damages are not compensatory.  Their purpose is to punish and 
  deter unacceptable conduct.  In Canada they have rarely been awarded in breach 
  of contract cases largely because the requirements to obtain them are appropriately 
  onerous.  To be entitled to punitive damages a plaintiff must meet a threefold 
  burden.  First, the plaintiff must show that the defendant’s conduct is so “harsh, 
  vindictive, reprehensible and malicious” or “so malicious, oppressive and high 
  handed that it offends the court’s sense of decency”.  See <i>Vorvis v. Insurance 
  Corporation of British Columbia,</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 at 1108; <i>Hill v. 
  Church of Scientology</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at 1208.  Second, the plaintiff 
  must establish that the defendant committed a separate or independent actionable 
  wrong causing damage to the plaintiff.  Although the requirement of an independent 
  actionable wrong does not easily explain some of the breach of contract cases 
  where punitive damages have been awarded and though it has been criticized by 
  several academics, it remains the current law in Canada.  See <i>Vorvis, supra</i>; 
  <i>Wallace, supra;</i> <i>McKinley, supra</i>, and <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance 
  Co</i>. (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 280 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. 
  granted, [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 157.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, even if the requirements of reprehensible conduct and an independent 
  actionable wrong are met, a trier of fact should only award punitive damages 
  “if the compensatory damages are considered by the jury to be insufficient to 
  express its repugnance at the conduct of the defendant and to punish and deter”.  
  In other words, punitive damages must serve a rational purpose.  See <i>Hill 
  v. Church of Scientology of Toronto </i>(1994), 114 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 70 (Ont. 
  C.A.), aff’d, <i>supra</i> (S.C.C.).   This last requirement is important in 
  this case because of the jury’s generous compensatory award, which was then 
  augmented by the <i>Wallace</i> extension.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge instructed the jury on the first requirement for a punitive 
  damages award – that Watson Wyatt’s conduct must be “exceptionally harsh, vindictive, 
  reprehensible or malicious” – but she did not refer either to the requirement 
  of an independent actionable wrong or to the need for the jury to be satisfied 
  that its compensatory award did not adequately express its repugnance at Watson 
  Wyatt’s conduct.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for Watson Wyatt did not object to these two omissions at trial.  
  But unlike the failure to object in connection with the other grounds of appeal, 
  I do not consider that the failure to object to the instruction on punitive 
  damages is fatal to Watson Wyatt’s position.  I say that for two reasons.  First, 
  an appellate court has a wider latitude to review a punitive damages award than 
  it has to review a compensatory award.  An appellate court is entitled to intervene 
  if punitive damages do not serve a rational purpose.  See <i>Hill v. Church 
  of Scientology of Toronto, supra</i> (S.C.C.).  Second, objection or not, the 
  plaintiff must be legally entitled to an award of punitive damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, even accepting that Watson Wyatt’s conduct was sufficiently 
  reprehensible to attract punitive damages, Ms. Marshall was not entitled to 
  these damages for either of two reasons.  First, I doubt that Watson Wyatt committed 
  an independent actionable wrong.  Ms. Marshall submits that the independent 
  wrong was Watson Wyatt’s failure to pay the $80,000 in commission revenue it 
  acknowledged owing to her for her work in 1995.  She contends that the failure 
  to pay this amount was an actionable wrong separate from her wrongful dismissal.  
  But that wrong was not independent of Ms. Marshall’s breach of contract claim.  
  Those unpaid commissions formed part of that claim and the compensatory damages 
  awarded at trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Still, I have considerable sympathy for Ms. Marshall’s position that 
  punitive damages should be available in breach of employment contracts cases 
  where the employer refuses to honour an admitted contractual obligation to pay 
  money.  Her position finds support in the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s 1991 
  <i>Report on Exemplary Damages </i>at pp. 97-99, cited in <i>Whiten, supra</i>, 
  at p. 292:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is at least one type of case of breach of contract where the arguments 
      in favour of punitive damages are compelling.  This is the case where the 
      defendant breaches the contract deliberately, and refuses or fails to tender 
      compensation known to be owing to the plaintiff.  This could be a case where, 
      without justification, the defendant fails to perform and does not tender 
      damages for the breach, or a case where the defendant declines to honour 
      a known contractual obligation to pay money.  Of course, the court would 
      have to distinguish between a true case of denying contractual obligations 
      known to exist, and a <i>bona fide</i> dispute over the existence or extent 
      of liability.</p>

    <p>The case for punitive damages in these circumstances is much the same as 
      it is in the tort for profit situation, and may be justified on both retributive 
      and deterrence grounds.  The fact that the defendant refuses to honour a 
      known obligation to pay money suggests that there exists some imbalance 
      of power in the relationship that makes it worthwhile for the defendant 
      to do so.</p>

  </span> Even if the Commission’s view satisfies the independent actionable wrong 
  requirement, and I doubt whether it does, a punitive damages award in this case 
  serves no rational purpose.  Ms. Marshall was awarded generous compensation 
  equal to nine months’ notice.  That nine months was increased by three months 
  because of the jury’s finding that the way Watson Wyatt dismissed Ms. Marshall 
  was unfair or in bad faith.  Undoubtedly the jury relied on much the same evidence 
  for both extending the notice period by three months and awarding punitive damages.  
  In my view, the overall compensatory award of 12 months’ notice – which included 
  a base salary of $112,500 for the second six months and a maximum bonus of $45,000 
  – was more than adequate to express the jury’s disapproval of Watson Wyatt’s 
  conduct and to deter similar conduct in the future.  I would therefore set aside 
  the award of $75,000 in punitive damages.</p>

  </span> I would allow the appeal in part by setting aside the punitive damages 
  award ($75,000) and directing the trial of an issue on the compensable revenue 
  awarded Ms. Marshall in connection with the Montreal office ($46,330.30).  I 
  would therefore reduce Ms. Marshall’s damages from $516,214.82 to $394,884.52.  
  Correspondingly I would reduce the amount of damages on which interest is to 
  be paid from $441,214.82 to $394,884.52.</p>

  </span> Before addressing costs, I would give both parties an opportunity to 
  make submissions in writing on both the costs of the trial and of the appeal.  
  These submissions should be delivered within 30 days of the release of the court’s 
  reasons.</p>
