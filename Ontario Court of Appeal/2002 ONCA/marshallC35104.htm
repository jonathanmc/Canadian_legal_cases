<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  8, 2000 (reported at (2000), 36 R.P.R. (3d) 153).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue on this appeal is the entitlement to a deposit of $150,000 
  paid by the respondents pursuant to an agreement of purchase and sale concerning 
  residential real estate.  At trial, Justice Keenan held that the respondents 
  were entitled to the return of the deposit, together with accumulated interest, 
  and costs on a party and party scale to November 3, 1998 and on a solicitor 
  and client scale thereafter following assessment.  The appellant, Bernard Place 
  Corporation, appeals from that decision.  It also initially sought leave to 
  appeal the costs award, but that request was abandoned before this court.  For 
  the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.            BACKGROUND</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On August 9, 1998, the respondents executed an agreement of purchase 
  and sale (the “Agreement”) to acquire a residential property situated on Bernard 
  Avenue in Toronto, Ontario (the “Bernard Property”) from Bernard Place Corporation 
  (“BPC”) for a purchase price of $1,510,000.  Following several counter-offers 
  and sign-backs, the Agreement was finalized on August 11, 1998.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents paid a deposit of $150,000 to the listing broker, Chestnut 
  Park Real Estate Limited, which held it for some months.  After commencement 
  of this action, the deposit funds were paid into court and the action was dismissed 
  as against the broker, on consent.  At the time of this appeal, the funds remained 
  in court accumulating interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Agreement provided for a closing date of January 29, 1999, conditional 
  upon the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This Agreement is conditional upon the inspection of the Property by a 
      home inspector of the Purchaser’s choice and at the Purchaser’s own expense, 
      and receipt of a report satisfactory to him in his sole and absolute discretion.  
      Unless the Purchaser/Co-operating Broker gives notice in writing, delivered 
      to the Vendor/Listing Broker on or before 3:00 p.m. Wednesday, August 19, 
      1998, that this condition is fulfilled, this Agreement shall be null and 
      void and the deposit shall be returned to the Purchaser in full, without 
      interest or deduction.  The Vendor agrees to co-operate in providing access 
      to the Property for the purpose of this inspection at reasonable times upon 
      reasonable notice given by the Purchaser.  This condition is included for 
      the sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be waived at his sole option by 
      notice in writing to the Vendor/Listing Broker within the time period stated 
      herein.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Schedule “A” to the Agreement provided, amongst other matters, that 
  the Bernard Property was being offered for lease during the conditional period 
  under the Agreement and confirmed that if BPC elected to rent the property prior 
  to closing, the respondents would have the right to approve the tenant and the 
  rental agreement.  The Schedule also set out the work to be done by BPC at the 
  Bernard Property prior to closing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When they entered into the Agreement, the respondents resided in New 
  York City.  It was their plan to return to Toronto in the future and, for this 
  reason, in August 1998 they were considering purchasing real estate in Toronto 
  with a view to renting the property until their return.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents inspected the Bernard Property on two occasions prior 
  to entering into the Agreement.  They were considering two renovations to the 
  house, should they acquire it:  creation of a rooftop garden area, which would 
  require a feasible water source on the rooftop, and the re-design of existing 
  garden patio doors.  No mention of either renovation was made in the Agreement, 
  either as a condition or as part of the work scheduled to be done by BPC prior 
  to closing, the latter as detailed in Schedule “A” to the Agreement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents promptly arranged for a professional property inspection.  
  The resulting inspection report identified various deficiencies relating to 
  the construction, design or condition of the house.  Some of the deficiencies 
  concerned inadequately or uninsulated pipes, ductwork and a crawl space area, 
  giving rise to the potential for the freezing of pipes, increased heating costs 
  and the need for installation of insulation.  In addition, amongst other matters, 
  the flat roof on the detached garage did not slope properly, raising drainage 
  concerns; the caulking on the roof and front door was described as “incomplete”; 
  a leak was identified in one of the washrooms in the house; and water damage 
  on the carport ceiling was observed.  Most of the deficiencies, according to 
  the inspector, could be remedied at minor cost.  The cost to remedy the leak, 
  however, could not be determined pending further investigation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Overall, the inspector described the Bernard Property as a “well-built 
  house”, requiring no major repairs at the time of the inspection.  On a rating 
  scale, the inspector assigned the Bernard Property a score of 7, denoting an 
  “above average” property, out of a possible score of 9.  He testified that a 
  score of 8 out of 9, which he occasionally assigned, signified a house which 
  was meticulously well built to the highest of standards.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents discussed their renovation plans with the inspector.  
  He informed them that arranging a water source for the proposed rooftop garden 
  would be disruptive and costly, involving extensive repairs.  In the inspector’s 
  view, the re-design of the existing patio doors would be similarly disruptive 
  and was “not a small job”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After considering the inspection report, the respondents decided to 
  rely on the condition by not waiving it or delivering the required notice that 
  the condition had been fulfilled.  Their agent informed the listing agent of 
  this decision on August 17, 1998, two days prior to the expiry of the notice 
  period under the condition.  They subsequently requested the return of the deposit.  
  When this was not forthcoming, litigation ensued in which the respondents sought 
  damages for breach of the Agreement by BPC.  The action was not framed in misrepresentation 
  or fraud, nor was any contract collateral to the Agreement alleged.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When she learned of the respondents’ decision, the listing agent, who 
  had represented BPC in the negotiations concerning the Agreement, sought to 
  be informed of “what elements have been revealed by the inspection report to 
  be unsatisfactory” and to discuss the inspection report directly with the inspector, 
  who declined to do so.  She also communicated with the respondents’ solicitors, 
  requesting receipt of a copy of the inspection report.  Her request was denied, 
  although a copy of the report was subsequently provided to BPC’s solicitors.  
  The  listing agent’s actions were fuelled by her belief that the respondents 
  were seeking to resile from the Agreement over concerns unrelated to the condition 
  of the Bernard Property. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the same day that the respondents informed the listing agent of their 
  decision to rely on the inspection condition, BPC accepted an offer to lease 
  the Bernard Property.  The respondents had approved the form of lease.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One month after terminating the Agreement, the respondents entered into 
  a new agreement of purchase and sale for another, less expensive property located 
  in the same neighbourhood as the Bernard Property.   While residing outside 
  Canada, they undertook extensive renovations to this second property, at a cost 
  of approximately $1.6 million.</p>

  </span> In <i>Greenberg v. Meffert</i> (1985), 18 D.L.R. (4th) 548 (O.C.A.), 
  leave to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1985), 30 D.L.R. (4th) 768, this 
  court confirmed that discretion under contractual conditions subject to discretionary 
  judgments (sometimes called “sole discretion clauses”) must be exercised honestly 
  and in good faith.  Both parties acknowledge this requirement, but  BPC argues 
  that it was not satisfied by the respondents.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> BPC also argues that in exercising their discretion under the inspection 
  condition, the respondents were obliged to act reasonably, according to an objective 
  standard.  The respondents argue that “reasonableness” is to be measured by 
  a subjective standard or alternatively, a blended subjective/objective standard.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Greenberg</i> and in <i>Canadian National Railway Co. v. Inglis 
  Ltd.</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 410 (Ont. C.A.) it was recognized that discretionary 
  contractual provisions fall into two general categories.  In <i>Greenberg, </i>Robins 
  J.A. stated, at p. 554:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Provisions in agreements making payment or performance subject to “the 
      discretion”, “the opinion” or “the satisfaction” of a party to the agreement 
      or a third party, broadly speaking, fall into two general categories.  In 
      contracts in which the matter to be decided or approved is not readily susceptible 
      of objective measurement -- matters involving taste, sensibility, personal 
      compatibility or judgment of the party for whose benefit the authority was 
      given -- such provisions are more likely construed as imposing only a subjective 
      standard.  On the other hand, in contracts relating to such matters as operative 
      fitness, structural completion, mechanical utility or marketability, these 
      provisions are generally construed as imposing an objective standard of 
      reasonableness: see generally, 4 Hals., 4th ed., p. 612, paras. 1198-9; 
      <i>Corbin on Contracts </i>(1960), vol. 3A, ss. 644-48; <i>Williston on 
      Contracts</i>, 3rd ed. (1957), ss. 675A, 675B; Hudson, <i>Building and Engineering 
      Contracts</i>, 10th ed., (1970), chapter 7.</p>
    <p><i>In any given transaction, the category into which such a provision falls 
      will depend upon the intention of the parties as disclosed by their contract.  
      In the absence of explicit language or a clear indication from the tenor 
      of the contract or the nature of the subject-matter, the tendency of the 
      cases is to require the discretion or the dissatisfaction to be reasonable</i>: 
      <i>Minister Trust, Ltd. v. Traps Tractors, Ltd., et al.</i>, [1954] 3 All 
      E.R. 136 at p. 145.  This construction imposes the least hardship in that 
      it produces a result that cannot be said to be unfair or unjust to either 
      of the parties.  Other things being equal, I think it preferable that provisions 
      of this kind be construed as implying the less arbitrary standards of the 
      objective test: American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Second: 
      Contracts 2d (1981), s. 228. (sic) [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under the principles articulated in <i>Greenberg</i>, the contract controls 
  the standard to be applied to a sole discretion clause.  The determination of 
  whether a discretionary condition imposes a subjective or objective standard 
  depends upon “the intention of the parties as disclosed by their contract”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The requirement of honesty and good faith applies whether the exercise 
  of discretion is measured by an objective or subjective standard (<i>Greenberg, 
  </i>at p. 554).  No contractual discretion is absolute, in the sense of authorizing 
  the capricious or arbitrary exercise of the discretion.  <i>Greenberg </i>confirmed 
  that even a broadly stated contractual discretion is not “unbridled” and is 
  subject to established limits.  Further, as illustrated in <i>Inglis</i>, even 
  where the operative standard of reasonableness is an objective one, it can only 
  be satisfied if the discretion or opinion at issue was “reasonably formed” in 
  the circumstances (at p. 416, per Robins J.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, absent express contractual language to the contrary, an 
  inspection report which identifies deficiencies in the construction or integrity 
  of a house provides an objective basis on which to assess the potential exercise 
  of discretion under a discretionary property inspection condition.  The intention 
  of the parties, as reflected in the language of the condition, then determines 
  the scope for subjective assessment of the materiality of the identified deficiencies.  
  The language of a contract may afford considerable latitude to a party seeking 
  to rely on a discretionary property inspection condition where an inspection 
  report provides objective evidence on which to base a decision that the deficiencies 
  identified in the report are sufficiently unacceptable as to warrant a decision 
  not to complete the transaction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, relying on <i>Greenberg,</i> BPC asserts that the respondents 
  were obliged to complete the purchase of the Bernard Property unless the inspection 
  report revealed defects of a nature that went to “operative fitness, structural 
  completion, mechanical utility or marketability”.  It argues that the deficiencies 
  identified by the report were minor and capable of ready remedy at minimal cost.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The inspection condition, as drafted by the respondents’ agent and accepted 
  by the listing agent, provided that the inspection report was to be “satisfactory” 
  to the purchaser; the purchaser’s discretion was described as “sole and absolute”; 
  and, the condition was for the “sole benefit” of the purchaser and could be 
  waived at the purchaser’s “sole option” in a stipulated manner. </p>

  </span> I agree that the language of the inspection condition in this case imports 
  a significant subjective element into the exercise of the discretion conferred 
  under the condition.  On a plain reading of the condition, subjective factors 
  relating to “sensibility, personal compatibility or judgment” (<i>Greenberg</i>, 
  at p. 554) are not precluded by words of limitation or exclusion.  Had it been 
  the intention of the parties to exclude such factors, it is not unreasonable 
  to assume that suitable qualifying language would have been introduced to the 
  condition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, it is also my view that the subject-matter of this Agreement 
  attracts elements of an objective standard of reasonableness.  The Agreement 
  relates to the acquisition of a residential property.  The integrity of the 
  property and its condition are matters which are capable of objective measurement.  
  As indicated above, this suggests that, in the first instance, objective factors 
  must ground the exercise of discretion under the condition.  If such objective 
  factors exist, the language of the condition will then establish what latitude 
  is given to the party seeking to rely on the condition in determining whether 
  the risks associated with the identified deficiencies in the property are acceptable 
  in the circumstances.  This determination must be reasonably based, and the 
  discretion must be exercised honestly and in good faith.  In the circumstances 
  of this case, therefore, the contract between the parties dictates that a standard 
  of reasonableness containing, first, objective, and, second, subjective, elements 
  governs the exercise of discretion under the property inspection condition.  
  It remains, then, to consider whether the respondents met this standard in relying 
  on the inspection condition, acting honestly and in good faith.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The inspection report identified physical deficiencies which could be 
  remedied at minimal cost; however, the true risks associated with some of the 
  deficiencies could not be determined at the time of the inspection.  In addition, 
  the report gave rise to the prospect of coping with the deficiencies, and effecting 
  necessary repairs, when a tenant was in possession of the premises.  These were 
  legitimate uncertainties and inconveniences which the respondents were entitled 
  to take into account.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence indicates that cost did not drive the respondents’ decision 
  to rely on the inspection condition.  Neither the purchase price of the Bernard 
  Property, nor the cost of remedying its identified deficiencies, was beyond 
  their financial reach.  Any doubt about this is dispelled by the fact that the 
  respondents subsequently purchased and renovated another property, the existence 
  of which was not known to them until after August 1998, at a cost in excess 
  of the entire purchase price of the Bernard Property.  There is no basis to 
  conclude, therefore, and BPC does not argue, that in deciding to rely on the 
  inspection condition, the respondents were seeking to avoid the Agreement in 
  order to purchase a preferred, less expensive house, or to escape repairs which 
  they were unable to afford.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In any event, the inspection condition was not tied to the cost of correcting 
  identified deficiencies, nor did it contain language of limitation regarding 
  the number or nature of deficiencies, or the materiality of any associated repairs,  
  that would support reliance on the condition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents commissioned the inspection report promptly after entering 
  into the Agreement.  Further, when it was in hand, they acted speedily, through 
  their agent, to inform the listing agent of their decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge held that the respondents’ decision to rely on the inspection 
  condition was “motivated by subjective considerations of personal compatibility 
  and was based on their judgment pursuant to the authority given to them in the 
  condition clause”.  In my view, there was evidence to support this conclusion.  
  He further concluded that the respondents met the requirements of good faith, 
  honesty and reasonableness.  I agree, for several reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the deficiencies revealed by the inspection report related to 
  the construction, design or condition of the Bernard Property.  The report thus 
  identified objective, physical factors concerning the structural integrity of 
  the Bernard Property.  While the evidence suggests that in deciding whether 
  to proceed with the transaction, the respondents also took the uncertainties 
  associated with their proposed renovations to the Bernard Property into account, 
  the inspection report detailed objective facts on which they were entitled to 
  and did base the exercise of their discretion under the inspection condition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, there is no evidence that the respondents engaged in the type 
  of collusive conduct at issue in <i>Greenberg, </i>as to establish dishonesty 
  or bad faith.  In <i>Greenberg</i>, unlike this case, the respondents were held 
  to have devised a scheme to divide a listing agent’s commission in order to 
  defeat his entitlement to commission after his employment had been terminated.  
  There is no evidence whatsoever of similar improper conduct in this case.  Further, 
  on the record before this court, the respondents were serious purchasers who, 
  prior to the inspection, did not have any intention to resile from the Agreement 
  or to invoke the inspection condition to avoid completion of the transaction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the inspection condition did not contain language which tied 
  it to the “operative fitness, structural completion, mechanical utility or marketability” 
  of the Bernard Property, as might warrant imposition of an exclusively objective 
  standard of reasonableness.  No concept of materiality was embodied in the condition, 
  either in relation to the cost of repairs or the overall significance of the 
  deficiencies.  Accordingly, once the inspection report identified objective 
  facts relating to deficiencies in the property, the expansive language of the 
  inspection condition agreed to by the parties permitted the respondents to assess 
  whether the risks, uncertainties and inconveniences associated with the deficiencies 
  outlined in the report were acceptable, according to their own subjective circumstances 
  and perspectives.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>(2)            <u>The Onus of Proof</u></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> BPC also argues that the trial judge improperly shifted the onus of 
  proof to BPC to demonstrate that the respondents had acted dishonestly and in 
  bad faith in deciding to rely on the inspection condition.  It suggests that 
  the failure of the respondents to afford BPC an opportunity to view the inspection 
  report, and to correct the identified deficiencies, renders holding BPC to such 
  an onus illogical.  These arguments, in my view, must fail.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found, rightly in my view, that the onus was on the 
  respondents to prove the Agreement, the inspection condition in the Agreement 
  and their right, in light of the condition, to call for the return of the deposit.  
  In its Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, BPC raised the issues of reasonableness 
  and good faith as a basis to disentitle the respondents to the return of their 
  deposit.  BPC also specifically pleaded the bad faith of the respondents in 
  seeking to rely on the inspection condition.  In these circumstances, there 
  is no affirmative obligation on the respondents to disprove an exception or 
  a suggested ground of disentitlement to the relief claimed.  As noted by the 
  trial judge, when grounds of disentitlement are raised, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… it is for the Court to examine all the evidence to discover whether it 
      discloses that the plaintiffs did not act reasonably, honestly and in good 
      faith and were thereby disentitled to the relief sought by them.</p>
    <p>BPC was obliged, if it wished to assert that the respondents had not met 
      the requirements necessary to support their exercise of discretion, to ensure 
      that all evidence upon which it sought to rely for this defence was proffered 
      at trial.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the respondents declined to provide the listing agent with a copy 
  of the inspection report upon demand, it is acknowledged that a copy was subsequently 
  provided to BPC’s solicitors.  The clear language of the inspection condition 
  did not provide for the participation by BPC, as vendor, in the inspection of 
  the property or in the decision whether the inspection report was satisfactory, 
  nor did it confer a right on BPC to remedy any deficiencies identified in the 
  inspection report to avoid reliance by the purchaser on the inspection condition. 
  Had the parties envisaged such rights for the vendor, or its agent, the language 
  of the condition should have so stated.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, the respondents sought relief 
  from forfeiture as an alternative ground of relief.  BPC argues that such relief 
  is not available in the circumstances.  For the reasons set out above, however, 
  it is unnecessary to consider this issue in this case.</p>
