<p>On appeal from the Judgment of Justice Wailan Low dated February 14, 2001 dismissing 
  the appellant’s claims.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These appeals arise from the distribution of the proceeds of 
  two estate-freeze trusts.  The plaintiff was named as one of the potential beneficiaries 
  in both trusts.  The terms of both trusts conferred on the settlor/trustee broad 
  discretion to divide the proceeds among the named beneficiaries.  Both trustees 
  exercised their discretion when distributing the proceeds of the trust to deny 
  the appellant any benefit.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the case of both trusts, it is clear from the record that 
  there has been a serious falling out between the respondent settlor/trustees 
  and the appellant.  In view of the terms of the trusts and the broad discretion 
  they confer upon the trustees, we agree with the motions court judge that there 
  was no triable issue that the respondents had committed a breach of trust in 
  denying the appellant any benefits from the trusts. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the Robert Banting Trust, the appellant submits 
  that there is a triable issue that the trustee committed a fraud on a power 
  by exercising his discretion as trustee so as to confer benefits upon himself 
  and another non-beneficiary, namely the Freeburne Banting Foundation.  It is 
  argued that it would be open to a trial judge to draw this inference from the 
  fact that on the same day Barbara Martin received her distribution, she immediately 
  gave a portion of the proceeds to the trustee and another portion to the Freeburne 
  Banting Foundation.  This argument was pressed with considerable force before 
  us.  However, the underlying facts are not clearly pleaded in the statement 
  of claim and the point was not pressed to the same degree before the motions 
  court judge.  We reject it for the following reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Assuming (without deciding) that there is a triable issue that 
  the distribution of the proceeds of the trust should be set aside on grounds 
  of fraud on a trust power, it does not follow that the appellant has an arguable 
  claim.  The terms of the instrument exercising the power clearly state that 
  the termination of the trust is to take effect <i>following</i> the distribution 
  of all of the assets of the trust.  If, as the appellant submits, the distribution 
  of the trust assets is void, and if, as a consequence, it were to be set aside, 
  the termination of the trust would also be set aside and the trustee would retain 
  the discretion to distribute the trust proceeds as he deems fit.  In view of 
  the unequivocal position taken by the trustee throughout, there is simply no 
  prospect that the appellant would stand to gain. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Given the nature and objects of the trust, there 
  is no serious prospect that a trial judge might accept the appellant's request 
  for the appointment of a replacement trustee who might exercise the trustee's 
  discretion in favour of the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant relies on the default distribution that is to take 
  place on the &quot;vesting day&quot; as defined by Article VIII (1)(2) of the 
  Trust Deed.  However, we are unable to accept the submission that the actions 
  of the trustee have brought about the &quot;vesting day&quot; that would result 
  in the default distribution to the appellant.  The trustee's termination resolution 
  made no reference to the vesting day.  We also note that Trust Deed clearly 
  stipulates that that the &quot;vesting day&quot; cannot occur earlier than 21 
  years after its execution which is December 9, 1996.  The termination resolution 
  was made on November 24, 1995.  While we see nothing in the Trust Deed that 
  authorizes the trustee to terminate the trust, we are unable to accept the appellant's 
  contention that the purported termination had the effect of invoking the &quot;vesting 
  day&quot; given these explicit terms of the Trust Deed. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It follows, in our view, that the even if we 
  were to accept the appellant's submission that the distribution of the proceeds 
  of the trust should be set aside, the appellant cannot escape the discretion 
  of the trustee who has made it clear that he will not exercise his discretion 
  in favour of the appellant. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, we would dismiss both appeals with 
  costs.</span></p>
