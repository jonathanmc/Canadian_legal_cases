<p>On appeal from the sentence of four years imposed by Justice D. Cooper on February 
  2, 2001.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On January 25, 2002, the appellant pleaded guilty 
  before the Honourable Mr.&nbsp;Justice Cooper to one count of robbery and one 
  count of robbery with a firearm (the Ancaster offences). On February 2, 2001, 
  Justice Cooper sentenced the appellant to four years concurrent on each count. 
  That sentence however, was made consecutive to a seven-year sentence the appellant 
  had received on August 2, 2000 from a different judge following his pleas of 
  guilty to charges of robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery and kidnapping (the 
  Brantford offences). The appellant’s co-accused, Joseph Boutilier, pleaded guilty 
  before a different judge to the Ancaster and Brantford charges and he received 
  a global sentence of seven years.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals from the four-year sentence 
  imposed by Justice Cooper. He does not quarrel with the length of that sentence 
  but with the fact that it was made consecutive, not concurrent, to the seven-year 
  sentence imposed on the Brantford charges. In that regard, he raises the issue 
  of disparity and requests that he receive the same sentence as his co-accused.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With the able assistance of Mr. Robert Goddard 
  of the Queen’s Correctional Law Project, the appellant has persuaded us that 
  the appeal must be allowed. We see no reason why the appellant’s global sentence 
  should be four years longer than the global sentence of seven years imposed 
  upon his co-accused Boutilier. The appellant was 18 years old and Boutilier 
  was 30 years old when they committed the Ancaster and Brantford offences. Both 
  men played equal roles in the commission of the crimes and both had equivalent 
  criminal records.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the circumstances, we think that if the appellant 
  had followed the same course as Boutilier and had entered pleas of guilty to 
  the Brantford and Ancaster charges before one judge, he would, in all likelihood, 
  have received the same seven-year global sentence that was imposed on Boutilier, 
  a sentence which Crown counsel endorsed.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal 
  and vary the four-year sentence imposed on the Ancaster offences by making it 
  concurrent with the global sentence of seven years imposed on the Brantford 
  offences. In coming to this conclusion, we wish to make it clear that Mr. Justice 
  Cooper is not to be faulted for imposing the sentence he did. The disparity 
  issue was not raised before him and the sentence he imposed was put forward 
  as a joint submission by defence and Crown counsel.</span></p>
