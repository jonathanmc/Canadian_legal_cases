style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was charged with committing a sexual assault on the complainant 
  in February 1993. On April 26, 2000, the jury found him guilty and he was subsequently 
  sentenced to five years imprisonment. He appeals from both his conviction and 
  his sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The sole ground raised on the conviction appeal is that the trial judge 
  erred in dismissing the appellant’s <i>Corbett</i> application and permitting 
  the Crown to cross-examine him on his criminal record. For the reasons that 
  follow, I agree with this submission and would therefore allow the appeal and 
  order a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Prior to the trial, the appellant brought an application to exclude 
  evidence of his previous convictions. All of the convictions were for sexual 
  offences: one in 1981 for indecent assault on a female; one in 1984 for sexual 
  assault; and one in 1986 for two counts of sexual assault and for two counts 
  of indecent assault on a female.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this proceeding the appellant’s defence was that the sexual intercourse 
  alleged was consensual. It was clear from the beginning that credibility would 
  be the central issue at trial with the complainant giving one version of her 
  encounter with the appellant and the appellant giving another. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s position on the application was that the prejudicial 
  effect of having this record before the jury would outweigh its probative value. 
  The Crown’s position was that without the record the appellant would have a 
  one-sided feature to his trial given that he would be putting his credit in 
  issue by denying the complainant’s allegations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After reciting the positions of the parties and quoting from the reasons 
  of Dickson C.J.C. in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, 41 C.C.C. (3d) 
  385 the trial judge dismissed the appellant’s application on the following basis:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>            I recognize that the presentation of questions with respect 
      to any criminal record has some prejudicial effect upon the person on trial. 
      <i>Because credibility of the complainant and the defendant will be a central 
      issue in the trial, I am persuaded that the Crown should be permitted to 
      cross-examine Mr. McFadyen on his criminal record for that limited purpose</i>. 
      I adopt the reasoning of the former Chief Justice Dickson in the <i>Corbett</i> 
      decision in stating that it is preferable to give the jury all relevant 
      information provided that the members of the jury are instructed on its 
      limited use. To prevent the presentation of this record in cross-examination 
      would in effect create a lopsided presentation of the credibility of the 
      complainant and the defendant. The jury can be properly instructed on how 
      they can use this information so that they do not make a leap of assumption 
      of guilt.</p>
    <p>            Therefore, I find that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial 
      effect of this evidence, the defence application is dismissed, and the Crown 
      will be permitted to cross-examine Mr. McFadyen on his criminal record. 
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court, the appellant does not challenge the trial judge’s charge 
  to the jury on the limited use they could make of the appellant’s criminal record. 
  However, he does challenge the basis upon which the trial judge determined to 
  admit that record in the first place.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I recognize that the decision made on a <i>Corbett</i> application is 
  a matter of discretion and that absent a clear error in the exercise of that 
  discretion this court should not interfere in order to substitute its own view 
  of how that discretion should have been exercised. See <i>R. v. P.(G.F.)</i> 
  (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 1 at 5 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, in this case the trial judge did make such an error. In 
  essence, he admitted the appellant’s record simply on the basis that the credibility 
  of the complainant and the appellant would be a central issue at the trial. 
  The <i>Corbett</i> process rather requires a weighing of the factors relevant 
  to the prejudicial effect and the probative value of the previous convictions, 
  against the backdrop that the general course of preference is to give the jury 
  all the information, but at the same time give a clear direction as to the limited 
  use they are to make of such information.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case the balancing of these factors requires that the appellant’s 
  record be excluded because of its very significant prejudicial effect and its 
  minimal probative value. In <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 498 at 
  516 (Ont. C.A.) Rosenberg J.A. said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>            [48]     In <i>Corbett</i>, while Dickson C.J.C. disagreed 
      with La Forest J. as to whether the record should be admitted, he accepted 
      the factors that should be taken into account in the exercise of the judge’s 
      discretion. Among the most important factors enumerated by La Forest J. 
      at pp. 740-44 are: the nature of the previous conviction, the remoteness 
      or nearness of the conviction to the present charge, whether it is a conviction 
      for a similar offence (in which case there is a greater risk of prejudice 
      to a fair trial), and the nature of the defence attack on the Crown witnesses.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The previous convictions were all at least 14 years old at the time 
  of the appellant’s trial. The fact that since his convictions the appellant 
  has apparently led a legally blameless life for a long period of time substantially 
  diminishes the relevance these convictions may have for his credibility.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, the prior convictions were for offences similar to the one 
  for which the appellant was on trial. The Crown does not advance them as similar 
  acts. The prejudicial effect of the appellant’s record is markedly greater given 
  that the convictions were for offences of a similar kind.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the appellant’s attack on the complainant’s credibility was 
  not based on any assertion that she had a bad character or a criminal record 
  of her own. There was no need on this score to balance the picture for the jury 
  as there was in <i>Corbett</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, all of these factors weigh against the admission of the prior 
  convictions. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court, the Crown argued that the admission of the record was 
  proper because the complainant testified that after her encounter with the appellant 
  he called her to apologize, saying that he had never done anything like this 
  before. The appellant denied making any such call.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the Crown’s argument is unpersuasive. While the appellant’s 
  prior convictions are inconsistent with his statement as reported by the complainant, 
  those convictions are of no help in evaluating his credibility at trial when 
  he denies making the statement altogether. Further, the accused did not place 
  his character in issue, so as to make the record admissible. It was the Crown 
  that chose to lead the statement. Crown counsel at trial did not suggest that 
  it could use the accused’s record to prove the statement was untrue and thus 
  evidence of consciousness of guilt. It was content to lead the “apology” as 
  an admission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, I am of the opinion that the trial judge made a clear error 
  in the exercise of his discretion on the appellant’s <i>Corbett</i> application. 
  In the circumstances of this case, particularly that they are such old convictions 
  and for similar offences, that error requires a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order 
  a new trial.</p>
