  </span></span> The applicant applies for leave to appeal the decision of Klowak 
  J. dismissing his application for an extension of time to appeal his convictions 
  for several summary conviction offences.  Johnston J. entered these convictions 
  on June 15, 2000 in accordance with guilty pleas.  The application for an extension 
  of time was filed almost a year later on June 12, 2001.  Klowak J. rendered 
  her decision on August 21, 2001.  For the following reasons, while leave to 
  appeal is granted, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant's difficulties with the law arise out of the deteriorating 
  relationship with his wife, Susan Dunn. Much of the following information is 
  taken from Ms. Dunn's evidence on June 14, 2000 at the appellant's trial. Ms. 
  Dunn and the appellant are both lawyers. They met at law school in 1992, where 
  they were both mature students. Ms. Dunn had previously been an officer with 
  the O.P.P. At the time, Ms. Dunn was in first year and the appellant was in 
  third year. Ms. Dunn was a single mother having one child Alexia (Aly) born 
  in 1990 from a previous marriage. The appellant and Ms. Dunn have a son, Sam, 
  born in 1995. They married in 1996. After Ms. Dunn finished articling, the family 
  moved to Orillia. The appellant intended to open up a law practice based in 
  their home. Ms. Dunn again took employment with the O.P.P. At the time of the 
  trial, she was an inspector.<br>
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The marriage did not thrive and probably by late 1998, Ms. Dunn 
  was intent on separating.  By the fall of 1999, the marriage was one in name 
  only.  She described the appellant as becoming increasingly angry.  His practice 
  was not doing well and he had begun to drink excessively.  The appellant also 
  made an unfounded allegation that Ms. Dunn had been sexually abused by her maternal 
  grandfather.  Ms. Dunn considered this particularly offensive.  She had been 
  very close to her grandfather who was now deceased and the appellant had never 
  met him.  The appellant made this allegation one week before December 13, 1999, 
  the date of the alleged assault.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to Ms. Dunn, the assault arose out of a disagreement 
  over how to deal with a nosebleed suffered by Sam.  It is unnecessary to go 
  into the details.  Suffice it to say that according to Ms. Dunn, the appellant 
  delivered a karate-type chop to her arm as she was struggling to leave the home 
  with Sam.  Prior to this the appellant was swearing and screaming at Ms. Dunn.  
  Ms. Dunn was able to leave the house.  She spoke to several people including 
  her lawyer and decided to lay a charge of assault. She also saw her physician 
  who confirmed there had been some type of injury to the arm.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was arrested for assault and released on bail with 
  conditions that he was not to communicate directly or indirectly with Ms. Dunn.  
  Ms. Dunn also obtained an order from the family court giving her exclusive possession 
  of the family home and custody of the children.  Eventually this order was varied 
  to allow the appellant access to the home and some access to the children.  
  To avoid communication, Ms. Dunn would leave the home when the appellant was 
  there and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Notwithstanding the conditions of his release, the appellant 
  left a number of messages for Ms.&nbsp;Dunn.  In addition, the appellant started 
  to contact Ms. Dunn’s friends and colleagues at the O.P.P.  In one letter, delivered 
  to a friend of Ms. Dunn’s, who was also an O.P.P. officer, the appellant wrote 
  about the alleged sexual abuse.  This letter was delivered on Christmas Day, 
  1999.  The appellant  also contacted the Children’s Aid Society raising apparently 
  unfounded concerns about Ms. Dunn’s treatment of the children. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms. Dunn contacted the officer in charge of the case to complain 
  about the indirect communication.  The officer spoke to the appellant about 
  his conduct but he persisted in leaving notes for Ms. Dunn.  The appellant was 
  eventually charged with breach of an undertaking for the period from December 
  25, 1999 to January 9 [later amended to January 10] 2000.  The appellant was 
  arrested on January 10, 2000 and later released on a recognizance.  It was a 
  term of his release that he not communicate with Ms. Dunn directly or indirectly 
  except through their respective counsel to arrange access visits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to Ms. Dunn, over the next month on some occasions 
  the appellant would follow her in his car or position his car so that he could 
  make eye-contact with her.  The appellant also hired a private investigator 
  who made contact with Ms. Dunn’s superiors at the O.P.P. and requested a meeting 
  with the Commissioner, two Deputy Commissioners and an inspector to “disclose 
  any relevant facts of which you may be aware” concerning Ms. Dunn’s “various 
  legal actions … and the background to the subsequent jailing of Mr. Menear by 
  Inspector Dunn on January 10, 2000”.  On February&nbsp;21, 2000, Ms.&nbsp;Dunn 
  was called in by her superior as a result of this letter.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On February 19, 2000, the appellant called the O.P.P. allegedly 
  to arrange an access visit with the children.  As a result of this call, he 
  was charged with breach of recognizance for indirect contact with Ms. Dunn and 
  arrested on February 24, 2000.  The appellant remained in custody until released 
  on a bail review on April 25, 1999.  During this time, the appellant sent letters 
  to his children.  The letters would have a cover sheet on them, apparently intended 
  to be read by Ms. Dunn.  An example is the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is a private communication between father and child.  It is not intended 
      to be a communication to Inspector Dunn in any way and it is not be used 
      as evidence in any legal proceedings, criminal or matrimonial, to further 
      any false, illegal or fraudulent child custody scheme or false criminal 
      charges.  I have intentionally written this not to try and ensure that my 
      children will be unable to read it.  It is included only to stop any invasion 
      of my children’s private communication by Inspector Dunn, the children’s 
      mother.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>One of the conditions of the April release was 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Not to write any letters to his children.  Access to children through the 
      terms of the family court order.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was a term of the family court order that the appellant have 
  access, supervised by his mother, to the children on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. 
  to 5:00 p.m.  On June 3, 2000 the appellant had a visit with Sam.  Aly was unwilling 
  to see the appellant and so had not been part of the access visit.  Ms. Dunn 
  came to a restaurant parking lot at about 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to pick up Sam from 
  the appellant’s mother.  While Ms. Dunn was getting Sam, the appellant’s mother 
  gave Aly a note from the appellant and told her to hide it from Ms.&nbsp;Dunn.  
  Ms. Dunn discovered the letter and contacted the police.  The appellant was 
  charged with breach of recognizance in writing a letter to his child.  He was 
  held in custody and was in custody when the trial began before Johnston J. on 
  June 14, 2000.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> By this time, the appellant had been charged with a number of 
  offences including harassment and watching and besetting.  The trial began with 
  the testimony of Ms. Dunn.  At the end of the day on June&nbsp;14<sup>th</sup>, 
  cross-examination had not been completed.  The trial was to continue on June 
  15<sup>th</sup>.  There was some discussion on June 14<sup>th</sup> about further 
  dates to continue.  That discussion was not transcribed.  The applicant claims 
  that he would be held in custody for a further 45 days for continuation of the 
  trial.</p>

  </span></span> Counsel agreed that the trial judge could rely upon the evidence 
  she had heard from Ms. Dunn, except that the appellant disputed one incident 
  when the appellant allegedly drove by Ms. Dunn and waved at her.  The sentence 
  was in accordance with a joint submission of one day jail (in addition to 65 
  days of pre-trial custody) and two years probation.   The other charges were 
  withdrawn. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was represented at trial by counsel.  He claims 
  that on July 13, 2000, he discussed with “legal counsel” the possibility of 
  an appeal but was unable to proceed because of non-disclosure to the defence 
  of an audio tape of the alleged assault.  The appellant repeated this allegation 
  before the summary conviction appeal judge and this court.  His allegation is 
  based on certain letters and an affidavit from the investigating officer.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In January 2001, the applicant filed an application for an extension 
  of time, which he abandoned “due to an inability at the time to proceed, resulting 
  from concurrent Law Society proceedings and family matters”.  It would appear 
  that the applicant was also pursuing a complaint against Ms. Dunn either in 
  the criminal courts or with the O.P.P., attempting to vary his probation order, 
  and pursuing various matters in the family court.  He claims that he decided 
  to renew his application for an extension of time when he learned that the psychologist  
  doing a report for the family court would not go behind the assault conviction 
  and make a different determination of the facts underlying that conviction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant explains his guilty pleas as follows.  He believed 
  that the trial would not be finished after the second scheduled date (June 15, 
  2000).  He also believed that he would not be able to get bail pending resumption 
  of the trial.  He therefore changed his plea to guilty to avoid being incarcerated 
  any longer.  It was important that he be released as soon as possible not only 
  so that he would no longer be subject to the usual consequences of imprisonment 
  but also so that he could at least maintain access to his son.  He believes 
  that his wife is intent on poisoning the relationship between him and the children 
  and it was critical that he be able to maintain contact with them.  He maintains 
  that he is innocent of the charges and has a good defence to them.  He concedes 
  that he understood the consequences of the plea, that it was fully informed 
  and he had the assistance of competent counsel.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF THE SUMMARY CONVICTION APPEAL 
  COURT</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In her reasons for refusing to extend the time, the summary conviction 
  appeal court judge held that the appellant was not entitled to “two kicks at 
  the can” and that it was not open to him to try and now raise arguments that 
  could have been made at trial. She did not otherwise deal with the merits of 
  the proposed appeal.  She also held that the appellant had not satisfied the 
  onus of explaining away his extraordinary delay in seeking an extension of time.  
  As she said, the appellant decided that other matters had greater priority than 
  pursuing an appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19] <span lang=EN-US><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As we understand it, although the appellant pleaded guilty to 
  four charges, he only seeks an extension of time to appeal three charges being 
  the assault and the breaches of recognizance on February 19, 2000 and June 3, 
  2000. <br>
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is no absolute rule to be applied in the exercise of the 
  discretion whether or not to grant an extension of time.  The court will, however, 
  usually consider the following three factors:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)   whether the applicant has shown a <i>bona fide</i> intention to appeal 
      within the appeal period;</p>
    <p>(ii)   whether the applicant has accounted for or explained the delay; 
      and</p>
    <p>(iii)  whether there is merit to the proposed appeal.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Depending on the case, the court may take into consideration 
  other factors such as whether the consequences of the conviction are out of 
  all proportion to the penalty imposed, whether the Crown will be prejudiced 
  and whether the applicant has taken the benefit of the judgment.  In the end, 
  the main consideration is whether the applicant has demonstrated that justice 
  requires that the extension of time be granted. In our view, the appellant has 
  not met the onus of demonstrating that an extension of time should be granted.</p>

  within the appeal period.  Although he says that he met with legal counsel shortly 
  after the sentencing, the nature of those discussions is not disclosed except 
  that the appellant states that he was unable to proceed with the appeal due 
  to the non-disclosure of the audio tape.  The alleged non-disclosure would not 
  have prevented the appellant from filing a notice of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> We also agree with the summary conviction appeal court judge 
  that the appellant has not explained the lengthy delay.  As she said, the appellant 
  chose to give priority to other matters.  The fact that he wanted to pursue 
  other issues and in particular complaints against his wife did not prevent him 
  from launching a summary conviction appeal.  Although the appellant is not a 
  criminal lawyer, he is a lawyer and had to realize that the longer he delayed, 
  the more remote his chances of being able to set aside his convictions.  </p>

  </span></span> Courts have granted an extension of time to allow an accused 
  to attempt to set aside a guilty plea notwithstanding lengthy unexplained delay 
  where there are unexpected consequences of the conviction and there is good 
  reason to doubt the validity of the conviction.  The appellant attempts to bring 
  himself within that line of cases and relies upon <i>R. v. Gaudreault</i> (1992), 
  76 C.C.C. (3d) 188 (Que. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Hetsberger</i> (1979), 47 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 154 (Ont. C.A.).  In our view, the correct principle is as stated by Carthy 
  J.A. in <i>R. v. Closs</i> (1998), 105 O.A.C. 392 (C.A.) at 394:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>It is my view that such orders should be made only in exceptional circumstances 
      where there is a real concern that an injustice may have occurred.</span></u><span>  
      </span>There are many negative consequences of having a criminal conviction 
      and it cannot be expected that these will all be explained to an accused 
      prior to a plea; nor should the convicted person expect the judicial system 
      to provide a fresh start when a surprising consequence of the conviction 
      is encountered.  We must have finality except where the demands of justice 
      dictate otherwise.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> In our view, there is no real concern that an injustice may have 
  occurred.  This is not a case, like <i>Gaudreault</i>, where there is a real 
  doubt that the appellant committed the offences to which he pleaded guilty.</p>

  </span></span> The evidence of the complainant, which it was agreed could be 
  applied to the guilty pleas, supported the assault conviction. There is no merit 
  to the appellant’s claim that a relevant tape recording had not been disclosed.  
  There is no evidence that Ms. Dunn had taped the events of December 13, 1999.  
  The documents relied upon by the appellant do not support this allegation.</p>

  </span></span> With respect to the charge of breach of recognizance on February 
  19, 2000, the appellant alleges that the police tricked him and that he had 
  no intention of communicating indirectly with his wife.  We do not agree.  This 
  call was part of a pattern of harassment by the appellant in which he attempted 
  to involve the complainant’s colleagues and superiors at the O.P.P. with the 
  obvious intention of embarrassing her.  The appellant’s true intent can be gleaned 
  from his opening comments to the officer taking the call where he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Oh yes, its John Menear calling.  I’m Inspector Dunn’s husband.  </p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Inspector Dunn has, I guess more or less, illegally obtained custody 
      of my children</span></u><span lang=EN-US> and I made a request through 
      my legal counsel on Thursday to see my children today and tomorrow.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>And I can’t call Inspector Dunn <u>because as part of bringing a false 
      allegation of assault</u> against me there is a non-communication order.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>And so I want somebody who had authority to phone Inspector Dunn</span></u> 
      and say have we made arrangements for Mr. Menear to come to take care…  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He had no excuse for calling the O.P.P.  As the above excerpts 
  show, he knew that she would be contacted by the O.P.P.  The recognizance made 
  it clear that any communication concerning access was to be handled through 
  the parties’ lawyers.  This was indirect communication, it was intended to be 
  so and on no fair reading of the transcript of the call can it be said that 
  the police somehow tricked the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> With respect to the June 3, 2000 breach, the appellant submits 
  that on the admitted facts no offence was committed.  He argues that since he 
  was entitled to have access to his children on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. and 
  5:00 p.m. he did not violate the condition when his mother provided the letter 
  to Aly just before 5:00 p.m.  In our view, this is not a proper reading of the 
  terms of the recognizance.  Those terms were as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Not to write any letters to his children.  Access to children through the 
      terms of the family court order.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The term that the appellant not write any letters to his children 
  was a separate condition.  It was clear and unequivocal and distinct from the 
  access condition.  The term was obviously included in the recognizance because 
  the appellant was using his opportunity to write the children to communicate 
  with and harass his wife.  The facts supported the plea of guilty and the conviction.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> One final factor favours dismissal of the extension of time.  
  The appellant took the benefit of the judgment.  He obtained the sentence in 
  accordance with the joint submission and the charges of harassment and watching 
  and besetting were withdrawn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To conclude, the appellant did not satisfy any of the standard 
  prerequisites for granting an extension of time.  He has also not shown that 
  this is an exceptional case where the interests of justice require that an extension 
  of time be granted so that the appellant can seek to set aside guilty pleas 
  voluntarily entered with full knowledge of the consequences and with competent 
  legal advice.</p>
