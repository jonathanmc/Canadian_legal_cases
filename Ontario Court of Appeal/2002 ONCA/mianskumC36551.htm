  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from conviction by Justice Douglas

  <h2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for sexual assault primarily 
    on the basis that the court should have intervened, either during the Assignment 
    Court process or during the trial, to appoint counsel to represent him because 
    he was not provided with counsel through Legal Aid.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We are not persuaded that in the circumstances 
    of this case, the court was obliged to appoint counsel as now suggested. The 
    record discloses that the appellant originally had a lawyer through Legal 
    Aid who had conducted the preliminary inquiry and had made appearances in 
    Superior Court on his behalf. However, because the appellant was uncooperative 
    with the lawyer and failed to provide him with the information he needed to 
    prepare and present the case, the lawyer was obliged to have himself removed 
    from the record. The appellant was personally served with notice of the lawyer’s 
    motion but did not attend court to respond to it. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As a result of the removal of the appellant’s 
    lawyer from the record, he was obliged to reapply for legal aid and was required 
    to provide financial information which, the record discloses, he did not do 
    fully. Eventually, Legal Aid determined that he did not qualify for legal 
    aid based on the information as to his family income that the Kingston Legal 
    Aid office had in hand. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following the removal of counsel from the 
    record, the appellant made numerous appearances in Assignment Court to have 
    a date set for trial. The record discloses that the Assignment Court judge 
    made every effort to encourage and assist the appellant to retain a new lawyer 
    and to obtain legal aid for that purpose. The record discloses that the appellant 
    did not file the necessary financial information with Legal Aid, that he indicated 
    at one point that he and his father would pay for a lawyer, and that he did 
    not diligently seek to retain a lawyer to act for him despite the numerous 
    entreaties of the court. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>When it was clear that the appellant would 
    be acting for himself, the court considered s. 486(2.3) of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Criminal Code</i> and determined that although 
    the section did not apply because the complainant was over the age of 18 years, 
    the court would order counsel to be appointed to conduct the cross-examination 
    of the complainant on behalf of the appellant. Although this was done primarily 
    to protect the complainant from direct confrontation with the appellant, her 
    alleged assailant, it also effectively provided the appellant with counsel 
    to conduct one of the critical portions of the trial from his point of view. 
    Furthermore, during the trial itself, the trial judge provided the appellant 
    with appropriate assistance and instruction and granted him indulgences as 
    required along the way. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also carefully considered 
    and addressed in detail on the mistrial motion any alleged unfairness to the 
    appellant for not having counsel provided to him. The trial judge noted in 
    his decision on the mistrial motion, that at the opening of the trial, after 
    he had reviewed with the appellant the entire history of the Assignment Court 
    proceedings including the appellant’s failure to obtain counsel or legal aid 
    and his indication to the Assignment Court judge that he would be representing 
    himself, the appellant did not request an adjournment in order to make a further 
    attempt to obtain counsel. The trial judge also noted that at the opening 
    of trial, the appellant was present with senior counsel who was there to cross-examine 
    the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With this history, in our view, neither the 
    Assignment Court judge nor the trial judge erred in failing to make further 
    inquiries regarding the appellant’s financial circumstances or those of his 
    spouse or as to whether Legal Aid was correct or incorrect in its decision 
    to deny him legal aid for the trial. Both judges made significant efforts 
    to assist the appellant to understand his situation and to take the necessary 
    steps to clarify his position with Legal Aid and to attempt to retain another 
    lawyer. We would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant also submits that the trial 
    judge made several errors in the admission of evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, he submits that the trial judge erred 
    in admitting the evidence of the Crown’s expert on aboriginal healing practices. 
    In our view, the trial judge made no error in the exercise of his discretion 
    to admit the expert evidence. In particular, because the second charge required 
    proof that the appellant was in a position of trust, community practices and 
    standards regarding healing were relevant. Furthermore, we are satisfied that 
    the expert had sufficient expertise to be qualified to give the evidence. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s third submission is that the 
    trial judge erred in admitting into evidence and relying on certain hearsay 
    evidence, certain opinion evidence and some bad character evidence of four 
    witnesses. In our view, while the trial judge may have erred in admitting 
    this evidence, the evidence was not significant and the error does not warrant 
    a new trial in this case. It is clear from the trial judge’s comprehensive 
    reasons that he considered the evidence as a whole in coming to his decision 
    and that he addressed all of the issues raised by the appellant in his defence, 
    including proof beyond a reasonable doubt, consent, honest but mistaken belief 
    in consent, and the issue of trust. To the extent that the trial judge may 
    have erred in taking into account Ms. Lentz’s opinion evidence, we are satisfied 
    that it did not impact significantly on his ultimate conclusion. We would 
    therefore dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
