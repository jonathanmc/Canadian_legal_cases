<p>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Backhouse dated June 25, 2001 
  and supplementary reasons dated October 29, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in holding that Mr. Misirlis' 
  conduct did not come within the &quot;intentional wrongful act&quot; exemption 
  in the policy. There are two components to this submission. The first requires 
  a determination as a matter of law of the meaning of the phrase &quot;intentional 
  wrongful act&quot; in the context of an exemption clause in an errors and omissions 
  insurance policy. The second requires a review, albeit a limited review, of 
  the trial judge's finding of fact that Misirlis did not intend to injure his 
  client, Phoenix.</p>
<p>
  [2] Counsel for the appellant submits that a deliberate act from which injury 
  is foreseeable constitutes an intentional wrongful act for the purposes of the 
  policy. We cannot agree. In our view, Lloyd's of London v. Scalera (2000), 185 
  D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) makes it clear that an exclusion clause such as the 
  one in this policy, is directed at intentional torts as opposed to acts of negligence, 
  even if those acts of negligence are deliberate in the sense that they are volitional. 
  The two cases relied on by the appellant from this court, Buchanan v. Gan Canada 
  Insurance Co. (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 89 and Godonoaga v. Khatambakhab (2000), 
  188 D.L.R. (4th) 706, do not assist the appellant. Neither suggests that conduct 
  which does not amount to an intentional tort can constitute an &quot;intentional 
  wrongful act&quot; for the purposes of an exclusion clause. </p>
<p>
  [3] In the circumstances of this case, Misirlis' conduct could constitute an 
  intentional tort if he intended to cause economic injury to Phoenix, or perhaps 
  if he was reckless as to that the result, when he placed the insurance with 
  the offshore insurer. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge accepted that an intention to cause harm to Phoenix or recklessness 
  as to that result could support a finding that Misirlis' conduct amounted to 
  an &quot;intentional wrongful act&quot; within the meaning of the exemption 
  in the policy. She concluded that Misirlis did not intend economic harm to Phoenix 
  and was not reckless as to that result. The evidence was certainly not all one 
  way. Aspects of Misirlis' conduct raised serious questions. We are satisfied, 
  however, that it was open to the trial judge to come to the conclusion that 
  she did. We can see no misapprehension of any material evidence nor, any failure 
  to consider material evidence. It is noteworthy that the trial judge relied 
  to a considerable extent on the evidence of a defence witness in coming to her 
  conclusion that Misirlis did not intend economic harm to Phoenix. Nothing said 
  in the submissions made to this court has convinced us that she in any way misapprehended 
  or overstated the evidence of that defence witness. </p>
<p>
  [5] This ground of appeal fails.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant also argued that even if it was liable under the policy, prejudgment 
  interest should run from the date of this action, 1996, and not from the date 
  of the underlying action brought by Phoenix against Misirlis. That action was 
  commenced in 1990. </p>
<p>
  [7] We reject this submission. The policy clearly obligated the appellant to 
  pay prejudgment interest on the judgment obtained against Misirlis by Phoenix. 
  Under the terms of the policy, that prejudgment interest could run from the 
  date the action was commenced by Phoenix. The appellant's obligation to pay 
  prejudgment interest was above and beyond the face value of the appellant's 
  error and omissions policy with Misirlis. </p>
<p>
  [8] In support of his argument that the prejudgment interest should have run 
  from 1996, the appellant referred to s. 132 of the Insurance Act. That provision 
  has no application to this proceeding. It is directed to a proceeding brought 
  by a third party against an insurer. This is a proceeding brought by the trustee 
  in bankruptcy of the insured against the insurer. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed on consent at $10,000.</p>
