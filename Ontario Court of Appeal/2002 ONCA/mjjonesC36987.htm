<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John C. Kennedy dated

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>FINLAYSON J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Douglas Henry (the “appellant”) appeals from summary judgment 
  ordering him to deliver to M.J. Jones Inc. (the “respondent”) the boat he purchased 
  from Bodden’s Marine (“Bodden’s”) or in the alternative, to pay the respondent 
  the sum of $46,000, representing its purchase price.  At issue is whether the 
  appellant is entitled to protection under s. 2(1) of the <i>Factors Act, </i>R.S.O. 
  1990, c. F-1. </p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In July 1999, the appellant purchased a Sea Ray boat from Bodden’s 
  for $46,000.  Bodden’s was a retail marine dealership that sold used boats, 
  some of which it owned outright, and others which it sold on consignment for 
  private owners.  The Sea Ray purchased by the appellant was owned by the respondent 
  and was at Bodden’s on consignment.  The respondent claims the sale required 
  its authorization, that it never gave that authorization, and that Bodden’s, 
  which is now bankrupt, never remitted the proceeds from the sale of the Sea 
  Ray.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As a result, the respondent brought a motion under Rule 20 of 
  the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>for recovery of the boat or its value.  
  The appellant brought a cross-motion under Rule 20 for an order dismissing the 
  respondent’s action and a declaration that he is the owner of the Sea Ray, free 
  and clear of all claims by the respondent.  The motions judge gave summary judgment 
  in favour of the respondent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For the reasons that follow I would allow the 
  appeal. </span></p>
<p class=headingtitle>ANALYSIS  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent’s position on this appeal suffers from a plethora 
  of self-inflicted difficulties.  The concessions it made on the motions below 
  are fatal to the arguments it advanced in this court.  Having conceded that 
  Bodden’s was acting as a mercantile agent, that the Sea Ray was at Bodden’s 
  with the respondent’s consent, and that the appellant was a purchaser who acted 
  in good faith, there is little left to argue about.  As discussed below, it 
  runs contrary to case law to accept the respondent’s submission that the sale 
  was not in Bodden’s ordinary course of business as a mercantile agent because 
  the appellant did not inquire into the arrangements between Bodden’s and the 
  respondent to determine whether Bodden’s had the authority to close the transaction.  
  Additionally, the arguments advanced in this court by the respondent can, if 
  successful, result only in a trial, a position once again contrary to the earlier 
  agreement between counsel that there were no triable issues on any parties’ 
  version of the merits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant relies on the concession of the 
  respondent (and accepted by the motions judge) that Bodden’s was a mercantile 
  agent within the meaning of the <i>Factors Act</i> and cites s. 2(1) of the 
  <i>Factors Act</i> to validate the transfer of title to him by Bodden’s. Section 
  2(1) states as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession 
      of goods or of the documents of title to goods, a sale, pledge or other 
      disposition of the goods made by the agent when acting in the ordinary course 
      of business of a mercantile agent is, subject to this Act, as valid as if 
      the agent were expressly authorized by the owner of the goods to make the 
      disposition, <i>if the person taking under it acts in good faith and has 
      not at the time thereof notice that the person making it has not authority 
      to make it</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span><i> </i>The motions judge proceeded on the basis 
  that this court’s decision in <i>Patry v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation 
  of Canada</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 370<i> </i>at para. 12 was applicable and 
  sets out the test for reliance on s. 2(1) of the <i>Factors Act</i>.  Applying 
  this test, the appellant need only establish that: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)            the vendor was a mercantile agent;</p>
    <p>(ii)            the vendor was in possession of the vessel with the owner’s 
      consent;</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(iii)           
      </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the 
      vendor sold the vessel to the purchaser in the ordinary course of its business 
      as a mercantile agent;</span></p>
    <p>(iv)            the purchaser had no notice that the vendor did not have 
      the authority to sell the vessel; and</p>
    <p>(v)            the purchaser bought the vessel in good faith.<span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All these conditions, save 
      (iv), are expressly admitted.</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Despite the concessions, the motions judge embarked on an analysis 
  that is largely irrelevant.  He found that it was clear from the Bill of Sale 
  that the agreement “was a consignment tract involving the purchase of a private 
  brokerage boat”.  He noted that dealers are required to collect and remit GST 
  on dealer-owned boats, and that none was charged or collected here.  He ruled 
  “[t]he defendant must have known that this was a sale of a privately owned boat 
  and that the transaction was subject to the owner’s confirmation and release” 
  and found the defendant “careless in not paying the purchase funds to the plaintiff 
  or both the dealer and the plaintiff”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the basis of these findings, the judge determined that the 
  appellant could not rely on s. 2(1) of the <i>Factors Act</i>.  He found the 
  appellant did not meet requirement (iv) of the test in <i>Patry</i>,<i> supra</i>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[8] The test under s. 2(1) of the <i>Factors Act</i> set out in the <i>Patry</i> 
      case fail[s].  The broker dealer needed the plaintiff’s permission to conclude 
      the transaction and approve the contract and the defendant should have known 
      that.  <i>Further, the defendant should have made inquiries into the responsibilities 
      and obligations of the parties to the consignment or broker listing agreement.</i> 
    </p>
    <p>[9] It is not necessary to determine whether the boat was in possession 
      of Bodden’s Marine for resale.  This would be an issue for trial in any 
      event.</p>
    <p>[10] In my view, there is no genuine issue for trial and the plaintiff 
      is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant plus costs.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, the motions judge erred in his application of the 
  test and his finding that the appellant did not satisfy requirement (iv).  The 
  concession that the appellant acted in good faith precluded, on the facts of 
  this case, any finding that he was under a duty to inquire into the arrangements 
  between Bodden’s and the respondent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent concedes that Bodden’s was a mercantile agent 
  and that the boat was at Bodden’s with the consent of the respondent.  It is 
  unnecessary on this appeal to determine whether the Sea Ray was in Bodden’s 
  possession for re-sale purposes, although we now know that the respondent was 
  prepared to accept the fair price of $46,000, as paid by the appellant.  However, 
  the respondent submits that the sale of the Sea Ray to the appellant was not 
  in the ordinary course of Bodden’s business as a mercantile agent.  I disagree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In a similar case, <i>St. John v. Horvat</i> (1994), 113 D.L.R. 
  (4th)<i> </i>670 (B.C. C.A.), the respondent delivered a van on consignment 
  to a broker with instructions to contact her when a firm offer was made.  She 
  never authorized the broker to sell the van.  The broker registered a forged 
  ownership and sold the van to the appellant without notifying the respondent.  
  At issue was whether the appellant could rely on s. 58(1) of the <i>Sale of 
  Goods Act</i>, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 370 (the equivalent of s. 2(1) of the Ontario 
  <i>Factors Act</i>). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Court of Appeal held that the sale was in the broker’s ordinary 
  course of business as a mercantile agent and that the appellant was entitled 
  to protection under s.&nbsp;58(1).  It stated at pp. 678-9:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[t]he mere fact that the mercantile agent has acted outside his or her 
      actual authority does not take a sale out of the ordinary course of business; 
      s. 58 is designed to cure such a defect … If the words “in the ordinary 
      course of business of a mercantile agent” were defined in such a way that 
      lack of authority to sell or fraud on the part of the mercantile agent would 
      take the transaction out of s. 58, the entire purpose of the provision – 
      to promote efficiency in commercial transactions and protect buyers who, 
      without any indication that the mercantile agent does not have authority 
      to sell, purchase goods from one who does not have such authority – would 
      be defeated.  What takes a sale out of the ordinary course of business is 
      conduct of the seller or other circumstances that would put a reasonable 
      buyer on notice that this was not a sale in the ordinary course of business.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center;'><span
lang=EN-US>….</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… There would be no reason for [the appellant] to ask to see the previous 
      transfer form from the respondent to [the broker], but even if he had, there 
      was nothing on that transfer form to cause him to suspect that it was a 
      forgery.  In short, the evidence does not indicate that <i>a reasonable 
      buyer would have suspected that this was other than a sale in the ordinary 
      course of business.</i></p>
    <p>I find that the appellant has established that he acted in good faith and 
      without notice that [the broker] did not have authority to sell the van.  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the present case, Bodden’s was a broker of used boats.  It 
  sold privately owned boats on consignment.  As stated in <i>St. John </i>at 
  p. 675, “[t]he important question is whether [the broker] customarily had authority 
  to sell the vehicles delivered into its possession.” As in that case, there 
  does not appear to be any evidence that Bodden’s did not customarily have such 
  authority.  Bodden’s sold the privately owned boat on consignment to the appellant 
  at its place of business.  From the appellant’s perspective, and the perspective 
  of a reasonable person, the sale by Bodden’s was in its ordinary course of business 
  as a mercantile agent.<i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge erred in determining that the fact the appellant 
  “should have known” that “[t]he broker dealer needed the plaintiff’s permission 
  to conclude the transaction” precluded satisfaction of requirement (iv).  Notice 
  of the necessity for authorization is not the equivalent of notice that Bodden’s 
  lacked the authority to sell the boat.  Accepting that the appellant knew “[t]he 
  broker dealer needed the plaintiff’s permission to conclude the transaction” 
  there is no suggestion he had actual notice that Bodden’s did not have the requisite 
  authorization. <i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge also erred by finding that “the defendant should 
  have made inquiries into the responsibilities and obligations of the parties 
  to the consignment or broker listing agreement.” As Laskin J.A. stated in <i>Patry</i>, 
  at paras. 14 and 15 “[n]ormally, good faith and notice will coincide”.  He also 
  held that the good faith requirement in s.&nbsp;2(1) of the <i>Factors Act </i>does 
  not import a due diligence requirement.  It would logically follow that the 
  requirement that there be an absence of notice would also not import a due diligence 
  requirement.  As stated in <i>HOJ Franchise Systems Inc. v. Municipal Savings 
  and Loan Corp.</i> (1994), 110 D.L.R. (4th) 645 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at p. 673 
  “the provisions relieve innocent purchasers from having to inquire into the 
  limits of the agent’s authority”.  This is also consistent with the proposition 
  in <i>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</i>, 5th ed. (1997), at 347-8 that “there is 
  no general duty on the buyer of goods in an ordinary commercial transaction 
  to make inquiries as to the right of the seller to dispose of the goods”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Patry</i>,<i> </i>at para. 14, Laskin J.A. held that “[i]f 
  a party has notice of an agent’s lack of authority, it may not claim to be acting 
  in good faith”.  In the present case, the respondent acknowledges in its factum 
  that the appellant bought the vessel in good faith, but states that it was done 
  negligently.  In <i>Patry</i>,<i> </i>Laskin J.A. went on to state in para. 
  15, that acting in good faith should be interpreted as it is in the <i>Sale 
  of Goods Act</i> as an act “done honestly whether it is done negligently or 
  not”.  While negligence does not preclude satisfaction of the good faith requirement, 
  the acknowledgement that the purchase was made by the appellant in good faith 
  supports the appellant’s position that he did not have notice of an absence 
  of authorization by the respondent. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Proof that the goods were purchased at a price much lower than 
  the ordinary trade price, while not absolute proof of bad faith, is very strong 
  evidence of fraudulent knowledge on the part of the purchaser:  see <i>Benjamin</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at 346-7.  Here the appellant purchased the Sea Ray for a fair 
  price as evidenced by the respondent’s willingness to accept that amount as 
  an alternative to delivery of the Sea Ray.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent concedes that Bodden’s was a mercantile agent 
  and that the respondent consented to its possession of the Sea Ray.  It sold 
  the Sea Ray in its ordinary course of business as a mercantile agent.  The appellant 
  purchased the boat in good faith, without actual notice that Bodden’s did not 
  have authority to sell the boat.  I am not satisfied that the facts support 
  a finding of constructive notice.  The appellant had no obligation to investigate 
  whether that authority was actually given and nothing gives rise to a finding 
  of constructive knowledge, or even a suspicion, that there was an absence of 
  authorization by the respondent.  On that basis, the appellant is entitled to 
  protection under s. 2(1) of the <i>Factors Act. </i>He purchased the Sea Ray 
  in good faith in exactly the situation s. 2(1) was designed to govern. </p>

  </span></span> I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and enter 
  summary judgment dismissing the respondent’s action with costs and allowing 
  the cross-motion for judgment declaring that the appellant is the owner of the 
  Sea Ray in issue free and clear of all claims of any nature and kind whatsoever 
  arising directly or indirectly through the respondent.  The appellant is entitled 
  to his costs on the appeal set at $4,000 plus G.S.T. and to his costs of the 
  motion and cross-motion below to be assessed on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
