    with second-degree murder in connection with the death of Dmitri Baranovski 
    who was killed on November 14, 1999. Both appellants were sixteen years old 
    as of November 14, 1999. Where the young person against whom an information 
    is laid was sixteen or seventeen years of age at the time of the alleged offence, 
    s. 16(1.01) of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders Act</i>, 
    R.S.C. 1985, c.Y-1, requires that a charge of second-degree murder proceed 
    “in ordinary court in accordance with the law ordinarily applicable to an 
    adult … unless the youth court … makes an order” that the charges proceed 
    in youth court. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>For the purpose of the 
    transfer applications, the youth court judge accepted that both of the appellants 
    were part of a group of young people who attended at G. Ross Lord Park in 
    North York on the evening of November 14, 1999 to carry out a retaliatory 
    attack on a group of Russian youths who threatened a friend of the appellants 
    on November 12, 1999. When they were unable to locate the Russian youths at 
    the park, the appellants’ group decided to rob the deceased and his friends. 
    The deceased was tripped and then viciously kicked as he lay on the ground, 
    after he refused to comply with a demand to turn over his cigarettes and money. 
    It is undisputed that the victim died as a result of the injuries he sustained 
    during this attack.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The youth court judge 
    found that neither appellant had met the onus of demonstrating that the charge 
    against him should proceed in youth court, and dismissed both applications. 
    With respect to M.(M.), the youth court judge concluded at p.35-36:</span></p>
</div>
<ul> 
  <ul>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      M.(M.), the Applicant herein, has the onus on him to demonstrate that he 
      should be transferred to the youth system for his trial. I find that he 
      has not met that onus.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      M.(M.) was a main player in the events of November 14, 1999. He was a primary 
      mover in organizing the planned revenge attack. He readily became involved 
      in the robbery scenario. He was the person who threw the victim to the ground. 
      He participated in kicking the victim in the head.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      M.(M.) has a long history of aggression and intimidation. M.(M.) uses his 
      physical size and aggressive manner to achieve his goals. Because of these 
      attributes, he has not found it unnecessary (sic) to actually use physical 
      force. The one time M.(M.) was guilty of an assault, the circumstances were 
      such that they mirrored his normal approach to life situations.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      M.(M.) has developed an independent lifestyle that features drug use, unemployment, 
      and a negative peer group.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      There is no indication that a custodial setting places him in a position 
      of vulnerability. In fact, M.(M.) seems to have settled into the prison 
      culture remarkably well. </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      M.(M.) can presently be characterized as a danger to society. I accept Dr. 
      Brunet’s assessment as to M.(M.)’s future risk of recidivism. In so doing, 
      I am mindful of the direction of the Supreme Court in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Winko v. B.C. (Forensic Psychiatric Institute) 
      </i>(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 162-2 (S.C.C.) wherein the Court noted 
      that: </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      It may be extremely difficult for experts to predict whether a person will 
      offend in the future. The documented tendency to over-estimate dangerousness 
      must be acknowledged and resisted.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Dr. Brunet advised the court that there is nothing written as to the length 
      of time that is required to treat a Conduct Disorder. I am not satisfied 
      that there is convincing evidence that such treatment can be completed within 
      the time frame of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders 
      Act</i>.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      I am not satisfied that the public can be adequately protected under the 
      disposition scheme of the Young Offenders Act. </span></div>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>With respect to C.(W.A.), 
    the youth court judge concluded:</span></p>
</div>
<ul> 
  <ul> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA>C.(W.A.), the Applicant herein, has the onus on him to demonstrate 
      that he should be transferred to the youth court system for his trial. I 
      find that he has not met that onus.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      <br>
      C.(W.A.) was a main player in the events of November 14, 1999. He was a 
      primary mover in organizing the planned revenge attack. He readily became 
      involved in the robbery scenario. He participated in kicking the victim 
      in the head.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      C.(W.A.) did not exhibit signs of difficulty until he entered grade seven. 
      From that time on, his scholastic efforts went into serious decline, he 
      began using drugs, he began to associate with a negative peer group and 
      parental control slipped away.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      C.(W.A.) also became involved in two recent events that bear a remarkably 
      similar pattern as the index offence in question. The scenarios start with 
      aggression towards C.(W.A.) and dangerous and extremely vicious retaliation 
      on the part of C.(W.A.). An assault caused him to arm himself with a knife 
      for protection. A serious assault on C.(W.A.) resulted in a planned ambush 
      wherein his attackers were attacked with a baseball bat resulting in a broken 
      leg. A confrontation at a school resulted in a well-planned attack on the 
      alleged perpetrators. This event, in turn lead to the index offence before 
      the court.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      There is nothing to suggest that C.(W.A.) would be particularly vulnerable 
      in the adult system due to his maturity. </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      I adopt the same position in my conclusion for M.(M.) as to C.(W.A.)’s risk 
      of recidivism.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      I am not satisfied that the public can be adequately protected under the 
      disposition scheme of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders 
      Act</i>.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><br>
       </span>I am not persuaded by Dr. Meen’s evidence that C.(W.A.) can be treated

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-CA>M.(M.)’s Appeal </span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>We reject M.(M.)’s submission 
    that the youth court judge’s finding that M.(M.) is presently a danger to 
    the public is unreasonable. Assuming that the youth court judge placed undue 
    reliance on that portion of Dr. Brunet’s evidence that was based on her use 
    of actuarial risk assessment instruments<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [1] </span></span></a>, the balance of 
    the record amply supports the youth court judge’s finding in this respect. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Although Dr. Chamberlain 
    testified that, in his opinion, M.(M.) did not presently pose a significant 
    risk of committing further offences against the public, in our view, the youth 
    court judge was justified in rejecting Dr. Chamberlain’s opinion for three 
    reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>First, counsel for the 
    appellants instructed their respective psychiatrists not to ask the appellants 
    any questions concerning the circumstances of the alleged offences. In addition, 
    the appellants were instructed by counsel not to speak to Dr. Brunet or anyone 
    else retained by the Crown to conduct assessments ordered under s. 13 of the 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders Act</i> at the request 
    of the Crown. The youth court judge found that “the limitations placed on 
    all the psychiatrists in the case at bar had an impact on their opinion” and 
    stated that this conclusion was supported by the evidence “from the experts 
    themselves”. The youth court judge also noted specifically that Dr. Chamberlain 
    added a caveat to his opinion concerning M.(M.)’s risk of committing further 
    offences that he did not have the opportunity of inquiring into the details 
    and the nature of the behaviour for which M.(M.) was charged. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>We specifically reject 
    M.(M.)’s submission that the youth court judge erred by considering M.(M.)’s 
    decision to exercise his right to remain silent when weighing the psychiatric 
    evidence. In our view, the youth court judge’s conclusions concerning the 
    weight to be afforded to the expert’s opinions were findings of fact derived 
    from the evidence adduced on the transfer hearing; they did not amount to 
    an adverse inference. In addition, we note that M.(M.) did not challenge the 
    constitutional validity of s. 16(1.11) of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Young Offenders Act</i>, which placed the onus on him of demonstrating 
    that this matter should proceed in youth court. Finally, it does not appear 
    that M.(M.) requested an assessment order under s. 13 of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders Act</i> in order to obtain 
    protected status<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'> [2] </span></span></a> for statements that he made to his own psychiatrist. 
    In these circumstances, we can see no basis for M.(M.)’s submission that the 
    youth court judge erred, and we agree with the youth court judge’s conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Second, for the purposes 
    of the transfer hearing, the youth court judge found that M.(M.) was “a main 
    player” in the events of November 14, 1999 and that his actions included helping 
    to organize the revenge attack, becoming involved in a planned robbery, participating 
    in the confrontation of the first victim, throwing the deceased to the ground, 
    and kicking him in the head. We reject M.(M.)’s contention that the youth 
    court judge erred in making these findings because of inherent frailties in 
    the evidence. For the limited purpose of the transfer hearing, the youth court 
    judge was entitled to accept “evidence tendered by the Crown if that evidence 
    [was] reasonably capable of belief and also supporting the finding of fact 
    urged by the Crown”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [3] </span></span></a>. In making these 
    findings, the youth court judge recognized that the evidence implicating M.(M.) 
    as a major participant in the events of November 14, 1999 is subject to various 
    frailties. However, he found that it was “corroborated in many ways [by] that 
    of other witnesses”. In our view, he was entitled to make that finding, and 
    to accept the impugned evidence as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Third, based on evidence 
    concerning the appellant’s background, Dr. Chamberlain opined that M.(M.) 
    falls into the category of mild adolescent onset conduct disorder, excluding 
    consideration of the index offence, “or severe if one includes it”. Dr. Brunet 
    shared the opinion that, taking account of the allegations underlying the 
    second-degree murder charge, M.(M.) suffers from severe adolescent onset conduct 
    disorder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>In our view, the youth 
    court judge’s findings concerning the level of M.(M.)’s participation in the 
    alleged offence, the evidence that M.(M.) suffers from severe adolescent-onset 
    conduct disorder, and the evidence concerning M.(M.)’s background are sufficient 
    to support a finding that M.(M.) is presently a danger to the public. Particularly 
    when combined with the limitations imposed on all of the psychiatrists, and 
    with the caveat expressed by Dr. Chamberlain concerning his opinion, they 
    also justify the trial judge’s decision to reject Dr. Chamberlain’s opinion. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Finally, we reject M.(M.)’s 
    submission that the youth court judge’s finding that he had not met the onus 
    of proving that he could be rehabilitated within the youth court disposition 
    period was unreasonable. M.(M.) relies in particular on Dr. Chamberlain’s 
    testimony that there is a significant difference in outcome between adolescent-onset 
    and childhood-onset conduct disorder, and that, in his opinion, the time frame 
    for custody and community supervision provided for in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young 
    Offenders Act</i> would be “more than adequate to achieve the rehabilitative 
    purpose”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>The youth court judge 
    clearly found that the whole of Dr. Chamberlain’s opinion was undermined by 
    his failure to discuss the circumstances of the offence with M.(M.). In addition 
    to rejecting Dr. Chamberlain’s opinion concerning dangerousness, the youth 
    court judge also said at 34:</span></p>
</div>
<ul> 
  <ul> 
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA>Dr. Chamberlain expressed the view that M.(M.) can learn from his experience. 
      Without speaking to M.(M.) about the index offence, it is difficult to understand 
      how Dr. Chamberlain can arrive at such a conclusion. </span></div>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>The youth court judge’s 
    findings concerning M.(M.)’s participation in the alleged offence are a significant 
    factor in the finding of dangerousness. We share the youth court judge’s reservations 
    about how Dr. Chamberlain could express a helpful opinion concerning whether 
    M.(M.) is presently a danger to the public or concerning his prospects of 
    rehabilitation without exploring all of the factors that impact on those issues. 
    In our view, the youth court judge was entitled to reject Dr. Chamberlain’s 
    evidence concerning the prospects and timing of rehabilitation because Dr. 
    Chamberlain’s opinion was undermined by his failure to discuss the circumstances 
    of the alleged offence with M.(M.). Once the youth court judge rejected Dr. 
    Chamberlain’s opinion, the challenge facing the appellant in satisfying the 
    onus upon him increased significantly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Leaving aside that portion 
    of Dr. Brunet’s evidence that was based on her use of actuarial risk assessment 
    instruments, we agree with the youth court judge’s finding that M.(M.) is 
    presently a danger to the public. As M.(M.) failed to lead evidence demonstrating 
    that he can be rehabilitated and that his rehabilitation can be achieved within 
    the youth court disposition period, M.(M.)’ s appeal against the order of 
    the youth court judge is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-CA>C.(W.A.)’s Appeal</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>C.(W.A.) does not contest 
    the youth court judge’s finding that he is presently a danger to the public. 
    However, he contends that the youth court judge placed undue reliance on the 
    actuarial risk assessment evidence of Dr. Brunet and also erred in rejecting 
    Dr. Meen’s evidence that he can be rehabilitated with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Young Offenders Act</i> disposition period.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>We reject these submissions. 
    Once again, assuming that the youth court judge placed undue reliance on that 
    portion of Dr. Brunet’s evidence that was based on her use of actuarial risk 
    assessment instruments, in our view, the youth court judge was justified in 
    rejecting Dr. Meen’s opinion based on the doctor’s own testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>The youth court judge 
    noted that a significant area of disagreement between Dr. Brunet and Dr. Meen 
    “was with respect to whether [C.(W.A.)] suffers from cannabis abuse and conduct 
    disorder”. Before rejecting Dr. Meen’s evidence that C.(W.A.) can be treated 
    within the youth court disposition period, the youth court judge said this 
    about Dr. Meen’s approach to whether C.(W.A.) suffers from childhood onset 
    conduct disorder:</span></p>
</div>
<ul> 
  <ul>

lang=EN-CA>I have serious reservations regarding Dr. Meen’s approach to the whole 
      issue as to whether C.(W.A.) has a conduct disorder. The following exchange 
      in cross-examination highlights my concern:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      <span lang=EN-CA>And with respect to the diagnosis with respect to conduct 
      disorder, if there weren’t these time frames of the twelve months and six 
      months, would you have diagnosed Mr. C. as conduct disordered?</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>I would have, I wouldn’t have made a diagnosis, 
      that was not my task. I would, and I noticed, I went back and checked, none 
      of the other psychiatrists that presented material here today gave an axis 
      diagnosis as required by DSM-IV. If I was going to do that I would have 
      put in things like, rule out conduct disorder, rule out dysthymia. What 
      the task I was asked for was to see whether he could be served well within 
      the young offender system and that’s not a, a diagnosis is not required 
      to do that.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>So you deliberately didn’t turn your mind 
      to whether to diagnose him or not as anything in particular?</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>No, as a physician, a psychiatrist, my task 
      is to serve the client well. The client in a forensic case such as this 
      is the individual, the family, and the community, and that was my task.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>So your task was not to see if there was 
      a particular diagnosis that was…</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>If there was one that jumped out at me then 
      as a responsible physician then I would have had to identify it. In my experience 
      here I did not have one jump out at me that I could comfortably diagnose.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>And your position is, is that your mandate 
      was not to delve into this, is that correct?</span></div>
    <div class=Section1> <span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>That’s right.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
      Dr. Meen may not have been inclined to delve into the possibility of conduct 
      disorder when he himself has written that there is no quick [fix] for conduct 
      disorder available. Dr. Meen stood by a position that he had expressed in 
      the past wherein he noted that conduct disorder in is much more than a disorder, 
      but rather a disability. A disability with major incapacitating and devastating 
      consequences for the individual, the family, and the community. The most 
      malignant variety of the disorder begins in childhood and must not be confused 
      with the more benign adolescent-onset type. </span></div>

    concerning the circumstances of the offence and concerning C.(W.A.)’s background 
    justified a finding of dangerousness and raised obvious concerns about rehabilitation. 
    It is apparent that the youth court judge rejected Dr. Meen’s opinion because 
    he was not satisfied that Dr. Meen had adequately addressed the presenting 
    issues. Again, without the benefit of Dr. Meen’s opinion, the youth court 
    judge was entirely justified in finding that the appellant had not met the 
    onus upon him. </span></p>
