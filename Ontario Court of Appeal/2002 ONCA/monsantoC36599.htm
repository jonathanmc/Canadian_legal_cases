      Canada Inc. (Monsanto) is the primary appellant in this appeal, and its
      pension plan is the subject matter of this litigation. Monsanto is supported
      by the other two appellants, the Association of Canadian Pension Management
      (ACPM) and the National Trust Company (National). ACPM is a non-profit
      corporation which serves as a national voice for pension plan sponsors
      in Canada. National is in the same position as Monsanto in that it is seeking
      to proceed with a partial wind up of its pension plan without distributing
      any part of the plan’s surplus.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      respondents are the Superintendent of Financial Services (the Superintendent),
      who is the front-line regulator of pensions in Ontario, and Messrs. Smallhorn,
      Halsall, and Galbraith, who represent members of the National pension plan
      seeking distribution of a portion of that plan’s surplus when it is partially
      wound up. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      plan under scrutiny in this case is the defined benefit pension plan maintained
      by Monsanto for its employees. Monsanto’s wish to proceed with a partial
      wind up of the plan arose when, as a result of a corporate reorganization
      and a plant closure, it gave notice to 146 employees that their employment
      would be terminated between December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1998. Throughout
      these proceedings this group has been referred to as the Affected Members.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      submitted a report to the provincial pension regulator on August 11, 1997
      seeking approval for the partial wind up of the plan as it related to the
      Affected Members. At the time, there were approximately 1600 members of
      the plan in all, of whom about 700, including the Affected Members, were
      active employees.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      report provided that the partial wind up was to be effective May 31, 1997.
      As of that date, the information supplied to the regulator by the actuaries
      for the plan showed that the plan had an actuarial surplus of some $19.1
      million representing the amount by which the estimated asset value exceeds
      the estimated liabilities. The Affected Members’ <i>pro rata</i> share
      of that surplus was some $3.1 million. The report made no provision for
      the distribution of this sum either to the Affected Members or to Monsanto.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      July 1, 1998, because of the enactment of the <i>Financial Services Commission
      of Ontario Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 28, the Superintendent became the
      provincial pension regulator taking over that function from the Pension
      Commission of Ontario. At the same time that Commission’s adjudicative
      functions in relation to pensions were transferred to the newly created
      Financial Services Tribunal (the Tribunal).</span></p>

      a consequence, it was the Superintendent who, as the new provincial pension
      regulator, responded to the report submitted by Monsanto. On December 1,
      1998, she served Monsanto with a notice of proposal to refuse to approve
      the company’s partial wind up report. The notice set out a number of objections,
      but foremost among them was that the report did not provide for the distribution
      to the Affected Members of surplus assets relating to that part of the
      plan being wound up, contrary to s. 70(6) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      response was to exercise its right under s. 89 of the Act to require a
      hearing by the Tribunal. In such a hearing the Tribunal’s power in relation
      to the Superintendent’s proposal to refuse to approve the partial wind
      up report is set out in s.&nbsp;89(9) of the Act:</span></p>

        carrying out the proposal and to take such action as the Tribunal considers

        regulations, and for such purposes, the Tribunal may substitute its opinion

      Tribunal held the requested hearing and by a two to one majority, issued
      a decision ordering the Superintendent to refrain from carrying out the
      proposal to refuse to approve the partial wind up report, and ordering
      the Superintendent to approve it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      decision of the majority rested ultimately on its disposition of two issues
      in favour of Monsanto. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>First,
      the majority dealt with the surplus distribution issue raised by s.70(6)
      of the Act. That section reads as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>On the partial wind up of a pension
        plan, members, former members and other persons entitled to benefits
        under the pension plan shall have rights and benefits that are not less
        than the rights and benefits they would have on a full wind up of the
        pension plan on the effective date of the partial wind up.</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      majority determined that this subsection does not require that on partial
      wind up Monsanto provide for the distribution of the actuarial surplus
      in the plan that relates to the Affected Members. Rather, the majority
      said that the subsection gives the Affected Members no more than a right
      to participate in a distribution of actual surplus on a full wind up if
      and when that subsequently occurs. That participation would be based on
      their membership in the plan at the partial wind up date without disqualification
      because they ceased to be members of the plan before the date of the full
      wind up.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      dissent, on the other hand, concluded that s. 70(6) requires that members
      affected by a partial wind up are to be dealt with as if there had been
      a full wind up at the partial wind up date.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      second issue is whether Monsanto had a sufficient legitimate expectation
      that the Superintendent would approve the partial wind up report, in light
      of the past practice and policy of the pension regulator in respect of
      similar reports, that the Tribunal should direct the Superintendent to
      approve the partial wind up report. The majority concluded that, in the
      circumstances, this was a proper case in which to apply the doctrine of
      legitimate expectations, (or as it is sometimes called, estoppel against
      a public authority) to compel the Superintendent to approve the partial
      wind up report.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      dissent took the contrary view, finding that the policies of the regulator
      were ambiguous at best, and that the doctrine of legitimate expectations
      could not deny the Affected Members the rights conferred on them by s.
      70(6) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>On
      receiving the Tribunal’s decision, the Superintendent availed itself of
      the right provided by s. 91(1) of the Act to appeal the Tribunal decision
      to the Divisional Court, raising both the surplus distribution issue and
      the legitimate expectation issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>As
      to the former issue, the Divisional Court found that the interpretation
      of s. 70(6) offered by the majority decision should be scrutinized against
      the standard of reasonableness. It concluded that the interpretation offered
      was unreasonable and must be set aside. The Divisional Court agreed with,
      and adopted, the interpretation of the subsection offered by the dissent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>As
      to the latter issue, the Divisional Court found correctness to be the proper
      standard of review. It concluded that the reasons of the dissent were correct,
      and that the majority erred in using the doctrine of legitimate expectations
      to accord to Monsanto rights which were substantive, not simply procedural.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In
      the result, the Divisional Court allowed the appeal, set aside the order
      of the Tribunal, and ordered that the Superintendent carry out the notice
      of proposal to refuse to approve the partial wind up report because it
      did not comply with s. 70(6) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>With
      leave, Monsanto appeals to this court. It raises both the surplus distribution
      issue and the legitimate expectations issue. I will deal with each of these
      in turn. Before doing so, it should be made clear that all parties to this
      appeal agree that the issue of who owns the surplus –  the employer, the
      members or both –  is not before us. If distribution of a part of the surplus
      is required by law, the ownership question would have to be answered to
      determine the proper recipients.</span></p>

      to this issue is the interpretation of s. 70(6) of the Act. However, in
      order to decide whether the Divisional Court properly set aside the interpretation
      offered by the majority of the Tribunal, it is necessary to consider whether
      it applied the appropriate standard of review in doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      I have said, the Divisional Court tested the majority’s interpretation
      against a standard of reasonableness. In this court all parties argued
      that this was the proper approach. I agree with them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      determination of the proper standard of review of the decision of an administrative
      tribunal now requires application of the pragmatic and functional approach
      described in <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>,
      [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982. That approach focuses on the fundamental question
      of whether the issue before the Tribunal was one that was intended by the
      legislators to be left to the exclusive decision of that Tribunal. See <i>Pasiechnyk
      v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ 
    Compensation Board)</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 890 at para. 18.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      described in <i>Pushpanathan, supra, </i>there are four main factors, each
      not conclusive in itself, that must be considered in determining the proper
      standard of review. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      first of these is the presence or absence of a privative clause. Here s.
      20(b) of the <i>Financial Services Commission of Ontario Act</i> gives
      the Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions of fact
      or law that arise in any proceeding before it. However, the preclusive
      effect of this provision is essentially neutralized by s. 21(4), which
      provides that an order of the Tribunal is final and conclusive for all
      purposes unless the Act under which the Tribunal made it provides for an
      appeal. As we have seen, s. 91(1) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i> provides
      for a full appeal from the Tribunal to the Divisional Court. Thus, this
      factor suggests a less deferential standard of review.</span></p>

      second and most important factor is the relative expertise of the Tribunal.
      The Act gives the Tribunal the central adjudicative role in the specialized
      administrative structure set up to regulate pensions in Ontario. While
      the Tribunal deals with other regulated sectors in addition to pensions,
      the <i>Financial Services Commission of  Ontario Act</i> requires that,
      to the extent practicable, members are appointed with experience and expertise
      in the regulated sectors and that they are assigned to cases which draw
      on that experience and expertise. Hence the Tribunal must be seen as having
      a relative expertise in adjudicating questions relating to pensions. This
      points to a more deferential standard of review.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      third factor is the purpose of the Act as a whole and, in particular, the
      provision under consideration. Here s. 70(6) of the Act, whatever its proper
      meaning, is clearly designed to create rights or entitlements. When addressing
      this section, the Tribunal is not dealing with what Bastarache J. in <i>Pushpanathan,
      supra, </i>called a polycentric issue requiring the concurrent balancing
      of costs and benefits for many different parties. This factor thus weighs
      on the side of lesser deference.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Finally,
      there is the nature of the problem under review, in this case the meaning
      of s. 70(6) of the Act. Since it involves the interpretation of a statute
      within the Tribunal’s area of expertise some deference is suggested even
      though it is a question of law and thus might normally attract a strict
      standard of review. See <i>Moreau-Bérubé v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council)</i> (2002),
      209 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 (S.C.C.)<i> </i>at para. 61.</span></p>

      these factors together, I think that the Tribunal decision must be accorded
      considerable deference and that the proper standard of review of that decision
      by the court is that of simple reasonableness. The strict scrutiny of the
      correctness standard would give inadequate recognition to the Tribunal’s
      relative expertise and to the fact that the problem before it was the proper
      interpretation of an Act with which it has specialized experience. On the
      other hand, the great deference called for by the patent unreasonableness
      standard would accord too little significance to the absence of a privative
      clause and to the fact that the provision in question puts before the Tribunal
      an issue of rights or entitlements, not a polycentric problem. In my view
      the reasonableness standard strikes the right balance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>This
      conclusion accords with two related decisions of this court. In <i>Gencorp.
      Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pensions)</i> (1998), 39 O.R.
      (3d) 38 (C.A.), this court determined that the judicial assessment of an
      adjudication by the predecessor to the Tribunal, namely the Pension Commission
      of Ontario, should be done using a standard of reasonableness. Likewise
      in <i>Hinds v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pensions)</i> (2002), 58 O.R.
      (3d) 367, (C.A.) this court concluded that decisions of the Superintendent,
      the step in the regulatory process preceding the Tribunal, should attract
      a reasonableness standard of review. Both these cases, while not identical
      to this one, are consistent with the conclusion I have reached.</span></p>

      describing how the reasonableness standard works in practice, courts have
      used language which is understandably, and perhaps necessarily, general.
      This standard of review (like that of correctness and patent unreasonableness)
      must be sufficiently flexible to permit application to a wide variety of
      administrative agencies in a myriad of different situations. General language
      is thus apt to describe its operations.</span></p>

        at  para. 56, 59-60:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>An unreasonable decision is one that,
        in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat
        probing examination. Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the
        reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support
        it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary
        foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are
        sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would
        be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary
        to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. An example of the latter
        kind of defect would be a contradiction in the premises or an invalid
        inference.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      …</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA><br>
                  The standard of reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> is also closely
      akin to the standard that this Court has said should be applied in reviewing
      findings of fact by trial judges. In <i>Stein v. “Kathy K” (The Ship),</i> [1976]
      2 S.C.R. 802, at p. 806, Ritchie J. described the standard in the following
      terms:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;'><br>
      … the accepted approach of a court of appeal is to test the findings [of
      fact] made at trial on the basis of whether or not they were <u>clearly
      wrong rather than whether they accorded with that court’s view of the balance
      of probability</u>. [Emphasis added by Iacobucci J.]</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA>            Even as a matter of semantics, the closeness of the “clearly
        wrong” test to the standard of reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> is obvious.
        It is true that many things are wrong that are not unreasonable; but
        when “clearly” is added to “wrong”, the meaning is brought much nearer
        to that of “unreasonable”.</span></div>

      in <i>Moreau-Bérubé, supra,</i> at para. 62 Arbour J., speaking for the
      court, articulated the challenge of applying the reasonableness standard
      to a statutory interpretation offered by an administrative tribunal in
      the following language:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>In light of this, and other factors

      in applying the reasonableness standard of review to a statutory interpretation
      rendered by an administrative tribunal, the task of the court is to determine
      whether the interpretation is clearly wrong, that is, one which the statute

      assessing the interpretation of s. 70(6) offered by the majority of the
      Tribunal against this standard, it is useful to begin with an analysis
      of the meaning of the subsection. To reiterate, that subsection reads as
      follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>On the partial wind up of a pension
        plan, members, former members and other persons entitled to benefits
        under the pension plan shall have rights and benefits that are not less
        than the rights and benefits they would have on a full wind up of the
        pension plan on the effective date of the partial wind up.</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>I
      begin with the ordinary meaning of the words of the subsection. In their
      grammatical and ordinary sense they provide three things:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>First,
      they accord certain rights at a specified time, namely, on the partial
      wind up of a pension plan.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Second,
      they accord those rights to a specified group described in the subsection
      as “members, former members and other persons entitled to benefits under
      the pension plan.” All parties to this appeal agree that, despite its infelicitous
      wording, this refers to those affected by the partial wind up, in this
      case the Affected Members. Indeed that was the conclusion of the majority
      of the Tribunal and this finding has not been challenged in the appeal
      process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Third,
      the words of the subsection specify the rights accorded. They are “rights
      and benefits that are not less than the rights and benefits they would
      have on a full wind up of the pension plan on the effective date of the
      partial wind up.” The Affected Members get the rights they would have if
      there were a full wind up on the date of the partial wind up. In the words
      of the dissenting member of the Tribunal, “It says that in effect members
      affected by a partial wind up are to be dealt with as if there had been
      a full wind up at the partial wind up date.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>It
      is uncontested and indeed beyond dispute that on a full wind up, all members
      have the right to have the full surplus distributed. The ordinary meaning
      of the words in s. 70(6) accords to the Affected Members at the time of
      the partial wind up their share of that full wind up right, namely, the
      right to have distributed that part of the surplus that relates to them.
      This is the same right that they and all members would have if there were
      a full wind up at that date.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>This
      ordinary meaning is informed not just by the language of the subsection,
      but by that statutory and regulatory scheme of which it is a part. I refer
      particularly to the following:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA>            (a)       The definition section of the Act, s. 1, provides
        parallel definitions of “partial wind up” and “wind up”. It also provides
        a definition of “surplus”. These are set out in the following terms:</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      “partial wind up” means the termination of part of a pension plan and the
      distribution of the assets of the pension fund related to that part of
      the pension plan;</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      …</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      “surplus” means the excess of the value of the assets of a pension fund
      related to a pension plan over the value of the liabilities under the pension
      plan, both calculated in the prescribed manner;</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      …</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      “wind up” means the termination of a pension plan and the distribution
      of the assets of the pension fund;</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>These
      definitions make clear that the surplus in a pension plan comprises those
      assets which are in excess of the plan’s liabilities. Just as a full wind
      up entails the distribution of the assets of the plan including those making
      up the surplus, a partial wind up is defined to mean the distribution of
      the assets including those making up that part of the surplus related to
      the part of the plan being wound up.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA>            (b)       Other provisions of the statutory and regulatory
        scheme clearly contemplate that there will be some distribution of assets
        (including those making up the surplus) on both a partial wind up and
        a full wind up. Section 70(1)(c) of the Act requires a plan administrator,
        where the plan is to be wound up either in whole or in part, to file
        a wind up report setting out the methods of allocating and distributing
        the assets of the plan. Section 8(1) of Regulation 909, the general regulation
        enacted under the Act, sets out two methods by which payments may be
        made out of surplus when a plan is being wound up either in whole or
        in part. Section 28.1 of that Regulation requires that if there is a
        surplus on the wind up of a pension plan in whole or in part, the administrator
        must provide to those affected certain information including the method
        of distributing the surplus assets and the formula for allocating them
        among plan beneficiaries. Its predecessor (s. 28(2)(g) of the Regulation
        which was in force at the time of this partial wind up) was to identical
        effect.</span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span
lang=EN-CA> <br>
                 (c)       In a more general sense, ss. 68 to 77, which appear
      in the Act under the heading “Winding Up”, deal in the same way with both
      partial wind up and full wind up. For example, s. 73(1) provides for the
      immediate vesting of benefits on the winding up of a plan either in whole
      or in part. Similarly, s. 74 provides for “grow in” rights in both wind
      up circumstances, allowing those meeting the threshold of years of age
      and service to receive a pension once they reach normal retirement age
      despite having ceased to be employees after the full or partial wind up.
      Another example of this legislative treatment is s. 68(1): </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA><br>
      The employer or, in the case of a multi-employer pension plan, the administrator
          may wind up the pension plan in whole or in part.</span></div>

      is clear that the legislature has chosen to treat full wind up and partial
      wind up in parallel throughout the winding up provisions of the Act. When
      s. 70(6) provides that on a partial wind up surplus distribution must parallel
      what occurs on a full wind up, it is simply another instance of this legislative
      approach.</span></p>

      historical origins of s. 70(6) also support the meaning I have set out
      above. As the appellant Monsanto says in its factum, the equivalent of
      s. 70(6) was first enacted in Ontario in 1969 as a regulation. That regulation
      (O.Reg. 91/69) reads as follows: </span></p>

      Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Pension Commission)</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 122

<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-CA>            In particular, the Act evinces

      special solicitude needs no explanation. Employees affected by plant closures,
      like the Affected Members here, have just lost their jobs. In this important

      they ought not to be required to await a full wind up at some indeterminate

      a number of practical considerations support this interpretation of s.
      70(6). It is clearly possible to calculate the portion of surplus attributable
      to that part of the pension plan which is being wound up. The actuaries
      of the plan did so in this case. On the other side of the coin, as the
      majority acknowledged, there are practical difficulties if there is no
      distribution on partial wind up and the affected members are forced to
      await a full wind up at an indeterminate future date. As time passes it
      will become increasingly difficult to locate the members of the partial
      wind up group who may long since have severed all connection with the employer
      and the pension plan.</span></p>

      before the Tribunal and in this court, the appellant Monsanto argued on
      the basis of its expert evidence that serious practical consequences would
      flow from the interpretation of s. 70(6) that I have attempted to elucidate.
      For example, it alleged that the employers will fund pension plans less
      conservatively than at present. It also alleged that the Affected Members
      would be better off than those whose surplus entitlement must await a full
      wind up. </span></p>

      my view, these assertions can have no impact on the proper interpretation
      of s.&nbsp;70(6). There was contrary expert evidence before the Tribunal
      to that on which Monsanto founded its representations. The majority expressly
      declined to make findings resolving this conflict. Moreover, the assertions
      are to some extent speculation. For example, whether those employees who
      stay until full wind up will fare better or worse than the Affected Members
      will depend entirely on unpredictable future events. Their <i>pro rata</i> share
      of surplus could be smaller or larger than that received by the Affected
      Members on partial wind up.</span></p>

      summary, I think that the right interpretation of s. 70(6) is that made
      by the minority of the Tribunal and adopted by the Divisional Court. Members
      affected by a partial wind up are to be dealt with as if there had been
      a full wind up at the partial wind up date. The Affected Members have the
      right to have distributed that portion of the surplus that relates to that

      necessary corollary to this conclusion is that the interpretation of s.
      70(6) offered by the majority of the Tribunal is wrong. To reiterate, the
      majority found that s.&nbsp;70(6) accords to the Affected Members no more
      than a right to participate in a distribution of surplus on a full wind
      up, if and when it takes place in the future, but without disqualification
      because they have ceased to be members of the plan before the full wind
      up date. The question I must address, however, is whether this interpretation
      is not just wrong but unreasonable, in terms of the standard of review
      described earlier.</span></p>

      and most important, the majority’s interpretation accords to the Affected
      Members at partial wind up only the rights they would have on a full wind
      up at some indeterminate date in the future. It does not accord to them
      the rights they would have if there were a full wind up on the date of
      the partial wind up. Yet the subsection requires that the affected employees
      receive “the rights and benefits they would have on a full wind up of the
      pension plan <u>on the effective date of the partial wind up</u>” (emphasis
      added). The majority’s interpretation might be plausible if the subsection
      ended before the underlined phrase. However, that interpretation gives
      that phrase no meaning. In other words, the majority interpretation simply
      reads the underlined phrase out of the subsection. The correct interpretation,
      on the other hand, gives that phrase full recognition. In my view, where
      an incorrect statutory interpretation unnecessarily reads a phrase out
      of the section, it is a strong indicator that the unreasonableness standard
      has been met.</span></p>

      addition, the majority’s interpretation gives no recognition to the statutory
      context of s. 70(6) – either those provisions that contemplate distribution
      on partial wind up or those provisions that reflect a legislative desire
      to treat partial wind up and full wind up on the same footing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      is the majority’s interpretation consistent with the genesis of the obligation
      contained in s. 70(6), namely O. Reg. 91/69, which makes crystal clear
      that the rights accorded to the affected members are not less than what
      they would have been entitled to if the whole of the pension plan had been
      wound up on the same date as the partial wind up.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

      the majority’s interpretation extends no special solicitude to the Affected
      Members who have been impacted by plant closing and downsizing. It requires
      them to wait in hope that there will be a full wind up at some point and
      a surplus distribution in which they will share with those who have been
      fortunate enough to keep their jobs. In my view, this accords inadequate
      recognition to the purpose of the Act.</span></p>

      these considerations together, I conclude, as did the Divisional Court,
      that the interpretation of s. 70(6) offered by the majority of the Tribunal
      is not just incorrect. It is clearly wrong. It is an interpretation which
      the subsection cannot reasonably bear. </span></p>

      in my view the majority used a flawed reasoning process to reach its conclusion.
      In the language of <i>Southam, supra,</i> I do not think that its reasons
      can stand up to a somewhat probing examination.</span></p>

      rendering its statutory interpretation the majority decision does not address
      the conundrum presented for that interpretation by the last phrase in the
      subsection. Nor does it draw any assistance from the statutory context
      in which the subsection sits. Indeed that context is given short shift.
      The statutory definition of partial wind up is said to provide no assistance.
      A number of provisions of the Act and Regulation are said to be procedural
      only and as such of little assistance in determining the meaning of  s.
      70(6). Specific provisions of the Regulation are said to be of limited
      value in the interpretation task since they are subordinate legislation.</span></p>

      of the words of the subsection and the legislative context in which they
      appear. The important role of context in statutory interpretation was described
      by Iacobucci J. in <i>Bell Express Vu Limited Partnership v. Rex </i>(2002),

      the task of statutory interpretation called for in this case requires a
      careful assessment of the ordinary meaning of the text of the subsection
      in light of the overall statutory and regulatory scheme. In my view, the
      reasoning process of the majority was not as faithful to this as it needed

      second respect in which the majority’s reasoning process was flawed concerns
      the significant reliance placed on <i>Schmidt v. Air Products of Canada
      Ltd.,</i> [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611. The majority appears to draw from that case
      the proposition that there can be no surplus on partial wind up, but only
      on full wind up, and therefore, since there can be no surplus on partial
      wind up, there can be no legal obligation to distribute a part of it on
      a partial wind up. Indeed that was the position of the appellant Monsanto
      in this court.</span></p>

      my view, <i>Schmidt</i> cannot be taken for this proposition, at least
      in Ontario where s. 70(6) is part of the legislative regime. The central
      issue in that case involved the resolution of competing claims to the surplus
      in a pension plan when the plan is fully wound up and it is in this context
      that the discussion of  surplus must be read. The Supreme Court of Canada
      held that, in the absence of provincial legislation, this resolution must
      be done by a careful analysis of the pension plan and its funding structures
      against the backdrop of the common law. <i>Schmidt</i> simply does not
      speak to the question of the right to the distribution of surplus when
      there is a partial wind up, let alone a partial wind up when there is an
      applicable legislative provision in the terms of s. 70(6). In my view it
      is flawed reasoning to base the answer to the surplus distribution issue
      in this case on <i>Schmidt</i>.</span></p>

      to s. 70(6) that it could not reasonably bear, but its reasoning process
      cannot stand up to examination. Its conclusion thus reaches the threshold
      of unreasonableness required for judicial review. The Divisional Court
      was correct to set it aside and find that the Monsanto report did not comply

      Agreed Statement of Facts placed before the Tribunal stated that, during
      the period from November 1992 to November 1998, 156 partial wind up reports
      were filed with the pension regulator (the Superintendent or her predecessor,
      the Pension Commission of Ontario) in respect of plans which were in a
      surplus position, but where there was no proposal for the distribution
      of such surplus. The pension regulator neither approved nor refused to
      approve these partial wind up reports and thus, prior to this case, had
      never issued a Notice of Intent to Refuse in respect of a partial wind
      up on the grounds that the surplus was not to be distributed.</span></p>

      each of these cases the pension regulator responded to the report with
      form letters noting s. 70(6) of the Act and indicating that the rights
      and benefits which it provides to members affected by the partial wind
      up may include any entitlement to surplus that would exist on a full wind

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>The final issue is whether Monsanto

        the Tribunal should direct the Superintendent to approve the Partial
        Wind Up Report. Put another way, the issue is whether the Superintendent
        was estopped from disapproving the Partial Wind Up Report on the grounds
        that Monsanto had relied on the past practice of policy of the pension
        regulator, with the result that the Tribunal should direct the Superintendent

      policy and practice of not insisting that the distribution of surplus be
      provided for, or even dealt with, on a current basis in a partial wind
      up report. The majority also found that in structuring this partial wind

      while it acknowledged that the doctrine cannot preclude a public official
      from exercising a statutory duty, it found that s. 70(5) of the Act gives
      the pension regulator a discretion in dealing with a partial wind up report.
      The use of the doctrine to require approval of this particular partial
      wind up report did not offend this limitation.</span></p>

      I do not think that the majority purported to exercise a discretion under
      s. 70(5) of the Act in making this order. Rather, it simply answered the
      question it had originally posed to itself by finding that Monsanto had
      a legitimate expectation that the Superintendent would approve the partial

      by the partial wind up, that may include any entitlement that would exist
      on a full wind up, and that approval of the partial wind up report required

      some clearly leave the opposite inference, namely that the distribution
      of surplus related to the partial wind up must be provided for in the partial
      wind up report if it is to be approved. For example, the policy entitled “partial
      wind up – identification and administration of surplus – compliance with

      such a finding, the doctrine of legitimate expectations cannot be engaged
      in this case. However, even if such a finding had been properly made, the
      majority erred in law in several respects in the application of the doctrine.</span></p>

      is appropriate to review these errors against the standard of correctness
      rather than reasonableness because they involve the application of a common
      law doctrine, a task in which the Tribunal can claim no advantage of relative
      expertise over the courts. The absence of a specialized expertise in relation
      to this particular issue when taken together with the other factors relevant
      to the standard of review discussed earlier, tilt the scales towards the
      least deferential standard of review, namely that of correctness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      first error is that the majority concluded that its use of the doctrine
      created only procedural rights. There is no dispute that the doctrine is
      limited to according certain rights of procedural fairness and cannot create
      substantive rights. See <i>Ahani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
      Immigration)</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 107 (C.A.)  <i>per</i> Laskin J.A.
      at para. 59.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      majority of the Tribunal applied the doctrine to require the Superintendent
      to approve this partial wind up report thus granting Monsanto the right
      to partially wind up its pension plan without distribution of that portion
      of the surplus that related to the part of the plan being wound up. The
      right to keep that portion of the surplus in the plan  is not merely a
      procedural right; it is a substantive right to deal with a part of the
      surplus. Moreover, it is a right which would override the statutory obligation
      to distribute, which is found in s. 70(6) of the Act. In using the doctrine
      of legitimate expectations to create a substantive right for Monsanto,
      particularly a right that would override its statutory obligation, the
      majority erred in law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Second,
      while the majority acknowledged that the doctrine of legitimate expectations
      cannot preclude the Superintendent from exercising a statutory duty, it
      held that this did not prevent the use of the doctrine to require the approval
      of this report even though the report failed to comply with the distribution
      obligation arising from s. 70(6). The majority reached this conclusion
      by interpreting s. 70(5) of the Act to permit the Superintendent to approve
      a partial wind up report that fails to comply with the requirements of
      the Act. Section 70(5) reads as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-CA>The Superintendent may refuse to approve
        a wind up report that does not meet the requirements of this Act and
        the regulations or that does not protect the interests of the members
        and former members of the pension plan.</span></div>

lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In
      my view, this is a misinterpretation of s. 70(5). That subsection sets
      out the two circumstances which lead to a refusal to approve a wind up
      report: where the report fails to meet the requirements of the Act, or
      where those requirements are met but the Superintendent finds that the
      report does not protect the interests of the members of the plan. To read
      the subsection as the majority did, namely that the Superintendent may
      approve a wind up report that does not meet the requirements of the Act
      or that does not protect the interests of members and former members, is
      to read out of the subsection the words “refuse to”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Moreover,
      the Act and the Regulation set up an extensive and detailed regulatory
      regime. In my view, it would take much more explicit language than s. 70(5)
      to evince a legislative intention to allow the Superintendent to act in
      disregard of that regime. This is not a case like <i>Aurchem Exploration
      Ltd. v. Canada</i> (1992), 91 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 710 (F.C.T.D.), which
      was relied on by the majority. There the legislation set out the duties
      of the public official, a mining recorder. It also provided in detailed
      and specific language that a claimant’s failure to comply with precisely
      specified provisions of the legislation did not invalidate a claim where
      the mining recorder determined that there had been an honest attempt to
      follow the provisions as nearly as possible, with no intent to mislead
      others in the vicinity. The Act in this case contains no comparable provision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The
      interpretation of s. 70(5) offered by the majority would not just allow
      the Superintendent to approve a wind up report that did not comply with
      the Act. It would also allow her to approve a report that did not protect
      the interests of the members and former members of the plan. This would
      be contrary to the “high duty” owed by the Superintendent to the employees
      with Ontario pension plans that was articulated by this court in <i>Huus
      v. Ontario (Superintendent of Pension)</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 380 (C.A.)
      at 387.  It would also be contrary to the clear intention of the Act to
      benefit employees especially those affected by plant closures, as described
      in <i>Firestone Canada Inc., supra</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Thus
      I think that the majority erred in law in its reading of s. 70(5) of the
      Act. As a result, it erroneously applied the doctrine of legitimate expectations
      in a way that precluded the Superintendent from exercising her duty to
      require that a wind up report comply with the statutory guarantee provided
      by s. 70(6) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>Third,
      the majority erred when it concluded that the interests of third party
      Affected Members would not be adversely impacted by applying the doctrine
      to order approval of the partial wind up report because those members would
      have had the same expectations as Monsanto. The statutory rights of third
      parties cannot be erased by representations made by public officials. See <i>Libbey
      Canada Inc., supra,</i> at p. 435. What matters in determining whether
      the interests of third party Affected Members should preclude the application
      of the doctrine is whether their statutory rights under s. 70(6) would
      be negated as a result, not whether a representation has been made to them
      by the pension regulator that this would happen. The majority erred in
      law in applying the doctrine where the result would be just such a negation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>In
      my opinion, the Divisional Court was correct in finding that the majority
      of the Tribunal erred in using the doctrine of legitimate expectations
      to order that the partial wind up report be approved. The majority was
      clearly wrong in finding the necessary clear and unambiguous representation,
      and it erred in law in several ways in its application of the doctrine.
      As a result this ground of appeal must also fail.</span></p>

      summary, I conclude that the appeal must be dismissed. The Divisional Court
      did not err in allowing the appeal, setting aside the order of the Tribunal,
      and substituting a direction to the Superintendent to carry out the proposals
      to refuse to approve the Monsanto report.</span></p>
