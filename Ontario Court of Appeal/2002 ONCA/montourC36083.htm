<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice Linda M. Walters dated 
  March 30, 2001 granting <i>certiorari</i> upon grounds involving a question 
  of law alone.</span></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was charged, together with Michael Bonduro and 
  Vincent Montani, with the offences of extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, 
  threatening death and conspiracy to threaten death in relation to the victim, 
  Richard West.  West was a stock trader and promoter who entered into a business 
  venture with George Lodick and Paul Trennum.  Following a dispute with Lodick 
  and West, Trennum left the venture.  Nonetheless, Trennum claimed that he was 
  owed a debt amounting to 1.5 million shares in the venture, and he would call 
  West from time to time to assert his claim for shares.  When Trennum subsequently 
  went to work for Bonduro, he told him about the business venture and his dispute 
  with West and Lodick.  Trennum also told Bonduro that he would invest money 
  in Bonduro’s failing company by selling the shares he was owed, provided that 
  he was able to obtain the shares from West.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was involved in failed negotiations to settle West’s 
  outstanding debt. At the time, the appellant was indebted to Bonduro, who was 
  very interested in West’s debt.  The appellant lied and misled the victim.  
  He encouraged and drove the victim to meet Montani in a deserted parking lot.  
  In fact, if not for the appellant, the victim would not have attended the meeting.  
  After Montani threatened the victim, he thanked the appellant for setting up 
  the meeting.  Shortly thereafter, the appellant told the victim that he could 
  only help him until the upcoming Friday.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This evidence from the preliminary inquiry is reasonably capable 
  of supporting the inference that the appellant knew of the planned threat and 
  extortion of the victim and was thus a part of the conspiracy.  The preliminary 
  hearing judge, however, chose an inference of a different nature and found that 
  the appellant was an innocent dupe of Bonduro and that he merely facilitated 
  the meeting without knowing its purpose.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Campbell</i> (1999), 140 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 164 at 165, this court stated:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As Campbell J. said in <i>R. v. McIlwain</i> (1988) 67 C.R. (3d) 397 (Ont. 
      H.C.J.) at 399, the preliminary hearing is not the forum for weighing competing 
      inferences or for selecting from among them.  That is the province of the 
      trier of fact at trial.  In <i>R. v. Dubois</i> (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 221 
      (S.C.C.), Estey J. made it clear that it is jurisdictional error for a preliminary 
      hearing judge to enter upon this province.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the preliminary hearing judge was 
  in error in drawing an alternative inference and the motions judge was correct 
  in quashing his decision.</span></p>
