<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The deceased, Phuong Tran, was a distant cousin 
  of the appellant. From the beginning of September 1993 to Sunday, November 21, 
  1993, they shared a one-bedroom apartment in London. Phuong used the bedroom 
  and the appellant slept on a cot in the living room. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At around 2:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 20, 
  1993, the appellant entered Phuong’s bedroom and asked to kiss her, stating 
  that he thought she was beautiful and that he could not control himself. Phuong 
  soundly rejected his advance and the appellant left her room. Ten minutes later, 
  he returned with a knife and threatened to commit suicide unless Phuong promised 
  not to tell anyone about the incident. Phuong refused to make any such promise.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Later that day, family and friends gathered 
  at Phuong’s apartment and in the presence of the appellant, Phuong disclosed 
  the appellant’s improper behaviour. The appellant admitted that he was ashamed 
  for what he had done and it was agreed that he would move out of the apartment 
  the next day.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Over the course of the following two days (Sunday, 
  November 21<sup>st</sup> and Monday, November 22<sup>nd</sup>), the appellant 
  attempted to gain entry into Phuong’s apartment on numerous occasions in order 
  to retrieve his clothing and other personal items. On each occasion he was refused 
  entry by Phuong. On Monday, the 22<sup>nd</sup>, at around 11:00 p.m., while 
  speaking to a friend on the phone, Phuong stated that the appellant had last 
  been at her door around 9:00 p.m. That was Phuong’s last reported conversation 
  with anyone. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On Tuesday, November 23<sup>rd</sup>, Phuong 
  failed to attend school and when various friends and family could not reach 
  her by phone, her brother and a friend attended at her apartment just before 
  midnight. Upon entering, they discovered Phuong’s lifeless body on the bedroom 
  floor. She was wrapped in a blanket and dressed in clothing that she would not 
  have worn to school. This led the police to believe that she had been killed 
  some time before Tuesday morning. As it happens, no one could account for the 
  appellant’s whereabouts between 10:00 p.m. on Monday night and 3:30&nbsp;a.m. 
  on Tuesday morning.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>An autopsy performed on Phuong revealed that 
  she had been sexually assaulted and brutally beaten to death. Among other injuries, 
  a bite mark was found on her face. Seminal fluid retrieved from her vagina was 
  later shown through DNA testing to match the appellant. Given that the appellant 
  and the deceased were not romantically involved, that evidence, along with other 
  circumstantial evidence implicating the appellant in the killing, including 
  motive, opportunity, and after-the-fact conduct consistent with guilt, added 
  up to a formidable case against the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not testify at trial. However, 
  in a statement given to the police on the morning of his arrest, he denied killing 
  Phuong and claimed that he was with friends during the time frame within which 
  she was killed.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal;line-height:normal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;On the morning of November 24, 1993, the appellant 
    was arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the death 
    of Phuong Tran. The arrest came in the middle of a lengthy interrogation of 
    the appellant by the police at the police station (the morning statement). 
    Upon his arrest, the appellant was informed of his s. 10(b) right to counsel. 
    At that time, he indicated that he did not wish to contact a lawyer and the 
    interrogation continued.&lt;a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span> [1] </span></span> 
    Later that afternoon, the appellant changed his mind about retaining counsel. 
    Through miscommunication, two officers who met with him and obtained a written 
    statement, dental impressions and various bodily samples for DNA testing (the 
    afternoon evidence), were not notified of this change. Accordingly, for reasons 
    that need not be detailed, the appellant moved successfully at the outset 
    of his trial to have the afternoon evidence excluded on the basis that it 
    had been obtained in violation of his s. 10(b) right to counsel and that its 
    admission could bring the administration of justice into disrepute. That ruling, 
    which initially took the form of a brief endorsement, was issued on April 
    19, 1995.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At this juncture, the trial was put over for 
  two weeks to May 3<sup>rd</sup> to enable the Crown to bring a motion to adjourn 
  the trial. The adjournment was being sought because the Crown wished to apply 
  for a general warrant under s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i> to obtain bodily samples 
  and dental impressions from the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Prior to the May 3<sup>rd </sup>return date, 
  the police, in consultation with a senior Crown Attorney, formulated a plan 
  to obtain the appellant’s DNA. The plan was simple and admittedly designed to 
  circumvent the appellant’s refusal, on the advice of counsel, to provide bodily 
  samples. It involved offering the appellant a piece of chewing gum while in 
  the police cruiser en route to and from the courthouse.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On May 3<sup>rd</sup> the plan was put into 
  effect and it worked. The police were able to obtain the appellant’s DNA from 
  two pieces of gum which he accepted, chewed and then discarded. The details 
  of the plan and the trial judge’s findings in relation to it are found in the 
  trial judge’s ruling, dated August 11, 1995, in which, over the objection of 
  the defence, he held that the DNA evidence derived from the gum samples was 
  admissible:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Before application for the warrant was made, investigators 
      conceived and carried out a plan to provide opportunity to obtain epithelial 
      cells from the accused’s mouth for DNA analysis. The plan was intended to 
      circumvent the accused’s refusal on the advice of counsel to provide bodily 
      samples. Investigators knew the accused was not required to provide such 
      samples and that any consent by him was ineffective unless fully informed.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The plan involved the accused chewing and discarding gum 
      while in custody, either in the detention centre, a police car, or the court 
      house. The ploy was to be implemented incidental to a court appearance on 
      this charge of first degree murder.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Two female police officers were selected to transport 
      the accused in an attempt to create an atmosphere conducive to acceptance 
      of the gum. The officers were to respond if spoken to and were to participate 
      in conversation unrelated to the case. The sliding window into the back 
      seat of the police car was left open for this purpose. Gum was to be offered, 
      officer to officer, accepted, and then offered to the accused. Acceptance 
      by the accused was to be voluntary. The officers were not to suggest, persuade 
      or insist. They were neither to ask for the return of the chewed gum, nor 
      to suggest the accused discard it. If the accused swallowed the gum or put 
      it in his pocket, nothing was to be done. If the gum was discarded, they 
      were to retrieve it.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The toilet bowl in the court house security cell was drained. 
      Paper towelling was placed to catch anything dropped in the bowl. A clean 
      waste basket was placed outside the cell to provide another opportunity 
      for the accused to deposit the gum. I find the following facts: </span></p>
    <p>1)  On May 1, 1995, in the course of transportation by two female uniformed 
      London Police officers in a marked police car from the Detention Centre 
      to the court house for remand on this charge, the accused was offered a 
      stick of chewing gum.</p>
    <p>2)  Entirely independent of police suggestion or inducement other than 
      the offer, the accused voluntarily accepted and chewed the gum.</p>
    <p>3)  While the accused was in a holding cell, he voluntarily and entirely 
      independent of police action or inducement, discarded the chewed gum in 
      the “dry” toilet bowl.</p>
    <p>4)  That gum, which was immediately retrieved with latex gloves and a sterile 
      vial, was submitted for DNA analysis.</p>
    <p>5)  As the accused left the cell en route to court, a security constable 
      who was unaware of the plan asked in the course of his normal duty, if he 
      had anything in his mouth. The accused replied that he had “spit it out.”</p>
    <p>6)  On the return trip to the Detention Centre, the accused was offered 
      and voluntarily and entirely independent of police suggestion or inducement 
      other than the offer, accepted and chewed a second stick of gum.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>7) The accused knew gum was an unauthorized item in the 
      Detention Centre.</span></p>
    <p>8)  Upon arrival at the Detention Centre, the accused voluntarily and entirely 
      independent of police suggestion or inducement discarded the chewed gum 
      in a trash can in the security garage.</p>
    <p>9)  That gum was retrieved and submitted or DNA analysis.</p>
    <p>10)  The accused removed the gum from his mouth and abandoned it in each 
      instance because of his perception that gum was not appropriate either in 
      court or in the Detention Centre.</p>
    <p>11)  Had the accused been detected with gum in the Detention Centre readmission 
      process, he would have been required to dispose of it without penalty.</p>
    <p>12)  The police officers presented the opportunity for the accused to unwittingly 
      circumvent his decision not to supply bodily samples. They extended neither 
      encouragement nor persuasion.</p>
    <p>13)  The accused did not know chewed gum could provide bodily material 
      suitable for DNA analysis. Had he known, he would not have accepted the 
      gum.</p>
    <p>14)  The trick was premised on the accused’s ignorance or oversight about 
      possible consequences flowing from abandoning chewed gum.</p>
    <p>15)  The gum was not seized pursuant to warrant.</p>
    <p>16)  The accused did not consent to the gum being seized.</p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge approached the question of admissibility 
  from two perspectives. First, he considered whether the plan and its implementation 
  involved a breach of the appellant’s “residual s. 7 <i>Charter</i> protection 
  against self-incrimination”. Second, he considered whether the seizure of the 
  discarded gum constituted a violation of the appellant’s right to privacy under 
  s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. In the end, he concluded that the gum was not obtained 
  in a manner that violated the appellant’s rights under either s. 7 or s. 8 of 
  the <i>Charter</i>. Hence, he ruled that the DNA evidence derived from the gum 
  was admissible.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to s. 8, the trial judge found 
  that the police did not need a warrant to seize the discarded gum because having 
  discarded it, the appellant could no longer claim a privacy interest in it. 
  Accordingly, in his view, s. 8 was not triggered. That analysis, though reasonable 
  at the time, did not find favour with the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. 
  Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.). Writing for the majority, 
  Cory J. stated the following at p. 348:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Thus, where an accused who is not in custody discards 
      a kleenex or cigarette butt, the police may ordinarily collect and test 
      these items without any concern about consent. A different situation is 
      presented when an accused in custody discards items containing bodily fluids. 
      Obviously an accused in custody cannot prevent the authorities from taking 
      possession of these items. Whether the circumstances were such that the 
      accused had abandoned the items and relinquished any privacy interest in 
      them will have to be determined on the particular facts presented in each 
      case.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With her usual candor, Ms. Fairburn for the 
  Crown concedes that in the circumstances of this case, it cannot be argued that 
  in discarding the gum, the appellant relinquished his privacy interest in it. 
  Accordingly, she accepts that the warrantless seizure of the gum by the police 
  constituted a violation of his s. 8 <i>Charter </i>rights.</span></p>

  </span></span> On behalf of the appellant, Ms. Lavine, subject to one aspect 
  of it, generally accepts the submissions made by Ms. Fairburn in respect of 
  s. 24(2).  She takes issue with Ms. Fairburn’s characterization of the gum as 
  “non-conscriptive” evidence. In her opinion, the gum should be classified as 
  “conscriptive” evidence because it emanated from the appellant during the execution 
  of a trick orchestrated by the police and it did not exist in a form usable 
  by the state prior to the implementation of the trick. Accordingly, Ms. Lavine 
  submits that the DNA evidence derived from the gum should have been excluded

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our view, the resolution of this issue hinges 
  on whether the police improperly elicited the gum samples from the appellant. 
  The trial judge addressed this issue, albeit in the context of a s. 7 <i>Charter</i> 
  inquiry designed to determine whether the trick used by the police amounted 
  to an improper subversion of the appellant’s decision, on the advice of counsel, 
  not to provide bodily samples to the police.</span></p>

  </span></span> The trial judge gave extensive reasons for concluding that the 
  conduct of the police did not subvert or violate the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> 
  rights. Applying a similar analysis to that endorsed by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in cases such as <i>R. v.</i> <i>Hebert</i> (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 
  and <i>R. v. Broyles</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span> 
  [2] </span></a>, the trial judge’s reasons, in their essence, are found in the 
  following passages from his ruling:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>State subterfuge does not equate to improper active elicitation. 
      <i>Hebert</i> [<i>supra</i>] did not prohibit deception. State tricks which 
      would effectively deprive the suspect of the constitutional right to choose 
      whether to speak to police must be excluded. Otherwise <i>Hebert</i> reaffirms 
      the investigative right to encourage the suspect by legitimate means to 
      provide evidence.</span></p>
    <p align="center">. . .</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Is the trick of offering gum to the accused in the expectation 
      that it would be discarded, objectionable as an act of elicitation by the 
      state causing subversion of a constitutional right? Elicitation is considered 
      in <i>R. v. Broyles </i>at page 320 by Iacobucci J. as follows:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>“In my view, it is difficult to give a short and precise meaning of 
          ‘elicitation’, but rather one should look to a series of factors to 
          decide the issue. These factors test the relationship between the state 
          agent and the accused as to answer the question, ‘Considering all of 
          the circumstances of the exchange between the accused and the state 
          agent, is there a causal link between the conduct of the state agent 
          and the making of the statement by the accused?”</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Was the relationship between the two police officers and 
      the accused such that police conduct was causally linked to the accused 
      discarding the chewed gum? The officers carrying out the trick were obviously 
      police. They purported to be nothing else. No unlawful conduct was directed 
      toward the accused or anyone else. The subterfuge involved no active deception, 
      unfairness, threats, promises, or coercion. There was neither inducement 
      nor persuasion apart from making gum available. Nothing was done to actively 
      elicit the accused accepting, chewing, returning or discarding the gum.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Availability of the gum either caused the accused to provide 
      the evidence as the defence contends, or created an opportunity for the 
      accused to provide the evidence as the Crown contends. The fallacy in the 
      former proposition is demonstrated by consideration of the accused’s options. 
      He could decline the offer. He could accept the gum to chew later, to present 
      to a friend, to retain, conceal and use for some unauthorized scheme at 
      the Detention Centre, or to chew and swallow as is often done by witnesses.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The ploy is not objectionable. The trick was entirely 
      passive. The passive element was analogous to placing an undercover officer 
      in a cell with an accused for no purpose but to listen, thereby opportunity 
      for the accused to speak to someone is provided. By offering gum, police 
      created opportunity. Whether anything resulted depended on the accused. 
      His actions following acceptance were entirely of his own volition. The 
      choice to accept, chew and discard the gum closely parallel McLachlin J.’s 
      statement in <i>Hebert</i> at page 42:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>“If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she 
          must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform 
          police.”</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Police resort to this trick is not disqualified as a dirty 
      trick, one “that shocks the community.” DNA evidence has a potential for 
      impactive trial consequences relating to identification. It would be more 
      probable that public consciousness would be shocked if upon a charge of 
      first degree murder no further investigative attempt was made to marshall 
      such significant evidence.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>This is no more than police acting, in the words of Finlayson&nbsp;J.A. 
      in <i>Johnston</i> [(1991) 64 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.)], in “the duty 
      of the state to continue an investigation into a shocking crime.” The accused’s 
      declaration that he will not provide bodily samples does not equate to an 
      order restraining further investigative procedures. The accused has no constitutional 
      right to end that phase of the investigation.</span></p>

  the issue at hand. In short, we agree, for the reasons given by the trial judge,

  Crown’s application for a general warrant, the other to the admissibility of

  for bail and on June 30, 1995, his application was dismissed. At that time, 
  it was agreed that the trial would be postponed until November 6, 1995. In the

  his reasons on the admissibility of the DNA evidence derived from the chewing 
  gum and the propriety of the general warrant sought by the Crown. As indicated, 
  he found that the gum was obtained in a manner that did not violate the appellant’s 
  <i>Charter</i> rights. With respect to the general warrant, he found that it 
  too was proper and that it could be used to obtain the appellant’s dental impressions, 
  but only if the authorities did not use force in the process. In other words, 
  without the appellant’s compliance, the impressions could not be made.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In light of this, on August 15, 1995, four days 
  after the release of the trial judge’s rulings, the Crown applied for a DNA 
  warrant. In support of the warrant, Detective Constable Goodine of the London 
  police prepared and swore a 32-page affidavit setting out in detail the facts 
  and circumstances surrounding the murder of Phuong Tran, including the finding 
  of seminal fluid in her vagina, the DNA evidence from the chewing gum linking 
  the appellant to that fluid, and other evidence implicating the appellant in 
  the crime. The affidavit also disclosed the trial judge’s earlier ruling in 
  which he had refused to admit the bodily samples obtained from the appellant 
  on the day of his arrest due to a breach of his s. 10(b) rights by the police. 
  Insofar as the gum sample was concerned, the affidavit noted that the trial 
  judge’s ruling on the “admissibility of the gum is still subject to appeal” 
  and that the blood sample being sought would likely provide more accurate DNA 
  information than that already obtained from the gum sample. In short, the issuing 
  judge was provided with an accurate and detailed summary of the salient facts. 
  Based on this information, the warrant was issued on August 15, 1995 and executed 
  the next day.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At trial, the defence did not contest the validity 
  of the DNA warrant. Rather, the admissibility of the blood sample was challenged 
  on the basis that it was causally linked to the earlier violation of the appellant’s 
  s. 10(b) rights. The trial judge, in our view, properly rejected that argument 
  and ruled that the blood sample and the DNA evidence derived from it were admissible.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellant does not seek to resurrect 
  the causal link argument. Rather, he submits that had the issuing judge known 
  that in addition to violating his s.&nbsp;10(b) rights, the police also violated 
  his s. 8 rights by seizing the gum sample without a warrant, he would not have 
  issued the DNA warrant because he would not have been “satisfied that it is 
  in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so” under s.&nbsp;487.05.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect, we see no merit in that argument. 
  Assuming, without deciding, that a pattern of wilful and flagrant misconduct 
  on the part of the police could lead a judge to deny a DNA warrant on the ground 
  that it would be contrary to the best interests of justice to do so, this is 
  not such a case. The s. 8 violation, upon which the appellant relies to tip 
  the scales, was not serious. As indicated, the seizure of the gum samples did 
  not interfere with the appellant’s bodily integrity, nor did it cause him any 
  loss of dignity. In doing what they did, the police were acting in good faith 
  on the advice of senior Crown counsel at a time when the law of abandonment 
  and its relationship to s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> was at best uncertain. In 
  these circumstances, it is fanciful to think that the issuing judge would not 
  have issued the warrant had he known of the s. 8 violation. Accordingly, we 
  would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

  In type written form, it comprises some 261 pages. With respect to the issue 
  of voluntariness, it appears from the record that no one adverted to it until 
  the investigating officer had completed reading most of the morning statement 
  into the record in the presence of the jury. At that time, when the officer 
  was at page 255, defence counsel (not Ms. Lavine or Mr. Copeland) noticed, presumably 
  for the first time, a comment made by the investigating officer to the appellant 
  namely, that if he [the appellant] did not wish to tell his side of the story, 
  he was going to be taken “down to the cells now”. Upon hearing that comment 
  read out in open court in the presence of the jury, defence counsel asked that 
  the jury be excused. She then made this submission to the trial judge:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>[Defence Counsel]: Yes, Your Honour. The area of concern 
      that I have with respect to the last portion that Sergeant Carter was reading 
      to us and I understand when we did the voir dire -- or I should say when 
      [co-counsel] basically conducted the voir dire with respect to the admissibility 
      of things and one of them was the statement, that was concentrated on was 
      the issue under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What was not canvassed 
      to my understanding, and I believe I was here but it was a while ago, was 
      the voluntariness of the statement. Now, up to now I haven’t had concerns 
      about the voluntariness of the statement. That certainly was canvassed in 
      terms of -- well, at the motions that Mr. Nguyen went in the police cruiser, 
      but he went voluntarily and he was free to leave, et cetera.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>But now what we have in this particular portion of the 
      statement, as I see it, is “If you don’t want to tell me your side of the 
      story then I’m going to lead you down to the cells”. In other words, that 
      may be interpreted, in my respectful submission, as a threat. “You’re going 
      to stay incarcerated unless you tell me your side of the story”. So the 
      continuation of the statement from then on, in my submission, with respect 
      to voluntariness may not be admissible.</span></p>

  had not already been dealt with in the context of the trial judge’s comprehensive 
  s. 10(b) ruling. Upon reviewing that ruling, the trial judge realized, to his 
  surprise, that it had not. He then gave the following ruling in response to 
  defence counsel’s request for a <i>voir dire</i> to determine the issue of voluntariness:</span></p>
<blockquote>

      within the context of <i>Ibrahim</i> [[1914] A.C. 599]. It seems to me to 
      be equally compatible with the interpretation that “If you haven’t any more 
      to say, your side of the story, the interview is over, you are an arrested 
      man and the place for you is in the cell” and I view it in that context.</span></p>

    <p>THE COURT:  [Defence counsel] just with respect to the point you raised

      defence not introducing character evidence, Crown is leading the evidence 
      and so on that I just, for my own reference. At page 77 I saw -- or no, 
      excuse me. 88, I saw a reference to the death penalty and I thought the

      nothing for you”. I wondered how close that was to inducement or something 
      and -- but I obviously decided it wasn’t as I let the matter go, but at 
      90 -- at 103, again, at the top of the page, “You’re not doing yourself 
      any good”. I was thinking in the same terms in that context. But the reason 
      I draw this to your attention is if there are matters that arise from this 
      transcript that require special instruction, I’ll be grateful to counsel 
      for the assistance that I get in that respect.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Finally, just as a generality, through the reading of 
      the statement, I was conscious of the confrontational tone, “I don’t believe 
      you, and I don’t believe you for this reason and that reason”, and I can’t 
      think of the two case names. One of them is <i>Ward</i> and the other one 
      is a companion that’s always associated with it and begins with it, it begins 
      with M, but it’s the psychological breaking down of the accused and I thought 
      this was confrontational, but it wasn’t any psychological breaking down 
      and the proof of the pudding is he didn’t break down.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In oral argument, Mr. Copeland for the appellant 
  fairly conceded that when defence counsel first raised the issue of voluntariness 
  with the trial judge, her submission that “up to now [p. 255 of the transcription] 
  I haven’t had concerns about the voluntariness of the statement” amounted to 
  a belated admission of voluntariness in respect of everything that proceeded 
  the impugned comment at page 255. We see no reason to question that concession. 
  Accordingly, there is no basis for questioning the admissibility of the morning 
  statement up to page 255. In that regard, we find it reassuring that despite 
  defence counsel’s failure to raise the voluntariness issue in a timely fashion, 
  the trial judge made it clear, in his subsequent remarks reproduced above, that 
  he had been alive to the issue of voluntariness as the statement was being read-in 
  and despite some tentative reservations, he did not consider voluntariness to 
  be a problem. The trial judge was uniquely positioned to make that assessment 
  and we see no reason to question his conclusion.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the remainder of the morning 
  statement, that is, from page 255 to the end, we think that in light of defence 
  counsel’s objection, the trial judge should have conducted a <i>voir dire</i> 
  to determine whether the impugned comment about returning the appellant “to 
  the cells now” amounted to a threat. That said, to the extent the failure to 
  hold a <i>voir dire</i> amounted to error, we are satisfied that the error was 
  harmless and that the verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the 
  balance of the statement following page 255 had been excluded. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In so concluding, we acknowledge that in his 
  closing address to the jury, Crown counsel referred to two answers given by 
  the appellant after the alleged threat at page 255 and he invited the jury to 
  infer from those answers that the appellant must have killed Phuong Tran because 
  he knew, prior to the information being disclosed, that she had been beaten 
  to death. There are however, two reasons for treating the matter as one of harmless 
  error. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the answers to which the Crown was referring 
  do not, in our view, bear out the inference suggested by the Crown and this 
  would have been obvious to the jury. In effect, Crown counsel was inviting the 
  jury to speculate, something the trial judge warned against in his charge.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, even if the jury did consider the appellant’s 
  answers as indicative of knowledge and hence guilt, this was but a small item 
  in an otherwise overwhelming circumstantial case against the appellant. Without 
  it, the verdict of the jury would inevitably have been the same. Accordingly, 
  we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The charge in this case predated <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> 
  (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). Accordingly, the impugned instruction must 
  be viewed in that context. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Before defining the term reasonable doubt in 
  his charge, the trial judge provided the jury with clear instructions on the 
  presumption of innocence and he explained that the burden of proof rested with 
  the Crown and it never shifted. He then defined the term reasonable doubt as 
  follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>What is reasonable doubt? It’s rarely possible to prove 
      anything with absolute certainty so the burden of proof on the Crown is 
      only to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. When I speak of reasonable 
      doubt I use the words in their ordinary, natural meaning, not as a legal 
      term having some special connotation. A reasonable doubt is an honest and 
      a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It’s a real doubt, not 
      an imaginary or frivolous doubt that we might conceive to avoid the unpleasant 
      responsibility of having to convict someone. </span></p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Importantly, because the case against the appellant 
  rested entirely on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge, on no less than 
  three separate occasions, instructed the jury that in order for the Crown to 
  meet its burden, they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
  appellant’s guilt was the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven 
  facts. One such instruction is found at pages 1459 and 1460:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>… In circumstantial evidence, the additional uncertainty 
      is whether the correct inference has been drawn. Those inferences must not 
      be guesses. They must not be speculation. They must be rational inferences 
      based on proven facts. </span></p>
    <p><span>                                    </span>…</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>With respect to circumstantial evidence, the Crown does 
      not discharge the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt unless you are 
      satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to 
      be drawn from the proven facts is the guilt of the accused.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 
  449 at p. 543 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J. for the majority observed that when appellate 
  courts are called upon to review “a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> jury charge”, they “must 
  examine it to make sure that it was in substantial compliance with the principles 
  set out in that case”. When the instructions in this case, considered as a whole, 
  are measured against that yardstick, we are satisfied that the “substantial 
  compliance” test has been met. </span></p>

  </span></span> Manifestly, in light of <i>Lifchus</i> and its progeny, the trial 
  judge should not have told the jury that they were to consider the words reasonable 
  doubt “in their ordinary, natural meaning, not as a legal term having some special 
  connotation”. Moreover, he should have made it clear that the criminal standard 
  of proof was substantially higher than the civil burden of proof. In our view 
  however, those deficiencies are overcome by the fact that the charge as a whole 
  was fair, balanced and otherwise error-free, it properly linked the criminal 
  standard of proof with the presumption of innocence and it contained three separate 
  specific instructions on the high onus the Crown must meet to discharge its 
  burden in a circumstantial case.<a

  we are confident that the jury would not have been misled as to the proper standard 
  of proof. (See <i>R. v. Feeley</i> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (C.A.) per MacPherson 
  J.A. for the majority and <i>R. v. Rhee</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.).

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant received a fair trial and the 
  verdict of first degree murder was eminently reasonable on the evidence properly 
  admissible against him. Indeed, in our view, it was inevitable. To the extent 
  that the trial judge erred in his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> analysis in relation to 
  the chewing gum and in his failure to hold a <i>voir dire</i> on the issue of 
  voluntariness with respect to the tail end of the appellant’s morning statement, 
  the errors were harmless and occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice. Accordingly, we would uphold the conviction for first degree murder
