<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This appeal arises out of a decision of a Ministry of Labour 
  inspector relating to a work refusal by members of the Union that took place 
  in 1998.  At the center of the dispute was the failure of the Ministry’s inspector 
  to conduct an investigation “in the presence of” the parties to the dispute 
  as required by s. 43 (7) of the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> (“the 
  <i>Act</i>”).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The inspector decided the dispute against the 
  Union and the Union appealed the decision of the inspector to the Ontario Labour 
  Relations Board.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Prior to the hearing before the Board, the Union and the employer 
  Ministry entered into a settlement of the work refusal dispute.  The remaining 
  legal issue before the Board related to s. 43 (7) of the <i>Act</i> and the 
  Board concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to issue remedies against 
  inspectors or the Ministry of Labour.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Union sought judicial review of the Board’s decision.  The 
  Divisional Court dismissed the application for delay.  The Union then appealed, 
  with leave, to this court.  The order requested in its factum that is most relevant 
  to this motion seeks a declaration that the Board had jurisdiction in an appeal 
  under the <i>Act</i> to order an inspector or the Ministry of Labour to comply 
  with the <i>Act</i>, including ss. 43(7) and 62(1).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In June 2001, after leave to appeal to this 
  court had been granted, s. 43(7) of the <i>Act</i> was amended and the words 
  in the section “in the presence of” were replaced by the words “in consultation 
  with”.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As stated above, the work refusal issue was settled between the 
  parties.  In addition, the recent amendment to s. 43 (7) appears to have altered 
  the practice that, the Union alleged, contravened the <i>Act</i>.  There is 
  no “live controversy” left between the parties with respect to the legal issue.  
  Accordingly, there would be no practical effect of an order remitting the matter 
  to the Board.  The appeal is moot.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is not a case in which this court should exercise its discretion 
  to hear a moot appeal.  The Union has for the first time raised in this court 
  a <i>Charter</i> issue in respect of which there is no evidentiary record.  
  While the Union takes the position that it seeks only to use the <i>Charter</i> 
  as an interpretative tool, the position of the respondent Ministry is that it 
  wishes to retain the right, if so advised, to lead s. 1 evidence in respect 
  of the <i>Charter </i>issue.  The very same issue has now been raised in another 
  proceeding initiated by the Union and presently pending before the Board that 
  engages the amended s.&nbsp;47(3).  In our view, the incomplete record and considerations 
  of judicial economy speak strongly against exercising our discretion to hear 
  an appeal that is moot.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appeal is quashed.  As discussed with counsel, 
  we make no order respecting costs for or against any of the parties to the appeal.</p>

  </span></b> <b>DOHERTY J.A. (Dissenting):</b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree that the appeal is moot.  The settlement between the 
  employer and the appellant eliminated the factual dispute.  The amendment to 
  s. 43(7) of the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 
  (the <i>Act</i>) rendered the precise legal issue on which the Board would eventually 
  have had to rule moot.  I would, however, hear the appeal for the following 
  reasons.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the narrow legal issue underlying the dispute between the 
  parties is moot, there is a broader and much more important issue raised by 
  the preliminary motion brought before the Board by the Ministry of Labour.  
  The Ministry asked the Board to decide as a preliminary matter whether the Board 
  had jurisdiction to make orders against inspectors or the Ministry.  The Board 
  concluded that it had no such authority and consequently never reached the merits 
  of the appellant’s argument that the inspector had not complied with s. 43(7) 
  of the <i>Act</i>.  The question of the scope of the Board’s remedial power 
  is, in my view, directly before the court on this appeal.  It remains very much 
  alive and does not turn on the precise wording of the former s. 43(7) of the 
  <i>Act</i>.  The question of the Board’s power to make orders against inspectors 
  and the Ministry arises under the wording of the present s. 43(7) and other 
  provisions of the <i>Act</i>.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This court can decide the question of the Board’s power to make 
  the kind of orders in issue here without regard to the specific statutory language 
  of s. 43(7) of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The remedial power of the Board raises a question of significance 
  and importance to the parties in the context of their ongoing employer/employee 
  relationship.  The court has the advantage of full argument on all sides of 
  the issue.  It also seems to me that those involved in the ongoing employer/employee 
  relationship and the Board itself would be better off if the question of the 
  Board’s power to make the kinds of orders in issue in this case was resolved 
  by this court sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I also see no deficiencies in the present record which would 
  impede the determination of the issue I have outlined above.  Counsel for the 
  appellant made it clear that he relies on s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> only to 
  the extent that the values underlying that section inform the interpretation 
  of the relevant sections of the <i>Act</i>.  This is not, as I understand it, 
  a “<i>Charter</i> case”.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For the reasons outlined above, I would hear 
  the merits of the appeal even though it is moot.</span></p>
