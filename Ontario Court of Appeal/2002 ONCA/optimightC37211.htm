  appeal from a judgment of Kealey J. dated October 25, 2001 giving effect to 
  a Letter of Request issued on the application of OptiMight Communications, Inc. 
  (“OptiMight”), on April 20, 2001, by Magistrate Judge Seeborg of the United 
  States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Letter of 
  Request seeks the assistance of Ontario courts in enforcing an order for production 
  of 34 categories of documents by Innovance, Inc. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> 
  [1] </a>, as well as oral discovery on 19 specific topics of three named senior 
  officers of the corporation and one unnamed corporate representative. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       OptiMight is the 
  plaintiff in the California proceeding. It claims that a former employee, Dr. 
  Lucas Hsu “misappropriated highly confidential and proprietary trade secrets” 
  and then left its employ after only three months to take up a position at Innovance, 
  Inc.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> OptiMight 
  advances claims in the litigation against Dr. Hsu and ten unnamed parties. Innovance,

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Relying on <i>R. 
  v. Zingre</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 392, the motions judge allowed the application 
  for enforcement of the Letter of Request, finding that “[t]he international 
  common interest of sovereign states require each to give effect to the other’s 
  laws and judicial decisions unless there be sound reasons not to do so”. He 
  also held that no “restriction, limitation or adjustment is required [to the 
  terms of the Letter of Request] given the existence of the joint defence agreement 
  between Innovance and Hsu”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       The appellants 
  claim that the Letter of Request is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and that 
  it permits irrelevant discovery amounting to a “fishing expedition”, which extends 
  to Innovance, Inc.’s trade secrets. They submit that the scope of the Letter 
  of Request should be narrowed; that oral discovery should be limited to only 
  one corporate representative; and that Innovance, Inc. or its counsel, should 
  be entitled to disclosure of the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       I would allow 
  the appeal in part by limiting the scope of production and discovery permitted 
  by the Letter of Request to categories of documents and topics for deposition 
  not objected to before us. I would also order that this limitation shall lapse 
  upon OptiMight disclosing to counsel for the appellants particulars of the trade 
  secrets it has disclosed to Dr. Hsu on the terms set out at the conclusion of 
  this endorsement.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       OptiMight is a 
  fibre optics company engaged in developing technologies for long-distance transmission 
  of optical signals over fibre optic cables. It claims that it can increase the 
  distance an optical signal can travel without degradation from 500 kilometres 
  to 4,000 kilometres through use of its proprietary technology. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Significantly, 
  OptiMight claims that frequency modulation of optical signals is an innovative 
  aspect of the technology it uses, and that other technologies use amplitude 
  modulation only. OptiMight’s trade secrets relate to: the frequency modulation 
  pattern it has identified as optimal (referred to as full spectrum wave division 
  multiplexing in the Letter of Request) in permitting long distance transmission 
  of optical signals; the device that generates that frequency modulation pattern; 
  and the conditions that permit the device to generate the necessary frequency 
  modulation pattern.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      OptiMight hired 
  Dr. Hsu on May 1, 2000. It alleges that he worked in a high level position and 
  had access to its proprietary technology. It also alleges that Dr. Hsu resigned 
  on August 2, 2000, without prior notice; and that he commenced working for Innovance, 
  Inc. on August 3, 2000 as Vice-president of Technology, in what it describes 
  as “suspicious circumstances”:</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

  a company”.</p>

  for the Northern District of California made an order in the California action 
  denying, on a without prejudice basis, requests by OptiMight for a Letter of

  District Court Northern District of San Jose Division, California issued a protective 
  order in the California action, which applies to production and discovery between 
  both parties and non-parties. The order provides that highly confidential documents 
  and information produced in the litigation may be designated so that only the 
  court (under seal), outside counsel and independent experts will be given access,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On April 20, 2001 Magistrate Judge Seeborg issued an order dated April 
  20, 2001 authorizing issuance of the Letter of Request. It included the following 
  findings: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[OptiMight] contends that its former employee Dr. Lucas Hsu absconded with 
      trade secrets [footnote omitted] belonging to OptiMight, and that Dr. Hsu 
      has transferred these trade secrets to a new fiber optic company, Innovance 
      Networks, of Ottawa, Canada. OptiMight has sued Dr. Hsu and unnamed Does 
      … OptiMight has not made Innovance Networks a defendant.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>OptiMight investigated the circumstances following Dr. Hsu’s departure, 
      and found indications that on his last full day at OptiMight, Dr. Hsu had 
      copied files containing information pertaining to OptiMight’s trade secrets 
      … While denying that he expropriated trade secrets or breached his confidentiality 
      agreement with OptiMight … Dr. Hsu does not dispute that he copied some 
      OptiMight files to his Innovance laptop computer .</p>
    <p>…<u></u></p>
    <p>On October 10, 2000, Judge Whyte granted OptiMight’s request for expedited 
      discovery, and expressly authorized discovery into the nature of “Innovance’s 
      business.” … <u>Based upon a request from Dr. Hsu to hasten discovery, Judge 
      Whyte directed the parties to attempt to complete fact discovery by April 
      27, 2001. … Thus, while it might have been more efficient for the plaintiff 
      to finish reviewing Hsu’s responses to OptiMight’s … requests [and] interrogatories 
      once received, [footnote omitted] it cannot be said that the proposed Letter 
      of Request is premature.</u></p>
    <p><u>Dr. Hsu also argues that the proposed Letter of Request is premature 
      in that OptiMight’s identification of trade secrets was inadequate. [footnote 
      omitted] However, Dr. Hsu has <i>not </i>moved to compel OptiMight to refine 
      its identification of trade secrets, nor sought to meet and confer with 
      OptiMight counsel on this issue. Dr. Hsu has also not specified the particular 
      manner in which OptiMight’s identification of trade secrets are inadequate 
      and insufficient to allow the defendant and the court to determine relevance. 
      [footnote omitted] The court cannot therefore exclude this discovery as 
      premature on this record</u>.<u></u></p>
    <p>            …</p>
    <p><u>This is not a case, however, where a discovery burden is imposed on 
      an uninvolved nonparty. Dr. Hsu is himself a Vice-President of Innovance, 
      and he has not challenged OptiMight’s characterization of him as an Innovance 
      co-founder. Innovance is indisputably an interested party in many of the 
      events of central importance in this matter</u>. [emphasis added]</p>

  </span> OptiMight issued a subpoena out of the United States District Court 
  for the District of Delaware requiring Innovance, Inc. to produce documents 
  alleged to be relevant to the California litigation. The categories of documents 
  to be produced under the subpoena are virtually identical to the categories 
  set out in the Letter of Request. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On June 28, 2001 Chief Judge Robinson of the United States District 
  Court for the District of Delaware narrowed the scope of production required 
  pursuant to the Delaware subpoena “as much of the requested discovery exceeds 
  the scope of Judge Whyte’s order.” </p>

  </span> Magistrate Judge Seeborg granted a motion for clarification of his April 
  20, 2001 order on August 15, 2001. The August 15, 2001 order provides, in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a matter of United States law, neither the Letter of Request nor the 
      related Order of this Court is “in violation” of the scope of discovery 
      of Innovance authorized by United States District Court Judge Ronald M. 
      Whyte. On October 10, 2000, Judge Whyte issued an order granting both OptiMight 
      and Dr. Lucas Hsu the right to conduct limited discovery prior to the January 
      19, 2001, Initial Case Management Conference. By action of law and the Federal 
      Rules of Civil Procedure, the limitations to discovery imposed by Judge 
      Whyte have lapsed.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>The Order and Letter of Request were signed on April 20, 2001. Neither 
      party appealed the Order and Letter of Request, and the time for appeal 
      has expired. Accordingly, as a matter of United States law, the Order of 
      April 20, 2001, and the related Letter of Request, constitute valid, binding 
      and final orders of the United States /District Court for the Northern District 
      of California, and alone define the scope of the discovery-related judicial 
      assistance sought from the judicial authorities in Canada.</p>

  </span> On September 12, 2001 Magistrate Judge Seeborg made an order granting

  </span> Although it does not directly allege that Dr. Hsu transferred trade 
  secrets to Innovance, Inc., OptiMight seeks enforcement of a broad right of 
  production and discovery in order that it can explore the extent to which Dr. 
  Hsu has transferred trade secrets to Innovance, Inc., with or without that company’s 
  knowledge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> OptiMight contends that the motions judge in Ontario exercised his discretion 
  properly in declining to limit the scope of the Letter of Request and that further, 
  there is no basis in United States law for the court to order disclosure of 
  trade secrets to a non-party. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In a declaration made October 9, 2000 Dr. Hsu claims that he did not 
  misappropriate confidential information and that, in any event, the concepts 
  and ideas generally described in OptiMight’s materials as constituting its trade 
  secrets are well known throughout the fibre optics industry.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As already noted, the appellants claim that the Letter of Request is 
  overly broad, unduly burdensome, and that it permits irrelevant discovery. They 
  acknowledge that Innovance, Inc entered into a Joint Defence Agreement with 
  Dr. Hsu by letter dated December 6, 2000. They maintain however that that agreement 
  does not permit Dr. Hsu or his counsel to disclose the particulars of OptiMight’s 
  trade secrets to Innovance, Inc. or its lawyers, nor to direct Innovance, Inc.’s 
  position in relation to the litigation. </p>

  </span> Subsequent courts have considered these same factors, in whole or in 
  part, when determining whether to narrow the scope of documentary production 
  required under a Letter of Request: <i>Acton v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, Inc.</i>, 
  [1992] O.J. No. 43 (C.A.), <i>Pecarsky v. Lipton Wiseman Altbaum &amp; Partners

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In support of their submission that the scope of the Letter of Request 
  is overbroad the appellants point, in particular, to categories 3 (items (a) 
  to (d)), 6 and 26 of the permitted categories of documentary discovery. Reference 
  to one sub-category illustrates the issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> CATEGORY 6</p>
    <p>All documents relating to your research, testing, development, product 
      planning or competitive position relating to a) the use of frequency modulated 
      optical pulses to facilitate either full spectrum wave division multiplexing 
      <u>or any other optical source technology for use in transmitting optical 
      signals over long distances;</u> …<b> </b>[emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The concern with the emphasized language is that it exposes Innovance, 
  Inc. to a possible requirement to produce its own trade secrets without a mechanism 
  for ensuring that any trade secrets it is required to produce are truly germane 
  to the California litigation. However, OptiMight asserts that if Innovance, 
  Inc. is using frequency modulated optical pulses for long distance transmission 
  of optical signals, that is both a sufficient trigger to require production 
  of all information that Innovance, Inc. possesses concerning that technology 
  and a sufficient limit on the scope of production. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The presenting issue here is very much, which company “should go first” 
  in revealing its trade secrets, albeit subject to the disclosure restrictions 
  set out in the protection order. I am mindful that Innovance, Inc. has chosen 
  not to reveal whether it uses frequency modulated optical pulse technology to 
  facilitate long distance transmission of optical signals, and not to assist 
  with specifics of any technical parameters that would better define the scope 
  of discovery. Nevertheless, it is also significant, in my view, that Dr. Hsu’s 
  motion for further particulars of OptiMight’s trade secrets was allowed only 
  after the order authorizing the Letter of Request was made.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The transcript of the hearing held on April 11, 2001 makes it clear 
  that Magistrate Judge Seeborg recognized there is a challenge involved in attempting 
  to fashion an order requiring disclosure of all relevant information indicating 
  whether Innovance, Inc. has used OptiMight’s technology, without permitting 
  a “fishing expedition”. He specifically noted the risk inherent in the language 
  “the use of any other optical source technology for use in transmitting optical 
  signals” as potentially authorizing “a fishing expedition”. Nonetheless, based 
  on his assessment of the competing interests, he opted for an order that is 
  broader rather than narrower in its scope, to avoid the possibility that relevant 
  information would not be captured. Further, Magistrate Judge Seeborg made a 
  specific finding that because Dr. Hsu had not moved for particulars of OptiMight’s 
  trade secrets the motion for a Letter of Request was not premature.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The competing interests relating to enforcement of the Letter of Request 
  in Ontario are somewhat different. Relevance of the evidence sought is a factor 
  recognized as being significant to that determination. Although Innovance, Inc. 
  is not an <i>uninvolved </i>entity<i>, </i>unlike Dr. Hsu, it is not a party 
  to the California action. Dr. Hsu’s failure to seek particulars of OptiMight’s 
  trade secrets prior to April 20, 2001 does not bar Innovance Inc.’s entitlement 
  to point to the September 12, 2001 order for particulars as having a bearing 
  on the scope of production and discovery that should be enforced. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, there is merit to the contention that the scope of production 
  and discovery imposed on Innovance, Inc. is overly broad when neither the court 
  imposing the burden on the foreign non-party, nor the foreign non-party itself, 
  have access to the same particulars of the allegedly misappropriated trade secrets 
  as the resident party to assist them in assessing the relevance of the information 
  requested. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A review of the Joint Defence Agreement does not in any way alleviate 
  this concern. I accept the appellants’ submission that it does not authorize 
  Dr. Hsu either to disclose particulars of OptiMight’s trade secrets to Innovance, 
  Inc. or to direct Innovance, Inc.’s response to the Letter of Request.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the protection order preserves, to a significant degree, Innovance, 
  Inc.’s privacy interest in its trade secrets, it does not relieve it from the 
  prospect of irrelevant, overly broad, and unduly burdensome production and discovery. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, in the particular circumstances of this case, the motions 
  judge erred in endorsing the Letter of Request without requiring production 
  to legal counsel for the appellants, of the same particulars of the trade secrets 
  disclosed to Dr. Hsu, to provide the appellants with a means of determining 
  what is or is not relevant to the respondent’s claim. The appellants should 
  however comply in any event with those aspects of the Letter of Request to which 
  they did not object before us.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I find no valid objection to the requirement that four persons be produced 
  for oral discovery, as that appears consistent with California practice, provided 
  the scope of the discovery is limited by the disclosure referred to above.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would accordingly allow the appeal in part by limiting the scope of 
  production and discovery to the categories of documents and topics for deposition 
  not objected to before us by the appellants, which are listed in Schedule “A”. 
  This limitation shall cease to apply 21 days following disclosure of the particulars 
  to legal counsel for the appellants of the trade secrets disclosed to Dr. Hsu. 
  Any such disclosure shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 8 of the 
  Protective Order dated February 23, 2001 made in the California action, and 
  as if counsel for the appellants were outside counsel. In addition to other 
  objections already authorized by the terms of the judgment under appeal, production 
  and discovery required shall be subject to the right of the appellants to object 
  to any aspect thereof based on relevance. Any objections raised may be adjudicated 
  from time to time in accordance with paragraph 1(g) of the Judgment dated October 
  25, 2001. Counsel for Innovance may advise the court in writing of any errors 
  or omissions in Schedule “A” within seven days following the release of this 
  judgment. Counsel for OptiMight may respond in writing within 7 days following 
  any objection by Innovance.</p>

    Dr. Hsu is a named co-founder and Vice-President of Innovance, Inc. Counsel 
    appear, however, to advance conflicting positions concerning which company 
    employed Dr. Hsu. Counsel for OptiMight claims it was the Ontario corporation, 
    albeit possibly misnamed, whereas counsel for Innovance claims it was the

    differentiate clearly between the two corporations. </p>

    “I am currently employed by Innovance, who has offices in New Jersey and Ottawa, 
    Canada. … As part of the offer to join Innovance, I was named a co-founder. 
    …My main current task at Innovance is to recruit engineers for Innovance and 
    to set up the New Jersey office for the company.”</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Peter Allen, a founder, president, and chief executive 
    officer of Innovance, Inc. deposes in a declaration made October 10, 2000, 
    that: “Innovance [earlier defined as Innovance, Inc.] was incorporated in 
    April 2000”, and  has offices in Ottawa, Canada and New Jersey.” He also says: 
    “Dr. Hsu accepted Innovance’s offer of employment, and commenced employment 
    … on or about August 3, 2000, as Vice-president of Technology…”</p>
