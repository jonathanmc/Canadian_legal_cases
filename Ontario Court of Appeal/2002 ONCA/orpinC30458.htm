<p>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice Charles F. Doyle, sitting
  with a jury, dated April 17, 1998 and from the sentence imposed by Justice
Doyle dated May 27, 1998. </p>
<p>FINLAYSON J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from convictions and a six-year global sentence
  on thirteen counts of historical assaults and sexual offences committed against
  five of his female patients from approximately 1977 to 1989. </p>
<p>OVERVIEW </p>
<p>[2] The appellant is a former doctor who, although he had not completed his
  training in psychiatry, practised as a psychotherapist in Toronto and Ottawa.
  In treating his patients he employed unconventional, even bizarre, therapies
  that were variously described as “talk therapy,” “primal therapy,” “regression
  therapy,” “rebirthing” and “therapeutic touch.” His treatments of patients
  frequently included sexual contact that progressed to spanking, bondage, oral
  sex and/or sexual intercourse. He used drugs such as Ketamine, a veterinary
  and human anesthetic that can cause dream-like states and hallucinations, on
  some of the women. One of the women, K.S., alleged that the appellant committed
  forced anal intercourse during a “therapy” session. The appellant also engaged
  in romantic relationships, which evolved out of the therapeutic relationships
  he had with some of the complainants. </p>
<p>[3] The appellant was charged and committed to stand trial on nineteen counts.
  The counts included assault, assault causing bodily harm, indecent assault,
  sexual assault, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, gross indecency, assault
  with a weapon, and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The appellant entered
  a plea of not guilty at trial. At trial Crown counsel withdrew one count of
  assault in respect of an alleged spanking incident involving one of the complainants. </p>
<p>[4] At trial before a judge and jury the appellant did not testify but his
  counsel admitted that most of the sexual activity occurred. The appellant's
  defence at trial was three-fold. First he argued that some of the alleged acts
  had simply not taken place. Second he argued that some of the alleged touching
  was legitimate therapy, or at the very least that he genuinely believed the
  conduct was legitimate therapy aimed at correcting problems the patients identified
  in their sex lives. With respect to the admitted sexual acts such as intercourse,
  the appellant maintained that not all of them took place within the therapeutic
  relationship, but rather that some occurred in the context of romantic affairs
  with the complainants. Third, he argued that the complainants consented to
  all the sexual acts he admitted to or that he honestly believed they had consented
  to them. </p>
<p>[5] The Crown argued that the alleged acts had taken place. The Crown also
  argued that the appellant knowingly abused his position of authority in respect
  of these vulnerable women and that any professed consent was therefore vitiated
  by fraud. </p>
<p>[6] At trial the Crown presented two similar fact witnesses, L.B. and M.T.,
  who claimed to have suffered similar abusive treatment at the hands of the
  appellant. While M.T. testified at the trial, L.B., who now lives in the United
  States, was unwilling to attend court for the trial and did not actually testify.
  Rather, pursuant to the principled exception to the admission of hearsay in <em>R.
  v. Khan </em> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.), her hearsay evidence from
  a 1987 professional misconduct hearing at the College of Physicians and Surgeons
  was read-in. </p>
<p>[7] A second witness' testimony was also read in. K.S, who testified at the
  preliminary hearing, was excused from testifying at trial due to ill health
  and the trial judge allowed her preliminary hearing testimony to be read into
  evidence. </p>
<p>[8] Both sides presented testimony from a number of experts in a number of
  areas. The evidence of the experts was important as it related to doctor and
  patient relationships, the issue of <em>bona fides </em>in sexual acts that
  occur during therapy, and ultimately the issue of consent. The experts all
  agreed, in substance, that there is a power imbalance in the therapist-patient
  relationship. They disagreed on whether it is inherently harmful for a patient
  to be engaged in a sexual relationship with a therapist. At the very least,
  one defence psychiatrist testified, not all doctors would have known in the
  early 1980s that such relationships are harmful to patients. In any event,
  the defence expert concluded there is nothing inherent in such relationships
  that would prevent a patient from being able to consent to sexual activity.
  He did agree that when a drug causing an altered state of mind is used on a
  patient before any mention of sex, then the ability to consent must be questioned. </p>
<p>[9] At the end of four weeks of testimony the jury deliberated for four days.
  However, prior to putting the case before the jury, the trial judge dismissed
  one count of criminal negligence causing <em>bodily </em>harm after concluding
  that the provisions of s. 204 as amended to s. 221 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>,
  R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as amended, did not cover the <em>psychological </em>harm
  being alleged. </p>
<p>[10] On April 17, 1998 the appellant was convicted of five counts of sexual
  assault, two counts of assault causing bodily harm, two counts of assault with
  a weapon, two counts of assault, and two counts of gross indecency. The appellant
  was acquitted of one count of indecent assault and one count of assault. The
  jury was deadlocked on two counts of sexual assault and the trial judge declared
  a mistrial on those counts. The appellant was sentenced to a total of six years
  imprisonment. </p>
<p>ANALYSIS </p>
<p>[11] I am of the view that there must be a new trial in this case. Therefore,
  I do not propose to go into the evidence in any detail, with the exception
  of the testimony provided by K.S. and the similar-fact hearsay evidence of
  L.B., each of which presents special problems. However, those individual cases
  aside, all the verdicts of guilty are fatally flawed by the failure of the
  trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on what in law constitutes consent
  in the peculiar circumstances of the alleged assaults. This is a stand-alone
  impediment to the Crown upholding the result below. However, this confusion
  over the issue of consent also spilled into the trial judge's instruction on
  the theory of the defence and in the result the appellant was denied a fair
  hearing. </p>
<p><strong>The Trial Judge's Instructions on Consent </strong></p>
<p>[12] In the circumstances of this case there was a significant risk that the
  jury would have been confused about the proper test to apply to determine the
  issue of consent. In a similar case, <em> R. v. Makray </em> (1982), 70 C.C.C.
  (2d) 479, this court determined what it considered appropriate in a charge
  to the jury. In that case an acupuncturist was charged with two counts of indecent
  assault arising from touchings and examinations conducted by him on two of
  his female patients. At trial the Crown argued that the appellant held himself
  out as a doctor and that the complainants' consent was obtained by false and
  fraudulent representations as to the nature of the treatments. Makray's appeal
  from conviction was allowed. Zuber J.A., for the court, held as follows, at
  p. 480: </p>
<p class="indent">The issue of whether or not the appellant is a medical doctor
  in this case is not determinative. The jury was, of course, entitled to take
  this evidence into consideration along with all the other evidence in deciding
  the <em>central
  issue of fact, that is, whether or not the examination and touching was a part
  of the bona fide process of diagnosis and treatment because it was to this
  alone that consent was given. </em>[emphasis added.] </p>
<p class="indent">The [trial judge's] instructions
    to the jury, however, do not assist in the identification of this issue as
    pivotal to conviction. The instructions leave it open to the jury to conclude
    that a misrepresentation by the appellant that he was a medical doctor would
    be a sufficient basis for conviction. In the identification of the real issue
    in this case the trial judge would, of course, also identify the credibility
    of the two complainants and the appellant as critical in the resolution of
    that issue. In our view, there was non-direction which amounted to misdirection
    in this case and as a result the verdict cannot stand. [Emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[13] In the case at bar, the judge made a number of fatal errors in relation
  to the charge on consent. He failed to instruct the jury that its first task
  was to determine whether the criminal acts alleged in fact occurred. He then
  should have instructed them to distinguish between the alleged sexual acts
  that occurred within the therapeutic relationship and those which occurred
  outside of the therapeutic relationship. His instruction failed to specify
  that in order to convict with respect to the acts that occurred within the
  therapeutic relationship, the jury would have to determine that the complainants
  consented to the therapy and that it was not <em>bona fide </em>therapy because
  to the extent the jury found the complainants consented to treatment, that
  consent would only have extended to acts done for a <em>bona fide </em>therapeutic
  purpose. Finally, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that in relation
  to those alleged acts, if any, which the jury found occurred outside of the
  therapeutic relationship, that they were to approach those acts as they would
  sexual assault in any other case: i.e. by determining whether the complainants
  gave valid consent. </p>
<p>[14] Instead the trial judge operated under the erroneous assumption that
  all of the conduct complained of was conducted under a therapeutic umbrella.
  Compounding this problem, the trial judge further confused the issue of consent
  by instructing the jury that each complainant would have to have given an “informed
  consent” to the various acts in which they engaged with the appellant in order
  for the consent to be valid. </p>
<p>[15] The trial judge's instruction on “informed consent” was as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">Consent means the voluntary agreement of the complainant to
  engage in the sexual activity in question. Evidence that the complainant struggled
  or resisted the accused is obviously very significant to this determination.
  But failure to resist does not necessarily mean consent. This is not an exhaustive
  list. You may find other factors that may assist you in your determination
  of this issue. Remember, the consent must be a true consent in that it was
  a genuine <em>and
  also an informed consent </em>or decision by the complainant to engage in the
  sexual activity. </p>
<p class="indent">There should be <em>full information that is granted to a
    victim before it becomes an informed consent. </em>But if it is not an informed
    consent, if there are so many things left out of an explanation, then of
    course the consent is simply not valid, if it affects of course that the
    victim or the complainant had in mind. </p>
<p class="indent">There is no consent where submission
  results from force, threats, fraud or the exercise of authority. </p>
<p class="indent">The agreement
    must come from the complainant, who must be capable of consenting to the
  activity. <em>The
    complainant cannot be induced into consenting by someone abusing a position
    of trust. </em>Further, there is no consent if the complainant
    expresses, by word or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity.
    Likewise, there is no consent where the complainant agrees to engage in sexual
    activity and then expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to
    continue with the activity. When a person consents to being touched, that
    consent only covers a certain amount of touching. It does not cover touching
    that goes beyond consent. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>[16] The trial judge went on in his charge to refer to s. 149 of the <em>Criminal
    Code </em> (as it was in 1978) dealing with assault on a female <em>simpliciter </em>.
    However, he then referred immediately to s. 149 (2) dealing with consent
    obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality
    of the act and erroneously imported the medical concept of “informed consent” into
    s. 149(2). He said: </p>
<p class="indent">You [the jury] have to determine then the consent that's required now, <em>according
    to all of these medical associations </em>and even the case law…. [I]f a
    consent was obtained by false or fraudulent representations as to the nature
    and quality of the act – in other words, it means that there is no informed
    consent….[Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>[17] He also defined “informed consent” by reference to the expert evidence
  thereby confusing the issue of whether the therapy was <em>bona fides </em> with
  whether the complainants were fully informed within the medical meaning of “informed
  consent.” </p>
<p class="indent">But basically speaking, the doctors are saying that – Dr.&nbsp;Robinson
  [the Crown psychiatrist] said that there was to be no sexual relations, there
  was to be no touching, touch therapy, or things of that nature, so that you
  have to then decide whether there is a full consent, full informed consent
  that has been given and whether the patient was properly dealt with in the
  sense that the patient had consented to sexual intercourse taking place. </p>
<p class="indent">With
    respect to some of the case law, it says this: </p>
<p class="indent">Thus the nature of a complainant's relationship to her alleged
  assaulter, including the patient's lack of power and knowledge as well as the
  doctor's duty to perform medical examinations <em>only </em> for the good of
  the patient and in the patient's best interest, must be kept in mind when determining
  whether the patient in fact consented to the conduct in question. [Emphasis
  in original]. </p>
<p class="indent">This is generally what is meant by the consent. There is a
  matter of full disclosure that must be made or that is expected to be made
  to the patient before entering into these relationships or entering into sexual
  intercourse or some other lesser activity – sexual activity with the therapist. </p>
<p>[18] Taken together, these excerpts from the trial judge's charge demonstrate
  how the charge as a whole, clouded in the words of Zuber J.A., the “issue … pivotal
  to the conviction” of whether the acts were part of the <em>bona fide </em>therapeutic
  treatment to which the complainants consented. </p>
<p><strong>The Trial Judge's Review of the Appellant's Defence </strong></p>
<p>[19] The trial judge's charge became trapped in the issue of the alleged therapeutic
  treatment that the appellant is said to have been administering. This likely
  resulted in the trial judge's treatment of the appellant's defence as limited
  to the issue of whether there was consent within the concept of consent in
  a doctor/patient relationship. </p>
<p>[20] The trial judge did not even put to the jury the appellant's denial that
  the events occurred or his argument that those which did occur did not take
  place in the circumstances that the complainants described. He ignored firstly,
  that defence counsel adamantly denied that certain of the conduct ever occurred
  ( <em>e.g. </em>, allegations by K.S. of violent serial rape and sodomy). This
  argument is totally inconsistent with a defence that the sex was consensual
  and raises no air of reality that the complainants consented to such conduct.
  By restricting the appellant to the defence of consent, the trial judge as
  good as invited the jury to convict on these counts. </p>
<p>[21] Secondly, the trial judge ignored defence counsel's contention that many
  of the admitted acts of intercourse were not actually part of any therapy but
  arose within the context of romantic relationships that evolved out of therapeutic
  relationships the appellant had with the complainants. The trial judge's instructions
  failed to capture this theory and did not include a sufficient review of the
  evidence to illuminate this prong of the defence theory. His constant repetition
  of the need for “an informed consent”, the obligations within “fiduciary relationships”,
  and the concerns about “representations as to the nature and quality of the
  act” restricted the appellant's defence to the sole issue of whether or not
  the complainants had consented to therapy that included sexual intercourse. </p>
<p>[22] The trial judge's basic misconception of what in law could amount to
  consent bleeds into the instruction on the theory of the defence to give a
  skeletal and misleading charge. On the theory of the defence the trial judge
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">The defence now for Dr. Orpin is simply to the effect that the consent was
  obtained by each of the persons. Nobody objected to it, and that is correct,
  that no one seems to have objected to certain – to opposition to any of these
  things. You've got spankings, you've got sexual intercourse to consider. If
  you do come to the conclusion that these things are true as a result of coming
  through from the mouth of several witnesses, then you have to decide whether
  there is consent on any of these questions. And if there is consent to it,
  then of course Dr. Orpin would have to be acquitted of all of those charges
  that deal with – if you are satisfied that there is nothing other than consent
  that has been given to Dr. Orpin, that would be the end of things, of all of
  the counts on the indictment. </p>
<p>[23] This charge lacks any specifics in respect of the individual complainants
  and ignores completely the appellant's denials that certain of the alleged
  conduct even occurred. The evidence respecting K.S. on counts relating to gross
  indecency, sexual assault, assault with a weapon, and sexual assault causing
  bodily harm is important here because it illustrates conduct by the appellant
  that permits of no air of reality to a defence of consent. It also demonstrates
  the need to refer to the evidence and relate the different defences raised
  to that evidence. K.S.'s preliminary hearing testimony, which was read-in at
  trial due to her ill health, was dramatically illustrative of conduct that
  the appellant conceded occurred and that the appellant justified as therapy,
  as well as conduct that he simply denied occurred, and conduct that he argued
  arose out of a personal relationship which evolved out of the therapy sessions. </p>
<p>[24] K.S. testified at the preliminary hearing that she began to see the appellant
  in June or July of 1987 because of marriage difficulties. He presented various
  therapies to her, including primal therapy, magnetic fields, biofeedback, gas
  inhalation therapy, hypnosis and psychotherapy. She told the appellant that
  she did not want to engage in primal therapy. He gave her literature that included “The
  Art of Spanking.” He often employed hypnosis. During one such session, without
  seeking her consent, he bound her hands above her shoulders. She tried to struggle
  out of the trance but the appellant “counted her down” in an effort to put
  her in a deeper trance. She said the bondage was painful and that she told
  the appellant to “stop it.” He untied her. </p>
<p>[25] As a supplement to hypnosis he practised “Reichi” therapy, in which he
  put her head on his lap, near his groin, and moved her head and neck slowly
  to relax the muscles, then repeated the motions on her rib cage and breasts,
  under her blouse. Her breasts were numb, she said, so that she did not realize
  at the time that she was being violated. She alleged on that occasion during
  the therapy he committed forced anal sex and that the following week he forced
  her to have vaginal intercourse. </p>
<p>[26] The appellant through counsel vigorously denied the allegations of forced
  anal sex but conceded that most of the other conduct occurred and argued that
  it was justified as therapy to which K.S. had consented. </p>
<p>[27] However, there is another segment of her evidence that describes conduct
  that can never be therapy and much of which she could not have consented to
  in law: see <em> R. v. Jobidon </em> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (S.C.C.). She
  testified that she continued therapy with the appellant and, on one occasion,
  accompanied him to his cottage, where he put her under hypnosis, took hold
  of her wrists and forced her to go upstairs. There, he shoved her face into
  a pillow, beat her backside with an object, stripped her, anally raped her
  and shoved her into bed. Thereafter, the couple followed a pattern by which
  they had one session at the appellant's office, after which they went to his
  cottage for another session, which frequently involved anal rape and beatings.
  Among other things, she said that she was tied to exercise ropes with black
  ropes and blacked out. She suffered bruises on her buttocks that lasted for
  several weeks. </p>
<p>[28] On the other hand, and reflecting adversely on her credibility, she saw
  the appellant outside of his office during 1988, including a trip with him
  to Parry Sound, and frequently had sex with him. She began to work for him
  after the therapeutic relationship ended and they went out together in public
  socially. Near the end of the relationship, in early 1989, the appellant used
  Ketamine on her, despite her objection. It paralyzed her body but not her mind.
  She was able to “trip on it” but she could not speak while under its effects.
  While she severed the relationship in 1989, she admitted in cross-examination
  that she and the appellant had a few sexual encounters between 1989 and 1992. </p>
<p>[29] Appellant's counsel repeatedly objected to the trial judge's instruction
  to the jury on the issue of consent and its relationship to the theory of the
  defence. Counsel protested that the trial judge was treating all sexual acts,
  including the anal intercourse, which was adamantly denied by appellant's counsel,
  as part of the therapy, when he instructed the jury that there would have to
  be an informed consent to that conduct. </p>
<p>[30] The trial judge re-charged the jury twice but on the first occasion he
  merely repeated what he had said in his first charge. After further objection
  he gave a third instruction, which, in the context of his example relating
  to K.S., simply made it worse. After confirming with the jury that the transcript
  of K.S. had been read to them the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">I think I have been speaking of informed consent. I won't even bother to say “informed
  consent”. But with respect to consent, I would ask you, if [K.S.] should have
  been told something about the December 3 rd , ‘87 [the first act of anal intercourse] – in
  other words, I won't use the word “informed consent”. I have in the past. But
  let's say that we just talk about consent. Should she have been told about
  what was going to happen on that day, December 3 rd 1987. I assume that you
  read something about that particular occasion. But in any event, if you think
  that she should have been told something, you figure out then what it was that
  she should have been told that was coming on December 3 rd , 1987, and then
  you decide what the result of that would be with respect to the principles
  that we have discussed, I think in the past two or three days, perhaps not
  fully or whatever it is. </p>
<p>[31] The appellant's defence to the beatings, the bondage and the anal rape
  was that these things did not happen at all. Consent on any definition was
  not put forward as a defence with respect to these acts. To restrict the appellant's
  defence to consent was most unfair to the appellant. </p>
<p>[32] In my opinion, a suitable charge which recognized the appellant's defence
  and appropriately put the issue of consent to the jury ought to have included
  these four critical questions: </p>
<p class="indent">1. Do you find that the alleged sexual acts occurred; </p>
<p class="indent">2. If
    you find that these acts did occur was each sexual act part of a therapeutic
  session and/or for a therapeutic purpose; </p>
<p class="indent">3. If you find that each sexual
    act was part of a therapeutic session or for a therapeutic purpose was the
    therapy <em>bona fide </em>; and </p>
<p class="indent">4. If you find that the sexual acts occurred
      but were not part of a therapeutic session or for a therapeutic purpose,
      did the complainant give a valid consent to the sexual act? </p>
<p>Failure to so charge the jury rendered the trial unfair and is a ground in
  itself for ordering a new trial. This failure has particular application to
  the counts in which K.S. was the complainant. Hers was the most damning evidence
  of all and yet was read in from the preliminary hearing without benefit of
  cross-examination before the jury. This made it all the more important that
  the trial judge clearly set out the defence and instruct the jury as I have
  set out above. </p>
<p><strong>The Similar Fact Evidence </strong></p>
<p>[33] By admitting L.B.'s testimony from a prior proceeding to be read-in as
  similar fact evidence, the trial judge gave an overly broad interpretation
  to the “necessity” requirement in the principled exception to the hearsay rule.
  The trial judge admitted L.B.'s evidence as similar fact evidence <em>via </em> a
  transcript of an earlier proceeding. The transcript was from her testimony
  at a 1987 College of Physicians and Surgeons' disciplinary hearing in which
  she testified against the appellant. As a result of that hearing the appellant's
  license was revoked. This testimony was of little probative value at the trial
  since the issue before the College was an accusation of sexual touching of
  a patient and before the College, consent to such acts was irrelevant and was
  not raised as a defence. </p>
<p>[34] At the time of the trial, L.B. was living in the United States and expressed
  her reluctance to come to Canada to testify. As a result, the trial judge admitted
  her testimony from the disciplinary hearing as similar-fact evidence under
  the “principled approach” in <em>Khan </em>, <em> supra </em>. This evidence
  was particularly damning because K.S. in her secondary evidence stated that
  hearing of the appellant's treatment of L.B. approximately one year later triggered
  her memory of events. </p>
<p>[35] L.B.'s evidence was that in 1984 she began to see the appellant because
  of depression related to her marriage and infertility problems. At the first
  session, the appellant described his treatment methods to her as a combination
  of primal therapy, transactional analysis and psychotherapy. He told her not
  to tell anyone about what went on at the sessions. </p>
<p>[36] At one session the appellant pushed and shoved her around the head and
  shoulders and held her down on a futon. He said that he was trying to make
  her angry so that she would stick up for herself. </p>
<p>[37] At three sessions in September 1984 he touched her in a sexual manner.
  He rubbed and hugged her in various places. At the third session, after he
  gave her something to read about spanking, he asked her to kneel over a stool,
  then pulled up her skirt, pulled down her pants and strapped her with a belt.
  When she told the appellant that he was hurting her, the appellant continued
  to spank her with a bare hand. She suffered bruises and welts from the spankings. </p>
<p>[38] The relationship evolved into an intimate one. They took walks in the
  Gatineaus, held hands and hugged. On one occasion, she visited the appellant
  at his apartment. He undressed her and he had her undress him. They engaged
  in various sex acts short of intercourse. The therapy ended in November 1984
  but she continued to attend his workshops. After one workshop, the appellant
  asked her to go with him for a drink. They went back to his office and had
  intercourse. Following the last workshop she attended in late 1984 they went
  to a hotel where the appellant had made a reservation. They had intercourse
  and spent the night together. Similar events occurred in the following weeks. </p>
<p>[39] On this appeal the appellant takes objection to the admissibility of
  this evidence on the basis that L.B. was available and that accordingly resort
  to the principled exception to the admission of hearsay in <em>Khan </em>, <em>supra </em>, <em></em>was
  not justifiable as necessary. </p>
<p>[40] Detective Brian Card of the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police Force (as
  it then was) testified at the <em>voir dire </em>into the admission of L.B.'s
  similar fact evidence. He had been investigating the Orpin case since August
  1994. He gave evidence about his efforts to contact L.B. and to convince her
  to testify at the trial. Detective Card's first contact with L.B. was at her
  Ontario residence on September 25, 1995, during which he informed her of the
  criminal investigation into the appellant's conduct. </p>
<p>[41] At that initial meeting, L.B. delivered to Detective Card “a lot of correspondence” between
  her and a lawyer who had acted on her behalf during the 1987 College disciplinary
  hearings. This correspondence included statements she had written for the College
  prosecutors. She gave copies of the statements to Detective Card even though
  the police had already seized copies of them from the College. Detective Card
  reviewed her statement with her and “went over what happened to her during
  her time as a patient.” </p>
<p>[42] In 1995 L.B. gave a fresh statement to the police and, as a result of
  her statement the police laid several criminal charges against the appellant
  with respect to her allegations. </p>
<p>[43] To the best of Detective Card's knowledge L.B. left Ontario in August
  of 1996. He testified that he found out “through an answering message at her
  home” that she was living in the United States. Detective Card called her in
  an effort to have her testify at the preliminary inquiry. The following exchange
  took place at the preliminary hearing in direct examination between Detective
  Card and the prosecutor regarding L.B.'s attendance: </p>
<p class="indent">Q. When you spoke to her, did she indicate whether she was
  willing to return to Canada to testify at the preliminary hearing in this matter?  </p>
<p class="indent">A. No. She advised me that she no longer wished to come back
  and testify, that she thought about it and that it was her wish not to come
  back and go through the process again. </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Did she elaborate on her reasons
    for that? </p>
<p class="indent">A. She was newly married, or not – she had been married by
  another husband, because her husband, during the time of John Orpin had – was
  killed and she's remarried – </p>
<p class="indent">Q. A motor vehicle accident? </p>
<p class="indent">A. In a motor vehicle accident.
    And she had remarried, and she felt, now that she was away from Ottawa and
    out of Canada, that she can try and get her life back together, and this
  would be too stressful for her to go through again. </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Is she still residing
    in the United States of America? </p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, she is. </p>
<p>[44] It is evident from Detective Card's cross-examination that when he was
  told that L.B. “did not want to return to go though the process again” he made
  no effort to persuade her otherwise. As he put it, “I did not pursue it after
  she told me. I respected her wishes”. </p>
<p>[45] Evidently the trial judge admitted L.B.'s hearsay evidence as necessary
  on the basis that she refused to come to Ottawa to testify at the preliminary
  hearing and was therefore, unavailable for trial. That is placing her position
  much too high. She did not want to come and the police officer did not pursue
  the matter. Additionally neither Detective Card, nor the prosecutor, appears
  to have explored the possibility of compelling her testimony by taking commission
  evidence. </p>
<p>[46] This court held in <em>Khan v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of
    Ontario </em> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 10, that necessity cannot be equated
    with mere unavailability of a witness. Necessity in that case was about the
    need to place a child's evidence before the relevant tribunal. Doherty J.A.,
    for the court, held as follows, at 24: </p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the child testifies will clearly impact on the necessity of
  receiving his or her out-of-court statement. <em>Necessity cannot, however,
  be equated with unavailability. </em>In <em>Khan </em>, McLachlin J. instructs
  us that necessary means “reasonably necessary” (at p. 104). In the context
  of cases involving an alleged sexual assault on a child, reasonable necessity
  refers to the need to have the child's version of events pertaining to the
  alleged assault before the tribunal charged with the responsibility of determining
  whether the assault occurred. In my view, if that tribunal is satisfied that
  despite the viva voce evidence of the child, it is still “reasonably necessary” to
  admit the out-of-court statement in order to obtain an accurate and frank rendition
  of the child's version of the relevant events, then the necessity criterion
  set down in <em>Khan </em> is satisfied: see Anne McGillivray, “R. v. Laramee
  : Forgetting Children, Forgetting Truth” (1991), 6 C.R. (4th) 325 at pp. 335-41.
  [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>[47] Similarly this court's judgment in <em>R. v. Finta </em> (1992), 73 C.C.C.
  (3d) 65 at 199, aff'd on other grounds (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.)
  stated: </p>
<p class="indent">Properly understood, the principle of necessity means not that the hearsay
  evidence is necessary for a party to prove his case, but that hearsay is the
  only available means of putting that evidence before the court. To be admissible,
  the evidence must be relevant to, but not necessarily dispositive of, an issue,
  and for hearsay to be admissible, it must be the only way of tendering that
  relevant evidence. Furthermore, it must exhibit indicia of reliability not
  required of evidence capable of being tested in court by cross-examination. </p>
<p>[48] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <em>R. v. Charles </em>, [1997] 3
  W.W.R. 556, allowed an accused's appeal from conviction in a case of domestic
  assault on the basis that the trial judge erred in admitting the victim's three
  out-of-court statements. The victim, the appellant's common law spouse, made
  three hearsay statements before trial alleging that the appellant and his son
  had beaten her. She made the first to a women's shelter worker, the second
  to a police officer, and the third in testimony at the son's trial. The case
  for necessity was based on the complainant's failure to appear in court on
  the date of the trial. Cameron J.A., after reiterating the proper approach
  to determining “necessity” noted, at paras. 4 and 6: </p>
<p class="indent">[4] She [the complainant] had failed to appear on an earlier occasion as well,
  though having been served with a subpoena, and in consequence a bench warrant
  for her arrest as a witness had then been issued. Rather than act upon the
  warrant, the prosecutor chose to serve her with a fresh subpoena, though for
  one reason or another, not disclosed at trial, he did not expect her to show
  up. … </p>
<p align="center">. . . . </p>
<p class="indent">[6] … [T]he trial judge was in no position to find that the complainant was
  unavailable or unable to testify as a witness by reason of death, as in <em>R.
  v. Smith </em>; or of testimonial incapacity or incompetence, as in <em>R.
  v. Khan </em> and <em>R. v. Rockey </em>; or of non-compellability, as in <em>R.
  v. Hawkins </em>. Indeed he could not so much as find she was unavailable or
  unable to testify, except in the soft sense she was not then present, could
  not readily be located, and apparently did not wish to appear and testify.
  And even at that, it was impossible for him to know the reason for this. … </p>
<p>[49] In concluding that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence on
  the basis of necessity Cameron J.A. said the following, at paras. 9-11: </p>
<p class="indent">[9] Barring speculation, the complainant's failure to appear
  for the purpose of testifying cannot be specifically attributed. It can no
  more be attributed to fear and the threat of reprisal, let us say, than to
  affection and a desire to reconcile. And these are but limited examples of
  the myriad of forces potentially at work in these situations. Moreover, this
  speaks only to her absence. Whether, had she been present, she might or might
  not … have been willing to testify
  cannot be known. </p>
<p class="indent">[10] While the requirement of “necessity” remains to be bounded
  more fully than at present, making it difficult on occasion to determine whether
  it has or has not been fulfilled, we are satisfied the trial judge went too
  far in this instance. One might say the rationale for the principled exception
  to the hearsay rule lies in expedience, but it is not founded in expedience
  or convenience of the nature or degree relied upon by the trial judge. The
  concerns he acts upon, while no doubt real enough, are of highly dubious relevance
  to the application of the exception. Indeed, to find ”necessity,” based on
  nothing more than what was before the court in this instance, is virtually
  to find that this pre-condition to the admission of hearsay exists generally,
  and by definition, when it comes to the prosecution of spousal charges of assault
  and the allegations of the complaining spouse. </p>
<p class="indent">[11] In other words the mere
  unwillingness of the complaining spouse to testify at trial would constitute
  necessity. However generously and flexibly the notion of “necessity” is to
  be construed and applied, we do not think it can be made to extend this far
  without exceeding its bounds. The effect of so treating the exception to the
  rule would be to virtually abrogate the rule itself or its application. </p>
<p>[50] Similar reasoning can apply to this case. In my view, the trial judge
  evidently misapprehended the evidence regarding L.B.'s position on testifying.
  He stated that she had refused to attend for the trial. But her refusal had
  not been established. Moreover, there was no evidence before the trial judge
  that her testimony was non-compellable. In my view, the transcript of her evidence
  before the College of Physicians and Surgeons cannot meet the test of necessity
  as the courts, and indeed Crown counsel, defined it. </p>
<p>[51] In addition, this evidence likely would not meet the threshold test for
  reliability, as the transcript of the College hearing contained no cross-examination
  on the crucial issue of consent. L.B.'s evidence is probative of one issue
  only. That is the issue of whether sexual conduct occurred between the appellant
  and L.B. That issue is not contested here. The evidence does not provide any
  assistance on the issue of consent nor does it impeach the appellant's credibility. </p>
<p>[52] As appellant's counsel argued on appeal, it would be improper to rely
  on L.B.'s evidence from the disciplinary hearing. The only issue canvassed
  at the hearing was whether the alleged sexual acts had occurred, as the fact
  of sexual touching by a physician effectively constituted the offence. L.B.
  was not cross-examined at the disciplinary hearing on the issue of consent,
  which was central to the criminal trial. </p>
<p>Disposition </p>
<p>[53] For the reasons set out above, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
  convictions below and order a new trial. </p>
