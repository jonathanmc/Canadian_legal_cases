<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice David Fairgrieve 
  dated August&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2001. </p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is a Crown appeal from a 30 day conditional sentence imposed by 
  Fairgrieve J. on the respondent following his plea of guilty to two charges 
  of breach of probation.  On June 14, 2001, a short time after he had been released 
  from prison for breach of several court orders, the respondent became involved 
  in conversation with two boys aged nine and eleven years.  The respondent said 
  that he preferred young boys and liked to have them put their penises in his 
  mouth.  The boys became scared and went home.  The respondent did not touch 
  the boys.  The following day, one of the boy’s parents saw the respondent in 
  the same area and he was arrested.  At the time, the respondent was on probation.  
  The order included a term that the respondent not contact or communicate with 
  a young person under the age of 16 years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The sentence hearing before the trial judge extended over five days.  
  The trial judge heard from the Chief Psychologist at Millbrook Correctional 
  Centre, where the respondent had recently served a sentence of imprisonment, 
  from the respondent’s probation officer, and from the respondent’s mother.  
  The parties filed a number of reports, including the respondent’s extensive 
  file from Millbrook.  The trial judge also had the benefit of extensive submissions 
  from counsel for the Crown and the respondent.  It is apparent from his reasons 
  that the trial judge had studied the written material and gave careful consideration 
  to the oral submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This was a highly unusual and very difficult case.  The respondent is 
  not only a paedophile, but suffers a major mental illness and is of borderline 
  normal intelligence.  He is reluctant to take medication to treat his mental 
  illness and to curb his sexual drive.  His low intelligence makes some types 
  of therapy problematic.  Although he recognizes the need to obey court orders, 
  he is unwilling or unable to comply.  There are few community supports for him.  
  He has little, if any, family support.  In the brief periods when the respondent 
  is not in prison he lives in a shelter for homeless men.  His probation officer 
  had made referrals to a treatment centre that might be able to cope with the 
  respondent’s multiple problems but the respondent was unwilling or unable to 
  follow up.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, Crown counsel, not Ms. Kingston, sought a sentence of two 
  years imprisonment and three years probation.  Defence counsel, not Mr. Cohen, 
  sought a sentence of six to twelve months’ imprisonment and suggested that it 
  be a conditional sentence.  At the time of the sentencing, the respondent was 
  subject to a three year probation order imposed in July 2000 to follow an 11 
  month prison sentence.  The respondent had spent two months and nine days in 
  pre-sentence custody.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having heard extensive evidence and reviewed a wealth of written material, 
  the trial judge concluded that there was some reason for optimism.  The respondent 
  had recently voluntarily been taking his anti-psychotic medicine and his sex-drive 
  reducing medication.  He had a good relationship with his probation officer, 
  who was prepared to devote the extra time that this offender required.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We do not agree with Crown counsel that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the seriousness of the offences.  We agree with the trial judge that the sentence 
  proposed by Crown counsel at trial would have offended the proportionality principle.  
  See <i>R. v. Legere</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (Ont. C.A.) at 566-67.  As 
  Arbour J. said in <i>R. v. Knoblauch</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) 
  at 13:  “There is no mechanism in criminal law to remove dangerous people from 
  society merely in anticipation of the harm that they may cause. The limit of 
  the reach of the criminal sanction is to address what offenders have done.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown argues that the respondent was simply ineligible for a conditional 
  sentence because the evidence showed that he was a risk to the community and 
  that the trial judge so found.  The trial judge recognized that the respondent’s 
  multiple psychiatric and other problems made him a risk to re-offend.  The point 
  of the 30 day sentence was to first take into account the pre-sentence custody 
  and respond in a measured and proportional way to the conduct underlying the 
  offences.  The point of making the sentence conditional was to provide a mechanism 
  to ensure that the respondent found a residence, established contact with his 
  probation officer and resumed the taking of his medication that was interrupted 
  by the arrest.  Section 742.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not exclude dangerous 
  offenders from the conditional sentence regime.  Rather, as pointed out in <i>Knoblauch</i> 
  at p. 16 and <i>R. v. Proulx </i>(2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 
  68, the focus of the analysis is on the risk posed by the offender while serving 
  his sentence in the community. There was some basis for the trial judge taking 
  the view that within the short period of the conditional sentence, the respondent 
  would not re-offend.</p>

  </span> In the circumstances, we are not prepared to interfere with the trial 
  judge’s somewhat unusual disposition.  The trial judge was struggling with a 
  very difficult case.  Many other types of dispositions including prison and 
  probation had been tried and had failed to protect the community.  While it 
  would probably have been more appropriate for the trial judge to have imposed 
  a sentence of immediate imprisonment in the range suggested by defence counsel, 
  we cannot say that the trial judge made any error in principle or that the sentence 
  was manifestly inadequate.  Given the extensive record placed before the trial 
  judge, this was very much a case where this court should accord deference to 
  the trial judge.  As Lamer C.J.C. said in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 
  C.C.C. (3d) 327 at 374-75:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art 
      which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against 
      the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, 
      while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions 
      of and in the community. <u>The discretion of a sentencing judge should 
      thus not be interfered with lightly</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
