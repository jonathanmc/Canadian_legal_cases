<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice Peter B. 
  Tobias, sitting with a jury, dated December 10, 1999, and from the sentence 
  imposed by Justice Tobias dated February 3, 2000.</span></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted 
  of two counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency.  He was 
  sentenced to eighteen months consecutive on each count for a total of 7½ years.  
  The appellant appeals both his convictions and the sentence imposed.  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant raises several grounds of appeal relating to the 
  judge's charge to the jury.  We agree that the cumulative effect of the errors 
  in the charge is that a new trial must be ordered.  The trial judge's charge 
  was given on December 10, 1999, more than two years after the Supreme Court's 
  decision in<i> Lifchus </i>(1997),<i> </i>118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).<i>  </i>Unfortunately, 
  the trial judge's charge departed from <i>Lifchus</i> in a number of respects.  
  The trial judge also failed to adequately relate the position of the defence 
  to the jury.  The trial judge told the jury that the position of the defendant 
  was a denial of the crimes with which he was charged.  He did not tell the jury 
  that the defence position was that it was implausible the acts alleged occurred 
  nor relate the evidence led in support of that position.  Nor did he indicate 
  that the defence alleged the evidence of one of the complainants may have been 
  influenced by a book she had read and counselling she had taken or that there 
  was a possibility of collusion.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A further error is that the charge failed to caution the jury 
  against propensity reasoning and to tell the jurors what evidence applied to 
  each of the counts.  (This was required because the Crown did not bring an application 
  to have the evidence of the complainants treated as similar act evidence.)  
  In particular, the trial judge did not tell the jury that they could not use 
  the evidence of the complainant, Melissa, if they believed it, as evidence in 
  relation to the other two complainants, Tammy and Lance.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Having regard to the nature and number of errors 
  in the charge to the jury, this is not a case to which the curative provisions 
  of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) can be applied.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant also submits that the Crown's cross-examination 
  was improper in that the Crown asked the appellant whether he understood the 
  oath, asked him to agree that the case against him was a conspiracy to falsely 
  accuse him, asked him whether all four Crown witnesses were lying, referred 
  to the evidence of the appellant as a story, and was sarcastic in a number of 
  respects.  The Crown concedes that the cross-examination was flawed but says 
  that it was not so flawed as to affect the fairness of the appellant's trial.  
  We disagree and would also order a new trial on this ground.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A further ground of appeal relates to the admissibility of the 
  expert evidence called by the Crown to explain the delay in disclosure of the 
  complainants' allegations.  The judgment of this court in <i>D. (D.)</i>, delivered 
  in October 1998 and reported at (1999) 129 C.C.C. (3d) 506, subsequently affirmed 
  (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (S.C.C.), preceded the trial by more than a year.  
  That decision made it clear that evidence of this nature fails to meet with 
  the necessity requirement for expert evidence, is potentially prejudicial to 
  the defence and is more properly the subject of a jury instruction that no adverse 
  inference is to be drawn from the lack of timely disclosure. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal 
  with the sentence appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For all these reasons, the appeal as to conviction 
  is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</span></p>
