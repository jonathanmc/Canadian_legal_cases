<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice Dandie dated January 11, 
  2001.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The appellant mother appeals from the order of 
  Dandie J. dated January 11, 2001  awarding custody of her seven year old son 
  Ethan to the respondent father. The order varied a consent order dated June 
  13, 1997 that provided for custody to the mother and access to the father. By 
  subsequent order of Laskin J.A. of this court, dated February 27, 2001, the 
  child was returned to his mother’s custody, with continuing generous access 
  to the father, and the order of Dandie J. was stayed pending the hearing of 
  the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal, set aside 
  the order varying custody, and restore custody of the child to the mother, subject 
  to generous access to the father.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The parties are the natural parents of Ethan, 
  born on September 2, 1994. The mother is not married. She became pregnant with 
  Ethan during the course of an extra-marital affair with the father. Throughout 
  his relationship with the mother, the father was married to, and, unbeknownst 
  to the mother, continued to live with his spouse Dianne Barnes. The relationship 
  between the parties ended in April 1995 when the father disclosed to the mother 
  that he still lived with his wife. Following the break-up, Ethan continued to 
  live with his mother, subject to the father exercising regular access. Issues 
  of custody and access were agreed upon by the parties and incorporated in the 
  consent order dated June 13, 1997. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The father first disclosed to his wife his affair 
  with the mother, Ethan’s existence, and his ongoing relationship with his son 
  in the early part of 1998. Later in August 1998, he brought this application 
  seeking sole custody of Ethan. The evidence disclosed that Dianne Barnes is 
  willing to accept Ethan into her home and into her life. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A significant issue arose on the application 
  and on appeal whether the father met the onus of showing that a material change 
  of circumstances had occurred sufficient to warrant a re-examination of the 
  existing custody arrangement. It is common ground between the parties that a 
  material change is one that, if known at the time of the original order, would 
  likely have resulted in a different order. The trial judge concluded that the 
  disclosure of Ethan’s existence to the respondent’s wife and her willingness 
  to accept Ethan into her home constituted the requisite material change of circumstances.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, we cannot agree. In our view, it cannot reasonably 
  be said that these circumstances, if known at the time of the original order, 
  would likely have resulted in a different custody arrangement. Consequently, 
  the trial judge erred in finding that the threshold test for variation had been 
  met.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The respondent argues that the trial judge’s 
  finding that there had been a material change of circumstances can nonetheless 
  be supported on the basis of the mother’s “campaign of parental alienation” 
  and her continued unwillingness to promote a relationship between Ethan and 
  his father, despite certain admonitions contained in an assessment report prepared 
  for the court in September 1999. Indeed, the trial judge’s reasons are essentially 
  focused on the mother’s conduct, and his decision to award custody to the father 
  is largely based on certain recommendations contained in the assessor’s report. 
  It is therefore necessary to review some of this evidence.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is abundantly clear on the evidence that both parents are 
  deeply attached to Ethan and that they each want the best for him. There is 
  also no doubt on the evidence that, given the father’s deception surrounding 
  the birth of the child and his ongoing lack of financial support<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>, there is a significant hostility on the part of the mother 
  towards the father. This hostility has resulted in the mother having difficulty 
  accepting and promoting the relationship between Ethan and his father. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The mother’s deep resentment of the father and 
  its potential impact on the child’s relationship with his father were noted 
  by the assessor in his assessment report. After describing the mother’s difficulties 
  in accepting the relationship, the assessor expressed the hope that the mother 
  could accept a relationship between Randy and Ethan and added that “should these 
  changes not be forthcoming it may call into question the wisdom of leaving the 
  child with the mother as the primary caregiver”. His conclusion that custody 
  should remain with the mother was similarly qualified as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>It is important to note that all the professionals involved 
      with the child had no major concerns to report regarding [the mother’s] 
      parenting of Ethan. While it is my belief that the father is better able 
      to provide an environment supportive of Ethan’s emotional growth, the length 
      of time that the child has lived with his mother and the significant relationship 
      that he has with her supports the continuation of the current living arrangement. 
      </span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>This arrangement should be reexamined should the mother 
      be unable to develop the ability to promote Ethan’s relationship with his 
      father. If these changes are not forthcoming it may be necessary to remove 
      Ethan from his mother and place him with his father.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge placed much reliance on this 
  opinion in arriving at his decision to award custody to the father. He found 
  that the mother had “not effected the necessary changes” in her attitude and 
  that she had “embarked upon a course of conduct which [was] not only detrimental 
  to the father-son relationship but also to the little boy himself.” </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge described certain incidents in support of his 
  finding that the mother had not effected any significant change in her attitude 
  towards the relationship between Ethan and his father. The incidents noted by 
  the trial judge were mainly, if not entirely, related to the mother’s objection 
  to the father’s daily presence in Ethan’s classroom as a volunteer and to the 
  steps she undertook to change this state of affairs. The mother testified at 
  trial that she did not believe it to be in the best interests of the child to 
  have a parent in the classroom supervising what he is doing. She felt that the 
  child would not be able to express himself in the same way and that, when in 
  school, he should be learning from the teacher.   The steps taken by the mother 
  referred to by the trial judge in his reasons included an attempt to persuade 
  other parents that the father’s presence was detrimental to their children, 
  a visit to the principal of the school to discuss the matter in the company 
  of Ethan, and a transfer of Ethan to another school at the end of senior kindergarten. 
  The trial judge expressed sharp criticism of the mother’s conduct in this regard 
  and relied on these incidents in support of his critical finding that the mother 
  had not paid heed to the assessor’s admonitions that she should change her attitude 
  with respect to Ethan’s relationship with his father. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the trial judge’s findings of fact concerning the mother’s 
  conduct are supported by the evidence and his view that such conduct was “reprehensible” 
  is entitled to deference in this court, it is our view that the evidence cannot 
  reasonably support the trial judge’s further finding that the mother’s conduct 
  had a detrimental effect on the relationship between the father and son and 
  on the child himself so as to warrant a re-examination of the custody arrangement. 
  Indeed, the trial judge made no specific findings of fact in support of his 
  conclusion that there was resulting detriment to the child.  Nor can we find 
  support for his finding on a review of the evidence.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On everyone’s account at trial, Ethan is developing very well. 
  He is in good health. He has adjusted to school and generally behaves in a socially 
  appropriate manner. He is intelligent and does quite well in school. Ethan has 
  a close and healthy relationship with his father. He also has a significant 
  relationship with and attachment to his mother. Despite the mother’s feelings 
  towards the father, the father concedes that his access to his son has never 
  been denied. The school reports both parents as being appropriate parents and, 
  despite the father’s numerous complaints about the mother’s parenting ability, 
  as noted in the assessor’s report, all professionals involved had no major concerns 
  in this respect.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  there had been a material change in circumstances that warranted a re-examination 
  of the existing custody arrangement. He further erred in his assessment of the 
  existing relationship between the parties and the child by placing undue emphasis 
  on the mother’s conduct with insufficient regard to the critical issue whether 
  her conduct had any significant effect on Ethan and on his relationship with 
  his father. There is an obvious risk to any child of tender years who is the 
  centre of an acrimonious dispute between the parents.  However, the trial judge’s 
  findings do not support the conclusion that it is in Ethan’s best interests 
  that he be removed from his primary caregiver since birth. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal is therefore allowed, the order of Dandie J. is set 
  aside, and the respondent’s application to vary custody is dismissed. Consequently, 
  the consent order providing for custody to the mother continues in effect. The 
  parties are in agreement that the terms of access should be revisited in order 
  to make them more age appropriate to the child. There will be an order awarding 
  generous access to the father the terms of which are to be agreed upon by the 
  parties, failing which an application can be brought before a court of competent 
  jurisdiction. We make no order as to costs on the application or on the appeal.
