<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Ian M. 
  Gordon, sitting with a jury, dated October 12, 1997.</span></b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>CHARRON J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle>I.          Overview</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following his trial by judge and jury, the appellant 
  was convicted of the first degree murder of Gerard Leveille and offering an 
  indignity to his remains. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first 
  count and two years concurrent on the second count. He appeals against conviction.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The main ground of appeal relates to a pre-trial application 
  by the defence for disclosure of all contacts between one of the Crown witnesses 
  and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The appellant argues that he was improperly 
  excluded from his trial as a result of the trial judge meeting in private with 
  counsel for the federal Crown and the investigating officer during the course 
  of adjudicating on this application to review whether the informer privilege 
  extended to certain materials. He submits that this private meeting contravened 
  the express requirement under s. 650 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>that he be 
  present during the whole of his trial, and that a new trial should be ordered 
  on this ground alone.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant also relies on five other grounds, all related 
  to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury. The alleged errors can be divided 
  into three categories.  First, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred 
  in failing to instruct the jury on the “other suspect” defence. Second, the 
  appellant contends that the trial judge made three errors in cautioning the 
  jury against accepting the evidence of unsavoury witnesses: he improperly exempted 
  one Crown witness from the unsavoury witness category; he improperly extended 
  the warning to two defence witnesses; and he erred in his instructions on what 
  could constitute potentially confirmatory evidence of the witnesses’ testimony. 
  Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in instructing the 
  jury to engage in a “two-step” process in deciding whether the Crown had proven 
  its case beyond a reasonable doubt in a manner that could potentially exclude 
  relevant evidence from their consideration. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to the appellant’s main 
  ground of appeal. It is my view that the impugned meeting did not take place 
  during the course of the appellant’s trial. Rather, it was part of a separate 
  proceeding brought by the federal Crown under s. 37 of the <i>Canada Evidence 
  Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.<i> </i>In any event, the procedure that is now 
  objected to on appeal was adopted with the consent of both parties and following 
  an express waiver of the appellant’s right to be present during that part of 
  the proceeding. In these circumstances, there was no contravention of s. 650 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. With respect to the remaining grounds of appeal, 
  it is my view that the trial judge’s instructions, considered as a whole and 
  in the context of the evidence at trial, were adequate and reflected no reversible 
  error. Consequently, I would dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
<p class=headingtitle>II.      The Facts</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The deceased Gerald Leveille was a smuggler of drugs, steroids, 
  alcohol and cigarettes, a business he was involved in with the appellant and 
  a number of other persons who testified for the Crown and defence at trial. 
  He was last seen alive in the early morning hours of February 20, 1995 in Sudbury, 
  Ontario. On  February 16, 1996, as a result of information provided by Cecil 
  Russell (the appellant’s supplier of steroids) in exchange for favourable treatment 
  by prosecution authorities, the deceased’s burnt remains were found in an abandoned 
  silo adjacent to Russell’s residential property in Oshawa, Ontario. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the 
  appellant had a motive to kill Leveille for a number of reasons: Leveille was 
  encroaching on the appellant’s sales territory; he was making false claims that 
  the appellant owed him money; he was threatening to destroy the appellant’s 
  racehorses; and finally, the appellant suspected that Leveille was involved 
  in a break-in and theft at the appellant’s home near Sudbury on December 29, 
  1994. It was the Crown’s further theory that the appellant killed Leveille shortly 
  after Leveille was last seen alive, cut up the body, transported the remains 
  to Russell’s property and burned the body in the silo. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In support of its theory, the Crown relied on the evidence of 
  several witnesses who testified about the appellant’s numerous grievances with 
  Leveille and his plan to get rid of him. This evidence included a recording 
  of a conversation between the appellant and his cousin Joel Pilotte.  The Crown 
  also relied on the evidence of Cecil Russell who testified that the appellant 
  brought Leveille’s body to his property in Oshawa, burnt it in the silo, later 
  returned to check the silo, retrieved some of the remaining bones, and disposed 
  of them in a garbage dumpster. Russell also testified that the appellant admitted 
  to killing Leveille. The Crown further relied on the appellant’s admissions 
  to two other witnesses, Joel Pilotte and Martin LaChapelle. Finally, the Crown 
  relied on various pieces of evidence to confirm the testimony of the witnesses 
  Cecil Russell, Martin LaChapelle, and Joel Pilotte; evidence of the appellant’s 
  attempts to dissuade the deceased’s wife from calling the police; and the appellant’s 
  after-the-fact conduct.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not testify at his trial. 
  However, the defence called a number of witnesses to challenge the credibility 
  of the Crown witnesses. It was the defence theory at trial that Russell had 
  himself killed Leveille and disposed of his body in the silo or was involved 
  in the murder, and that he was lying about the appellant’s participation in 
  the crime to protect himself. It was the further theory of the defence that 
  none of the three Crown witnesses who testified as to admissions made by the 
  appellant were worthy of belief. Finally, it was the defence theory that the 
  Crown’s case left too many matters unexplained to constitute proof beyond a 
  reasonable doubt. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As indicated earlier, this ground of appeal

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Joel Pilotte had lived with the appellant and his wife for a 
  period of time ending in the fall of 1994. Joel Pilotte testified that on December 
  31, 1994, the appellant came to his residence and accused him of  breaking and 
  entering into his home. Joel Pilotte denied responsibility. The next day, the 
  appellant returned to his residence and questioned him again. He suspected him 
  as well as a number of other people including Leveille. Later that day, the 
  appellant told Joel Pilotte that he had now concluded that Leveille had done 
  the break and enter. The appellant was also upset with Leveille because he had 
  been telling people that the appellant owed him money. The appellant told Joel 
  Pilotte that he wanted to get rid of Leveille. He asked Joel Pilotte to help 
  him kill Leveille by whacking him over the head. Joel Pilotte was reluctant. 
  The appellant repeated his plan to kill Leveille on the morning of January 2, 
  1995. During this period of time, Joel Pilotte was involved in an investigation 
  by the RCMP into a large scale conspiracy to traffic in steroids involving the 
  appellant and others. Later on January 2, Joel advised the RCMP of his discussions 
  with the appellant. This information was turned over to the Sudbury Regional 
  Police.   </p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On January 4, 1995, Joel Pilotte was fitted 
  with a listening device by the police. He then met with the appellant. According 
  to Pilotte, the appellant repeated his plan to kill Leveille some time later 
  that week. He planned to hit Leveille on the head with an axe handle, put his 
  body in a snow bank until it froze, and then cut it up with a chainsaw. Joel 
  Pilotte then met with the police. It was discovered that the listening device 
  had malfunctioned and that none of the conversation had been recorded. However, 
  a statement was obtained from Joel Pilotte before he was advised of the equipment 
  failure. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On January 5, 1995, Joel Pilotte was fitted with different equipment 
  and again had a conversation with the appellant. The appellant repeated his 
  intention to get rid of Leveille. Amongst many other comments, he told Joel 
  that he had hired a 6’6”, 300 lb. Jamaican man to kill Leveille. After receiving 
  the recording of this conversation, the police decided neither to arrest the 
  appellant nor to warn Leveille. The police were concerned about Joel Pilotte’s 
  safety and about exposing an ongoing RCMP investigation of the appellant. Also, 
  the police were concerned that the plot changed in each conversation and the 
  last conversation bordered on the bizarre. However, surveillance teams were 
  dispatched to follow the appellant and Leveille for approximately two weeks; 
  nothing materialized during that time.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During approximately the same time period as the Sudbury Regional 
  Police Force investigated the appellant’s threats against Leveille, as reported 
  by Joel Pilotte, the RCMP continued their investigation into the conspiracy 
  to traffic in steroids. Charges relating to the conspiracy were laid against 
  the appellant and Cecil Russell.  At the time of the appellant’s trial on this 
  murder charge, those charges had been dealt with. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Joel Pilotte eventually testified about these conversations at 
  the appellant’s trial. He also testified that the appellant later described 
  to him how he had killed Leveille.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Given Joel Pilotte’s role in the murder investigation 
  and his concurrent involvement in the RCMP investigation, counsel for the appellant 
  brought an application on September 17, 1997 for disclosure of all contacts 
  between Joel Pilotte and the RCMP. The appellant’s trial was scheduled to commence 
  on September 22, 1997 and the application was brought in the Ontario Court (General 
  Division) before Gordon J., who ultimately presided at the appellant’s trial.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the application for disclosure, as evidenced 
  by the written Notice of Application, the defence was seeking a multitude of 
  information from the Crown, both provincial and federal, and from all police 
  forces, municipal, provincial and federal. However, the hearing before the applications 
  judge and the appeal before this court related solely to the material in the 
  possession of the RCMP that concerned Joel Pilotte. This material was not in 
  the possession of counsel for the provincial Attorney General who had carriage 
  of the prosecution and the application was therefore defended by the prosecution 
  on the basis that all material in its possession had been disclosed. Counsel 
  for the Attorney General of Canada appeared on the application and objected 
  to the production of the material on the ground of informer privilege. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From the outset, counsel for the appellant stated that it was 
  his understanding that some of the material in question would prove to be privileged 
  and that he expected the applications judge to rule on what was privileged and 
  what was not. He made it clear to the court that his client was only seeking 
  production of the material to which the privilege did not extend. The question 
  became: what procedure should be followed?  </p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Federal Crown took the position that it came to these proceedings 
  as a third party, and that consequently the defence had to meet the likely relevance 
  test set out in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411before the material 
  could be produced for inspection by the court. Alternatively, the Federal Crown 
  opposed the disclosure of the information under s. 37 of the <i>Canada Evidence 
  Act</i> on the grounds of public interest, namely informer privilege.  It was 
  agreed that the applications judge would rule on the “third party” argument 
  first before considering s. 37.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the first argument, the provincial Crown 
  joined the Federal Crown in characterizing the material in question as “third 
  party records” and in opposing its disclosure as such. It was argued that the 
  appellant’s right to disclosure extended only to the fruits of the investigation, 
  and not to matters that went beyond it. Since full disclosure of all matters 
  relevant to the murder investigation had been made, it was submitted that the 
  defence did not have a further right to disclosure of matters not in the possession 
  of the prosecution and relating to other investigations, without first meeting 
  the threshold test of likely relevance set out in <i>O’Connor. </i>It was submitted 
  that the threshold test could not be met by the simple assertion that the credibility 
  of Joel Pilotte would be in issue at the trial.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the appellant argued that the <i>O’Connor</i> 
  test had no application where the material in question was in the hands of the 
  state as a prosecuting authority. He argued that, contrary to <i>O’Connor </i>and 
  like cases, there was no competing privacy interest to be weighed in this case. 
  Hence, he argued that the test of relevance set out in <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, 
  [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 was the governing test and that relevance extended to matters 
  related to credibility. Counsel reiterated that disclosure was only sought with 
  respect to that part of the material, if any, that was not privileged.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The applications judge rejected the argument 
  of counsel for the Federal Crown and the provincial Crown. First, he noted that 
  the Crown had made full and complete disclosure with respect to the homicide 
  investigation, including information from the parallel investigation into charges 
  of conspiracy to traffic in steroids that involved the appellant. He also noted 
  that Joel Pilotte was expected to give significant evidence incriminating the 
  appellant at the trial and that his credibility would be in issue. He then ruled 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The defence now asks that a complete record of Mr. Joel Pilotte’s contacts 
      with the R.C.M.P. be disclosed. Such information would not be within the 
      parameters of the steroid conspiracy disclosure. As a preliminary matter 
      the Federal Crown says the application should be an <i>O’Connor Application 
      </i> for production as opposed to a <i>Stinchcombe Application</i> for disclosure. 
      …</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>… The higher standard of likely relevance in O’Connor type applications 
      flows, in my view, from special individual rights of persons to their medical, 
      psychiatric, therapy and like information, along with a consideration in 
      sexual cases of a necessity of not to discourage complainant [sic]. These 
      can be balanced in an O’Connor application against the accused’s rights 
      to full answer and defence. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I have difficulty finding the comparable rights for balance here against 
      the right to full answer and defence. The fruits of any investigation surely 
      do belong not to the police or to any specific body, and if relevant should 
      be disclosed. </span></p>

  </span></span> The applications judge concluded that in the circumstances of 
  this case, the Federal Crown could be subject to the <i>Stinchcombe </i>application 
  for disclosure and that it could appropriately protect its position by denying 
  relevance or claiming privilege. He further held that relevance on the basis 
  of <i>Stinchcombe </i>had been established. The sole remaining question to be 
  determined was whether the material was privileged. No appeal is taken from 
  this ruling.  </p>

  </span></span> <span> </span>On September 18, 1997, the hearing of the application 
  resumed in open court in the presence of the appellant, his counsel, and both 
  Federal and provincial Crown counsel. Counsel for the Federal Crown advised 
  the court that he had divided the materials into three piles: the first pile 
  did not relate to Joel Pilotte; the second pile were materials over which the 
  Federal Crown claimed privilege; the third pile were materials that the Crown 
  was prepared to disclose. The Federal Crown then sought an opportunity to elaborate 
  on the question of privilege in chambers in the sole presence of the judge and 
  the investigating officer. The applications judge sought the input of counsel 
  for the provincial Crown and counsel for the appellant on the suggested procedure. 
  The following exchange took place: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[Provincial Crown]: I am in agreement Your Honour. Quite frankly I 
      think at this point I am not even in the picture and I do not think my agreement 
      in any way would affect but, I have been explained what is understood to 
      be the procedure which is in-camera for rather obvious reasons and I tend 
      to agree with it. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: [Defence counsel].</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[Defence counsel]: I take no issue.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: Sorry, you make no comment or you take no issue with the 
      procedure?</span></p>
    <p>[Defence counsel]: Frankly, I take no issue with the procedure no.  Your 
      Honour I recognize it that the balancing has to be done, that has to be 
      done by the Court and in the circumstances I have no real objection to the 
      thought that it should be done in-camera.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Then what about representation?  I would gather that [the Federal 
      Crown’s] position is that he and the officer attend in Chambers with material.  
      Is that your position?</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>[Federal Crown]: Yes.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: What is your input on that?</span></p>
    <p>[Defence counsel]: If the Court is content with its role of reviewing the 
      material carefully to determine what is privileged and what isn't, then 
      I am prepared to trust the Court even without my client or I being there 
      to take part in the conversation.  If the Court prefers to have me there, 
      then I would be pleased to attend.  If the Court wants, or prefers to have 
      me there  and to ask me to make undertakings as to sharing what I learn 
      there with others and to limit me as to what I can do I will abide by the 
      Court's direction on that.  I don't intend to be difficult on this issue 
      Your Honour.  I am prepared to be of such assistance to you and my client 
      as you think is right given the nature of the material that you are going 
      to learn about.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: You are content with the procedure whereby [counsel for 
      the Federal Crown] and the officer attend in Chambers with me with the material 
      so that I may hear what their position is on any one or more of the four 
      elements set out in <i>Parmar</i>?</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[Defence Counsel]: Yes.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: And I would make a decision as to whether or not it is privileged</span></p>
    <p>[Defence counsel]: Yes. And I would assume that anything that  you direct 
      is not privileged I will get copies of quickly.  Anything you direct is 
      privileged I won't see and that will be the end of it.   <i> </i></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: Would it seem appropriate to determine firstly, whether 
      it had relevance, and then to determine whether or not it is privileged?</span></p>
    <p>[Defence counsel]: I guess on the issue of relevance I might have comment.  
      Because Your Honour's perception of what is relevant is of course limited 
      by your knowledge of the facts.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>THE COURT: Yes.</span></p>
    <p>[Defence counsel]: And so, on that issue I might truly have comment as 
      to whether this was something that I might reasonably make use of in a way 
      that the trial judge may not know before the  opening of the trial, but 
      I.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: It is always a difficult situation, <i>O'Connor </i> applications 
      put judges in that position all the time…</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[Defence counsel]: Yes.</span></p>
    <p>THE COURT: …to find whether or not something is relevant without knowing 
      entirely what the defence is.  But it is a function that we do carry out.  
      I understand your position.  I will determine first of all privilege and 
      will retire to Chambers [counsel for the Federal Crown].    </p>

  the issue of recording the private meeting and expressed the following view:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I think I will decline then having a record made. I see nothing in 
      the cases that would require such to be made and, in fact, a record seems

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>He then sought the input of counsel on this 
  issue. Counsel for the appellant was content that whatever material was adjudged 
  to be privileged be sealed so that it would be available for appellate review 
  if necessary. The applications judge then retired to his chambers with the Federal 
  Crown and the investigating officer, commenting on the record that he would 
  be asking “for assistance [from them] simply for the purpose of organization 
  and presentation of the material since it appears to be quite extensive.”</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The applications judge later returned in open 
  court to deliver his ruling. In his reasons, he referred to the procedure employed 
  as that that “paralleled” the procedure adopted by Watt J. in <i>R. v. Parmar</i> 
  (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (Ont. H.C.J.)<i>. </i>He then described the various 
  files he had reviewed, according to date and file number. He ruled, with respect 
  to some of the materials, that no further disclosure was required because it 
  had already been made and, with respect to the balance of the material, that 
  it was privileged. Counsel for the appellant indicated that he was “content 
  there was nothing further to press on those items at this time.”</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant does not take issue with the applications 
  judge’s ruling that the material that formed the subject-matter of the application 
  was privileged and not subject to disclosure. Therefore, he does not seek an 
  order for disclosure. Rather, he contends that the hearing of the application 
  for disclosure formed part of his trial, and that the applications judge committed 
  an incurable jurisdictional error in meeting privately with the Federal Crown 
  and the investigating officer to determine whether the material was privileged. 
  The appellant relies on s. 650 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and on the fundamental 
  principles of the criminal justice system that a person charged with an offence 
  is entitled to be present throughout his trial and that trials be conducted 
  in public. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Since the appeal raises no issue as to the correctness 
  of the applications judge’s ruling on the question of privilege, the Federal 
  Crown, with the consent of the appellant and leave of the court, did not participate 
  in the appeal. </span></p>

  </span></span> The Crown takes the position that the meeting in chambers did 
  not result in jurisdictional error vitiating the appellant’s trial. The Crown’s 
  position is threefold. First, it is submitted that the meeting was held in the 
  context of a proceeding pursuant to s. 37 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> 
  and that it did not form part of the trial. Consequently, s. 650 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code </i>is of no application. Second, it is submitted that, in any event, the 
  procedure was consented to by the appellant who, through counsel, expressly 
  waived any right to be present. Finally, it is submitted that if there was a 
  procedural error, the curative provision in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) may be safely invoked 
  with respect to this issue.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the Crown’s position is correct 
  that the <i>in camera </i>meeting which forms the subject-matter of this ground 
  of appeal took place during the course of a separate and distinct proceeding 
  under s. 37 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act.</i> Indeed, as I will explain further, 
  the appellant’s application for disclosure was effectively rendered moot as 
  a result of the ruling on the Federal Crown’s s. 37 application. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is important to consider s. 37 of the <i>Canada

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Subsection 37(1) provides that “a minister of 
  the Crown in right of Canada or other person interested may object to the disclosure 
  of information before a court… with jurisdiction to compel the production of 
  information…on the grounds of a specified public interest.” The objection may 
  be made “by certifying orally or in writing to the court” that the information 
  should not be disclosed on such grounds. There is no issue that the Federal 
  Crown did invoke s. 37 in this case within the meaning of s. 37(1). The specified 
  public interest was identified generally as “privilege”, but, from the material 
  that was filed and the nature of the information in question, the argument of 
  counsel before the applications judge and on appeal, it would appear to be common 
  ground between the parties that the public interest in question was the informer 
  privilege. In any event, no appeal is taken from the applications judge’s ultimate 
  finding that the information was privileged and it is therefore not necessary 
  to inquire into the precise nature or scope of the claim for privilege that 
  was ultimately upheld on the application. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When s. 37 is invoked, it gives rise to a separate and distinct 
  proceeding in a specified court, the determination of which is subject to an 
  independent right of appeal. Subsections 37(2)  and (3) provide that the objection 
  must be determined by a judge of the superior court of the province or by a 
  judge of the Trial Division of the Federal Court. Hence, if the objection is 
  made during the course of a proceeding before a superior court, as in this case, 
  the presiding justice may simply proceed with the s. 37 inquiry and make a determination 
  under s. 37(2). If however, the objection is made during the course of a preliminary 
  inquiry or a trial before a judge of the provincial court, an application must 
  be brought before one of the two designated courts within ten days after the 
  objection is made, or within such further time as ordered by that court: s. 
  37(3) and (4).  The separate nature of the inquiry becomes self-evident when 
  one reads the cases that have considered s. 37: see, for example, <i>R. v. Richards 
  </i>(1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Re Regina and Gray et al. </i>(1993), 
  79 C.C.C. (3d) 332 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Archer </i>(1989 ), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 567

  </span></span> The separate nature of the inquiry is further apparent when one 
  considers the appeal provisions contained in s. 37. A right of appeal lies from 
  the determination of the objection, either to the Federal Court of Appeal or 
  to the provincial Court of Appeal, depending on the court that heard the matter: 
  s. 37(5). Any such appeal must be brought within ten days from the date that 
  the objection is determined, or within such time as ordered by the appeal court. 
  A further right to apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada 
  is provided under s. 37(7).  </p>

  </span></span> In my view, the separate nature of the s. 37 application is not 
  affected by the fact that it is heard before the same superior court judge whose 
  ruling prompted the invocation of s. 37, as was the situation here. That is 
  not to say, however, that every time an issue of Crown privilege arises during 
  the course of a proceeding that the provisions of s. 37 automatically govern. 
  Section 37 does not oust the jurisdiction of a preliminary hearing judge, a 
  provincial trial court judge, or a superior trial court judge to make evidentiary 
  rulings.  On this point, this court in <i>R. v. Richards, supra</i> respectfully 
  disagreed with the contrary view expressed in <i>R. v. Meuckon </i>(1990), 57 
  C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.) at 199.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>R. v. Richards</i>, during the course of a preliminary 
  inquiry the Crown objected to the disclosure of information about an investigative 
  method used by an undercover officer, on the ground of privilege. Instead of 
  determining the issue of privilege, the preliminary court judge adjourned the 
  inquiry to allow the Crown to bring an application under s. 37 of the <i>Canada 
  Evidence Act </i> before a superior court judge. The application was brought 
  and determined by a superior court judge and an appeal was taken from his order. 
  This court upheld the superior court judge’s order but also commented on the 
  jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge to determine the issue of privilege: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that s.&nbsp;37(3) vests the superior court 
      with exclusive jurisdiction to determine a public interest claim.  It would 
      appear that the section was so interpreted in <i>R. v. Meuckon</i> (1990), 
      57 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.) at 199, although the jurisdictional point 
      was not in issue on that appeal.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not read s.&nbsp;37(3) as making the superior 
      court the only court competent to rule on a claim of public interest privilege.  
      Section 37 does not create or define the public interest privilege.  That 
      privilege is a creature of the common law rules of evidence.  Section 37 
      provides a mechanism for the resolution of a privilege claim.  Where the 
      Crown invokes s.&nbsp;37, only a court as defined in s.&nbsp;37(3) may settle 
      that claim:  <i>Canada (Attorney-General) v. Sander</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. 
      (3d) 41 (B.C.C.A.) at 46.  Where, however, the issue arises in the course 
      of a preliminary inquiry, the presiding judge is called upon to make an 
      evidentiary ruling.  To determine the admissibility of the evidence, the 
      judge must decide whether the public interest privilege bars disclosure 
      of the information.  Section 37 does not oust the preliminary inquiry judge’s 
      jurisdiction to make evidentiary rulings.  Instead, the section creates 
      a separate means whereby the public interest privilege may be asserted even 
      in the face of an evidentiary ruling at the preliminary inquiry which requires 
      disclosure.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a claim of public interest privilege arises 
      at the preliminary inquiry, the Crown should normally seek a ruling as to 
      the applicability of the privilege before proceeding under s.&nbsp;37 of 
      the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  The judge will decide whether the common 
      law privilege operates to render the requested information inadmissible 
      at the preliminary inquiry.  If the judge holds that the privilege applies, 
      there will be no need for a s.&nbsp;37 application.  If the judge orders 
      disclosure, the Crown can commence a s.&nbsp;37 application objecting to 
      the disclosure required by the ruling.  The s.&nbsp;37 application is a 
      separate proceeding but may, in some cases, amount to a reconsideration 
      of the same material considered at the preliminary hearing. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The same reasoning applies when an issue of 
  public interest privilege arises during the course of a trial and, in my view, 
  a like procedure should be followed. If an issue of public interest privilege 
  arises during the course of a trial before a provincial trial court, the trial 
  judge has the jurisdiction to make an evidentiary ruling, and should proceed 
  to do so. If the judge upholds the privilege claim, as indicated in <i>R. v. 
  Richards, </i>there will be no need for a s. 37 application and the trial can 
  simply continue. Any party who is adversely affected by the ruling will have 
  recourse to the usual right of appeal at the conclusion of the trial. On the 
  other hand, if the trial court denies the privilege claim, the “minister of 
  the Crown in right of Canada or other person interested” has the right to have 
  the matter determined by a superior court by way of a s. 37 application. If 
  an application is brought, the trial before the provincial court should nonetheless 
  continue to the extent that it is possible to do so but, depending on the circumstances, 
  the trial may have to be adjourned pending the final resolution of the s. 37 
  application. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Likewise, if an issue of public interest privilege 
  arises in a proceeding before a superior court judge, whether it be during the 
  course of a pre-trial motion or a trial, the superior court judge has the jurisdiction 
  to make the evidentiary ruling in that proceeding. Where the objection is made 
  by a party to the proceeding, usually by the Crown prosecutor, an evidentiary 
  ruling can simply be made as part of the same proceeding. Again here, if the 
  privilege claim is upheld, there will be no need for a s. 37 application and 
  the evidentiary ruling may be subject to appellate review in the usual course. 
  If the privilege claim is denied, the Crown, if so advised, can still invoke 
  s. 37 and seek a ruling from the same judge under s. 37(2). If this latter course 
  of action is chosen, it would give rise to a separate right of appeal as described 
  earlier under s. 37(5)and (7).</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Where the objection to the production of the 
  information on the ground of a specified public interest is made by a person 
  who is not a party to the proceeding before the court, the issue will necessarily 
  have to be determined in a separate proceeding and s. 37 will govern. This is 
  the situation that arose in this case. The objection was made, not by the Crown 
  prosecutor in the proceeding against the appellant, but by a minister of the 
  Attorney General of Canada. Gordon J., as a judge of superior court, had the 
  jurisdiction to entertain the application and did so. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Given the separate nature of a s. 37 inquiry, 
  the Crown is correct in its contention that the proceeding did not form part 
  of the trial. Hence, s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>upon which the appellant 
  relies, does not apply. It provides as follows: </span></p>

  the s. 37 inquiry, the appellant nonetheless had the right to be heard on the 
  Federal Crown’s s. 37 application and the question remains whether the procedure 
  that was adopted violated the appellant’s rights in any way. The appellant undoubtedly 
  had an interest in the proceeding. However, it is my view that the appellant 
  was given a full opportunity to participate in the proceeding, that his views 
  were heard through counsel, and that he expressly consented to the procedure 
  that was followed, including the private meeting he now objects to on this appeal. 
  I see no merit to the contention made in this court that defence counsel’s position 
  at trial should be disregarded because it was made without a full appreciation 
  of the rights of his client. There is no allegation of incompetency of trial 
  counsel in this case and, indeed, the record would not support such an allegation.

  </span></span> It is necessary on this point to deal with the appellant’s application 
  to this court to introduce fresh evidence on the appeal. The proposed fresh 
  evidence consists of a brief affidavit from the appellant’s trial counsel wherein 
  he seeks to explain that he took no issue with the procedure that was followed 
  on the s. 37 application because he thought that the private meeting suggested 
  by Federal Crown counsel was the usual procedure in such matters, that it had 
  been sanctioned by Watt J.  in <i>Parmar, </i>and that he did not believe that 
  he had any basis for objecting to it.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, this evidence is not admissible. The reasoning of 
  this court in <i>R. v. Henrich </i>(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 533 (Ont. C.A.) is 
  apposite to the appellant’s application to introduce fresh evidence. In <i>R. 
  v. Henrich, </i> the appellant sought to introduce fresh evidence with respect 
  to defence counsel’s decision not to raise the timing of the complaint in his 
  cross-examination of the complainant. The proposed fresh evidence purported 
  to establish that trial counsel would have raised the issue of timing had the 
  trial judge not restricted the right to cross-examine the complainant on the 
  recent complaint issue. This court refused to admit the evidence. In an addendum 
  to its judgment on the appeal, the court stated as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Looked at generally, fresh evidence is admissible under the authority of 
      s. 683(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which provides that fresh evidence 
      may be received on an appeal when it is &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; 
      to receive it.  Typically fresh evidence relates to a factual determination 
      made at trial and its admissibility is subject to the tests set out in <i>Palmer 
      and Palmer v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C).</i></p>
    <p>The fresh evidence tendered in this case was not the <i>Palmer</i> variety 
      of fresh evidence.  It did not relate to a factual determination made at 
      trial.  It related to defence counsel's position at trial in the light of 
      the trial judge's ruling, made early in the trial, with respect to defence 
      counsel's right to cross-examine the complainant as to the timeliness of 
      her complaints.  In this case the fresh evidence falls generally in the 
      category of fresh evidence referred to in case such as <i>R.v. Joanisse 
      (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Peterson (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 
      739, 106 C.C.C. (3d) 64 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. W. (W.) </i><i><span
lang=FR-CA>(1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161, 100 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).</span></i></p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>…</span></i></p>
    <p>In our opinion, when the trial record is clear, there is no basis upon 
      which to admit fresh evidence to explain or vary it.  Here, as extensively 
      outlined in our July 11, 1996 reasons, defence counsel made his position 
      clear.  In the circumstances, the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial 
      judge's ruling in respect of defence counsel's  right to cross-examine the 
      complainant on the broad issue of why her disclosure and complaint were 
      delayed.<i></i></p>
    <p>We were thus of the view, after having reviewed the fresh evidence and 
      heard counsel's submission with respect to it, that it would not be in the 
      interests of justice to admit the fresh evidence.    <i></i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the record is equally clear in this case that counsel, 
  on his client’s behalf, consented to the procedure that was adopted and hence 
  there is no basis for the admission of trial counsel’s affidavit.  It would 
  not be in the interest of justice to receive this kind of evidence that simply 
  purports to explain the thought process of counsel that led to a decision made 
  at trial. It is of paramount importance, in the interest of certainty and finality 
  of criminal proceedings, that the record speak for itself and that an appellate 
  court not embark upon such an inquiry.  </p>

  hard and fast rule on what procedure will be appropriate on this kind of application. 
  Further, given the wide range of information that can form the subject-matter 
  of a s. 37 inquiry, it would not be advisable for this court to establish any 
  such rule. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Meuckon, supra</i>, recognized 
  that the appropriate procedure to follow in reviewing the information would 
  depend on the circumstances. The Court stated as follows (at 199-200):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span

      the trial judge may examine or hear the information in circumstances which 
      he considers appropriate, including the absence of the parties, their counsel, 
      and the public. Whether the trial judge does hear or examine the information, 
      or whether he does not, the trial judge may then either uphold the claim 
      of Crown privilege or order the disclosure of the information either with 
      conditions or unconditionally. </span></p>

  </span></span></i> <span lang=EN-US>In this case, all counsel at trial and the 
  applications judge relied on Watt J.’s judgment in <i>R. v. Parmar </i>and, 
  as stated by the applications judge, an attempt was made to adopt a procedure 
  that paralleled the one adopted by the court in that case. In <i>R. v. Parmar, 
  </i>there was no s. 37 application but the issue to be determined by the court 
  involved a similar need to preserve the secrecy of material with respect to 
  which the Crown was claiming privilege. It may therefore be useful to review 
  what was done by the court in <i>Parmar</i> because, in my view, it does provide 
  useful guidance.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span></i> <span lang=EN-US>The accused <i>Parmar</i>, against whom 
  the Crown intended to introduce evidence of intercepted private communications, 
  applied to the trial judge for an order pursuant to s.178.14 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code </i>giving him access to the sealed packet that contained the material 
  used on the application for the relevant authorization to intercept communications. 
  In his reasons, Watt J. dealt mainly with the bases upon which such an order 
  can be made. He concluded that the order could and should be made. He further 
  held that it did not follow, however, that the accused was entitled to disclosure 
  of <i>all</i> the material in the sealed packet and that this material was subject 
  to judicial editing to ensure the disclosure was not inimical to the best interests 
  of the administration of justice. Amongst other issues, it was necessary to 
  determine if some of the material had to be edited to maintain the secrecy of 
  the identities of confidential police informants, an issue akin to the one that 
  arose in this case. For obvious reasons, the determination of this issue cannot 
  be made in a completely open fashion in a public court. Watt J. therefore described 
  the procedure that would be adopted. </span></p>

  edit the material  by himself to delete any privileged information from the 
  material to be disclosed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>...I intend, initially, to myself review the contents of the affidavit 
      filed in support of the application for authorization.  In this case, Crown 
      counsel has indicated, without elaboration, that there are certain matters 
      which he wishes deleted from the disclosure copy and generally articulated 
      his grounds of concern.  In the absence of such indication, I would conceive 
      it my duty, in any event, to review the contents of the original affidavit 
      thereby to ensure that disclosure as is made is not inimical to the best 
      interests of the administration of justice. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Following this preliminary editing, the following 
  procedure was to be followed: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>At the conclusion of this initial phase of the editing process, I shall 
      disclose to prosecuting counsel the affidavit, as edited.  Prosecuting counsel 
      shall then indicate his position with respect to disclosure of this affidavit 
      as edited.  In the event that he is content with the nature and extent of 
      such editing, he shall be provided with a copy of the affidavit as edited, 
      which shall serve as the disclosure affidavit for defending counsel. In 
      the event that Crown counsel requests that further editing be done, we shall 
      then proceed to the final stage of the editing process.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>If necessary, there would follow a final stage 
  of editing:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the event that judicial editing fails to produce an edited affidavit 
      satisfactory for disclosure purposes in the view of Crown counsel, it is 
      my view that, the final editing process ought to be undertaken in open court, 
      in the presence of the applicants and their counsel.  Crown counsel may 
      there make submissions, in such guarded terms as he is advised, as to what 
      further editing ought to take place and basis therefor.  It may well be 
      difficult so to do without expressly or impliedly revealing something of 
      that which it is sought to edit, but I am not persuaded, at this juncture, 
      that it cannot be done.  I shall then determine what further editing, if 
      any, shall be done and thereby, the nature of the disclosure affidavit to 
      be provided to applicants' counsel.  It is unnecessary to add that applicants' 
      counsel shall be at liberty to make submissions, in response to those of 
      Crown counsel, as to the nature and extent of further editing, but will 
      do so without benefit of the affidavit as then edited.</p>
    <p>In my respectful view, it is necessary that at least the final stage of 
      the editing process take place in the presence of the applicants.  The result 
      of such process affords the applicants the opportunity of acquiring first-hand 
      knowledge of proceedings which may well affect the eventual outcome of<i> 
      </i>their trial:<i> see R. v. Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner</i> (1982),  
      67 C.C.C. (2d) 510, 137 D.L.R. (3d) 400 (Ont. C.A.); leave to appeal to

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant in this case does not take issue 
  with the notion that the applications judge could review the material in private. 
  Indeed, if a review is to take place under s. 37, all the while preserving the 
  secrecy of the information until a determination can be made, some form of privacy 
  is required. The appellant submits, however, and correctly so, that the procedure 
  followed by Watt J. in <i>Parmar </i>did not involve any private meeting between 
  the judge, one of the counsel and a police officer as was done in this case. 
  Hence, although the procedure was consented to in first instance, the appellant 
  now takes issue with the fact that the federal Crown and the investigating officer 
  took part in this private review of the material by the applications judge. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, and I express this view with the 
  benefit of appellate hindsight, it would have been preferable if the private 
  meeting had been recorded, or better still, if the required assistance had been 
  provided to the applications judge in a manner that did not involve a private 
  meeting. However, I find no reversible error in this case where the procedure 
  was adopted with the express consent of all interested parties. Of necessity, 
  there must be some flexibility on the procedure that should be followed on a 
  s. 37 inquiry. The sensitivity of the material in question will often dictate 
  how the inquiry should be conducted. Indeed, in this case, the applications 
  judge’s decision not to record the meeting, a decision assented to by counsel 
  for the appellant, was informed out of that very concern for preserving the 
  secrecy of the information. Hence, it is my view that counsel’s consent on behalf 
  of the appellant provides a complete answer to this ground of appeal. There 
  is nothing to indicate that the consent was uninformed. Indeed, the record shows 
  that the applications judge expressed concern with the approach suggested by 
  counsel and that he took great care in ascertaining that this was indeed agreed 
  to by the defence. Further, given the particular circumstances of this case, 
  the procedure suggested by counsel made sense and I see no reason why the applications 
  judge should have refused to accede to it. I note the following circumstances 
  in particular. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the Federal Crown and the RCMP were not 
  involved in the investigation or the prosecution of the murder charge before 
  the court. It was common ground between the parties that the material to be 
  reviewed concerned a separate, unrelated investigation. In these circumstances, 
  it is perhaps not surprising that none of the counsel on the application saw 
  any impropriety in having the applications judge hold this private meeting for 
  the sole purpose, as expressly noted on the record, of assisting him in going 
  through the extensive material. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the nature of the privilege that was 
  asserted is important to keep in mind. The determination of whether the informer 
  privilege extended to the material in question did not involve a balancing of 
  interests as the determination of other forms of Crown privilege may entail. 
  Hence, there was no need to receive input from appellant’s counsel on his client’s 
  particular interests in obtaining disclosure of the material in order to determine 
  whether the privilege existed as claimed. This was made clear by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Leipert, </i>[1997] 1 S.C.R. 281. After elaborating 
  on the proposition that “informer privilege is an ancient and hallowed protection 
  which plays a vital role in law enforcement”, McLachlin J., in writing on behalf 
  of all members of the Court on this point, stated the following:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>[12] Informer privilege is of such importance that once found, courts 
      are not entitled to balance the benefit enuring from the privilege against 
      countervailing considerations, as is the case, for example, with Crown privilege 
      or privileges based on Wigmore's four-part test: J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman 
      and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (1992), at pp. 805-6. 
      In <i>Bisaillon v. Keable</i>, <i>supra</i>, this Court contrasted informer 
      privilege with Crown privilege in this regard. In Crown privilege, the judge 
      may review the information and in the last resort revise the minister's 
      decisions by weighing the two conflicting interests, that of maintaining 
      secrecy and that of doing justice. The Court stated at pp. 97-98:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>This procedure, designed to implement Crown 
          privilege, is pointless in the case of secrecy regarding a police informer. 
          In this case, the law gives the Minister, and the Court after him, no 
          power of weighing or evaluating various aspects of the public interest 
          which are in conflict, since it has already resolved the conflict itself. 
          It has decided once and for all, subject to the law being changed, that 
          information regarding police informers' identity will be, because of 
          its content, a class of information which it is in the public interest 
          to keep secret, and that this interest will prevail over the need to

      the judge is bound&quot; (p. 93).</span></p>
    <p><span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Hence, in this case there was no need for input 
  unless and until the applications judge decided that some of the material was 
  not privileged. Trial counsel repeatedly made clear that he was only seeking 
  disclosure of any material that was <i>not</i> found by the applications judge 
  to be privileged. No exception to the privilege exception was claimed in this 
  case. Informer privilege is subject to only one exception, known as the “innocence 
  at stake” exception, and when it is raised, the information must be reviewed 
  to determine whether its disclosure is necessary to prove the accused’s innocence: 
  see <i>R. v. Leipert </i>at paras. 20 and 33. However, no such issue arose in 
  this case. The appellant, through counsel, fully participated in the proceeding

  650(2)(b) provides that “the court may permit the accused to be out of court 
  during the whole or any part of his trial on such conditions as the court considers 
  proper.” In this case, the appellant was absent from that part of the proceeding 
  that allowed a private review of the privileged material with the permission

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As stated earlier, it was part of the defence’s 
  theory at trial that Russell, on whose property the remains of the deceased 
  were found, had himself killed Leveille and that he was lying about the appellant’s 
  participation in the crime to protect himself. It may be useful at this point 
  to review Russell’s evidence. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Russell was one of the witnesses who gave evidence 
  on the appellant’s motive for killing Leveille. He testified that the appellant 
  told him some time early in 1995, or perhaps earlier, that Leveille was cutting 
  into the appellant’s cigarette and liquor operations in Sudbury. He also told 
  Russell that he believed that Leveille had broken into his home and stolen things. 
  The appellant said that he would “take care of him”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Russell also gave extensive evidence implicating the appellant 
  in the disposal of the deceased’s remains. He testified that in February 1995, 
  he received a call early one morning from the appellant who said he was coming 
  to Russell’s farm. Later, the appellant arrived in a truck with bales of hay. 
  He told  Russell “I took care of my problem. I need to use your silo.” The silo 
  was near Russell’s house and was used to burn garbage. Russell gave the appellant 
  permission to use the silo. The appellant went to the silo and came back to 
  Russell’s house some fifteen minutes later. There were no more bales of hay 
  in his truck. The appellant told Russell that he’d been up most of the night 
  driving and that he was hungry. They therefore went out for breakfast. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>When they returned from breakfast, the appellant 
  said that he had to check on the fire. He asked Russell for firewood. Russell 
  helped him load some wood on his truck. The appellant returned to the silo and 
  unloaded the wood. He came back and asked Russell for more burning material. 
  Russell and the appellant went to Russell’s cabinet making workshop where, with 
  the assistance of Russell’s employees, including Clayton Tarrant, they loaded 
  empty boxes and scrap pieces of wood into the appellant’s truck. After loading 
  the appellant’s truck, Russell and the appellant returned to the silo. Russell 
  looked into the silo and saw what appeared to be a charred human torso. He assisted 
  the appellant with the burning material and later provided him with a can for 
  gasoline. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Russell testified that two days after the body 
  was burned, the appellant returned to rake the ashes in the silo. Russell saw 
  the appellant remove some bones and jewellery from the ashes. He placed these 
  items in a garbage bag and he and Russell drove to a dumpster and left them 
  there. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Russell was also one of the three witnesses 
  who testified that the appellant had admitted killing Leveille. The appellant 
  told Russell that he had killed Leveille by hitting him over the head with a 
  shovel. He had then cut up the body, put it in his truck and left it out to 
  freeze before bringing the remains to the silo.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On February 16, 1996, as a result of Russell’s 
  information, the police searched the silo, and, among garbage and various burnt 
  objects, they found a number of bones. The bones were examined by a forensic 
  anthropologist who concluded that they were burnt human bones that had been 
  disturbed since they were burned. The bones were also examined by a forensic 
  odontologist and found to be those of Gerald Leveille. The bones that were left 
  in the dumpster were never recovered.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to outline 
  the defence position that Russell was the real killer and that he failed to 
  relate the evidence to that position. He submits that the jury should have been 
  specifically instructed that if they believed that Russell was responsible for 
  the killing, or had a reasonable doubt on this issue, they must acquit.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I note at the outset that the defence at trial 
  did not seek the specific instruction that it now seeks on appeal and that no 
  objection was made on this aspect of the charge. In my view, this is significant 
  in assessing the adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on this 
  aspect of the defence. Indeed, having regard to the evidence and the address 
  of trial counsel, it becomes apparent why such an instruction was not sought 
  or given. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The defence at trial was multifaceted and not so focused on Russell 
  being “another suspect” as now contended on appeal.  In my view, Crown counsel 
  on appeal accurately characterized the defence position in his factum where 
  he stated that the proposition that Russell killed or was involved in the death 
  of Leveille was “overlaid upon the core position that Russell was falsely accusing 
  the appellant”, rather than upon “any inference that could be drawn from the 
  evidence.” Crown counsel also correctly noted that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span> </span>[p]aralleling this position was a diffuse suggestion that 
      there were several other people who could have murdered the deceased, including 
      “Rod” in Cornwall, the man in the donut shop who appeared to intimidate 
      the deceased, and certain people whom the deceased said he was going to 
      meet at the Toronto Airport. The defence position was not a directed submission 
      that Russell was the real killer, but that, more generally, there existed 
      doubt as to the identity of the killer. </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, there was ample direction from the trial judge relating 
  to Russell’s evidence and the defence’s theory in this regard. The trial judge 
  placed much emphasis on Russell's disreputable character and the need for careful 
  scrutiny of his evidence. He repeatedly referred to him as an unsavoury witness 
  and gave a very strong warning in relation to his evidence with emphasis on 
  his participation in the commission of a crime. The trial judge noted that Russell 
  was an accomplice “at least” in relation to the second count in the indictment, 
  offering an indignity to the remains of the deceased. He also instructed the 
  jury on the need to be cautious in accepting Russell’s evidence because of the 
  &quot;deal&quot; that he made with the prosecution authorities in return for 
  the information that he provided, adding the following:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, <u>in addition</u> to applying the usual test for credibility 
      which I have outlined and the warning because of unsavoury character, you 
      should consider that Mr. Russell <u>may have an interest of his own to serve 
      by giving evidence implicating the accused in the Leveille murder.</u> [Emphasis 
      added.] </span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge again referred the jury back to the problems 
  with Russell's evidence when he reviewed his testimony that the appellant had 
  admitted killing  Leveille: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I don't intend to review again the flaws which make Cecil Russell an 
      unsavoury character or all of the reasons why you must be very, very careful 
      in scrutinizing his evidence before giving it effect in your deliberations. 
      … You should direct your mind to it again on this issue of after the fact 
      evidence. … The defence position, as I see it, is that this witness is so 
      untrustworthy as to not be believed at all. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There were several other witnesses whose evidence 
  was described by the trial judge as suspect by reason of their unsavoury character. 
  Just as he did with respect to Russell’s evidence, the trial judge gave appropriate 
  instructions to the jury on the risk of convicting the appellant on the basis 
  of the evidence of these witnesses without some independent confirmation of 
  the witness’ testimony. This caution is commonly referred to as the “Vetrovec 
  warning” or “caution” in reference to the seminal decision of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen, </i>[1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, 67 C.C.C. (2d)1.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The following witnesses were characterized as 
  unsavoury: Russell, whose evidence I have reviewed; Joel Pilotte, who gave incriminating 
  evidence of statements made by the appellant both before and after Leveille’s 
  disappearance including an admission to the killing; Martin LaChapelle, to whom 
  the appellant had also admitted killing Leveille; and Lise Lapointe, who testified 
  that Leveille told her the night before his disappearance that he planned on 
  meeting the appellant the next morning and going with him to meet with Cecil 
  Russell. In light of the number of unsavoury witnesses and the importance of 
  their testimony, the <i>Vetrovec </i>caution became a recurring theme in the 
  trial judge’s instructions to the jury, and rightly so. Their testimony was 
  central to the Crown’s case and it was therefore important that it be scrutinized.

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s approach on this issue can 
  be described as follows. First, early on in his charge, he cautioned the jury 
  in general terms about the risk involved in convicting the appellant on this 
  kind of testimony. Then, he identified each witness who fell in this category, 
  and reviewed the evidence that made his or her testimony suspect. Next, he elaborated 
  on the necessity to be cautious, particularly with regard to the evidence that 
  was central to the Crown’s case, and to look for confirmation of the evidence 
  in some way. Finally, throughout his instructions, the trial judge made repeated 
  references to the caution that should be exercised in considering these witnesses' 
  testimony. He did so, both in reference to the elements of the offence and in 
  reviewing the various witnesses’ testimony as it related to the issues in the 
  case. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes no issue with the approach 
  adopted by the trial judge and with most of what was said to the jury on this 
  issue. As stated earlier, the appellant contends, however, that the trial judge 
  made three errors in the course of cautioning the jury against accepting the 
  evidence of the unsavoury witnesses: (i) he improperly exempted Clayton Tarrant 
  from the unsavoury witness category; (ii) he improperly extended the warning 
  to two defence witnesses, Matthew Lachance and Roger Pilotte; (iii) and he erred 
  in including two items of evidence on the list of evidence that was potentially 
  confirmatory of Cecil Russell’s testimony. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Tarrant was important to the Crown’s case in 
  two respects: first, he provided some confirmation of Russell’s testimony on 
  the events of February 1995 when the body was burned, and second, he provided 
  evidence of a taped conversation with the appellant after the remains were found 
  by the police from which an inference of guilty knowledge could be drawn. The 
  gist of his evidence was as follows. </span></p>

  involvement in them. He had been charged with conspiracy to traffic in steroids 
  with Russell, but the charge was later withdrawn. While the charge was outstanding, 
  Tarrant had breached his bail conditions by continuing to associate with Russell. 
  He admitted this to the police, but was not charged. Tarrant had also been involved 
  in smuggling liquor, though not with Russell. Tarrant considered Russell to 
  be a good friend and was loyal to him. According to Russell, Tarrant would occasionally

  and the appellant had gone to the cabinet making workshop to get more burning 
  material for the silo. Tarrant recalled that, early one morning in February, 
  1995 when he was at work, the appellant and Russell showed up and wanted a load 
  of garbage. He found this unusual because he, Tarrant, usually took out the 
  garbage. At Russell’s direction, Tarrant and another employee had loaded kitchen 
  countertops and a few garbage bags onto the appellant’s truck. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Tarrant further testified that that the appellant 
  used to telephone him in 1996 from time to time to make inquiries about whether 
  Russell was still in custody on the conspiracy charge. Tarrant taped one of 
  these conversations because he knew that the police were investigating the appellant. 
  The tape of this conversation was introduced at trial. During the course of 
  this conversation, Tarrant told the appellant that the police had been to Russell’s 
  silo. After ascertaining that the appellant was not aware that the police had 
  been at Russell’s silo, Tarrant stated that perhaps he should not say what else 
  was going on. When the appellant then said “Tell me”, Tarrant told him that 
  the police had been digging in the silo and that they had found “something”.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the course of identifying the witnesses who 
  were unsavoury and the reasons why their testimony was suspect, the trial judge 
  said the following about Tarrant: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Though  Clayton Tarrant was associated with Cecil Russell and employed 
      as a tradesman by him, and there are some indications that Russell manipulated 
      him and used his address for pick-up and delivery, I do not see his character 
      as requiring specifically the unsavoury witness warning.  He has no criminal 
      record. The charges of conspiracy to traffic in steroid[s] against him were 
      withdrawn without an exchange of information from him.  There is no indication 
      in the evidence that I've heard of independent gain from any illegal activity.  
      His credibility will be carefully weighed by yourselves as jurymen in any 
      event.  You will recall, he continued to associate with Karen, the secretary 
      in Mr. Russell's business, and to communicate with Cecil Russell after bail 
      terms required that he not do so.  This can be taken as an indication of 
      lack of respect for a Court order as could his continued response to telephone 
      calls from the accused, Mr. Pilotte.  It is to be remembered, of course, 
      that he was fixed with running the cabinet making business belonging to 
      Cecil Russell when he was released on bail.  This almost necessarily required 
      that he associate with the secretary referred to and that he communicate 
      with Mr. Russell concerning the business.  There is no evidence that he 
      called Mr. Pilotte, that he initiated calls to Mr. Pilotte or in fact, knew 
      where he was to call him.  He did not respond to the calls when he received 
      them.  He also made these calls and their contents known to the police.  
      You must assess Mr.&nbsp;Tarrant's credibility with common sense as any 
      other normal witness.  I see no need to tell you when  dealing with him 
      to exercise the extra caution necessary as you would when you would assess 
      the evidence of an unsavoury character.   </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the appellant argues that the trial 
  judge erred in excluding Clayton Tarrant from the category of unsavoury witnesses. 
  I do not find this argument persuasive. While Tarrant could have been so identified

  the evidence. I find no error in excluding Tarrant from the category.</span></p>

  </span></span> Alternatively, counsel submits that, even if the trial judge 
  did not err in his discretion to exempt Tarrant, he erred in giving the jury 
  his reasons for not including Tarrant in this category of witnesses, because 
  this could have led the jury to conclude that Tarrant was a credible witness. 
  While there is logic and some merit to this argument when this part of the charge 
  is considered in isolation, I am not satisfied that the appellant was prejudiced 
  by these comments when they are considered in context. The trial judge’s review 
  of the evidence that related to Tarrant’s character was accurate, and, on the 
  whole, it is my view that the impugned instruction constituted fair comment 
  on the evidence. Further, it is noteworthy that the trial judge directed the 
  jury to weigh Tarrant’s evidence carefully in any event. Consequently, I am 
  not satisfied that the trial judge committed any reversible error in his instructions

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Matthew Lachance and Roger Pilotte were two 
  of a number of witnesses called by the defence to attack the credibility of 
  the Crown witnesses and to suggest that several other people could have murdered 
  Leveille, including “Rod” in Cornwall, a man in a donut shop who appeared to 
  intimidate Leveille, and certain people whom Leveille had said he was going 
  to meet at the Toronto Airport. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant contends that the trial judge’s 
  instruction with respect to Lachance and Roger Pilotte, coming as it did immediately 
  after the trial judge had identified the unsavoury witnesses for the Crown, 
  would have led the jury to conclude that they were also unsavoury witnesses 
  whose evidence could not be relied upon without confirmatory evidence. It is 
  well-established that unsavoury witness warnings ought not to be given with 
  respect to defence witnesses: see <i>R. v. Hoilett </i>(1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 449 
  at 451-52 (Ont. C.A.). </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Again, it is important to consider this instruction 
  in the context of the entire charge. I am not satisfied on considering the charge 
  as a whole that the jury would have mistakenly believed that the <i>Vetrovec 
  </i>caution applied to these witnesses. The trial judge did not instruct the 
  jury to look for confirmatory evidence with respect to these two witnesses and 
  did not repeat any words of caution in relating their testimony as he did with 
  the witnesses he had expressly identified as unsavoury. Further, there was ample 
  evidence to support the trial judge’s comments with respect to these witnesses. 
  Counsel for the appellant himself commented on Matthew Lachance’s lack of credibility 
  in his address to the jury:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, of course, one of the witnesses that I called for you is Matthew Lachance. 
      And it is possible that Diogenes might have some trouble with Matthew as 
      well. Fair point.  Because Matthew is a real problem. He wasn't straightforward 
      with the police in the first place. He was trying to cover a lot of tracks 
      when he met with the police and he was not doing a very good job of it. 
      Now, he cames [sic] to court, he says he's trying to be more honest, maybe 
      he is, but it's understandable if he think it's too late.  Mr. Huneault 
      did a brilliant job with him in showing what he had said earlier and to 
      say to him in essence these words: &quot;Matthew, your prior lies have caught 
      up with you.  They undercut your evidence in this courtroom.&quot; And obviously, 
      that's an accurate statement.  But I ask you not to forget the pieces of 
      Matthew's evidence that were confirmed by others.</p>

  </span></span> Finally, in the context of the evidence at trial, the testimony 
  of Matthew Lachance and Roger Pilotte was of minimal probative value.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge pointed to a number of items 
  of evidence that could be considered by the jury as potentially confirmatory 
  of Russell’s evidence on certain aspects of his testimony. The trial judge concluded 
  the list of those items by saying that those seemed, “on the surface, to be 
  snippets of evidence from independent sources that would confirm in some way 
  the evidence of Cecil Russell.” The appellant contends that two of those items 
  could not confirm his evidence: first, the forensic evidence of Kathy Gruspier 
  that burnt remains were found in the silo and that their appearance was consistent 
  with the remains having been raked; and second, the evidence that Russell and 
  Ninchritz had dinner plans with one Miss Mailer. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the forensic evidence was confirmatory 
  of Russell’s testimony in the sense described in <i>Vetrovec.</i> Although it 
  did not implicate the appellant, it tended to support Russell’s story on what 
  was done with the deceased’s remains. As such, it could restore, at least in 
  part, the jury’s faith in the truth of his testimony. While the second item 
  of evidence was of questionable value in assessing Russell’s credibility, I 
  am not persuaded that the appellant was prejudiced by its inclusion. Further, 
  it is noteworthy that the trial judge, in his recharge to the jury, gave further 
  instructions that they should not conclude that a witness was credible simply 
  because they found certain items of evidence to be confirmatory of his or her 
  testimony. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, the trial judge gave a fair, balanced, and adequate 
  charge with respect to the unsavoury witnesses. This jury was given all the 
  assistance it needed to deal with this evidence. Indeed, when considered as 
  a whole, the caution that had to be given to the jury in this difficult case, 
  was very effectively delivered.  Even if the imperfections that have become 
  apparent under the appellate microscope could be said to constitute error, a 
  conclusion I have not reached, I would not hesitate to apply the curative proviso.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, the appellant takes issue with the 
  following instruction given at the outset of the charge: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>So far, all we have in this case is evidence.  You are the only persons 
      in the courtroom who can transform portions of that evidence which you accept 
      as truthful and credible into fact.  After you have been able to do that, 
      then the law which I give you, and that is my sole responsibility in this 
      case, will be applied to those facts so that you can come to a verdict; 
      so that your responsibility is to determine the facts, my responsibility 
      is to give you the law. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that this instruction is similar to that 
  prohibited by this court in <i>R. v. Miller </i>(1992), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 517 (Ont. 
  C.A.) at 543-44 where the trial judge had instructed the jury to consider the 
  evidence in two separate steps in such a manner that there was a risk that the 
  jury may not have considered the whole of the evidence in arriving at their 
  verdict.  In my view, the charge in this case bears no resemblance to that in 
  <i>Miller. </i>The impugned instruction was given at the beginning of the charge 
  in the context of explaining the respective roles of the judge and the jury 
  and, in my view, it could not have misdirected the jury in relation to those 
  items of evidence that could give rise to a reasonable doubt. When the charge 
  is considered as a whole, it is plain that the jury was instructed to consider 
  all of the evidence in arriving at a verdict, not just that which it accepted 
  as truthful. Therefore, I see no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>
