  </span></span> It was accepted before the Ontario Review Board and before this 
  court that this is not a case where the disposition could be an absolute discharge 
  or a discharge subject to conditions under <i>Criminal Code</i> ss. 672.54(a) 
  and (b) respectively.  The appellant accepts that he is a significant threat 
  to the safety of the public.  Accordingly, the case is governed by s. 672.54(c).  
  The appellant must be detained in custody subject to such conditions as the 
  Board considers appropriate.  What is in issue is a condition imposed by the 
  Board that the appellant be transferred to and detained at the Oak Ridge Division 
  of the Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that we should interfere with the Board’s 
  decision on the basis that it unreasonably concluded that there were issues 
  of risk and trust justifying the transfer and, also, failed to consider the 
  breaches of fiduciary duty committed by female staff members and the Blackwells 
  in their relationship with the appellant.  The appellant also submitted that 
  the Board relied on irrelevant considerations or failed to consider proper considerations.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It is common ground that the relevant considerations 
  are those set forth in s. 672.54:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…. the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition 
      of the accused, the reintegration of the accused into society and the other 
      needs of the accused …</p>

lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As far as the standard of review is concerned, it is clear that 
  we are obliged to accord the Board’s decision a high level of deference.  This 
  is explained in this court’s decision in <i>Peckham v. Ontario (Attorney General) 
  </i>(1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 443 at 455: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the present case, the Board had to review extensive psychiatric material 
      and consider somewhat conflicting psychiatric opinions.  In doing so, the 
      Board was <i>required to assess the mental condition of the accused, </i>the 
      dangerousness of the accused<i>, the treatment prospects of the accused, 
      and the treatment regime that would best fit the dictates of s. 672.54</i>.  
      All of these judgments called into play the Board’s medical expertise and 
      its knowledge of the various facilities available within the mental health 
      system.  This court has neither that expertise nor that knowledge, and must 
      show curial deference to those judgments in applying the reasonableness 
      standard in s. 672.78(1)(a).  That said, if after due regard to the Board’s 
      advantaged position and its expertise, the court concludes that the disposition 
      is unreasonable, it must intervene. (Emphasis added.) </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>This passage is particularly relevant to the case before us.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are satisfied that the Board’s decision is reasonably supported 
  by the evidence and that, in arriving at it, the Board took the proper considerations 
  into account.  The Board concluded in its reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Patients who are housed in medium security who enjoy indirectly supervised 
      hospital and grounds privileges and community access, must be capable of 
      a degree of trust before these privileges can be used.  In Mr. Pinet’s case, 
      for reasons which are well-documented and were fully supported by the evidence 
      heard, Mr. Pinet has been unable to maintain the level of trust which he 
      enjoyed for a period of time at this facility.  He has been confined to 
      the ward since the summer of 1998.  Dr. Komer’s evidence is that he is not 
      a candidate for community access in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>
    <p>…..</p>
    <p>The Board finds that a medium secure milieu is no longer appropriate for 
      Mr. Pinet.  The live issues are those of risk and trust.  Secondarily, but 
      also important is the availability of programming, which by the nature of 
      maximum security will be more accessible to Mr. Pinet in Oak Ridge.  Ms. 
      Fraser, on behalf of her client, submitted that the submissions of the other 
      parties amount to “writing off” Mr. Pinet.  The Board is of the view, that 
      this is not the case, given Mr. Pinet’s proven ability in the past, to progress 
      in the areas of education, behaviour and participate appropriately in programming 
      and activities, that he could again form a more positive therapeutic alliance 
      with those charged with the responsibility of caring for him.  The Board 
      has found that this can be best accomplished in a maximum secure facility, 
      with a maximum amount of structure and attention paid to the challenges 
      which he presents.</p>
