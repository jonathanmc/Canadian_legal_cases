  </span> The defendants appeal from the decision of Kerr J. granting summary 
  judgment with costs against all defendants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The facts are not complex.  The plaintiff (“Pinnacle”) is a bank in 
  Georgia, U.S.A.  One of Pinnacle’s clients is Kustom Marketing Inc. (“Kustom”).  
  Kustom did business with 1317414 Ontario Inc. carrying on business as Jay-B 
  Conversions (“Jay-B”).  William Gibbs (“Gibbs”) is a principal of Jay-B.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The nature of the business was that Kustom bought goods and services 
  from Jay-B and paid for such goods and services by having Pinnacle wire funds 
  from Kustom’s account at Pinnacle to Jay-B’s account at the Royal Bank of Canada 
  (“RBC”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the occasion in question Kustom directed Pinnacle to transfer $60,101. 
  U.S. to Jay-B’s account at RBC.  Pinnacle carried out this direction on December 
  24, 1999.  As a result of its own purely clerical error Pinnacle wired a further 
  sum in precisely the same amount on December 27, 1999 to Jay-B’s account at 
  RBC.  About two weeks later Pinnacle discovered its error and requested Gibbs 
  to return the second payment.  It was not returned.  Jay-B’s position is that 
  Kustom owed the additional $60,101. U.S. to Jay-B in any event and that the 
  money has been used to pay the business that supplied the goods which Jay-B 
  sold to Kustom.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge found that the state of accounts as between Kustom 
  and Jay-B was in issue but that that fact did not provide the defendants with 
  any defence.  He ordered the defendants to repay the second payment of $60,101. 
  U.S. to the plaintiff together with costs and pre-judgment interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defendants ask for the dismissal of the action as against all defendants, 
  in the alternative for dismissal as against Gibbs and in the further alternative 
  that the summary judgment be set aside and the action proceed to trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge rested his decision in favour of the plaintiff on two 
  different bases.  The first was the decision of Dysart J. in <i>Royal Bank v. 
  The King</i>, [1931] 2 D.L.R. 685 (Man. K.B.).  The second was the decision 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Rural Municipality of Storthoaks v. Mobil 
  Oil Canada, Ltd.</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 144 (S.C.C.).  As the latter is binding 
  upon this court and in the circumstances, of clearer application, it should 
  be dealt with first.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mobil held oil and gas leases pursuant to which it paid royalties to 
  the municipality in which the lands were located.  In error, Mobil continued 
  to pay royalties after surrendering the leases.  When it discovered its error, 
  Mobil demanded repayment.  The municipality refused the claim and Mobil sued.  
  The trial judge dismissed the action basing his decision on the fact that an 
  officer of Mobil was aware of the surrender of the leases.  The Alberta Court 
  of Appeal allowed Mobil’s claim and appeal upon the ground that the monies were 
  paid under mistake of fact.  The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal 
  upon the ground that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . where money is paid on the supposition that a specific fact is true 
      which would entitle the other to receive it, which fact is untrue and the 
      money would not have been paid if the fact had been known to be untrue, 
      it can be recovered “and it is against conscience to retain it.” (p. 159)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That authority is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Royal Bank v. The King</i> is a somewhat more complicated case but 
  in it Dysart J. purported to set out the law with respect to the right to recover 
  money paid under mistake of fact in the form of four principles as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>First: that the mistake is honest.  There must be on the part of the person 
      paying the money the genuine <i>bona fide</i> belief that certain facts 
      exist which really do not exist.  It is not what he ought to believe or 
      what he ought to have learned.  His last laches or negligence will not of 
      themselves affect his belief.  Knowledge will not be imputed to him, however 
      ample may be the means of knowledge which he has on hand, however readily 
      accessible those means may be, they do not constitute knowledge; and knowledge 
      will not be imputed to him or inferred against him, unless he wilfully abstains 
      from enquiry. [Authorities omitted.]</p>
    <p>The second condition is that the mistake must be as between the person 
      paying and the person receiving the money.  In other words, the receiver 
      must in some way be a party to the mistake, either as inducing it, or as 
      responsible for it, or connected with it : 21 Hals., p. 30; <i>Skyring v. 
      Greenwood</i>, 4 B. &amp; C. 281, 107 E.R. 1064; <i>Chalmers v. Miller</i>, 
      32 L.J.C.P. 30; <i>Pollard v. Bank of England</i>, L.R. 6 Q.B. 623; <i>Thomson 
      v. Clydesdale Bank, Ltd., </i>[1893] A.C.282.</p>
    <p>The third condition is that the facts, as they are believed to be, impose 
      an obligation to make the payment.  This obligation must be legal or equitable 
      or moral, as will appear  from a reading of the cases already referred to.  
      It is not enough that the payment is desirable or advantageous, the compulsion 
      must at least be practical.            [Authority omitted.]</p>
    <p>The fourth condition to recover is that the receiver of the money has no 
      legal or equitable or moral right to retain the money as against the payer.  
      This proposition is not the exact converse of the third condition.  The 
      money may be owing to the receiver from a third person who has induced the 
      payment,, but the existence of such a debt is not enough to defeat recovery 
      : see <i>John v. Dodwell &amp; Co.</i> and <i>Reckitt v. Barnet, Pembroke 
      &amp; Slater Ltd., supra</i>.  Thus, the mere volunteering cannot defeat 
      recovery : <i>Banque Belge v. Hambrouck</i>, [1921] 1 K.B. 321.  As was 
      stated in <i>O’Grady v. Toronto</i> (1916), 31 D.L.R. 632, 37 O.L.R. 139, 
      the money ought not to be retained if it cannot be retained honestly and 
      conscionably.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel in the instant case, both here and below, were agreed that conditions 
  one and three had been met.  Counsel for the appellants argued that conditions 
  two and four had not been met.  The motion judge found that all four conditions 
  had been met.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As to condition four, the appellants rely upon the evidence of Gibbs 
  that Kustom owed even more than the two payments of $60,101. U.S. and on the 
  finding of the motion judge that there was in fact a difference of opinion as 
  to what debt was owing by Kustom to Jay-B.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge went on to find that that difference of opinion did 
  not afford the defendants any defence to this action.  He did not say why but 
  I agree with his conclusion because Kustom is not a party to these proceedings.  
  The fourth condition requires that the receiver of the money has no legal, equitable 
  or moral right to retain the money <u>as against the payer</u>.  The payer is 
  Pinnacle, not Kustom.  To constitute a defence, Jay-B must have some claim against 
  Pinnacle and none is disclosed on the evidence.  Accordingly condition four 
  is met.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This leaves for consideration the second condition which Dysart J. set 
  out as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The second condition is that the mistake must be as between the person 
      paying and the person receiving the money.  In other words, the receiver 
      must in some way be a party to the mistake, either as inducing it, or as 
      responsible for it, or connected with it. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In finding that the second principle had been met, Kerr J. relied on 
  <i>Royal Bank v. The King</i>, but appears in my view to have mixed the second 
  and third principles.  His reasons in this regard read as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>With respect to the second condition, counsel relies on the <i>Royal Bank</i> 
    decision, above-cited, which she submits closely resembles the factual situation 
    presented in the case at bar, where in that case, the provincial authorities 
    who were found liable had no previous knowledge of the intended action of 
    Mr. Rheaume, yet they subsequently received and retained the money as the 
    fruit of his actions, and when they learned the facts, they refused to refund 
    the money.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It was said there that by receipt of the money, and that refusal to return 
      it, the province adopted Mr. Rheaume’s action in issuing the cheque in the 
      name of, and as attorney for, the Manitoba Tax Commission, and by implication, 
      adopted his action in making the said deposit.</p>
    <p>With respect to the second condition, it is said the mistake must be as 
      between the person paying the money and the person receiving the money; 
      that is to say, the receiver must in some way be a party to that mistake, 
      either by inducing it, or is responsible for it, or connected with it.</p>
    <p>Counsel for the defendant submits that the receiver must in some way be 
      a party to the mistake, and that in this case, the defendant was not a party 
      to the mistake, but that he must be party to the mistake before he can be 
      liable, either by inducing the mistake, or as actually responsible for the 
      mistake itself, or having a connection with it.</p>
    <p>On the subject of the third principle, the <i>Law of Contract</i> at page 
      62 makes the following comment upon which the defendant relies:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>“In much the same way, it appears to have been suggested that there 
          can be no recovery on the basis of money had and received, in the older 
          terminology, or restitution in more modern language. unless some equivalent 
          ‘privity’ exists between the parties.”</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is submitted by defence counsel that no such privity exists here.</p>
    <p>But Fridman, at page 65 of the same volume states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>“The cases in which privity appears to have been a possible issue concern 
          payments made by or to banks.  This is hardly surprising since in other 
          instances, money will have gone in the form of cash directly from the 
          mistaken payer to the disentitled payee.  In ‘bank’ cases, either the 
          payer of the money is a bank acting for or on behalf of its customers, 
          or the payee is the bank, in which event the bank may be receiving the 
          money for its own purposes or use.  It seems clear that courts will 
          regard the relationship between a bank acting as agents for the third 
          party, and payee as being sufficiently direct to give rise to the necessary 
          privity.  It would appear that the precise nature of the mistake is 
          of no significance as long as the party paying made a mistake in regard 
          to the payment in question.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now, I gather from that, and it is my understanding of that, that on that 
      basis, there is privity between the bank, the defendant, and Custom (<i>sic</i>) 
      Marketing Inc. sufficient  to form a basis for the fulfilment of condition 
      two above-cited.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The references to the “<i>Law of Contract</i>” at pages 62 and 65 is 
  to <i>Restitution</i> by G.H.L. Fridman, 2d Edition 1992 (Toronto; Carswell).  
  These references deal with a related subject, namely, “privity” as between payer 
  and payee.  With respect, privity is not relevant to the instant case.  Pinnacle 
  did not act on behalf of Kustom in making the second payment and the fact that 
  the second payment was received by RBC on behalf of Jay-B is irrelevant.  For 
  all practical purposes, the two payments may as well have been received directly 
  by Jay-B.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The authorities cited by Dysart J. for his second principle are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>21 Hals., p. 30; <i>Skyring v. Greenwood</i>, 4 B. &amp; C. 281, 107 E.R. 
      1064; <i>Chalmers v. Miller</i>, 32 L.J.C.P. 30; <i>Pollard v. Bank of England</i>, 
      L.R. 6 Q.B. 623; <i>Thomson v. Clydesdale Bank, Ltd., </i>[1893] A.C.282.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>None of those authorities can be related 
  directly to the facts of the instant case.  The reference to the Halsbury is 
  to the law as it stood in 1912.  Halsbury today deals with the recovery of money 
  paid under a mistake as “part of the law known as quasi-contract, which has 
  now developed into the law of restitution, the central principle of which is 
  the reversal of unjust enrichment”.  32 Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4<sup>th</sup> 
  Edition re-issue, <i>Mistake</i> paragraph 69 (Butterworths; London 1999).  
  That law provides no basis whatever for the retention of the second payment 
  by the defendants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In these circumstances, Jay-B must be found to be connected with and 
  a party to the mistake of Pinnacle by virtue of Jay-B having received the second 
  payment, thus fulfilling Dysart J.’s second condition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed with respect to 1317414 Ontario 
  Inc., carrying on business as Jay-B Conversions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge gave judgment for the plaintiff without distinguishing 
  as amongst the defendants.  Counsel for Pinnacle did not respond to the appellant’s 
  argument with respect to Gibbs personally.  No basis has been shown upon which 
  to find personal as opposed to corporate liability.  In the result, the appeal 
  as against Gibbs is allowed and the action as against him is dismissed without 
  costs either here or below.  The appeal as against 1317414 Ontario Inc., carrying 
  on business as Jay-B Conversions, is dismissed with costs.</p>
