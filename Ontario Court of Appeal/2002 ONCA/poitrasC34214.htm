  </span> The appellant, the deceased Clifford Blake, and Mr. Blake’s common law 
  wife, Colette Nelson, lived together in September 1995.  In early December 1995, 
  Ms. Nelson decided to end her relationship with Mr. Blake, left the home and 
  travelled to Welland, Ontario to stay with her sister.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant and Ms. Nelson were in close contact in the two weeks 
  following her departure.  There was evidence from which it could be inferred 
  that the appellant and Ms. Nelson were romantically involved when she left for 
  Welland.  The appellant and Ms. Nelson testified and denied both any romantic 
  involvement prior to late December 1995 and any involvement in Mr. Blake’s death.  
</p>

  </span> Mr. Blake was last seen alive on the evening of December 14, 1995.  
  He was with the appellant.  A cloth soaked in Mr. Blake’s blood was found on 
  December 22<sup>nd</sup>.  On January 2, 1996, parts of his dismembered body 
  were found in the bush.  Various parts of his body were found in different locations 
  in the following days.  The forensic evidence established that Mr. Blake was 
  shot in the head three times in what had all of the appearances of an execution 
  style killing.  The killing occurred in the home that had been shared by the 
  appellant, Mr. Blake and Ms. Nelson.  The appellant’s rifle was identified as 
  the probable murder weapon.  The forensic evidence also revealed that Mr. Blake 
  was lying on the floor of the bedroom in the home when at least one of the three 
  shots was fired into his head.  One of those shots came from very close range.  
  Ammunition located in the home was consistent with the ammunition used to fire 
  the fatal shots.  A large quantity of Mr. Blake’s blood was found in the back 
  of the appellant’s truck.  The cloth soaked in Mr. Blake’s blood that was found 
  on December 22, 1995 was an exact match to cloth seized from the appellant’s 
  garbage.  </p>

  </span> Within about a week of Mr. Blake’s disappearance, Ms. Nelson returned 
  from Welland and she and the appellant began to live together.  The appellant 
  used Mr. Blake’s credit cards, bank card, and forged cheques in his name on 
  numerous occasions between December 15<sup>th</sup> and January 3<sup>rd</sup>.  
  In the last week of December, the appellant and Ms. Nelson did an extensive 
  clean-up of the house where Mr. Blake had been killed.  They cleaned and shampooed 
  the rugs, repainted walls, and reupholstered chairs and a couch.  The appellant 
  also pressure cleaned the inside and the outside of his truck, even though it 
  was the dead of winter.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A few weeks prior to December 14, 1995, the appellant and Ms. Nelson 
  told Mr. Blake’s sister that he was planning to go to Timmins and would be gone 
  for good.  On December 15<sup>th</sup>, the appellant told a friend that he 
  had taken Mr. Blake to the bus station on the evening of December 14<sup>th</sup> 
  and saw him board a bus marked “Timmins”.  There was no evidence that Mr. Blake 
  ever went to Timmins and there was evidence that no bus marked “Timmins” left 
  the bus station on December 14, 1995.</p>

  </span> The circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant as the killer 
  was overwhelming.  There was also ample evidence to support the Crown’s theory 
  that the appellant decided to kill Mr. Blake so that he and Ms. Nelson could 
  live together as man and wife.  That evidence included the following:</p>

<p><b>1.  Did the trial judge err in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal

  </span> The appellant moved for a directed verdict on the charge of first degree 
  murder at trial.  He argued that the after-the-fact conduct potentially attributable 
  to the appellant (eg. the dismemberment and hiding of the body parts) could 
  not assist the jury in determining the appellant’s level of culpability.  He 
  submitted that the evidence of that conduct was equally consistent with second 
  degree murder as with first degree murder and therefore had no evidentiary value 
  on the question of whether the murder was planned and deliberate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In rejecting this submission, the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Crown’s theory in this case is that a reasonable inference from all 
      the evidence would be that the accused, Jean-Paul Poitras had planned to 
      murder Cliff Blake to accommodate his future and further involvement with 
      Colette Nelson.  The plan included planning [planting] the idea that Cliff 
      Blake had gone to the bush in the Timmins area to visit, or to live.  The 
      after-the-fact dismemberment and attempt to hide the body is consistent 
      with and a part of that plan.</p>
    <p>In my view, the conduct of Jean-Paul Poitras after the offence, has some 
      relevance to his level of culpability and the jury may draw proper inferences 
      from it when considered together with all the other evidence in their deliberations.</p>
    <p>The evidence has or may have utility, quite apart from being an indicator 
      of guilty consciousness, and it is my opinion that it ought not to be taken 
      from the jury, and in view of that and for the reasons that I have stated, 
      the application for directed verdict is dismissed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the trial judge.  The relevance of after-the-fact conduct 
  to the issue of whether a murder was planned and deliberate depends on the circumstances 
  of the particular case:  <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 
  (Ont. C.A.).  If as a matter of common sense and human experience, the after-the-fact 
  conduct considered in combination with the rest of the evidence is reasonably 
  capable of supporting the inference that the murder was planned and deliberate, 
  then the evidence is relevant to that issue.  For example, evidence that the 
  appellant dismembered the body and hid parts of the body in various locations 
  could support the inference that the appellant did not want the body discovered 
  and wanted people to think that Mr. Blake had left for Timmins.  This would 
  allow the appellant and Ms. Nelson to immediately assume cohabitation without 
  attracting suspicion.  If the jury drew that inference, it would go a long way 
  toward a finding that the murder was planned and deliberate.</p>
<p><b>2.  Did the trial judge misdirect the jury as to the evidence capable of 
  supporting the inference that the murder was planned and deliberate?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This argument, like the argument made on the first ground of appeal, 
  was premised largely on the contention that the after-the-fact conduct could 
  not support the inference that the murder was planned and deliberate.  For the 
  reasons set out above, I reject that submission.  In addition, counsel for the 
  appellant looks at each piece of the evidence referred to by the trial judge 
  as relevant to planning and deliberation in isolation.  The evidence must be 
  viewed in its totality.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In reviewing the evidence relevant to the issue of planning and deliberation, 
  the trial judge highlighted certain “areas in the evidence” which he suggested 
  could assist the jury in determining that issue.  All of those areas were logically 
  relevant to the question of planning and deliberation, even though some of the 
  pieces of evidence he reviewed would not, if viewed in isolation, assist on 
  that issue.  The trial judge concluded his review of this evidence by saying:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [I]t is the totality of all of the evidence that your memory and your 
      recollection individually and collectively brings you to that must be considered 
      in determining whether the charges have been made out beyond a reasonable 
      doubt…</p>

line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no error in the manner in which the trial judge reviewed the evidence 
  relevant to the question of whether the murder was planned and deliberate.</p>
<p ><b>3.  Did the trial judge err in instructing the jury that the accused had 
  an interest in the result and that it could bear that interest in mind in assessing 
  his credibility?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In assessing the credibility of witnesses, juries are entitled to consider 
  what motive, if any, witnesses, including the accused, have for testifying in 
  a particular way.  The motive of the accused is self-evident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge told the jury that it could consider the motives of 
  witnesses in assessing their credibility.  Later in his instruction when he 
  dealt specifically with the evidence of the appellant, he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Both of the accused gave evidence at this trial.  Each was under no obligation 
      to do so.  The decision was that of the accuseds.  Because an accused takes 
      an oath and testifies, does not mean that you must accept the evidence.  
      As with any witness, you can accept all, part, or none of the accused’s 
      testimony.  <u>Obviously, an accused person has an interest in the result 
      of the trial.  You may fairly bear that in mind in assessing the accused’s 
      testimony.  There is no onus on the accused to prove anything whether an 
      accused testifies or not.  Rejection of an accused evidence is not evidence 
      of guilt.</u>  If you disbelieve every word by either of the accused in 
      this case that they have given in the witness box, the onus still remains 
      on the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Whereas, in this 
      case an accused person has given evidence of the events, which if accepted 
      would result in a verdict of not guilty, it is not simply a question of 
      what version of the facts you prefer.  That is, it is not for you just to 
      choose between the Crown’s version and the version offered by the accused 
      person.  You must approach the issue in this way as a matter of law, and 
      do so with respect to each of the accused who have testified. …  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge proceeded to give the jury the three-step approach to 
  the assessment of an accused’s testimony set out in <i>R. v. S.(W.D.)</i> (1994), 
  93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  He immediately repeated that instruction and then 
  said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The accused person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  The 
      burden is on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence 
      which you have considered was committed by the accused before a finding 
      of guilt can be made on that charge. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This court has indicated that trial judges should not isolate the evidence 
  of the accused when instructing juries as to the relevance of motive when assessing 
  the credibility of a witness’s evidence.  As Carthy J.A. said in <i>R. v. Trombley</i> 
  (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 495 at 500 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., 134 C.C.C. (3d) 576 
  (S.C.C.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Isolating the accused in this fashion (as opposed to referring generally 
      to all witnesses) tends to undermine the burden of proof and the presumption 
      of innocence.  …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These cases, however, make it clear that a reference to the accused’s 
  obvious interest in the outcome of a case is not in and of itself reversible 
  error.  The instruction will be fatal to a conviction if it erodes the instruction 
  as to the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof:  <i>R. v. Trombley, 
  supra</i>, at p. 500;  <i>R. v. Zurmati</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 1520 (C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused February 3, 1994, 68 O.A.C. 
  399.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am satisfied that no erosion occurred here.  The trial judge instructed 
  the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt in terms which are not subject to 
  any objection.  Furthermore, and immediately after referring to the accused’s 
  interest in the result, the trial judge stressed that there was no onus on the 
  accused and repeated the presumption of innocence.  He also immediately told 
  the jury how the burden of proof should be applied in considering the evidence 
  of the accused and then repeated that instruction.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Considered in the context of the entire charge, I am satisfied that 
  the jury would not have taken the trial judge’s reference to the accused’s obvious

  criminal record.</b></p>

  </span> Before the appellant testified, his counsel brought a motion to exclude 
  evidence of the appellant’s criminal record.  The appellant had a lengthy criminal 
  record beginning in 1968 and extending through to 1988.  His record included 
  many crimes of dishonesty, two convictions for driving while disqualified and 
  two convictions for carrying a concealed weapon.  Apart from the convictions 
  for driving while disqualified, the appellant had never received a jail sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge ruled that the appellant’s convictions for crimes of 
  dishonesty were admissible, but that his convictions for driving while disqualified 
  and carrying a concealed weapon would not be admitted.  The trial judge also 
  ruled that defence counsel could ask the appellant during examination-in-chief 
  whether he had a criminal record, but could not bring out the specifics of that 
  criminal record.  The trial judge accepted the Crown’s argument that as only 
  an edited version of the criminal record was admissible, it should fall to the 
  Crown to decide whether the jury should hear the particulars of that criminal 
  record.  In making this ruling, the trial judge appears to have followed rulings 
  made by other trial judges in his district. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Faced with the trial judge’s ruling, defence counsel elected not to 
  ask his client whether he had a criminal record.  Counsel was concerned that 
  if he asked the question and the Crown chose not to go into the particulars 
  of that criminal record, the jury would be left to wonder about the exact nature 
  of the record.  Crown counsel did cross-examine the appellant on the particulars 
  of his criminal record.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Defence counsel then sought to re-examine the appellant to elicit the 
  penalties imposed on the various convictions for the crimes of dishonesty.  
  Counsel wanted to lead this evidence because, in his view, the penalties imposed 
  supported the inference that the offences were relatively minor.  The trial 
  judge would not permit counsel to ask about the sentences imposed for the convictions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal, counsel makes three arguments.  He submits that the trial 
  judge should have excluded the entire record.  He further contends that if the 
  trial judge correctly ruled that the crimes of dishonesty were admissible, he 
  should have allowed defence counsel to adduce the particulars of those convictions 
  during examination-in-chief.  Lastly, he submits that he was entitled to elicit 
  the penalties imposed on the various convictions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no merit to the argument that the trial judge should have excluded 
  all of the appellant’s criminal record.  A trial judge should exclude evidence 
  of an accused’s prior convictions only where the probative value of that evidence 
  in assessing the accused’s credibility is outweighed by the prejudicial effect 
  of the evidence such that the admission of the evidence would undermine the 
  fairness of the trial:  <i>R. v. Corbett</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 400 
  (S.C.C.).  The balancing process described in <i>R. v. Corbett, supra</i>, is 
  first and foremost a function for the trial judge.  Appellate courts must show 
  deference to determinations by trial judges as to whether all, some or none 
  of an accused’s criminal record will be admitted if the accused testifies.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge admitted evidence of prior convictions involving dishonesty.  
  Those convictions have direct relevance to the accused’s credibility as a witness.  
  While it is true that those convictions predated the offence by at least some 
  7 years, the number of those convictions and the long time span over which they 
  occurred, gave them sufficient potential probative value on the issue of the 
  appellant’s credibility to fully justify the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do agree with the submission that the trial judge should have allowed 
  defence counsel to introduce the particulars of the convictions that were ruled 
  admissible during examination-in-chief.  The trial judge’s ruling that parts 
  of the criminal record would not be admitted did not put the Crown at any disadvantage 
  such that the trial judge was entitled to counter that apprehended disadvantage 
  by limiting defence counsel’s examination-in-chief.  The ruling simply excluded 
  evidence that did not have sufficient probative value to warrant its admissibility.  
  Once the trial judge ruled that certain convictions were sufficiently probative 
  to warrant their admissibility, it was up to counsel to decide whether to elicit 
  that evidence during examination-in-chief.  Many think that there are tactical 
  advantages in doing so:  <i>R. v. Stewart</i> (1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 
  316 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, Crown counsel argued that by “editing” the criminal record, 
  the trial judge put the Crown at a disadvantage requiring that he allow the 
  Crown to decide whether the particulars of the record should be disclosed to 
  the jury.  That argument rests on the claim that if the jury heard the particulars 
  of the “edited” criminal record, it could conclude that while the appellant 
  was prone to commit crimes, he was not prone to commit crimes of violence.  
  In short, the jury might decide that the appellant was a fraudsman but not a 
  murderer.  Crown counsel at trial argued that given this risk it was appropriate 
  that the trial judge leave it up to the Crown to decide whether the particulars 
  of the criminal record should go before the jury.  On appeal, Crown counsel 
  did not advance this argument. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot accept the argument advanced at trial.  It rests on the assumption 
  that the jury would apply propensity reasoning, albeit propensity reasoning 
  favouring the accused, when considering the evidence of the accused’s criminal 
  record.  A criminal record is admitted because it is assumed that juries will 
  follow the instruction given by the trial judge and use the record only in assessing 
  credibility and not for any other purpose.  The argument advanced by the Crown 
  at trial assumes that the jury will misuse the evidence.<a

line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s ruling, combined with Crown counsel’s refusal to indicate 
  before examination-in-chief whether he would bring out the particulars of the 
  conviction in cross-examination, put defence counsel in a difficult position.  
  No valid purpose was served by imposing this limitation on counsel’s examination-in-chief.  
  Once some of the convictions were ruled admissible, they were admissible at 
  the instance of either the Crown or the defence:  <i>R. v. St. Pierre</i> (1974), 
  17 C.C.C. (2d) 489 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s ruling that counsel could not elicit the sentences 
  imposed on the convictions is contrary to the decision of this court in <i>R. 
  v Boyce</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 16 at 37 (Ont. C.A.) where Martin J.A. held 
  that the word “conviction” in s. 12 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> included 
  the adjudication of guilt and the sentence imposed for the prior conviction.  
  In so holding, he said at pp. 36-37:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Moreover, it might well be in the interest of the accused, as I think 
      it was in this case, to inform the tribunal of fact, of the penalty imposed.  
      In the present case, two of the three convictions proved against the appellant 
      resulted in fines.  If the nature of the penalty had not been disclosed, 
      the jury might have assumed that the convictions were more serious than 
      they appear to have been.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It remains to consider the effect of those two errors outlined above.  
  I do not think they prejudiced the appellant.  The trial judge gave a clear, 
  correct and strong instruction to the jury as to the limited use of the evidence 
  of the appellant’s criminal record both when the evidence was adduced and in 
  his final instructions to the jury.  There is no danger that the jury would 
  have misused the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant, in his closing address, skilfully turned 
  the ruling by the trial judge that he could not adduce the criminal record during 
  examination-in-chief to his client’s advantage.  He pointed out to the jury 
  that the accused had willingly taken the witness stand to tell his story knowing 
  full well that he would be faced with his criminal record in cross-examination 
  by Crown counsel.  Counsel for the appellant used his client’s willingness to 
  testify, although knowing that by testifying he could expose his criminal record 
  on cross-examination, to lend some credence to his client’s evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am also satisfied that the refusal to allow counsel to lead evidence 
  of the penalties imposed for the various convictions for crimes of dishonesty 
  did not have any prejudicial effect.  Evidence of the penalties imposed would 
  not have materially diminished the potential significance of the appellant’s 
  criminal record to the assessment of his credibility.  That record had potential 
  significance because of the number of prior convictions and the long period 
  of time over which those convictions were entered.  Evidence that the appellant 
  repeatedly received relatively minor penalties for his many crimes of dishonesty 
  committed over many years would not have helped the appellant.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, this was far from a case where the credibility of the accused 
  was matched against the credibility of other witnesses.  Instead, this was a 
  case where the accused’s bald assertion that he did not murder Mr. Blake stood 
  against a torrent of circumstantial evidence indicating that he did.</p>

  </span> After the evidence was complete and before counsel addressed the jury, 
  the trial judge convened a pre-charge conference.  He told counsel that his 
  instructions would consist of three parts.  The first part would deal with general 
  matters such as reasonable doubt.  The jury had received instructions on these 
  matters at the outset of the trial.  The second part of the instruction would 
  address the law specifically applicable to the allegations against the accused.  
  The third part of the charge would deal with “administrative matters” such as 
  the selection of a foreperson and the procedure to be followed if the jury had 
  questions during its deliberations.  The trial judge described part two of his 
  instructions as “the guts of what the case is about …” and told counsel that 
  he contemplated giving a typed copy of part two of his instructions to each 
  of the jurors for their use during deliberations.  He provided counsel with 
  a draft of part two of his instructions and invited their comments.</p>

  </span> Crown counsel did not suggest that the jury should not receive a written 
  version of part two of the instructions.  He made submissions with respect to 
  specific parts of the draft provided by the trial judge.  Counsel for the appellant 
  took the position that the jury should not be given anything in writing.  Alternatively, 
  he submitted that if the jury was to receive any part of the charge in writing, 
  it should receive the entire charge in writing.  Counsel also took exception 
  to many of the specific references in the draft provided by the trial judge.

  </span> After counsel had addressed the jury, the trial judge convened a second 
  pre-charge conference.  By this time it was clear that he had decided to give 
  the jury a written copy of part two of his instructions.  He provided counsel 
  with a second draft of that part of his charge and invited further submissions.  
  The trial judge’s second draft reflected many of the submissions that had been 
  made to him by counsel at the first pre-charge conference.  Most notably, he 
  had removed all references to the evidence from the document he planned to give 
  to the jury.  Counsel for the appellant did not resile from the positions he 
  took at the first pre-charge conference and he raised specific concerns about 
  parts of the second draft. </p>

  pre-charge conference.  He began by telling the jury that his instructions would 
  fall into three parts.  He described each of the three parts in general terms,

  He told the jury  that a written copy of part two would be provided to each

  Under that heading the trial judge emphasized the presumption of innocence,

  </span> Although counsel did not submit that it was wrong to give the jury any 
  written material to use in the course of its deliberations, I will comment in 
  general terms on that practice.  Traditionally, Canadian juries have received 
  only oral instructions on the law to be applied by them.  While providing jurors 
  with written material was not viewed as in and of itself reversible error, it 
  was described as “a dangerous procedure” to be adopted only in “special circumstances”:  
  <i>R. v. Wong</i> (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 196 at 204 (B.C.C.A.).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

  </span> More recently, however, many Canadian judges have come to recognize 
  that written material in various forms can assist juries in their difficult 
  task of understanding, remembering and applying legal instructions.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> 
  [5] </span></a>  In some Canadian jurisdictions, particularly British Columbia, 
  judges now often provide written materials to juries.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span>

  </span> Judges must explain a variety of legal principles to a jury.  Some of 
  these principles are complex, particularly where there are multiple accused, 
  different theories of liability and various defences advanced at trial.  Complex 
  instructions will sometimes be lengthy.  Any judge who has tried to instruct 
  a jury in a complex criminal case knows how difficult that task can be.  Surely, 
  it can be no less difficult for twelve lay people to understand, recall and 
  apply those instructions.  Juries need whatever help judges can give them.  
  For many years, educators have accepted as self-evident the proposition that 
  appropriate written material enhances the comprehension of oral instruction.  
  Social science research suggests that this proposition has application to jury 
  instructions.<a href="#_ftn8"

  </span> The time has come to embrace the use of written material to enhance 
  juror comprehension of oral instructions, particularly where those instructions 
  must be lengthy and complex.  There is no legal impediment to the use of written 
  material as an adjunct to oral instructions.  While the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  contemplates that trial judges will give closing instructions to the jury (s. 
  650.1), it says nothing about how those instructions should be given. In <i>R. 
  v. Ménard</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 424 at 431 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., (1998), 
  125 C.C.C. (3d) 416 (S.C.C.), Arbour J.A., in this court, accepted that judges 
  could develop new instruction techniques to assist juror comprehension.  Major 
  J., for the Supreme Court of Canada, agreed with Arbour J.A., stating at p. 
  430:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Trial judges should not be discouraged from taking new approaches in 
      an effort to make their instructions more accessible to the jury.  What 
      is crucial is that at the conclusion of the charge the members of the jury 
      understand the nature of their task and have the necessary help from the 
      instructions to carry it out.</p>

  </span> <i>R. v. Ménard, supra</i>, does, however, make the point that care 
  must be taken as to the content of any written material given to the jury, its 
  format and the manner in which that material is presented to the jury.  If a 
  jury is given written material to assist in recalling and applying the oral 
  instructions, it is only sensible to assume that that written material will 
  be relied on by the jury during its deliberations.  Any inaccuracy or inadequacy 
  in the written material, or any confusion or unfairness created by that material 
  is likely to have a serious impact on the validity of any verdict returned by 
  the jury.  The high premium placed on ensuring that written material is accurate 
  and fair should not discourage the use of written material but, should encourage 
  careful preparation of any written material that is to be given to the jury.

  charge.  <i>R. v. Cathro</i> (1955), 112 C.C.C. 154 (B.C.C.A.), rev’d., [1956] 
  S.C.R. 101, the authority relied on by him, does not hold that it is error to 
  provide the jury with a written transcript of only part of a trial judge’s instructions.  
  In that case, the trial judge, in response to a jury’s question, gave the jury 
  a transcript of part of his earlier instructions concerning the applicable legal 
  principles.  The transcript did not contain all of the instructions he had given 
  on those matters.  The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld 
  the conviction.  Davey J.A., in dissent, held that the trial judge had erred 
  in providing the jury with a transcript of part of his instructions.  He said 
  at p. 179:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While, in my respectful opinion, it was unwise to allow the jury to have 
      in writing excerpts from the charge out of their context I would not be 
      disposed to interfere with the verdict if the excerpt in this case had only 
      contained an exposition of the law without reference to the Crown’s case 
      or if it had also contained that portion of the charge relating to the defence.  
      But allowing the jurors to take into their deliberations the Crown’s case 
      in the form of the printed word while leaving the case for the defence to 
      the jury’s memory had the unhappy but unintended result of pushing the defence 
      into obscurity.</p>

  </span> In the Supreme Court of Canada, the conviction was quashed and a new 
  trial ordered.  Estey J., for the majority at p. 114, after deciding the appeal 
  on another ground, indicated his agreement with the dissent of Davey J.A. as 
  it related to the giving to the jury of a transcript of part of the trial judge’s 
  charge.  Estey J. outlined the circumstances in which the jury came to receive 
  the transcript and observed that the transcript did not include all of the instruction 
  on the legal principles referred to in the oral instructions given to the jury.  
  He went on to say at pp. 114-15:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… <u>It is well established that a charge must be considered as  a whole.  
      With this in mind, it seems impossible to conclude otherwise than that the 
      jury, in the course of their deliberations, would inevitably give more weight 
      to the portion transcribed than to that part which they had heard but verbally 
      expressed in the courtroom.</u>  Moreover, in this particular case there 
      was that portion which counsel for the defence had discussed at the end 
      of the learned trial judge’s charge and upon which the learned judge made 
      further comment, which he repeated to the jury as he handed them the typewritten 
      portion.  <u>It would, therefore, seem, as a matter of principle, that a 
      part of a charge should not be handed to the jury.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> Read in the context of what happened in that case, I take Estey J. to 
  mean that if a jury is to receive a transcript of the instructions on the applicable 
  legal principles, that transcript must include all of the instructions referable 
  to those principles and not just part of the instructions.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> In any event, Estey J., did not suggest that it was reversible error 
  to provide the jury with a transcript of only part of the entire instructions 
  given to the jury.  Like Davey J.A., Estey J. looked to the effect of what was 
  actually given to the jury on the fairness of the trial.  He concluded at p. 
  115:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…Where, however, as here, the transcribed part of the charge contains important 
      references to the evidence and contentions made on behalf of the Crown, 
      and but slight reference to the evidence and none to the contentions on 
      behalf of the defence, there can be no doubt but that the giving of such 
      a portion to the jury ought not to be permitted.</p>

  </span> It is consistent with <i>R. v. Cathro, supra</i>, to read the reference 
  by Major J. in <i>R. v. Menard, supra</i>, to the “entire charge” as meaning 
  all of the instructions on the topic or topics to which the written material 
  is directed.  For example, if a judge decides to give a jury a written copy 
  of his instructions relating to the applicable legal principles, that written 
  material should contain all of the instructions referable to those principles.  
  This requirement guards against two dangers.  Juries may be misled by written 
  instructions which tell them only part of what they have to know, and incomplete 
  written instructions may be skewed in favour of one side or the other.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> If a trial judge decides to give a jury a written copy of part of his 
  instructions, he or she should clearly identify the topics to be addressed in 
  the written material and ensure that the written material contains a complete 
  and balanced instruction on those topics.  As long as the jury understands that 
  the written material relates to a specific part of the instruction and that 
  it is to be considered along with the rest of the instructions, I do not think 
  there is any danger that a jury will be misled simply because they were not 
  provided with a written copy of every word in the trial judge’s charge to the 
  jury. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see some advantages in being selective about the written material 
  to be given to a jury.  Some parts of a judge’s instructions will be readily 
  understood by the jury as reasonable, intelligent laypersons.  There will, however, 
  be other matters that will be difficult for the jury to understand, recall and 
  apply during their deliberations.  The applicable legal principles may well 
  be the most difficult part of the instructions for lay jurors to understand.  
  If the aim of written material is to assist the jury in arriving at a true verdict 
  by improving its comprehension, recall and application of the oral instructions, 
  that aim is best served by targeting for written reproduction those parts of 
  the instructions which will prove difficult for the jury.  Giving the jury a 
  written copy of all of the instructions could bury the part of the instructions 
  to which the jury needs to refer in a mass of material that it has no need to 
  make reference to in its deliberations.  Selective resort to written material 
  to assist a jury during its deliberations could enhance the educational value 
  of that material.  However, in a case where the trial judge provides the jury 
  with a written copy of the applicable legal principles care must be taken to 
  ensure that the written material contains all the instructions referable to 
  those principles including, as discussed subsequently, instructions on the presumption 
  of innocence and reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, the trial judge told the jury it would receive a written 
  copy of his instructions relating to the legal matters that were specific to 
  the charges before the jury.  The topics addressed in the written material were 
  consistent with that description and with one caveat constituted the “entire 
  charge” on those topics.  Nothing said by the trial judge in the rest of his 
  charge qualified or amplified anything contained in the written instructions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The one caveat relates to the instructions on the presumption of innocence 
  and reasonable doubt.  The trial judge instructed the jury on these issues at 
  the start of the trial and in the first part of his instructions.  His instructions 
  on these topics were not included in the written material provided to the jury.  
  Instructions on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt are instructions 
  on legal matters specific to the charges. They are indeed the fundamental principles 
  to be applied.  I think the instructions on the presumption of innocence and 
  reasonable doubt should have been included in the written material.  The absence 
  of the instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt is perhaps the most significant 
  omission from the written material.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The merit of including the reasonable doubt instruction is perhaps demonstrated 
  by the sole question asked by the jury during its lengthy deliberations.  It 
  asked the trial judge to repeat the definition of reasonable doubt he had given 
  to them in his instructions.  Had that definition been included in the written 
  material, presumably the jury would not have needed further instruction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although I think the trial judge should have included instructions on 
  the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt in the written material given 
  to the jury, I am satisfied that his failure to do so did not prejudice the 
  appellant.  The oral instructions on the presumption of innocence and reasonable 
  doubt were not challenged on appeal.  The written material provided a strong 
  reminder of the importance of those principles.  Finally, as the jury’s question 
  demonstrates, it appreciated the significance of the reasonable doubt instruction 
  and knew how to access that instruction if the need arose in the course of its 
  deliberations.  </p>
