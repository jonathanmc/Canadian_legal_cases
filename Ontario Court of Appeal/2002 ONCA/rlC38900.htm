    years, all natural siblings, who are the subject of ongoing child protection 
    proceedings commenced in the Ontario Court of Justice at Welland, Ontario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The children were apprehended from their natural parents by the respondent

    natural family, there has not yet been a determination by the court whether 
    the children are in need of protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    will become apparent, the inordinate delay in achieving a permanent placement 
    for these young children lies at the core of this litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The issue for determination by this court is whether Henderson J. erred, 
    in these unusual circumstances, in refusing to exercise the <i

    Court and to make an order respecting the residence of the children pending

    the consent of all parties and of the person caring for the children: s. 51.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before determining an application the Court 
    must obtain and consider a plan for the child’s care prepared in writing by 
    the Society: s. 56.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That plan is to 
    include a statement of the criteria by which the Society will determine when 
    its supervision or wardship is no longer required and an estimate of the time

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>When a protection hearing is held and a court 
    declares that a child is in need of protection, the court must make one of 
    three orders: a supervision order, a society wardship or a Crown wardship: 
    s. 57(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Prior to making such an 
    order, the court is required to ask what efforts the Society has made to assist 
    the child before intervention and to be satisfied that less restrictive alternatives 
    have been attempted and failed, refused by the parent or would be inadequate 
    to protect the child: s. 57(2)(3).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If 
    it is necessary to make an order removing the child from the person who had 
    charge of him or her immediately before the Society intervened, the court 
    must consider whether it is possible to place the child with a relative, neighbour 
    or other member of the child’s community or extended family under the supervision 
    of the Society before making an order for society or Crown wardship: s. 57(4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The court may order that the child, a parent, or a person, except a 
    foster parent, in whose charge the child has been or may be, undergo an assessment: 
    s. 54(1).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When a child is made a society or a Crown ward, 
    the Society chooses a placement for the child.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    Director is satisfied that extraordinary circumstances justify the placement: 
    s.&nbsp;61(4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Director is a person 
    appointed under subsection 5(1) of the Act by the Minister of Community and 
    Social Services. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Hence, within a short time after apprehension, the Society is obligated 
    to provide the court with a written plan of care and information that will 
    enable the court to ascertain whether a member of the child’s extended family 
    is an appropriate caregiver. If it is apparent that a child is in need of 
    protection, because, for example, the parents have abandoned the child and 
    time to explore placement with a family member is required, the Society may 
    request that the court declare the child a ward of the Society. Society wardship, 
    combined with supervision, cannot exceed an aggregate of twelve months: s.&nbsp;57(1)4. 
    Towards the end of the period specified in the court order for supervision 
    or society wardship a review of the child’s status will generally be requested 
    by the Society. The Act stipulates in s. 70 that the court shall not make 
    an order that results in the combined total period for a child being in the 
    Society’s care that exceeds twenty-four months or, pursuant to the recent 
    amendments to the Act, in the case of a child under the age of six years, 
    twelve months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time limit may 
    be extended by an additional six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>This time limit includes any interim care orders made during an adjournment 
    of a protection proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It excludes 
    the time to dispose of any appeals from orders that have been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Society wardship therefore gives the Society a finite time within which

    a parent or with his or her extended family. </span></p>

    of the child’s status under s.&nbsp;64(2)(b).<span

    make a further order or orders under s. 57, such as an order of Crown wardship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    ward that the Act states the Crown has the rights and responsibilities of 
    a parent for the purpose of the child’s care, custody and control: s.63(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Until that time, the Act recognizes that children continue to be the 
    responsibility of their parents by making provision in s. 60 for a parent 
    to be ordered to pay support for a child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The Act also contains a presumption that access with “the person who 
    had charge of the child immediately before intervention under this Part” is 
    in the best interests of the child unless the court is satisfied that this 
    would not be in the child’s best interests: s. 59(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Therefore, until an order of Crown wardship is made, the parents of 
    a child retain a presumptive right of access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    passed or the appeal has been disposed of, the Society may place the child 
    for adoption: s. 140.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Following an

    at which society or Crown wardship is sought.<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Act provides that after a child who is 
    a Crown ward has resided continuously with the same foster parents for more 
    than two years, the foster parents’ wishes must be taken into account in respect 
    of major decisions: s. 61(5)(b).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    foster parents are also provided with 10 days notice prior to removal of a 
    child who is a Crown ward from their residence, and have the right to a review

    is first made by the Society’s board of directors and its decision can be 
    further reviewed by a Director.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    decision of the Director is subject to judicial review. See: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    144 of the Act states that, where a society makes a decision refusing to place 
    a child with a person, including a foster parent who is caring for the child,

    or rescind the decision and do anything that the Society may do with respect

    </span>In this case, the proceedings, although commenced over two years ago, 
    are still at the initial stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    noted earlier, the threshold hearing to determine whether they are in need

    the final stage of the proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This

    example, the record reveals that the appellants, at the same time as they

    the Director in regard to what they viewed as the Society’s refusal to place 
    the children with them for adoption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not 
    surprisingly, they were advised that their request was premature because the 
    children were not as yet available for adoption. It is our view that, although 
    again perhaps understandable given the inordinate delay in this case, their 
    application in the superior court is, likewise, misconceived.<span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On August 6, 2002, the respondents moved before 
    Henderson J. of the Superior Court for an order dismissing the foster parents’ 
    application for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    in Ontario are governed exclusively by the<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> 
    </i>Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They further submitted that, 
    because the Ontario Court of Justice was the specified court with jurisdiction 
    to entertain the child protection applications under the Act, the Superior 
    Court of Justice had no residual jurisdiction to intervene.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The respondents recognized that the Superior 
    Court of Justice has inherent jurisdiction to deal with all matters related 
    to children in the province.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This 
    jurisdiction is commonly known as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parens 
    patriae </i>jurisdiction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, 
    they argued that this jurisdiction is to be exercised rarely and only where 
    there is a gap in the legislation or in the case of judicial review, neither 
    of which applied in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On this preliminary issue of jurisdiction, 
    the foster parents took the position that there is a gap in the legislation 
    that allowed the Superior Court of Justice to exercise its <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction and make the 
    order requested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They submitted that 
    this gap is created by the fact that the Act provides no mechanism by which 
    a foster parent may challenge CAS decisions with respect to the residence 
    of the children pending the determination of their status under the child 
    protection applications in the Ontario Court of Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Hence, in this case, the appellants say they would be unable to challenge 
    or appeal a decision by the CAS to remove the children from their home. The 
    appellants acknowledged before Henderson J. that they were not seeking judicial 
    review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, as an alternative 
    argument, they requested that the application be treated as a judicial review 
    and transferred to the Divisional Court if the applications judge found it

    Children’s Aid Society of Hamilton-Wentworth </i>(1998), 39 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
    389 (Ont. C.A.) and concluded that the Superior Court of Justice may exercise 
    its inherent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction 
    regarding the protection of children where there is a gap in the governing 
    legislation, or in the case of judicial review.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After considering the provisions of the Act 
    as a whole, the role of foster parents under the legislative scheme and the 
    case law, the applications judge concluded that there was no gap in the legislation 
    as contended by the appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On 
    the question of judicial review, the applications judge held that a decision 
    by the CAS as to the residence of children prior to a finding that the children 
    are in need of protection is not subject to judicial review.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In any event, he found that judicial review 
    was not available in this case because the foster parents had not exhausted 
    all available remedies under the Act and that, in several respects, their 
    application was largely premature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consequently, 
    he concluded that there was no basis to exercise the court’s inherent jurisdiction 
    in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By judgment released 
    on October 4, 2002, he dismissed the application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While it would appear that the appellants’ 
    position before Henderson J. was that the court should exercise its inherent 
    jurisdiction because there was a gap in the legislation, their argument on 
    this point has been somewhat modified on appeal.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They now take the position that the applications 
    judge erred in finding that the Superior Court’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction regarding the 
    protection of children is confined to gaps in the legislation or to judicial 
    review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They submit that, absent an 
    express legislative provision to the contrary, the Superior Court has a residual 
    and overriding jurisdiction to supervise all matters concerning the interests 
    of children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They acknowledge, however, 
    that resort to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction 
    should be limited to situations that are not contemplated by the legislation 
    where it becomes necessary for the court to intervene to protect the children. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellants submit that this is a case 
    that is not contemplated by the Act given the fact that more than two years 
    have passed without a post-apprehension hearing being held to determine the 
    status of the children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They submit 
    that the Act can only be considered a complete code in respect of the role 
    of foster parents in the context of the timelines contemplated by the Act.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When these timelines are exceeded, they argue 
    that the children’s strong primary attachments to their foster parents as 
    caregivers become a paramount, if not overriding, factor in the determination 
    of their best interests regardless of the stage of the protection proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The appellants therefore take the position that, in this case, it has 
    become necessary in the best interests of the children for the Superior Court 
    to exercise its inherent jurisdiction and make an order that the children 
    reside with them until the final determination of their status in the protection 
    proceedings.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They submit further that this court’s decision 
    in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>G.(C.)</i>, which held that there 
    was no gap that needed filling in this legislative scheme, can be distinguished 
    because that case involved a situation at a later stage in the proceedings,

    basis to justify the exercise of the Superior Court’s general supervisory 
    power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They submit that the CAS, in 
    arranging for “extended visits” between the children and members of their 
    extended natural family pending the trial, is improperly depriving the appellants 
    of their limited statutory entitlements under the Act and subverting its legislated 
    obligation to promote the best interests of the children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellants submit that the CAS, without 
    receiving the approval of the court, is attempting to create a new <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status quo</i> with respect to the potential 
    placement of the children for adoption in favour of the family members’ position 
    and to the detriment of their own position.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We will deal with the second argument at the 
    outset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In our view, the argument 
    cannot prevail for several reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>First, the argument, which is based on an 
    allegation of abuse of discretion by the CAS, is inconsistent with the appellants’ 
    concession that there is no basis for judicial review in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, the appellant’s allegation of abuse 
    of discretion in relation to the visits between the children and family members 
    ignores the court’s obligation under s. 57(4) to consider the possibility 
    of placing a child “</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extended family</i>” before making an order 
    for society or Crown wardship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hence, 
    an investigation by the CAS into the plans of care presented by the family 
    members is entirely consistent with the legislative scheme. Whether the CAS, 
    under the guise of arranging access, is entitled to effect a residential placement 
    for the children with extended family members at this stage of the proceedings 
    is another question:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>see s. 61 of 
    the Act with respect to the residential placements of children after they

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Third, the record shows that the question 
    of the extended visits with family members was canvassed before Budgell J. 
    in the Ontario Court of Justice and, hence, contrary to the appellants’ submission, 
    it was subject to the court’s approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    on the children’s access to the respondent family members that he saw fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The formal order made by Budgell J. on the issue of access reads: </span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Access as arranged in the past should be continued but

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Further, in his reasons, he stated that it 
    was the view of the court “that the children should not be removed from their 
    present foster setting”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It became 
    apparent during the hearing of the appeal that the parties disagreed on their 
    interpretation of the scope of access permitted by Budgell J.’s order.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The CAS’s interpretation of “reasonable access” 
    that did not amount to removal from their present foster setting was that 
    it had the right to place the children on a series of “extended visits” with 
    the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was intended that 
    the children would reside with the appellants for only a few days in between 
    these visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a few such visits, 
    the CAS planned to place them on an “indefinite extended visit” with these 
    relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellants took the 
    position that this access plan in effect constituted a premature residential 
    placement of the children as wards without court approval.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Given the parties’ disagreement over the meaning 
    of the access order, this court encouraged the parties to seek a clarification 
    from Budgell J.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any uncertainty surrounding 
    this issue, however, is clearly a matter to be resolved in the Ontario Court

    a foster parent and a child and that moving the child back to the family would 
    break the attachment. When could it not be said that the foster home had advantages 
    over the original home. It would be ironic if foster homes were being chosen 
    where the foster parents were so casual that there was no attachment or where

  <div class=Section1>On a status review hearing under s. 65, once it is established

  <div class=Section1><br>
    Values which the C.F.S.A. seeks to preserve through s.&nbsp;57(3) and (4)

    other things, the least restrictive alternative (s. 65(3)(h)) consistent with 
    the pervading principle of the child’s best interests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<blockquote> 
  <div class=Section1>Every person in the child protection and justice systems,

    counsel in a timely manner or failing to attend at assessment appointments; 
    lawyers may not be prepared for a motion or trial; Children’s Aid Societies 
    may not identify all necessary parties or serve documents in a timely manner 
    on all parties; judges may adjourn trials without concluding the evidence 
    and submissions of counsel; and court administrators may not be able to identify 
    proceedings which have exceeded the time frames of the legislation and the
