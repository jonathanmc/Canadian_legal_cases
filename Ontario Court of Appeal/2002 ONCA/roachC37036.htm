  </span> The appellant, Charles Roach is a lawyer and community organizer.  He 
  sued the respondent, Robert Davis, a municipal politician, Now Communications 
  Inc. and Enzo Di Matteo alleging libel and slander.  The libel allegation arose 
  out of an article that appeared in the October 26, 2000 edition of the weekly 
  newspaper “NOW”.  Now Communications Inc. is the publisher of that newspaper.  
  Mr. Di Matteo wrote the article and Mr. Davis was quoted in the article.  Mr. 
  Roach alleged that statements attributed to Mr. Davis implied that Mr. Roach 
  was anti-Jewish.  Mr. Roach also alleged that Mr. Davis had slandered him.  
  The slander allegation relating to Mr. Davis and the libel allegations against 
  the other two defendants are not in issue on this appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Prior to serving a statement of defence, counsel for Mr. Davis moved 
  for an order striking the libel claim against him, contending that Mr. Davis 
  had not been served with a libel notice as required by s. 5(1) of the <i>Libel 
  and Slander Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.12 (the <i>Act</i>).  The motion judge 
  accepted this argument and struck the libel claim.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and reinstate the 
  libel action.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The relevant facts can be briefly stated.  The article in which the 
  alleged libel appeared was published on or about October 26, 2000.  On November 
  7, 2000, Mr. Roach had a letter delivered to the campaign headquarters of Mr. 
  Davis.  The letter contained a copy of the offending article and referred specifically 
  to the three paragraphs that Mr. Roach said contained the libellous statements.  
  The letter went on to say:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mr. Roach’s work with the Nation of Islam is <i>not</i> anti-Jewish.  His 
      position is that what is ascribed to him in the second and third paragraphs 
      of the article quoted above is defamatory.  Accordingly, I have served the 
      writer, Enzo Di Matteo, and the publisher of NOW with the required notice 
      under the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i>.  …</p>
    <p>Needless to say, he [Mr. Roach] takes this matter very seriously.  To avoid 
      legal proceedings against you, please let me have your response as soon 
      as possible.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The letter was hand-delivered to Mewan Chau an adult person working 
  as an administrative assistant in the campaign headquarters of Mr. Davis.  Ms. 
  Chau had no recollection of seeing the letter.  Mr. Davis said the letter was 
  not brought to his attention.  According to Mr. Davis, he was first aware of 
  the libel claim when he was served with the statement of claim on May 22, 2001.  
</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> On appeal, but not before the motion judge, counsel for Mr. Roach argued 
  that Mr. Davis’ motion was premature.  She submitted that Mr. Roach was not 
  required to plead compliance with s. 5(1) of the <i>Act</i> in his statement 
  of claim, but that it was for the defendant to put compliance with that section 
  in issue in the statement of defence:  rule 25.06, <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, 
  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, <i>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. Canadian Broadcasting 
  Corp.</i> (1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 55 (H.C.).</p>

line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is considerable merit to this submission.  However, it was not 
  raised before the motion judge, and the parties put material before the motion 
  judge which fully developed their respective positions.  Nothing would be gained 
  by requiring Mr. Davis to recommence this motion after service of his statement 
  of defence.  In any event, as I am satisfied that Mr. Roach should succeed on 
  the merits, he is not prejudiced by my addressing the issue at this stage of 
  the proceedings.  </p>

  </span> Section 5(1) of the <i>Act</i> reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>No action for libel in a newspaper or in a broadcast lies unless the plaintiff 
      has, within six weeks after the alleged libel has come to the plaintiff’s 
      knowledge, given to the defendant notice in writing, specifying the matter 
      complained of, which <u>shall be served in the same manner as a statement 
      of claim or by delivering it to a grown-up person at the chief office of 
      the defendant.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> NOW is a newspaper as defined in the <i>Act</i>.  Mr. Roach’s action 
  is, therefore, an “action for libel in a newspaper”.  Where s. 5(1) is applicable, 
  compliance with the section is a condition precedent to the bringing of an action 
  for libel.  Failure to provide the notice required under s. 5(1) will bar the 
  action for libel in a newspaper:  <i>Misir v. Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.</i> 
  (1997), 105 O.A.C. 270 at 273 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The November 7<sup>th</sup> letter met the time requirement set out 
  in s. 5(1).  It also specified “the matter complained of” as required by that 
  section.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Davis was not personally served with the November 7<sup>th</sup> 
  letter.  Nor did Mr. Roach obtain an order permitting some alternative method 
  of service upon Mr. Davis.  Consequently, Mr. Roach cannot successfully maintain 
  that he served the letter “in the same manner as a statement of claim”:  rule 
  16.01 and rule 16.03, <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for Mr. Roach makes two submissions.  She argues that s. 5(1) 
  has no application to defendants like Mr. Davis who have no connection to the 
  entity that published or broadcast the alleged libel.  She submits that the 
  purpose of the section is to give notice to the medium through which the libel 
  was spread to allow that medium to take appropriate steps in mitigation.  Alternatively, 
  counsel submits that if s. 5(1) applies to all defendants, the service provisions 
  apply equally to all defendants and that Mr. Davis could be served by delivering 
  the notice to a grown-up person at Mr. Davis’ chief office.  She contends that 
  the delivery of the letter to Ms. Chau, Mr. Davis’ assistant at his campaign 
  headquarters, constitutes compliance with the second means of service described 
  in s. 5(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motion judge proceeded on the basis that all defendants were entitled 
  to the notice referred to in s. 5(1) where the claim alleged libel in a newspaper.  
  She went on to hold, applying <i>obiter</i> from <i>Boyer v. Toronto Life Publishing 
  Co. Ltd.</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 383 at 391 (S.C.J.), that the second means 
  of service described in s. 5(1) was not available to serve individual defendants 
  who had no connection to the entity that had published or broadcast the alleged 
  libel.  Since Mr. Davis was in no way connected to Now Communications Inc., 
  he could not be served by the giving of the notice to a grown-up person at Mr. 
  Davis’ chief office.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The contention that the notice requirement in s. 5(1) does not apply 
  to a defendant like Mr. Davis who has no connection to the publisher or broadcaster 
  of the alleged libel is not without merit.  The various arguments in support 
  of it are marshalled by R. Brown in <i>The Law of Defamation in Canada</i>, 
  2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1999), Vol. 3, at pp. 17-90 to 17-94.  This court has, however, 
  recently held that s. 5(1) applies to all defendants:  <i>Watson v. Southam 
  Inc.</i> (2000), 189 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 695 at 706-707 (Ont. C.A.).  In 
  coming to that conclusion, the court observed that the word “defendant” was 
  not qualified in s. 5 and that the purpose underlying the notice requirement 
  had application to all defendants.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The arguments against the reading of s. 5(1) adopted in <i>Watson v. 
  Southam Inc., supra</i>, may warrant a reconsideration of that authority.  I 
  do not think, however, that this is the appropriate case.  While counsel raised 
  the correctness of <i>Watson v. Southam Inc., supra</i>, her primary argument 
  was that delivery of the letter to Mr. Davis’ office manager at his campaign 
  headquarters constituted compliance with s. 5(1).  As I would decide that issue 
  in favour of Mr. Roach, I prefer to determine the appeal on that basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Watson v. Southam Inc., supra</i>, holds that s. 5 refers to all 
  defendants without qualification because there is no reason to deny any defendant 
  the benefit of the notice contemplated by that section.  If the notice requirement 
  is to apply to all defendants, then I see no reason why the two modes of service 
  described in s. 5(1) should not also apply to all defendants.  The closing words 
  of s. 5(1) clearly suggest service on a corporate entity and the application 
  of those words to individual defendants may be somewhat clumsy.  I see nothing, 
  however, in the language of the section which prevents the application of these 
  words to individual defendants.  If an individual defendant has a “chief office”, 
  that is, a principal place of business, then delivery of the notice to an adult 
  person at that place should suffice to bring the alleged libel to the attention 
  of the individual defendant.  While the notice may not have come to Mr. Davis’ 
  attention in this case, that failure is explained by matters peculiar to this 
  case and not by any inherent inadequacy in that mode of service.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Boyer v. Toronto Life Publishing Co. Ltd., supra</i>, the individual 
  defendants were employed by or closely connected to the publisher of the alleged 
  libel.  Copies of s. 5(1) notices were delivered to their attention at the publisher’s 
  chief office.  They were not served personally.  In a carefully considered decision, 
  Nordheimer J. held that service of those individuals at the publisher’s chief 
  office was proper.  He said at pp. 390-91:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… [S]ervice on all defendants can be effected through the chief office 
      of a corporate defendant publisher assuming there is legitimate reason to 
      believe that there is a connection between the corporate publisher and the 
      individual defendants. …</p>

text-indent:0pt;line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nordheimer J. went on to indicate at p. 391:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… If one of the individual defendants was simply a person who was quoted 
      in the article or broadcast and who had no connection to the corporate publisher 
      then, under this interpretation, the second option for service would not 
      be available.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt; Nordheimer J. went on to indicate at p. 391:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0pt;

text-indent:0pt;line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This observation was unnecessary to the decision reached by Nordheimer 
  J.  I think it is inconsistent with his functional interpretation of s. 5(1) 
  as it applied to defendants who were connected to the publisher.  With respect 
  to those defendants, he gave s. 5(1) an expansive interpretation so as to permit 
  service of individual defendants at someone else’s chief office.  However, his 
  conclusion that other individual defendants could not be served even at their 
  own chief office seems a restrictive interpretation of the section.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>

  </span> Consistency with <i>Watson v. Southam Inc., supra</i>, dictates that 
  s. 5(1) be interpreted so as to provide that both modes of service are potentially 
  available to a plaintiff as against all defendants.  It was not argued that 
  Mr. Davis’ campaign headquarters were not his “chief office”.  Delivery of the 
  letter on November 7<sup>th</sup> to Mr. Davis’ assistant at his campaign headquarters 
  complied with the closing words of s. 5(1) and constituted effective service 
  of the notice.  </p>
