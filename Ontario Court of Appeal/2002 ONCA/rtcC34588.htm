<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Frank K. Roberts dated June 13, 2000.</p>
<p><b>LASKIN J.A.:</b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>            <b>A.            INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants Richard Carlstrom and his company RTC Engineering Consultants 
  Ltd. sued for libel because of a defamatory letter written by the respondent 
  Ian Outerbridge, a lawyer, on behalf of his client, the other respondent Consumers’ 
  Gas Company.  The main question on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred 
  in holding that the defence of qualified privilege defeated the appellants’ 
  action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The action arose out of an explosion in Concord, Ontario.  Carlstrom, 
  a professional engineer, was retained to investigate the cause of the explosion.  
  He theorized that the explosion was caused by a design defect in a heater to 
  which Consumers’ Gas supplied natural gas.  Everyone else who had investigated 
  the explosion, including the provincial regulators, rejected his theory.  After 
  his retainer ended Carlstrom persisted with his theory and wrote these other 
  investigators alleging that the explosion had probably been caused by defective 
  wiring in the heater.  Outerbridge replied to the same individuals and said 
  that Carlstrom’s allegations were “at best professionally irresponsible if not 
  deceitful or at worst malicious.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants sued.  The trial judge Roberts J. dismissed the action 
  on the ground of qualified privilege.  He assessed the appellants’ damages at 
  $40,000 for general damages and nothing for either special or punitive damages.  
  The appellants appeal on four grounds:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1. The trial judge erred in holding that Outerbridge’s letter was written 
      on a privileged occasion;</p>
    <p> 2. the trial judge erred in holding that the letter was written without 
      malice;</p>
    <p> 3. the trial judge erred in holding that the letter was reasonably appropriate; 
      and </p>
    <p> 4. the trial judge’s assessment of general damages was unreasonably low.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>We called on counsel for the respondents 
  only on the third ground of appeal. For the reasons that follow I would dismiss 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>            <b>B.            BACKGROUND FACTS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The explosion took place on November 27, 1992 in a building rented by 
  Inline Fibreglass Limited, a manufacturer of fibreglass and vinyl windows and 
  doors.  Both the Fuels Safety Branch of the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial 
  Relations and the Ontario Fire Marshall’s Office investigated the explosion.  
  They concluded that it was caused by the overheating of a 45-gallon acetone 
  drum located in Inline’s premises.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Carlstrom, who had been retained by Trow Engineering on behalf of Inline, 
  came to a different conclusion.  In his opinion not one but two explosions had 
  occurred.  The first explosion had been caused by design failure in a unit heater 
  above the acetone drum.  The design failure allowed natural gas to accumulate 
  in one chamber of the heater, where it was ignited by the open pilot light in 
  the other chamber.  According to Carlstrom, the explosion in the acetone drum 
  was the second explosion.  No one else supported Carlstrom’s opinion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although Carlstrom’s retainer with Trow ended in January 1993, he mounted 
  a letter writing campaign to persuade others of the validity of his theory.  
  He claimed to have done so because the explosion raised a question of public 
  safety.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because of Carlstrom’s persistence, the Fuels Safety Branch and the 
  Ontario Fire Marshall’s Office agreed to test the unit heater.  The heater was 
  pre-tested on May 5th and fully tested on May 9th, 1994.  Carlstrom was present 
  for the May 9th testing.  The heater worked perfectly and disclosed no deficiencies.  
  Still, Don Beck, an engineer with the Fuels Safety Branch who watched the test, 
  did not rule out the possibility that the heater had been miswired.  Beck asked 
  to review photographs of the heater and Carlstrom supplied him with one he had 
  taken.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The next day, however, without waiting for Beck’s review, Carlstrom 
  wrote a strongly worded letter to Trow reiterating his opinion that there had 
  been two explosions, that natural gas had exploded first, and that the design 
  of the heater “was involved as part of the first explosion”.  He noted the government’s 
  “[i]ncredible resistance” to his concerns and said “[o]bviously something was 
  seriously wrong somewhere.”  He also referred to the May 5th and 9th testings, 
  claiming that they showed “a very serious wiring problem” and concluding that 
  it was “fortunate that no fatality was involved.”  He ended his letter with 
  a “special request”:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Please advise INLINE as soon as possible of this probable deficiency with 
      this specific unit heater, and possible identical problem with other unit 
      heaters, so that they can contact CONSUMERS GAS to discuss the efforts necessary 
      [to] ensure that all electrical circuit wiring to these unit heaters is 
      as required by CGA, (which electrical circuit wiring must include at all 
      times the safety controls).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Significantly for this appeal, Carlstrom sent a copy of his letter to 
  the president of Consumers’ Gas, three adjusters who had investigated the explosion, 
  three employees of the Fuels Safety Branch, including Beck, and two employees 
  of the Ontario Fire Marshall’s Office.  The trial judge concluded that the letter 
  constituted an “attack” on Consumers’ Gas’ interests.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On receipt of the letter, Consumers’ Gas became concerned that it had 
  a safety problem.  By regulation it was prohibited from supplying natural gas 
  to an unsafe appliance.  It asked its lawyer, Outerbridge, to deal with Carlstrom’s 
  allegations.  Outerbridge already had a report from Consumers’ Gas’ own adjuster 
  suggesting no safety problem existed but he was not content with it.  He asked 
  an experienced paralegal on his staff to investigate further.  Within two weeks 
  of receiving Carlstrom’s letter, Outerbridge’s office had three reports – two 
  from engineers with the Ontario Fire Marshall’s Office and one from Beck – all 
  stating that the heater did not have an electrical wiring problem.  Outerbridge 
  was briefed by his paralegal on the two reports from the Fire Marshall’s Office 
  and he read Beck’s report.  Beck summarized his conclusion that the heater was 
  not miswired in the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>An analysis of photographs taken shortly after the incident occurred do 
      not provide any evidence that supports a possibility that mis-wiring of 
      the power supply lines to the appliance could have resulted in an unsafe 
      condition.  The tests demonstrated good ignition and combustion of the unit 
      heater.  The tests also showed that the pilot safety shut-off components 
      would actuate as intended in less than approximately 45 seconds after a 
      pilot outage.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Armed with these three opinions, Outerbridge then drafted a reply to 
  Carlstrom.  His letter dated June 1, 1994 and sent on June 3rd to the same people 
  to whom Carlstrom had written is the subject of the appellants’ libel action. 
  The gravamen of the appellant’s complaint is found in the second last paragraph 
  of the letter.  The full text of Outerbridge’s letter – with the offending paragraph 
  italicized for emphasis – is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>RTC Engineering Consultants Ltd.<br>
      P.O. Box 245<br>
      Rexdale, Ontario<br>
      M9W 5L1</p>
    <p>Dear Sirs:</p>
    <p>Re:  Fire Loss November 27, 1992<br>
      141 Syndercroft Road, Concord, Ontario<br>
      Our File No. 0001/09241<br>
      <br>
      We act for Consumers Gas Company</p>
    <p>Mr. R. Carlstrom, P. Eng., caused to be delivered to our client a report 
      dated May 10, 1994, on the letterhead of your company addressed to Trow 
      Consultants Ltd. ostensibly prepared by him on their instructions at the 
      request of Inline Fibreglass.  This report was published and made public 
      by Mr. Carlstrom by providing a copy of same to the following persons:</p>
    <p>Consumers Gas: President<br>
      Fuels Safety Branch:  M. Philip; Don Beck; Ken Taylor<br>
      G.W. Cleary:  Bob Krywiak<br>
      S.B. Sobel:  Steve Sobel<br>
      Lowthian Smith Sharoun:  Raymond Smith<br>
      Ontario Fire Marshal:  Mr. Moyle; Armen Kassabien</p>
    <p>There is no privilege attaching to this publication.</p>
    <p>Specifically the statements on page 4 under the heading “Conclusion” and 
      under the heading “Special Request” are untrue and known to be untrue by 
      Mr. Carlstrom or alternatively, should have been known to be untrue and 
      constitute a defamation of Consumers Gas.</p>
    <p>In consequence of the publication by Mr. Carlstrom, we have caused an intensive 
      investigation into the facts and circumstances underlying his allegations 
      and have determined that there is no substance whatever to his suggestion 
      that the unit in question was incorrectly wired on the premises of Inline.</p>
    <p>The wiring “problem” to which he alludes was one which was created deliberately 
      by Mr. Hilla on or about the first week of May, 1994, in order to facilitate 
      the testing of the individual components of the heater and this information 
      was known or should have been known to Mr. Carlstrom.</p>
    <p><i>His opinion premised on the possibility that such a wiring configuration 
      “probably” occurred prior to having been made by Mr. Hilla is at best professionally 
      irresponsible if not deceitful, or at worst malicious.</i></p>
    <p>That being the case we request of you on behalf of our client that your 
      disassociate yourself from this publication or alternatively acknowledge 
      that the publication was done on your authority and with your knowledge, 
      in which event, we ask for an apology and a retraction forthwith addressed 
      to the Consumers Gas Company.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the last paragraph of the letter shows, Outerbridge sought a retraction 
  or an apology from Carlstrom.  But Carlstrom offered neither.  Instead he sued 
  for libel.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;

    <p><b>(a)            The defence of qualified privilege</b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Outerbridge’s letter is admittedly defamatory of Carlstrom and his company.  
  The appellant’s action failed because of the trial judge’s conclusion that the 
  respondents were entitled to rely on qualified privilege.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Qualified privilege is a defence to a defamation action.  The privilege 
  attaches to the occasion when a defamatory statement is made, not to the statement 
  itself.  But on an occasion of qualified privilege a person may defame another 
  – either orally or in writing – without attracting liability.  The law presumes 
  that the defamatory statement was made honestly and in good faith.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The rationale for the defence is that the interest sought to be protected 
  by the statement is considered important enough to justify a limited immunity 
  from an action for defamation.  Immunity is limited because it extends only 
  to statements that are germane and reasonably appropriate, and that are made 
  honestly and in good faith or without malice.  Thus, the defence of qualified 
  privilege reflects a balancing of competing interests:  the interest the maker 
  of the statement seeks to serve and the interest in reputation that the defamed 
  party seeks to protect.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the heart of the defence of qualified privilege is the notion of 
  reciprocity or mutuality.  A defendant must have some interest in making the 
  statement and those to whom the statement is made must have some interest in 
  receiving it.  “Interest”, however, should not be viewed technically or narrowly.  
  The interest sought to be served may be personal, social, business, financial, 
  or legal.  The context is important.  The nature of the statement, the circumstances 
  under which it was made, and by whom and to whom it was made are all relevant 
  in determining whether the defence of qualified privilege applies.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Two examples are relevant here.  First, a lawyer may have a qualified 
  privilege in trying to protect the legitimate interests of a client.  And second, 
  a person attacked by another may respond in kind, in the same way and to the 
  same audience chosen by the person making the attack: <i>Netupsky v. Craig</i>, 
  [1971] 1 O.R. 51 (C.A.), aff’d [1973] S.C.R. 55; <i>Falk v. Smith,</i> [1941] 
  O.R. 17 (C.A.).   And see generally Brown, <i>The Law of Defamation in Canada</i>, 
  2nd ed. (1999), Vol. 2, Ch. 13; <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>, 
  [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130; <i>Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd.</i>, 
  [1995] 3 S.C.R. 3.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Not everything said or written on an occasion of qualified privilege 
  is protected.  As is evident from the term “qualified privilege” itself and 
  from the previous discussion, the privilege is not absolute.  It may be lost 
  in one of two ways.  First, it may be lost if the dominant motive for making 
  the statement was malice.  In this context malice means not just ill will towards 
  another but any ulterior motive that conflicts with the interest or duty created 
  by the occasion.  And it includes recklessness.  Both dishonesty and a reckless 
  disregard for the truth may amount to malice.  Second, a privilege may be lost 
  if the statement is not commensurate with the occasion, either because the statement 
  is not germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion or because the recipients 
  of the statement have no interest in receiving it.  Put differently, to maintain 
  privilege a defendant must communicate appropriate information to appropriate 
  people.  See <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology, supra</i>, and <i>Douglas v. 
  Tucker</i>, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 275.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I turn now to the issues on the appeal.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>(b)            The issues</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.         <u>Did the trial judge err in holding that 
  Outerbridge’s letter was written on an occasion of qualified privilege?</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge held that Carlstrom’s May 10th letter, especially the 
  last paragraph headed “Special Request”, constituted an “attack” on Consumers’ 
  Gas’ interests.  He therefore concluded that Carlstrom’s letter created an occasion 
  of qualified privilege, triggering “an interest or duty in the defendants to 
  reply”.  The appellants acknowledge that Consumers’ Gas, through its lawyer, 
  was entitled to respond to the letter to protect its interests but submit that 
  Outerbridge should have replied only to Carlstrom.  The appellants point out 
  that as an engineer Carlstrom had a professional obligation to report a situation 
  he believed may endanger the safety or welfare of the public.  If Consumers’Gas 
  did not agree with Carlstrom’s opinion it should have communicated with him 
  alone.  Thus, the appellants contend that whatever privilege might have existed 
  was lost because Outerbridge sent his letter to more people than he should have.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not accept this contention.  The trial judge was correct in characterizing 
  Carlstrom’s strongly worded letter as an attack on Consumers’ Gas’ interests.  
  Consumers’ Gas carries on business in a highly regulated industry.  If the heater 
  at Inline and others like it in the province were unsafe Consumers’ Gas was 
  obligated to inspect them, no doubt at great cost to itself.  Outerbridge was 
  thus entitled to protect his client’s legitimate interests by writing to the 
  very same people to whom Carlstrom had sent his letter.  Indeed, Outerbridge 
  was careful to restrict the recipients of his letter to those who had received 
  Carlstrom’s letter.  Had he not done so the respondents’ qualified privilege 
  may have been lost.  In the context of what occurred here, however, I agree 
  with the trial judge that Outerbridge’s letter was sent on an occasion of qualified 
  privilege.</p>
<p>2.       <u>Did the trial judge err in holding that Outerbridge’s letter was 
  written without malice?</u></p>

  </span> The trial judge found as a fact that Mr. Outerbridge honestly believed 
  the statements he made.  And he held that “on all the evidence…there was no 
  malicious motive nor were the defendants reckless with respect to the truth.”  
  The appellants attack the trial judge’s finding of no malice.  They submit that 
  Outerbridge’s ulterior motive in writing the letter was to teach Carlstrom a 
  lesson.  They note Outerbridge’s own testimony that he thought Carlstrom was 
  “sort of trolling for business”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even if this evidence reflects some ill will toward Carlstrom, it was 
  but a minor motive for the letter.  To defeat the defence of qualified privilege 
  the law requires a plaintiff to show that malice was the dominant motive for 
  the communication.  Here the trial judge found no dominant malicious motive 
  and that finding is amply supported by the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Outerbridge testified that he honestly and on reasonable grounds believed 
  what he wrote was true and necessary.  He was not cross-examined and his evidence 
  was not otherwise contradicted.  Outerbridge knew that his client’s interests 
  were threatened by Carlstrom’s letter.  But instead of relying on the report 
  of Consumers’ Gas’ own adjuster, he carefully researched the question whether 
  the heater was defective before replying.  When he wrote his letter on June 
  1, 1994, Outerbridge had the benefit of three engineering reports, each of which 
  had concluded that the heater was not defective.  The care taken by Outerbridge 
  may be contrasted with the reckless behaviour of the defendant lawyers in <i>Botiuk, 
  supra,</i> whose failure to investigate the facts before defaming the plaintiff 
  Mr.&nbsp;Botiuk was properly criticized by the Supreme Court of Canada.  I would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>3. &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Did the trial judge err in 
  holding that the letter was reasonably appropriate?</U></p>
<p> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This was the main ground of appeal and the only ground on which we called 
  on the respondents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A qualified privilege will be defeated if the communication is not reasonably 
  germane and appropriate to the occasion.  The appellants accept that Outerbridge’s 
  letter was germane to the occasion in the sense that it addressed the matters 
  raised by Carlstrom in his letter.  But the appellants submit that the trial 
  judge erred in concluding that the words used by Outerbridge were reasonably 
  appropriate.  The appellants particularly complain about Outerbridge’s statement 
  that Carlstrom’s opinion was “at best professionally irresponsible if not deceitful 
  or at worst malicious.”  In support of this submission the appellants argue 
  that because Outerbridge was a lawyer the trial judge should have scrutinized 
  his words and actions more carefully.  The appellants point to the following 
  proposition from the reasons of Cory J. in <i>Botiuk</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 
  35:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>However, when the defendants are lawyers who must be presumed to be reasonably 
      familiar with both the law of libel and the legal consequences flowing from 
      the signing of a document, their actions will be more closely scrutinized 
      than would those of a lay person.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge did not ignore this 
  proposition but the appellants submit that he did not give it enough weight.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not agree with this submission, and I do not agree that the trial 
  judge erred in concluding that Outerbridge’s words were reasonably appropriate 
  to the occasion.  Three main considerations support the trial judge’s conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, Carlstrom’s letter merited a strongly worded response.  Indeed, 
  in my view, Outerbridge was entitled to question Carlstrom’s professional responsibility, 
  truthfulness, and <i>bona fides</i>.  Carlstrom wrote as a professional engineer, 
  yet he did not refer at all to the many professional opinions that contradicted 
  his own.  Moreover, when he wrote his letter, as the trial judge found, he “knew 
  or ought to have known…that at the very least there was no definitive evidence 
  of miss-wiring and further…that Mr. Beck was reviewing the two photographs to 
  see if they disclosed any further evidence of miss-wiring.”  Despite what he 
  knew or ought to have known, Carlstrom referred to a “very serious wiring problem” 
  and urged that Inline be told not of a possible deficiency with its heater but 
  of a “probable deficiency”, a distinction whose significance could not be lost 
  on a professional engineer.  In addition, Carlstrom raised the spectre of Consumers’ 
  Gas having been fortunate to have avoided a fatality, a scare tactic some might 
  well consider malicious.  I therefore agree with the trial judge’s holding that 
  “the seriousness of the attacks contained in the May 10th letter based on misstatements 
  of the facts and omissions including the omissions of any reference or qualification 
  arising from the multitude of contrary opinions, required strong language from 
  the defendants to protect their interests.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A second relevant consideration is that a person whose interests are 
  attacked is entitled to reasonable latitude in responding.  Even accepting that 
  Outerbridge’s language was, to use the trial judge’s word, “indelicate” and 
  even taking into account that Outerbridge is a lawyer, I do not think his letter 
  exceeded the bounds of reasonable latitude.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A final consideration, pointed out by Mr. Porter in his argument, is 
  that Outerbridge had a wider scope to comment because he investigated the issues 
  raised by Carlstrom before responding to them.  See <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology</i>, 
  <i>supra,</i> at p.&nbsp;1193.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  
  I would therefore dismiss the appellant’s appeal.</p>
<p>4.         <u>Was the trial judge’s assessment of 
  damages unreasonably low?</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is not necessary to address this ground of appeal because I would 
  dismiss the appeal on liability.  That said, I see no reviewable error in the 
  trial judge’s assessment of $40,000 for general damages.  That figure is not 
  so low that it warrants this court’s intervention.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>(c)            Costs</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial 
  indemnity scale.  The amendments to rule 57.01 effective in January of this 
  year require this court to fix the respondents’ costs in accordance with rule 
  57.01(1) and the Tariff.  I would fix their costs at $20,000.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although Mr. Porter acted for Outerbridge and Ms. Sefton for Consumers’ 
  Gas their position was identical.  Thus, they quite properly prepared a joint 
  factum and Mr.&nbsp;Porter made oral submissions on behalf of both respondents.  
  For costs purposes, I would treat the respondents as a single party.  The argument 
  of the appeal took 2¾ hours.  Both Mr. Porter and Ms. Sefton have over 20 years 
  experience at the bar.  Their total fees claimed, using the top hourly rate 
  of $350 per hour, are approximately $40,000.  I have no doubt that they spent 
  the hours they said they did.  Nevertheless, having regard to the factors set 
  out in rule 57.01(1)(a), (c) and (d) I think that $20,000 is a fair figure for 
  the respondents’ fees.</p>

  </span> I would dismiss the appeal with costs on a partial indemnity scale.  
  I would fix the respondents’ costs at $20,000 plus the disbursements set out 
  in Ms. Sefton’s bill of costs together with the appropriate amount for G.S.T.</p>
