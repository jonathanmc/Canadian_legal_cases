<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice Kenneth A. Langdon dated 
  February 26, 2001.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This case concerns the interpretation of an offer to settle made 
  prior to institution of litigation.  The respondent Elaine Scanlon and the appellant 
  Richard Standish separated after twelve years of cohabitation.  They retained 
  counsel to resolve issues arising out of their cohabitation and separation.  
  Through her lawyer, Ms. Scanlon made an offer to settle these issues.  The offer 
  contained this phrase:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>You may treat this as an offer to settle pursuant to the provisions 
      of Rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure even though no litigation has 
      been commenced.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Standish did not accept that offer.  Rather, without consulting 
  his counsel, the following day he made a new offer to Ms. Scanlon.  She did 
  not accept this counter-offer.  The next day, Mr. Standish purported to accept 
  Ms. Scanlon’s original offer.  She did not agree that the matter had been settled.  
  About six months later she commenced an action seeking, among other things, 
  declarations that she is the owner of various properties and of shares in Polymer 
  Distribution Inc. or compensation in the amount of $3,000,000.  Mr.&nbsp;Standish 
  brought a motion for judgment pursuant to rule 49.09 on the basis that the litigation 
  had been settled.  Langdon J. dismissed this motion.  He held that the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 did not apply since the offer had 
  been made before litigation had been started.  Thus, the common-law rule of 
  contract that delivery of a counter-offer destroys the power to accept the initial 
  offer applied.  I agree with Langdon J.’s conclusion and most of his reasons 
  and would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms. Scanlon and Mr. Standish began to cohabit in 1988.  In the 
  following twelve years they built Polymer Distribution Inc. into a very successful 
  company.  Their personal relationship broke down and in August 1999 they separated, 
  although they continued to occupy the same residence.  In the fall of 1999 they 
  began to try and resolve their differences.  By October, the parties had retained 
  lawyers and Standish’s lawyer provided a draft separation agreement.  Ms. Scanlon’s 
  lawyer replied by asking for financial disclosure from Mr. Standish.  He did 
  not provide the disclosure and she refused to sign the agreement.  In December 
  there followed an exchange of correspondence that has produced the issue raised 
  by this appeal.  The chronology is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>December 10, 1999</span></b>:  Standish’s solicitor 
      sends to Scanlon’s solicitor a settlement proposal.  The letter contains 
      the following clauses:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>You may take this correspondence as a formal 
          offer of settlement pursuant to Rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
          in the matter of contemplated litigation as between the parties.</span></p>
        <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>In the event your client ought to see fit 
          not to accept the foregoing offer, then we will be relying upon the 
          same upon the issue of costs and shall be seeking the entirety of our 
          client’s legal fees to be paid by your client on a solicitor and client 
          basis from the date of this offer forward to the conclusion of the litigation.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>December 15, 1999:</span></b><span>  </span>Scanlon’s 
      solicitor replies to this letter with a letter setting out two alternatives.  
      The first alternative may be characterized as an offer to settle and concludes 
      with the following clause:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>You may treat this as an offer to settle 
          pursuant to the provisions of Rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
          even though no litigation has been commenced.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>December 16, 1999:</span></b><span>  </span>After receiving 
      the letter from Scanlon’s lawyer, Standish speaks to her directly and then 
      sends her a document by fax headed “Final Offer”.  This offer, although 
      handwritten and brief, sets out with reasonable certainty an offer to settle 
      the dispute.</p>
    <p><b>December 17, 1999:  </b><span lang=EN-US>Standish’s solicitor writes 
      to Scanlon’s solicitor purporting to accept the first alternative in the 
      letter of December 15, 1999.</span></p>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>December 21, 1999:</span></b><span>  </span>Scanlon’s 
      solicitor writes to Standish’s solicitor confirming a conversation of the 
      previous day that she did not agree that the matter had been settled and 
      that she would be making no further “commitments” until Standish provided 
      his financial statement.  Scanlon’s solicitor also writes the following:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Mr. Standish’s counter offer of December 16 was a rejection of the 
          offer Ms. Scanlon made on December 15.  Mr. Standish could no longer 
          accept the offer after having rejected it.  The authorities, I submit, 
          are clear on this point.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>This appeal raises the following issues:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>1.         Was Scanlon’s letter of December 15, 1999 an offer to settle 
      within the meaning of rule 49?</p>
    <p>2.         If not, did the letter nevertheless incorporate by reference 
      the provisions of rule 49 including rule 49.07(2)?  Rule 49.07(2) provides 
      as follows:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>Where a party to whom an offer to settle is made rejects the offer 
          or responds with a counter-offer that is not accepted, the party may 
          thereafter accept the original offer to settle, unless it has been withdrawn 
          or the court has disposed of the claim in respect of which it was made.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3.         If the December 15, 1999 letter incorporated rule 49.07(2) by 
      reference, did this, in effect, create an option, thus requiring separate 
      consideration for the offer to remain open for acceptance after the counter-offer?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Since I agree with Langdon J.'s disposition of the case I will 
  largely rely on his reasons, which are now reported at (2001), 17 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 
  136.  While he did not expressly deal with the second issue, he made findings 
  that resolve that issue against the appellant.  Because of my resolution of 
  the first two issues, I find it unnecessary to decide the third issue.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>1.         Was Scanlon’s letter of December 15, 1999 an 
  offer to settle within the meaning of Rule 49?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As set out in Scanlon’s solicitor’s letter of December 21, 1999, 
  the common-law position is that a counter-offer generally destroys the power 
  to accept the initial offer, unless the original offer is renewed by reply to 
  the counter-offer.  See <i>Re Cowan and Boyd</i> (1921), 61 D.L.R. 497 (Ont. 
  S.C. App. Div.); S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>,<i> </i>4<sup>th</sup> 
  ed. (1999), at p. 83.  Scanlon did nothing to lead Standish to believe that 
  she was renewing the original offer after his counter-offer.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Rule 49.07(2) reverses the common-law position by providing that 
  the party may accept an offer to settle although he or she has made a counter-offer, 
  unless the original offer has been withdrawn or the court has disposed of the 
  claim.  Standish submits that the December 15, 1999 letter was a rule 49 offer 
  and therefore it remained open for acceptance notwithstanding his counter-offer 
  of December 16, 1999.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After reviewing the few cases that have dealt with application 
  of rule 49 to pre-litigation offers, Langdon J. concluded that the Rules, including 
  rule 49, could not apply to pre-litigation offers.  He particularly relied upon 
  <i>Bodenhamer v. Bodenhamer</i> (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 767 (Gen. Div.), where Herold 
  J. pointed out that rule 49 is triggered by a “party to a proceeding” serving 
  an offer to settle “any one or more of the claims in the proceeding”.  As Herold 
  J. said at p.&nbsp;770 these words contemplate the existence of pending litigation.  
  And, as Langdon J. pointed out, “proceeding” is defined in rule 1.03 as “an 
  action or application”.  As he explained, Scanlon and Standish could not be 
  parties to a proceeding when there is no proceeding.  I agree with his conclusion 
  that,  “Absent an application or action, the Rules of Civil Procedure, by their 
  own definition, have no application to disputes between citizens”.  As rule 
  49 does not apply, the common law rule prevails and Standish’s counter-offer 
  of December 16, 1999 destroyed the power to accept Scanlon’s original offer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before leaving this first issue, I would point out that rule 
  18 of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99, which deals with offers to 
  settle under those rules, does apply to pre-litigation offers.  Rule 18(2) provides 
  that the rule applies to an offer “made at any time, even before the case is 
  started”.  The fact that the Family Rules Committee thought it necessary to 
  expressly provide for this extended application tends to support the view that 
  rule 49, which governs this litigation and contains no comparable provision, 
  cannot by its terms apply to pre-litigation offers.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>2.         Did the December 15, 1999 letter incorporate 
  by reference the provisions of rule 49 including rule 49.07(2)?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Standish submits that even if rule 49 does not apply by its 
  terms to pre-litigation offers to settle, the December 15, 1999 letter incorporated 
  by reference the provisions of rule 49, including rule 49.07(2).  In aid of 
  this submission he calls upon the <i>contra proferentem </i>rule and says that 
  if there is any ambiguity as to whether the terms of rule 49 were incorporated, 
  the offer should be interpreted against its author, Ms. Scanlon.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In effect, Mr. Standish argues that by expressly referring to 
  rule 49 in his letter, Ms. Scanlon’s counsel must have intended to incorporate 
  the provisions of that rule.  He submits that the court should at least imply 
  that the offer was to remain outstanding notwithstanding intervening counter-offers 
  (rule 49.07(2)); that the offer could only be withdrawn in writing (rule 49.04); 
  and that the offer once accepted could be enforced by judgment under rule 49.09.  
  Counsel for Mr.&nbsp;Standish attempts to distinguish <i>Bodenhamer</i> on the 
  ground that there is no indication that the pre-litigation offer referred to 
  rule 49, as did Scanlon’s December 15<sup>th</sup> offer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Taken in isolation, Scanlon’s counsel’s reference to rule 49 
  may appear ambiguous and thus potentially inviting application of the <i>contra 
  proferentem </i>rule.  However, when read in light of Standish’s December 10<sup>th</sup> 
  letter, to which the December&nbsp;15<sup>th</sup> offer was a response, it 
  seems to me that the ambiguity evaporates.  For ease of reference I repeat the 
  two pertinent clauses from the December 10<sup>th</sup> letter:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>You may take this correspondence as a formal offer of settlement pursuant 
      to Rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure in the matter of contemplated 
      litigation as between the parties.</span></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>In the event your client ought to see fit not to accept the foregoing 
      offer, then we will be relying upon the same upon the issue of costs</span></u> 
      and shall be seeking the entirety of our client’s legal fees to be paid 
      by your client on a solicitor and client basis from the date of this offer 
      forward to the conclusion of the litigation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, counsel for Scanlon, like counsel for Standish, was 
  putting the other side on notice that if the dispute were not settled and a 
  court was ultimately called upon the resolve the issues in litigation he would 
  draw the correspondence to the court’s attention and ask the court to exercise 
  its discretion to award solicitor/client costs.  In my view, counsel did not 
  intend to incorporate the whole of rule 49, parts of which could have no possible 
  application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nor is this a proper case for the court to imply a term such 
  as rule 49.07(2) into the offer.  I would adopt the discussion in G.H.L. Fridman, 
  <i>The Law of Contract in Canada</i>,<i> </i>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed. (1999), 
  at pp. 501-2 where he says the following:</p>

      trade or business usage or custom that may be said to govern the relationship

      term into the kind of contract that is in question.  [Footnotes omitted;

  </span></span> There is hardly strong evidence to support importing the terms 
  of rule 49.07(2) into the December 15<sup>th</sup> offer.  As I have pointed 
  out, the previous course of dealings between the parties indicates that this 
  was nothing more than an attempt to import the costs consequences of rule 49.  
  This was the view of Langdon J.  He held that the reference to rule 49 was nothing 
  more than a “clear warning that, at the end of the day, the successful litigant-offeror 
  will disclose the offer to the court and seek costs sanctions if his offer turns 
  out to have been unreasonably rejected”.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>3.         If the December 15, 1999 letter incorporated 
  rule 49.07(2) by reference, did this, in effect, create an option, thus requiring 
  separate consideration for the offer to remain open for acceptance after the 
  counter-offer?</p>

  </span></span> Having decided that rule 49 by its terms did not apply to a pre-litigation 
  offer, the motions judge turned to the question of whether inclusion of the 
  reference to rule 49 in the solicitors’ letters could abrogate the common law 
  rule, referred to above, that delivery of a counter-offer destroys the power 
  to accept the initial offer.  His approach to that question was different from 
  the approach I have taken above.  He held that a reference to rule 49 alone 
  could not abrogate the common law rule because this would, in effect, create 
  an option and require separate consideration to be valid.  He reasoned as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[No] individual, merely because he is a party to a dispute, has the capacity 
      unilaterally to alter the law of contract.  In order to do that, there must 
      be legislation, such as the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> and the [Rules 
      of Civil Procedure].  <u>Failing that, he must make an offer under seal 
      or he must receive consideration for what is essentially a bargain to grant 
      an option</u>. … <u>These particular portions of judge-made law are too 
      important, too universally understood, accepted and acted upon, for them 
      to be inflicted randomly upon anyone who happens to be a party to a dispute.</u></p>
    <p>… <u>[Ms. Scanlon’s] offer was not under seal.  It was not given pursuant 
      to a bargain where she had received consideration, a dollar or a peppercorn, 
      in exchange for her promise to hold the “option” open past the time when, 
      under ordinary principles of contract law, it would expire.  It was no longer 
      open for acceptance.</u>  [Mr. Standish] did not rely on it.  His material 
      does not say that “but for” the Rule 49 clause, he would not have made a 
      counter-offer.  It does not appear that he consulted his solicitor before 
      he made the counter-offer.  He tried to get a better deal by making a counter-offer.  
      It cannot be said that he suffered a detriment.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The principle relied upon by the motions judge

  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>The approach of the common law has been that the promise to hold the 
      offer open is not binding unless it is itself bargained for or under seal.</span></u><span>  
      </span>The problem is a difficult one.  On the one hand it is argued that 
      a promise, to be enforceable, should meet the ordinary tests of enforceability 
      – that is bargain or the formality of the seal.  <u>An enforceable option 
      is a valuable right and is not to be treated more lightly than any other 
      contract.  On the other hand, the offeree may well rely on the promise to 
      hold the offer open and if the reliance is reasonable (and it is very common 
      in business circles) justice seems to require its protection.</u>  [Footnotes

  </span></span> A promise to keep the offer open notwithstanding delivery of 
  a counter-offer may not strictly speaking be an option.  It was open to Ms. 
  Scanlon to withdraw her offer up to the time that it was validly accepted.  
  An option is usually thought of as a promise by the offeror not to withdraw 
  the offer for a certain period of time.  Depending on changes in the market, 
  an option can turn out to be very expensive to the grantor.  Hence the reluctance 
  of the common law to enforce gratuitous promises to hold offers open, especially 
  in the absence of reasonable reliance.  Further, if such promises were to be 
  enforceable “just as bargained-for-promises, an oral promise to hold an offer 
  open made by a private individual would expose the individual to the full panoply 
  of remedies including specific performance and expectation damages”.  See Waddams, 
  <i>supra</i> at p. 92. </p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thus, some of the policy reasons supporting the common law rule 
  with respect to options would not necessarily apply to a promise merely to keep 
  the offer open notwithstanding delivery of a counter-offer.  Further, Waddams 
  suggests at p. 93 that an all or nothing approach to enforceability of promises 
  to keep an offer open may not be the preferred approach.  He suggests that a 
  “sounder approach” would be for the court to recognize that “a promise to hold 
  an offer open is not a bargain but that it may be enforceable to a limited extent 
  if justice so requires in view of the subsequent reliance of the promisee”.

  </span></span> For the following reasons, I find it unnecessary to decide whether 
  the motions judge’s characterization of the reference to rule 49 as, “essentially” 
  an option was correct and if so whether, nevertheless the court should enforce 
  such a promise.  I have already found that on its proper construction, the December 
  15, 1999 letter did not incorporate by reference rule 49.07(2).  Therefore, 
  it did not incorporate a promise to keep the offer open for acceptance notwithstanding 
  delivery of a counter-offer.  The motions judge also found as a fact, in the 
  passage set out above, that there was no reliance upon any such promise.  Finally, 
  counsel for the respondent did not seek to support the motion judge’s conclusion 
  on this basis.  </p>

  </span></span> To summarize my holdings.  A pre-litigation offer, such as the 
  December 15, 1999 offer by Scanlon, is not a rule 49 offer.  The Scanlon offer 
  did not incorporate by reference the terms of rule 49.07(2).  Accordingly, the 
  delivery of the counter-offer destroyed the power to accept Scanlon’s original 
  offer. </p>
