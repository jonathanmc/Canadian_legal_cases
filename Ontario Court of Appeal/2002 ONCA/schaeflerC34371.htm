<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice James B. 
  Chadwick, sitting with a jury, dated May 21, 1993.</span></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the beginning of his able submissions to this court, appellant’s 
  counsel acknowledged that the appellant’s guilt had been established beyond 
  a balance of probabilities but submitted that it fell short of proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt.  We deal below with each of the submissions made on behalf 
  of the appellant.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred 
  in failing to instruct the jury that counsel’s suggestions to each of two witnesses, 
  Robert Campbell and Theresa Lavergne, were not evidence unless adopted by the 
  witness.  It was his submission that the suggestions were so significant that 
  they undermined the appellant’s defence and resulted in an unfair trial.  Counsel 
  invited us, in considering this submission, to have reference to three statements 
  of Robert Campbell’s ex-wife and related documents.  The Crown agreed that we 
  might refer to this evidence, and reference was made to it by counsel for both 
  the appellant and the respondent in this court.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We do not agree with this submission.  During his review of the 
  evidence in his closing address, Crown counsel did not refer to the suggested 
  contradictions.  In his charge, the trial judge similarly dealt only with the 
  <i>viva voce</i> evidence given by these two witnesses at the trial.  There 
  was no objection to the charge by defence counsel.  In the overall context of 
  this six-week trial, we do not consider that any prejudice flowed from these 
  questions.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the jury was not properly 
  instructed with respect to the burden of proof.  It should be noted that this 
  charge was delivered four years prior to the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision 
  in <i>R. v. Lifchus </i>(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1, and seven years prior to 
  its decision in <i>R. v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449.<i>  </i>Throughout 
  the charge, the trial judge emphasized that the burden of proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt rested with the Crown and never shifted.  In our view, the charge, read 
  as a whole, does not give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended 
  the standard of proof.  While the language is not as precise as the <i>Lifchus 
  </i>formulation, the charge complied with the necessary criteria identified 
  in that case, and the jury was not misled as to the correct standard of proof:  
  <i>R. v. Tavernor </i>(2001), 140 O.A.C. 78 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge failed 
  to give a specific <i>Vetrovec </i>warning with respect to two witnesses, Richard 
  Berube and Gerald Gnassi. Defence counsel did not ask for such a warning or 
  object to the failure to give it.  Having regard to their conduct during the 
  years that preceded the trial, neither witness fell within the traditional characterization 
  of an unsavoury witness, and we see no error in the failure of the trial judge 
  to give such a warning. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred 
  in telling the jury that “it would certainly appear to me that the stronger 
  evidence points to the death having occurred in the morning”.  This was consistent 
  with the Crown’s theory at trial, but was not unfavourable to the appellant, 
  who adduced evidence of an alibi for his whereabouts that morning.  The trial 
  judge, as is customary, made it very clear that the responsibility to find facts 
  was that of the members of the jury, and that they were in no way bound to follow 
  his opinion.  In our view, this remark of the trial judge, in the context of 
  his specific cautions to the jury and in light of the weight of the evidence 
  in favour of its accuracy, could not have misled the jury as to its independent 
  duty as finders of fact.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant took issue with the reference both 
  by Crown counsel in his closing address and the trial judge in his charge to 
  the jury to a statement of David Kesselring in which he purportedly said that 
  Robert Campbell had told him that the deceased had “been murdered at the ceramic 
  shop and that it was a mess”.  We think it is arguable that, in Kesselring’s 
  evidence, he adopted this statement in its entirety, but in any event, in all 
  of the circumstances, we do not accept that the reference to this statement, 
  including the portion that “it was a mess”, created any unfairness in the appellant’s 
  trial. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge ought 
  not to have permitted the admission of “grotesque” photographs taken at the 
  scene of the murder or the use by Dr.&nbsp;Lee of projected slides of the crime 
  scene and injury photographs in a darkened courtroom.  The trial judge had regard 
  to the appropriate legal test for the admissibility of the photographs and, 
  after considering the submissions of counsel, excluded the photographs on the 
  autopsy table but found that the probative evidentiary significance of the remaining 
  photographs outweighed any potential prejudicial effect.  We note that both 
  Crown and defence counsel made use of the probative value of the photographs 
  with reference to the nature of the attack.  We see no basis to interfere with 
  the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion with regard to the admission of 
  the photographs in question. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred 
  in admitting the evidence of David Larche that the appellant asked him, in the 
  summer of 1980, if he knew how he could find anyone who could “get rid of his 
  wife”.  In admitting this evidence, the trial judge applied the appropriate 
  governing principle, namely, whether its probative value outweighed its prejudice 
  effect, and we see no error in the exercise of his discretion to admit this 
  evidence. </p>
