<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence of Justice S. March dated June 
  1, 2001.</span></b></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>In this case, the essence of the offence of possession 
  of child pornography was the downloading of images from the internet.  The trial 
  judge quite properly described the images as vile and disgusting.  There was, 
  however, no evidence of any distribution by the appellant of these images.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In passing sentence, the trial judge recognized 
  that there are a number of mitigating factors, including a guilty plea, the 
  fact that the appellant was co-operative with the police and that the “accused 
  had taken very significant steps to deal with the problems that give rise to 
  the charge”. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge focussed on the horrific and 
  repulsive nature of the photographs, the number of them and stated that “the 
  substantial amount does have a significant effect on my decision”. </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In referring to the case law, the sentencing 
  judge focussed on the evils of child pornography and we share his concern that 
  “some pedophiles use child pornography in ways that put children at risk”.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>While we also agree with the trial judge that 
  the offence requires deterrence and denunciation, we are of the view that the 
  trial judge erred in principle in not focussing to a greater extent on the particular 
  circumstances of this case; namely, that the appellant downloaded the images 
  from the internet for his own use and further that he did not distribute any 
  of the material.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As a result of these charges, it would appear that the appellant’s 
  marriage has ended, as well as his relationship with his two children.  He has 
  suffered serious depression and has attempted suicide.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our opinion, if there had been a greater 
  emphasis on the specific circumstances of this offender, there would have been 
  a greater consideration of the appropriateness of a conditional sentence.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the result, we are of the opinion that a conditional sentence 
  should be imposed and that the conditional sentence be for a period of 18 months.  
  The terms of the conditional sentence should reflect the strict terms imposed 
  by this court in <i>R. v. Cohen</i> [2001] O.J. No. 1606 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The application for leave to appeal is granted 
  and the sentence is varied accordingly but we would not interfere with the terms 
  of the probation order.</span></p>
