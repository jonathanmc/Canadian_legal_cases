<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice John D. Evans on January 19, 
  2001.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault and received 
  a 12 month conditional sentence.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal.  It seeks 
  a longer conditional sentence, a term of probation and orders under s. 161(1) 
  and s. 109(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Counsel for the respondent resists 
  any variation in the sentence.  The sentence was imposed a little over a year 
  ago.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This was a serious and tragic case.  The complainant was four years 
  old at the time of the assaults.  The respondent was 24 years old but is intellectually 
  challenged.  At the time of the assaults, he was working at the complainant’s 
  home, which also served as a group home for adults who are intellectually challenged.  
  Prior to the assaults, the complainant’s parents liked and trusted the respondent.  
  The respondent has no criminal record and enjoys the full support of his family.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The convictions arose out of four incidents.  The last occurred on June 
  20, 2000.  The respondent was virtually caught in the act of assaulting the 
  complainant.  He told the complainant to pull down her pants and sit on his 
  face.  He then performed oral sex on the complainant and told her to touch his 
  penis.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After the respondent was confronted with what he had done on June 20<sup>th</sup>, 
  he admitted that he had engaged in almost identical activity on three prior 
  occasions in the previous several months.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge had the benefit of psychiatric evidence.  That evidence 
  indicated that the respondent was not a paedophile, but that he had a generally 
  vague sense of right and wrong and no idea as to what constituted appropriate 
  interaction between the sexes.  The psychiatrist opined that the respondent 
  had not developed any sexual orientation and needed treatment so that he could 
  learn how he should behave.  He did not anticipate that the respondent would 
  re-offend.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent was sorry for what he had done, but his remorse fixed 
  more on the complainant’s parents and his own parents than on the complainant.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We agree with the Crown’s contention that the trial judge erred in fixing 
  the appropriate length of sentence without regard to whether that sentence would 
  be served in the community or in a jail.  In our view, where, as here, the sentence 
  is to be served in the community, the duration of the sentence must be well 
  beyond 12 months to adequately reflect the gravity of these offences and society’s 
  denunciation of them. Not only will a lengthier conditional sentence reflect 
  the principles of denunciation and deterrence, it would also provide an adequate 
  opportunity for the respondent to receive the treatment he needs.  That treatment 
  has only just begun.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent completed his sentence a few weeks ago.  We would order 
  a conditional sentence of a further 12 months less one day.  The Crown agrees 
  that the “house arrest” provision of the conditional sentence is no longer necessary.  
  Consequently, we would impose an additional conditional sentence of 12 months 
  less one day to run from the date of release of this judgment.  The terms and 
  conditions are the same as those imposed by the trial judge save that the “house 
  arrest” provision [para. “O” of the order] will be deleted.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the substantial increase in the length of the conditional sentence, 
  we see no need to impose a term of probation upon completion of the conditional 
  sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge declined to make an order under s. 161(1) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  The order is discretionary and we are not satisfied that we should 
  interfere with the exercise of that discretion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown did not request an order under s. 109(1) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> and consequently no such order was made at trial.  On appeal, Crown 
  counsel argues that the order is mandatory because any sexual assault by its 
  nature involves “violence against a person”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 109(1)(a) does not direct that a firearms prohibition is mandatory 
  upon conviction on a charge of sexual assault.  Rather, it directs that the 
  prohibition is mandatory where any offence involves “violence against a person”.  
  It may be that virtually all sexual assaults, particularly those perpetrated 
  against children, will involve violence against the victims.  That issue was 
  not raised before the trial judge and consequently he made no determination 
  of whether the respondent’s conduct amounted to violence against the complainant.  
  We do not think it would be appropriate for us to consider this issue on appeal.  
  Consequently, we decline to make any order under s. 109(1).</p>
