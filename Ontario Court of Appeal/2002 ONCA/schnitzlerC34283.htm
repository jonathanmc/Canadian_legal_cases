lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice William J. Morrison dated April 
  14, 2000.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal and a cross-appeal from the judgment of Morrison 
  J. dated April&nbsp;14, 2000.  The litigation arose from the dissolution of 
  the parties’ business relationship.  It is our view that the appeal should be 
  allowed on each ground, and the cross-appeal allowed on one ground.  Our reasons 
  can be stated succinctly as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1.  <i>Expenses for keeping “My High Star”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the trial judge erred in awarding $4,000 for unjust 
  enrichment to the respondent in partial recovery of the expenses for keeping 
  the foal “My High Star.”   Even assuming an enrichment to the appellant and 
  a corresponding deprivation to the respondent, it was also incumbent upon the 
  respondent to show, in order to make out his claim, that there was the absence 
  of a juridical reason for the enrichment.  In the circumstances of this case, 
  this third element could not be made out.  The respondent incurred those expenses 
  as a result of his insistence to keep My High Star over the appellant’s objections.  
  As the result at trial shows, the appellant was unjustly deprived of the possession 
  of the foal during the relevant period.  There is no injustice in allowing the 
  enrichment, if any, to stand.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2.  <i>Purse monies</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are also of the view that the trial judge erred in dismissing 
  the appellant’s claim for $3,493.99 for purse monies owed to her.  The trial 
  judge dismissed this claim on the basis of the respondent’s testimony that no 
  monies were owed to the appellant at the time that they severed their relationship.  
  This conclusion was  inconsistent with the trial judge’s own finding that the 
  parties had agreed, at the relevant time, that the appellant would be paid for 
  any purse monies owing to her, if any, as determined by the accountant.  Further, 
  the respondent testified that he had no personal knowledge of purse monies owing 
  from time to time, since he left the matter entirely up to his accountant and 
  the appellant to determine.  The accountant’s records, introduced in evidence 
  by the respondent, showed that $3,493.99 was owing for purse monies.  Hence, 
  it is our view, that the trial judge’s conclusion on this issue cannot reasonably 
  be supported by the evidence.  The appellant is entitled to an award as claimed. 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. <i>Clanwilliam's reduced value </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is our view that the respondent was entitled to be compensated 
  for the reduced value of Clanwilliam.  The trial judge’s finding that Clanwilliam 
  was injured at the time the respondent took possession of the horse was supported 
  by the evidence.  The trial judge found that the appellant’s misrepresentation 
  that  Clanwilliam was sound was innocent, but it is implicit in his reasons 
  that the soundness of the horse became a term of the contract.  This conclusion 
  is also supported by the evidence.  However, we are of the view that the award 
  of $10,000 resulted in overcompensation to the respondent.  On the basis of 
  the trial judge’s own analysis with respect to the intention of the parties 
  that there be an equal division, and the respective value of the horses that 
  they each received ($15,000 and $5,000), the award should have been no more 
  than $5,000 in addition to the proceeds from the sale of Clanwilliam.  We would 
  therefore reduce the award to $5,000.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4.  <i>Damages flowing from interlocutory injunction</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Given that the respondent’s claim to an interest in Man Overboard 
  was not substantiated at trial, we are of the view that the appellant was entitled 
  to be compensated for damages flowing from the respondent’s undertaking with 
  respect to the interlocutory injunction.  There was no issue as to the quantum 
  of the appellant’s loss. The issue was causation. The trial judge held that 
  the appellant’s claim for $12,433.79 was “tenuous at best”.  We disagree.  In 
  our view, the claim was reasonable and substantiated at trial. Given the nature 
  of the injunction sought and obtained by the respondent, the appellant was not 
  in any position to provide further or better evidence to support this claim.  
  We would award the appellant damages as claimed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>5.  <i>Defamation</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s findings 
  and conclusion on the claim for defamation.  We would not give effect to the 
  respondent’s argument on the cross-appeal.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>6.  <i>Costs</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the trial judge erred in failing to give effect 
  to the offer to settle made by the appellant early in the litigation. The appellant’s 
  recovery was greater than the offer.  This offer met the requirements of Rule 
  49.10, and its acceptance would have obviated the need for this litigation.  
  This factor, coupled with the respondent’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud and 
  dishonesty from which he never resiled throughout the trial, entitled the appellant 
  to solicitor and client costs from the date of the offer to the date of the 
  trial judgment.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>7.  <i>Pre-trial interest</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We see no basis for distinguishing between the parties on their 
  respective entitlement to pre-judgment interest.  In our view, the trial judge 
  erred in refusing to award pre-judgment interest to the respondent.  The respondent 
  is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the amount awarded to him.  </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs and the cross-appeal 
  is allowed, but given the limited success, without costs.  Paragraphs 10, 11, 
  12, 14, 15, and 17 of the judgment of Morrison J. are set aside and/or varied 
  to reflect the decision of this court in accordance with the above reasons.
