<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Maria T. Linhares de Sousa dated June 29, 
  2001.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> William Scott appeals from the order made by Linhares de Sousa J. (&quot;the 
  application judge&quot;) on June 29, 2001, granting him limited access to his 
  three-year-old son.  That order amended the access order made by Métivier J. 
  on June 13, 2000.  Before the application judge, the appellant was seeking a 
  substantial increase in access, including extensive and unsupervised access 
  during the spring holiday, the summer, and every alternate Easter and Christmas.  
  He was also seeking an increase in telephone contact with the child.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The history of this dispute includes a conviction of the father for 
  assaulting the mother, allegations of failing to comply with a probation order 
  forbidding the father from contacting the mother, and allegations that he was 
  harassing her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The application judge (Linhares de Sousa J.) considered numerous relevant 
  factors.  The father had not visited the child in the United States as he had 
  been entitled to do pursuant to the order of Métivier J.  Only a few short access 
  visits, both supervised and unsupervised, had taken place when the mother and 
  child were visiting Ottawa.  Injuries to the child had been discovered after 
  an unsupervised visit.  (The father denies that the child was injured while 
  with him.)  At the time of the application to Linhares de Sousa J., the father 
  had not seen the child for some eight months and there had been very few access 
  visits in the two years before that.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In these circumstances, it was entirely proper for the application judge 
  to grant the father limited access in order to permit the establishment of a 
  relationship between the child and the father before considering more liberal 
  access.  For the security and comfort of the child, she ordered that the visits 
  be supervised. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We essentially agree with the approach of Linhares de Sousa J.  However, 
  we are of the view that the one visit per year by the father is too restrictive 
  to give effect to the intention of paragraph 1 of the order, namely that “[b]oth 
  parties shall make an effort to promote contact and a relationship between the 
  child … and his father …”.  Counsel for the wife agrees that if the father is 
  prepared to go the location of the child’s domicile more than once per year, 
  the father should be allowed, on proper notice, to exercise access in the nature 
  of the access provided in paragraph 3 of the order of Linhares de Sousa J.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, paragraph 3 of the order is varied as follows: “one (1) 
  time per year” is varied to “three (3) times per year”, “for a three day period” 
  is varied to “a seven (7) day period”, “During that three day period” is varied 
  to “During that seven day period” and “for each of the three days” is varied 
  to “for each of the seven days”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.  We make no order as 
  to costs.</p>
