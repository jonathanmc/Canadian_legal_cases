<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice Michael Meehan, sitting with a jury, dated 
  February 14, 1997 and from sentence dated February 21, 1997.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals from his convictions for 
  second degree murder. He raises several grounds of appeal in support of his 
  submission that the convictions should be quashed and a new trial ordered. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Before addressing the various grounds, we note 
  that the sole issue in this case was whether the appellant, on account of drunkenness, 
  lacked the requisite intent for second degree murder. In his charge, the trial 
  judge reviewed at some length the evidence relating to the appellant’s state 
  of intoxication at the time of the killings and he made it clear to the jury 
  that they were to find the appellant not guilty of second degree murder if, 
  after considering the whole of the evidence, they believed or had a reasonable 
  doubt that he did not possess one or the other of the requisite intents for 
  murder. At the conclusion of the charge, defence counsel at trial [not Mr. Wright] 
  observed that in his view, the charge was not biased in any way and that it 
  was fair and balanced, an observation with which we agree. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant complains that the trial judge 
  made a number of errors in his instructions to the jury on the defence of drunkenness. 
  We disagree. In our view, it was appropriate for the trial judge to leave the 
  common sense inference to the jury and we are satisfied that in doing so, he 
  clearly linked it with the evidence of intoxication. We are also satisfied that 
  the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the requisite intent for murder 
  and although his explanation as to how the appellant’s state of intoxication 
  could negative that intent was not ideal, it was adequate in the circumstances.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, the trial judge, at the request of 
  defence counsel, did not instruct the jury on capacity to form the requisite 
  intent. Instead, he told the jury that the sole issue to be determined was whether 
  the appellant possessed one or the other of the requisite intents for murder 
  at the time of the killings. In the circumstances, the fact that Crown counsel 
  may have referred to the appellant’s capacity in his closing address resulted 
  in no prejudice to the appellant. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the alleged <i>Miller</i> error, while we agree 
  that the impugned sentence is wrong and should not be repeated,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> when the charge is read fairly as a whole, we are not persuaded 
  that the jury would have been left with the impression that they could only 
  find the appellant not guilty of murder on evidence found to be credible and 
  reliable. The trial judge told the jury on numerous occasions that they were 
  to consider the whole of the evidence in arriving at their verdict and if, after 
  doing so, they were left in a state of reasonable doubt on the issue of the 
  appellant’s intent, they could not find him guilty of murder. Moreover, the 
  trial judge made it clear to the jury that they could “have a reasonable doubt 
  as to the guilt of the accused arising from the credibility of witnesses.”  
  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the submission that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to properly instruct the jury as to the difference between 
  inferences and speculation and in failing to caution the jury against relying 
  upon speculative submissions made by Crown counsel in his closing address, we 
  are satisfied that the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the difference 
  between inferences that could be drawn from proven facts and speculation. As 
  for the Crown’s address, we see no merit in the submission that Crown counsel 
  invited the jury to speculate. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, with respect to the trial judge’s instructions 
  on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the test is substantial compliance with 
  the principles set forth in <i>Lifchus</i>. Although the charge did not comply 
  with all of the <i>Lifchus</i> principles, it contained many of the factors 
  that have preserved similar charges in later cases. These include: (1) the trial 
  judge linked the presumption of innocence to the burden of proof and the meaning 
  of reasonable doubt; (2) the trial judge gave a special instruction on the high 
  standard of proof needed to sustain a conviction on circumstantial evidence, 
  and he gave that instruction with respect to the crucial issue of intent; and 
  (3) apart from the instruction on reasonable doubt, there were no other errors 
  in the charge. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the result, the appeal from conviction is 
  dismissed. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to sentence, the appellant submits 
  that the trial judge erred in increasing his period of parole ineligiblity from 
  ten to fifteen years. We have not been persuaded that the trial judge erred 
  in principle in arriving at the sentence in question. While we think the increase 
  was substantial, we cannot say, in all of the circumstances, that it was manifestly 
  excessive. Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is 
  dismissed.</span></p>

    “Evidence is the body of testimony you heard, including the exhibits filed. 
    Facts are the things you choose to believe from the evidence. <i>The things 
    that you choose not to accept must not be taken into account when arriving
