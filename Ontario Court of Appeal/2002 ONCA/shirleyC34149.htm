<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  <span>      </span>For reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that

<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In the early morning hours of June 20, 1999, Damon Merkley 
  was shot and seriously injured while engaging in a drug transaction with the 
  appellant. Prior to the shooting, Merkley had borrowed a friend’s car and driven 
  to the appellant’s home in search of crack cocaine. Merkley was a “crack” addict 
  and the appellant had been one of his suppliers in the past. On the night in 
  question, however, the appellant wanted nothing to do with him and he told Merkley 
  as much. Merkley had proved to be untrustworthy and he had been violent and 
  aggressive towards the appellant on two recent occasions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Merkley did not take kindly to the appellant’s refusal to 
  sell him drugs and the two men engaged in a heated argument on the appellant’s 
  driveway. At one point, after being grabbed by Merkley, the appellant produced 
  his handgun<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> 
  and told Merkley to leave. Merkley responded by telling the appellant that he 
  was going to take the gun away from him and punch him in the head. When questioned 
  further about this, Merkley stated that he was not afraid of the appellant, 
  nor was he concerned about being shot by him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At the appellant’s suggestion, the two men left the driveway 
  and agreed to meet at a nearby school. Merkley drove his car to the school parking 
  lot and the appellant followed on foot. When efforts to consummate a drug deal 
  failed, the appellant left the parking lot and began walking down the street 
  away from his apartment. Merkley followed in his car and after pulling alongside 
  the appellant, he told the appellant to “hurry-up” and give him the drugs. Realizing 
  that Merkley would not leave him alone, the appellant capitulated and approached 
  the car. Merkley remained seated in the front seat and the appellant stood beside 
  the front passenger window. The two men then gave very different versions of 
  what occurred.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Merkley testified that as he reached through the open passenger 
  window to pay the appellant for an agreed-upon amount of crack cocaine, the 
  appellant put a ten-cent coin in Merkley’s hand, produced his handgun and at 
  point blank range, fired three shots at Merkley through the open window. One 
  of the bullets shattered his elbow, entered his side and lodged next to his 
  spine. The other two penetrated the front seat of the car. At this point, the 
  appellant fled and Merkley, though stunned, managed to drive to a nearby hospital 
  where he received emergency treatment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant, on the other hand, testified that as he was 
  reaching out to hand Merkley the crack cocaine, Merkley grabbed his arm, twisted 
  it and told him to drop the drugs. The appellant told Merkley to let go but 
  Merkley continued to twist his arm with considerable force. In pain, and thinking 
  his arm was broken, the appellant used his free hand to retrieve his handgun. 
  He then leaned into the car, pointed the gun at Merkley and told him to let 
  go of his arm. Merkley refused and continued to twist, telling the appellant 
  to drop the drugs. The appellant finally complied and dropped the drugs inside 
  the car. Merkley then grabbed for the gun and the appellant pulled back, telling 
  him to let go. In the ensuing struggle, the gun accidentally discharged. The 
  appellant did not recall pulling the trigger, nor did he believe that his finger 
  was on the trigger when the gun went off. He further testified that he did not 
  want to harm Merkley and that he had produced the gun solely as a defensive 
  measure to have Merkley release his arm.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>After the shooting, the appellant fled the scene and disposed 
  of the gun. Later that day, after learning from a friend that Merkley had been 
  injured and that the authorities were looking for him, the appellant surrendered 
  himself to the police.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES AT TRIAL</span></b></p>
<p style='line-height:normal;line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Stripped to its essentials, this was a straightforward case 
  involving one, and perhaps two issues for the jury. The first issue was whether 
  the appellant deliberately pulled the trigger, as Merkley claimed, or whether 
  the gun discharged accidentally, as the appellant claimed. The resolution of 
  that issue hinged on the jury’s findings of credibility. If the jury believed 
  or had a reasonable doubt that Merkley was the aggressor and that the gun discharged 
  accidentally as the appellant maintained, then the appellant was entitled to 
  be acquitted. On the other hand, if the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant was the aggressor and that he deliberately pulled the 
  trigger, as Merkley claimed, then depending on his intent at the time of the 
  shooting, the appellant was either guilty of attempted murder or the included 
  offence of aggravated assault.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></b></p>
<p style='line-height:normal;line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant raised seven grounds of appeal, 
  all relating to alleged errors in the charge to the jury. In my view, while 
  each ground has some degree of merit, of the seven alleged errors, two are particularly 
  serious and come within the “reversible error” category. I will deal with them 
  momentarily. Of the remaining five, I find it unnecessary to analyze them in 
  detail. Each is briefly addressed below. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, in the context of his instructions on the requisite intent 
  for attempted murder,  although it was permissible for the trial judge to instruct 
  the jury on the common sense inference that sane and sober people intend the 
  natural consequences of their acts, it would have been preferable had he alerted 
  the jury to the various facts which, in the circumstances of this case, tended 
  to rebut that inference. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, again in the context of the requisite 
  intent for attempted murder, I think that the trial judge’s instructions on 
  the law of homicide and the distinction between culpable and non-culpable homicide 
  were unnecessary and a potential source of confusion for the jury. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Third, with respect to his instructions on onus 
  and burden of proof, the trial judge unfortunately slipped on numerous occasions 
  and used language which suggested that the appellant bore the onus of proving 
  that the gun discharged accidentally. By way of example, he told the jury that 
  if they were “satisfied and accept the explanation that the gun accidentally 
  discharged, then that is a total defence to the offence … charged” and later, 
  “if you are satisfied that Mr. Shirley … is not responsible because it was an 
  accident, you do not even get to this [the requisite intent for attempted murder].”</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the instructions on accident and intent 
  were confusing and, in my view, the charge, when read as a whole, failed to 
  adequately delineate the difference between accident (the unintentional physical 
  act of pulling the trigger) and intent (the mental state required for attempted 
  murder).</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, in his instructions to the jury on the legal effect 
  of a witness’s denial of  a suggestion put in cross-examination, the trial judge 
  stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>… allegations of misconduct or suggestions of evidentiary 
      matters are easily put to a witness in cross-examination. In the absence 
      of evidence supporting the allegation or suggestion in the question, <i>the 
      witness’s denial of the allegation or suggestion must be taken as correct</i> 
      because counsel’s questions or submissions cannot be tendered as evidence, 
      only witnesses testifying. [Emphasis added]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect, the emphasized portion is clearly 
  wrong. While it is true that unaccepted suggestions put to a witness do not 
  amount to evidence, a witness’s denial of a suggestion does not mean that the 
  denial must be taken as correct. The jury is entitled to accept all, part, or 
  none of a witness’s testimony.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:24.0pt;line-height:normal;page-break-after:
avoid'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CRITICAL ERRORS</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:normal;page-break-after:

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the circumstances, I need not decide whether 
  these errors, standing alone or considered cumulatively, would have warranted 
  a new trial. In the end, they affirm my conclusion that the appellant is entitled 
  to a new trial. That brings me to the two critical errors in the charge. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal;line-height:normal;line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In his charge, the trial judge instructed the 
  jury as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>You must remember that because you reject a person’s explanation 
      or Mr. Shirley’s explanation does not mean that he is guilty. But when the 
      explanation turns out to be a deliberate fabrication, that could be evidence 
      of what you would use to determine guilt. If you find that he has deliberately 
      lied and his explanation is found to be deliberately false, you may take 
      that as evidence to consider with all of the rest of the evidence in determining 
      his guilt or innocence.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is now well settled that rejection of an 
  accused’s evidence can only be used as circumstantial evidence of guilt where 
  there is independent evidence of concoction. (See <i>R. v. Coutts</i> (1998), 
  126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont.C.A.), leave to appeal refused (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 
  vi S.C.C.; <i>R. v. Blazeiko</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 652 (Ont.C.A.); and<i> 
  R. v. McNeill</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 212 (Ont.C.A.)). </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With his usual candor, Mr. Tweney for the Crown 
  acknowledges that there is no independent evidence of concoction in this case 
  and he concedes that the impugned instruction constituted error. Nonetheless, 
  he submits that the conviction should be sustained because the error occasioned 
  no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. He bases that submission on 
  the fact that if the jury rejected the appellant’s explanation as to how the 
  gun discharged, then the sole remaining issue was whether the appellant possessed 
  the requisite intent for attempted murder at the time of the shooting. In that 
  regard, he submits that the trial judge made it clear to the jury that the Crown 
  bore the onus of proving that the appellant intended to kill Merkley and that 
  the impugned instruction did not derogate from that instruction. Moreover, he 
  submits that the evidence of the appellant’s intent at the time of the shooting 
  was overwhelming and that absent the impugned instruction, the jury’s verdict 
  would inevitably have been the same.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, I disagree with Mr. Tweney’s analysis. First, given 
  the blemished backgrounds of the appellant and Merkley,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a> this was a case where the jury may have had difficulty deciding 
  which one to believe. In the circumstances, it is at least conceivable that 
  the jury followed the impugned instruction, made a finding of fabrication and 
  used that finding to tip the scales in favour of believing Merkley. Viewed that 
  way, I cannot say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same had 
  the jury not been misdirected.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, even if Mr. Tweney is correct and the 
  jury only considered the impugned instruction, if at all, in determining whether 
  the appellant had the requisite intent for attempted murder at the time of the 
  shooting, I cannot agree with him that the error was necessarily harmless. The 
  appellant’s intent at the time of the shooting was a live issue and although 
  the case for the Crown in this regard was strong, I cannot say that it was so 
  overwhelming that the verdict would inevitably have been the same absent the 
  impugned instruction.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>Error 2 - The trial judge erred

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In his charge, the trial charge correctly instructed 
  the jury on the use they could make of the appellant’s criminal record. In that 
  regard, he made it clear that the record could not be used to show that the 
  appellant was the type of person likely to have committed the offence with which 
  he was charged. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, the trial judge failed to make 
  any mention of Merkley’s criminal record in the charge. Of even greater significance, 
  he failed to instruct the jury on the use they could make of Merkley’s admitted 
  disposition for violence in assessing whether he, as opposed to the appellant, 
  was the initial aggressor in the incident resulting in the shooting. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tweney concedes, correctly in my view, that 
  there was ample evidence of Merkley’s disposition for violence both in general, 
  and specifically in relation to the appellant. Merkley was an admitted brawler 
  and fighter, he had a prior conviction for assault causing bodily harm, he had 
  boasted about being sent to jail for beating up someone and sending him to the 
  hospital, he had connections with outlaw biker gangs and he had exhibited violence 
  towards the appellant on two prior occasions. The appellant was entitled to 
  have the jury consider that body of evidence in assessing his claim that Merkley 
  was the initial aggressor. (See <i>R. v. Scopelliti</i> (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 
  481 (Ont.C.A.)). He was likewise entitled to have the jury consider Merkley’s 
  criminal record, which included offences of dishonesty and lack of trustworthiness, 
  in assessing Merkley’s credibility.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel at trial asked the trial judge 
  to instruct the jury on both matters. Regrettably, the trial judge refused to 
  do so. His failure in this regard went to the heart of the appellant’s defence 
  and, in my view, constituted reversible error. Accordingly, I would give effect 
  to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
