  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The plea was accepted based on an agreed statement 
  of facts. On June 26, 2000, the appellant, who was 41 years old, was visiting 
  her father at his townhouse, together with an old school friend of the family, 
  David Keleman. They were watching T.V. and drinking. Mr. Keleman left to go 
  to his home for an antenna. When he returned, he found the appellant’s father 
  naked on top of his daughter. He had her top up and her pants down and he was 
  tying to nuzzle and penetrate her. Mr. Keleman became angry, began to yell at 
  Mr. Simcoe, then struck him. The appellant woke up and was yelling and hysterical. 
  Mr. Keleman took the appellant upstairs to calm her down. Mr. Simcoe was shouting 
  obscenities and taunting the appellant. She went back downstairs in a rage and 
  began throwing things around the room. At that point, Mr. Keleman left. After 
  that, the appellant, who was highly intoxicated, used a large kitchen knife 
  to stab her father repeatedly on the arms. During this time she called 9-1-1 
  and told them she was stabbing her father and that if they did not get there 
  quickly, he would be dead. When the police arrived, the appellant was screaming 
  that she hoped her father was dead as he was a monster. When she learned later 
  that he was dead, she first said: “Good, he deserved it if he is”, then “Please 
  tell me he isn’t”, then “I won’t have to suck his cock anymore or kiss him.”</span></p>

  </span></span> The Crown’s position was that the appropriate sentence was  5 
  to 7 years in prison. The defence asked for a suspended sentence with 3 years’ 
  probation, or in the alternative, a conditional sentence. The appellant recognized 
  that she needed treatment for her drug and alcohol abuse as well as her depression 
  and low self-esteem. She even asked to go to the penitentiary if she had to 
  go to jail because she understood that she would receive better treatment there.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On sentence, the trial judge had an extensive 
  pre-sentence report, the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of a psychologist called 
  by the defence, the report of a psychiatrist who examined the appellant on the 
  issue of her fitness to stand trial, and victim impact statements from two of 
  the appellant’s siblings and from a grandchild of her father as well as a letter 
  from the appellant’s maternal grandmother.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant had no criminal record. Her life experience was 
  described by the author of the pre-sentence report as “very tragic.” She was 
  born out of wedlock at a home for unwed mothers, although her parents subsequently 
  married  and had three more children. Her parents moved many times to accommodate 
  her father’s job. Her father sexually abused her and was verbally and emotionally 
  abusive to herself and her mother. She left home at age 14, but returned after 
  her parents separated. Her parents then reconciled and separated several times, 
  and the appellant was further abused. The appellant was significantly affected 
  by the death of her boyfriend when she was 18. She then began to abuse drugs 
  and alcohol and was unable to hold a job. In 1995 she returned to Oshawa to 
  look after her mother who was dying. Thereafter she squandered her inheritance. 
  She began to see her father sporadically but he continued to emotionally and 
  verbally abuse her, and also attempted to sexually abuse her, resulting on one 
  occasion in him urinating on her in rage. At the time of the offence the appellant 
  had a history of depression, including 5 attempts at suicide and was on methadone 
  treatment. She had had many failed relationships and was unable to have children.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Dr. Chiarot, a consulting psychologist with 
  the Ministry of Correctional Services, interviewed the appellant and testified 
  about the effect of incest based on the sexual abuse the appellant described 
  to him. The sexual abuse included oral sex, and on the occasions when her father 
  would drink and be physically abusive and give her wet kisses in the day, he 
  would sexually abuse her at night. She would wake in the morning to find semen 
  present and to find that her underwear had been removed. The final incident 
  before she left home involved her father inserting a chicken baster into her, 
  causing injury and bleeding. There was no sexual abuse when the appellant was 
  in her twenties and thirties, but, as is often the case in incest relationships, 
  the appellant still wanted her father’s love and attention. She spent time with 
  him and even allowed him to stay with her on occasion when he had no other place 
  to stay. </span></p>

  led up to the stabbing including that this was the first occasion the sexual 
  abuse had been witnessed by someone else, and the fact that she had just spent

  were alcohol and anger.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge imposed a sentence of 4 years 
  in penitentiary following 8 months pretrial custody, which he determined to 
  be a sentence at the low end of what he expressed to be the applicable range 
  of 5 to 10 years for a homicide of this nature. He discussed the applicability 
  of the range in the following way:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The crime of homicide always attracts a lengthy penitentiary 
      term, ranging, at least in the case law, from between five and ten years 
      imprisonment, subject to any extenuating circumstances. Cases falling within 
      this range are characterized by the accused being impaired by alcohol at 
      the time of the incident. Weapons are sometimes sought and used in the crime. 
      The victim is often in a defenceless position, either impaired himself or 
      wounded or unconscious when the final blow is applied. Even minor provocation 
      by the victim is not enough to reduce this type of sentence. Other factors 
      include the lapse of time between a provoking event and the action of the 
      accused.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge discounted the legal effect 
  of provocation on the sentence. He was also influenced by his understanding 
  that a significant amount of time had passed between the sexual assault by the 
  father and his death at the hand of his daughter as a result of the interruption 
  and intervention of the friend, Mr. Keleman.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s principal position on this appeal is that  the 
  sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly unfit for this appellant 
  in all the circumstances. However, I prefer to approach the case by determining 
  whether the trial judge made an error in principle or misapprehended the evidence, 
  leading him to overemphasize a particular factor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the trial judge erred in principle 
  in three respects: (1) he misapprehended the correct range of sentence available 
  in the circumstances; (2) he erred in holding that provocation is not a factor 
  to be taken into account in sentencing for manslaughter; and (3) he misapprehended 
  the evidence on the issue of the timing of the events, thus overemphasizing 
  the fact that time had passed between the sexual assault and the homicide as 
  an aggravating factor.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated that the range of sentence 
  for a homicide is 5 to 10 years, particularly for cases where the accused is 
  impaired by alcohol at the time, weapons are used, and the victim is defenceless 
  either because of impairment or having already been wounded. This statement 
  of the range is in error. In <i>R. v. Turcotte</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 97 at 
  101, 144 C.C.C. (3d) 139, this court recently made a clear statement about the 
  range of sentence available in a manslaughter case:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>While many, if not most, sentences for manslaughter 
      are in the penitentiary range, maximum reformatory sentences are not unknown 
      and are clearly within the acceptable range: Clewley &amp; McDermott, <i>Sentencing: 
      The Practitioner’s Guide</i> (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book Inc., 1999), 
      at sec. 8.150. Conditional sentences of that duration and, indeed, of shorter 
      duration, have been passed against persons found guilty of manslaughter 
      both in this province and elsewhere: <i>R. v. Ferguson</i>, [1997] O.J. 
      No. 2488 (Gen. Div.); <i>R. v. Mananghaya</i>, [1997] M.J. No. 267, 118 
      Man. R. (2d) 30 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Emard</i>, [1999] B.C.J. No. 463 (S.C.); 
      <i>R. v. Oster</i>, [1997] B.C.J. No. 3099 (Prov. Ct.); <i>R. v. Hariczuk</i>, 
      [1999] O.J. No. 3110 (C.J.). The Supreme Court of Canada has recently rejected 
      the suggestion that conditional sentences are inappropriate for serious 
      offences, including manslaughter: <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. 
      (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at paras. 80-81. The imposition of a conditional sentence 
      upon a person convicted of manslaughter is not, in and of itself, an error 
      in principle. </p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, the courts have been faced with 
  a number of manslaughter cases arising out of abusive relationships where some 
  or all of the features referred to by the trial judge (alcohol, a weapon, and 
  an impaired or otherwise incapacitated victim) have been present. But, recognizing 
  the effect of the abusive relationship, the courts have imposed non-custodial 
  or minimal custody sentences, including suspended sentence with probation: <i>R. 
  v. Millar</i> (1994), 31 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 315 (Ont. Gen. Div.), <i>R. v. 
  Bennett</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 1011 (Prov. Div.), <i>R. v. Whitten</i> (1992), 
  110 N.S.R. (2d) 148 (N.S.S.C.), <i>R. v. Fors</i> (1987), 3 W.C.B. (2d) 31(Ont. 
  H.C.); twelve months plus probation: <i>R. v. Tran</i>, [1991] O.J. No.&nbsp;2052; 
  conditional sentence of two years less a day: <i>R. v. Getkate</i>, [1998] O.J. 
  No. 6329 (Gen. Div.); <i>R. v. Ferguson</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 2488 (Gen. Div.); 
  seven months imprisonment with three years probation: <i>R. v. Cowley</i>,<i>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated that: “Even minor provocation 
  by the victim is not enough to reduce this type of sentence.” This statement 
  represents an error in principle. The issue was discussed and resolved by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Stone</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290. In that 
  case, the defence of provocation had been used to reduce a homicide from murder 
  to manslaughter. The question was whether the effect or use of the provocation 
  was thereby spent, and therefore not available for consideration a second time 
  on the issue of the appropriate sentence to be imposed. At p. 405, Bastarache 
  J. referred to the principle that “punishment must be meted out with regard 
  to the moral culpability or blameworthiness of an offender”. He concluded at 
  p. 407 that: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In cases involving provocation, s. 232 permits a verdict 
      of murder to be reduced to one of manslaughter, for which there is no minimum 
      penalty unless a firearm was used in the commission of the offence (s. 236) 
      This in turn allows for the consideration of provocation in the assessment 
      of the offender’s moral culpability and hence in the determination of an 
      appropriate sentence. It is Parliament that has chosen to accord special 
      attention to provocation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In his factum, appellant’s counsel fairly points 
  out that the manslaughter plea in this case may not have been based on the defence 
  of provocation but rather on lack of intent to kill. However, it was clear that 
  defence counsel at trial did rely on the deceased’s historical abuse of the 
  appellant as well as the sexual assault on her that evening, as a mitigating 
  factor on sentence. In my view, whether or not provocation was the basis of 
  the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter, where the existence of clearly provocative 
  conduct affects the moral culpability of the appellant, that conduct can and 
  should be taken into account when considering the appropriate sentence.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The following is the description of the role 
  of Mr. Keleman in the facts read in by Crown counsel on the guilty plea:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The night of the incident, he had been at Ken’s [the deceased’s] 
      townhouse with Ken and Bonnie Simcoe. They were watching T.V. and drinking. 
      He left to return to his own home to get an antennae. When he returned, 
      he states, &quot;Ken was nude on top of Bonnie. He had her top up and bottoms 
      down. He was trying to nuzzle her, trying to penetrate her.” Mr. Keleman 
      stated that he got mad and began to yell at Ken Simcoe, and that he struck 
      Ken Simcoe. </span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Simcoe woke up. She was yelling and was hysterical. 
      Mr.&nbsp;Keleman took Ms.&nbsp;Simcoe upstairs to calm her down. He indicates 
      that Mr. Simcoe was shouting obscenities and taunting her. She returned 
      downstairs in a rage and began to throw items around the room. Mr. Keleman 
      states that he then left the apartment.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Based on this description, there was no basis 
  for the trial judge to conclude that Mr. Keleman left thinking the incident 
  was over. Although one might wonder how he could have left during the yelling 
  and throwing, and perhaps infer that he only did so when he thought the incident 
  was over, that was not the evidence before the court.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also concluded from the above 
  description, including that Mr.&nbsp;Keleman took the appellant upstairs to 
  calm her down, that some time passed between the sexual assault and the homicide, 
  and that the appellant had in fact calmed down. He said: “True, he had behaved 
  abominably towards his daughter, but his actions had been interrupted by a concerned 
  friend of both the accused and the deceased. Some time had passed because of 
  this interruption. Ms. Simcoe could have left the scene completely. She chose 
  not to do so.” However, the brief recitation of the circumstances of the offence 
  suggest that only a very short time had passed and that the appellant did not 
  have the opportunity to calm down as her father was shouting obscenities and 
  continuing the incident. The trial judge mentioned the lapse of time as a factor 
  in sentencing, and one which weighed against the appellant.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I conclude that the trial judge made three significant errors 
  in determining sentence. He began by using a range of sentence with a lower 
  limit that was far above the correct range, which range can, in appropriate 
  circumstances, include a suspended sentence. He was in error in concluding that 
  he could not consider the provocative actions of the deceased in mitigation 
  of sentence. Third, he placed emphasis on his misunderstanding that when the 
  friend, Mr. Keleman, left the appellant and the victim, the incident appeared 
  to be over, and that a period of time passed between the assault by the victim 
  and the manslaughter, so that the appellant’s actions were in effect unprovoked. 
  This was a misapprehension of  the evidence as disclosed in the statement of 
  facts read in by the Crown.</p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As a result of these errors, this court may 
  set aside the sentence imposed by the trial judge and impose the proper sentence.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The taking of a life is always a terrible tragedy 
  and a most serious offence no matter the circumstances. It is therefore difficult 
  to consider how a prison sentence of a term of years can be viewed as disproportionate 
  to the offence. Rather, courts have viewed the offence of manslaughter in the 
  context in which it occurred, including the relationship between the victim 
  and the accused, together with the personal characteristics of the accused, 
  in order to determine the appropriate sentence. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this case there are several mitigating factors 
  that militate in favour of a more lenient sentence: </span></p>

    <p> <span

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The moral culpability of the appellant is 
      significantly reduced by several key factors: first, she did not intend 
      to kill her father due to her consumption of alcohol; second, the extreme 
      provocation of the sexual assault in front of a friend, followed by the 
      taunting and obscenities; third, the assault capped the long history of 
      abuse by her father.</span></p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>No history of conduct that would suggest 
      she would be a threat to the community.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant is remorseful for what she 
      did and pled guilty.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant has a tragic history marked 
      by sexual abuse, the loss of her boyfriend in a car accident, drug and alcohol 
      abuse and suicide attempts.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant wished treatment whether in 
      the community or in custody.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the mitigating factors in this case 
  suggest that a sentence in the upper reformatory range would have been appropriate. 
  I am also of the view that the trial judge could have imposed a conditional 
  sentence to be served in the community. In this case and for this appellant, 
  such a sentence, including strict terms of house arrest together with treatment 
  for substance abuse and community service would well have served the sentencing 
  objectives set out in the <i>Code</i>. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>However, the appellant has now served one year 
  in custody following sentencing as well as 8 months of pretrial custody which 
  is credited as 16 months. As a result, the appropriate sentence at this time, 
  is time served. The appellant should also be on probation for 2 years on the 
  statutory conditions and on terms that she take treatment as required and perform 
  100 hours of community service.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside 
  the sentence and substitute a sentence of time served together with probation 
  on the conditions described.</span></p>
