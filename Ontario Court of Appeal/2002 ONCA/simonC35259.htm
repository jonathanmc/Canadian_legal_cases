<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Russell G. Juriansz dated October 20, 
  2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The sole issues on the appeal are both the proper 
  test for, and proof of, causation. The trial judge’s finding that the appellant 
  breached the duty of care that he owed to the respondent was not challenged 
  on the appeal. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge held that the “but for” test 
  of causation was not the appropriate test in this case. The respondent says 
  that the modified objective test is the correct test. She contended that, implicitly, 
  this was the test the trial judge must have used in concluding that the respondent, 
  as a reasonable person, would have acted in accordance with a proper warning 
  from the appellant doctor not to take the drug AC&amp;C. Counsel also submits 
  that applying the modified objective test, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove, 
  on a balance of probabilities, what a reasonable person would have done, and 
  that having done that, the onus then shifts to the defendant to show, on the 
  same standard, that the plaintiff would not have acted reasonably had she been 
  given the proper warning. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Assuming, without deciding, that the modified 
  objective test is the correct test of causation to apply in this case, we do 
  not think that the test could be met on the evidence. In our view, the onus 
  was on the respondent to satisfy the court that a reasonable person, in the 
  circumstances of the respondent, would not have taken AC&amp;C had she been 
  properly warned not to do so by the appellant doctor: see <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>, 
  (1997), 148 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 48 (S.C.C.) at p. 152. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In this case, the respondent was not asked what 
  she would have done had she been properly warned of the danger of AC&amp;C to 
  her ulcer condition. Moreover, she was warned by Dr. Jenkins in 1996 to discontinue 
  taking AC&amp;C. However, she either continued to take it, and was taking it 
  when she first saw the appellant in 1997, or at least she began to take it again 
  in May of 1998. Therefore, on the evidence, her own conduct could not satisfy 
  the test of what a reasonable person in her circumstances would have done had 
  she been given an adequate warning by the appellant. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Mr. David submits that that evidence does not 
  address the issue directly because the finding of the trial judge was that the 
  appellant had a duty not only to warn the respondent not to take AC&amp;C, but 
  also to educate her as to the risks of so doing, and the serious consequences 
  of taking the drug with her ulcer condition. He submits that as Dr.&nbsp;Jenkins’ 
  warning was a bare warning without education, one cannot infer from the evidence 
  that she disobeyed it, that she would have disobeyed a full explanation and 
  education, had they been given. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We cannot accept this submission. Whether the 
  respondent would have followed a full warning of this kind was, of course, a 
  subject particularly within her knowledge and, clearly, the burden was on her 
  to prove this fact. This was especially so in light of the evidence that she 
  did not heed Dr. Jenkins 1996 warning. She gave no evidence on the subject. 
  In fact, as indicated, the evidence of her past and ongoing conduct was to the 
  contrary.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In our view, therefore, the trial judge erred 
  in finding that the appellant’s breach of his duty caused the respondent any 
  damage.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal is therefore allowed with costs, 
  the judgment of the trial judge is set aside, and the action is dismissed with 
  costs to be assessed on a partial indemnity basis.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Based on the amount in issue on the appeal (approximately 
  $45,000) and the fact that a breach of the standard of care by the appellant 
  was found at trial and not appealed, we fix the appellant’s costs of the appeal 
  on a partial indemnity basis at $10,000.</span></p>
