<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Richard G. Byers of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 6, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant Marks is a solicitor and was retained by the respondent Sliwinski 
  as counsel in connection with several medical malpractice lawsuits. In 1999, 
  Sliwinski discharged Marks after he advised her he could not continue unless 
  her accounts were brought up to date and a retainer was provided. The accounts 
  were assessed at $31,683.03. Sliwinski appealed and the appeal was dismissed. 
  A further appeal was undertaken to the Divisional Court. Before the Divisional 
  Court heard the matter, however, the parties reached a settlement and Marks 
  resumed his position as counsel on one of the medical malpractice lawsuits. 
  As part of the settlement, Sliwinski was to pay Marks $9,000 and to provide 
  security by way of a $25,000 mortgage on her Brant Street property against future 
  fees and disbursements. Sliwinski granted the $25,000 mortgage but did not pay 
  the $9,000. On the eve of trial of the malpractice action, Marks required Sliwinski 
  to provide an additional $15,000 mortgage on her Gardenvale property.</p>
<p>
  [2] In May, 2001, Sliwinski's medical malpractice action was dismissed with 
  costs. After the May, 2001, trial Sliwinski did not make any payments to Marks, 
  either on the $9,000 plus post-judgment interest or the $31,686.03 she owed 
  to Marks in fees. Marks therefore commenced Power of Sale proceedings on the 
  existing mortgages but claimed $44,000 under each power of sale. Sliwinski sued 
  Marks claiming that he used undue influence to procure the $15,000 mortgage. 
  She made no claim respecting the $25,000 mortgage in her statement of claim. 
  She also brought an ex-parte application to enjoin the power of sale proceedings 
  from continuing. The ex-parte injunction was granted on April 29, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [3] On June 6, 2002, following a number of consent adjournments, the parties 
  were before Byers J. on a motion to continue the injunction. Byers J. ordered 
  Sliwinski to pay Marks $15,000 no later than July 5, 2002, and to pay $25,000 
  into Court &quot;to the credit of the action&quot; by that date. He further 
  ordered that, upon payment of the money, Marks was to discharge the $25,000 
  mortgage on the Brant Street property. Finally, upon payment of the money, the 
  order cancelled the power of sale proceedings respecting both mortgages and 
  extended the injunction until final disposition of the action brought by Sliwinski. 
  Sliwinski made the payments and Marks appealed.</p>
<p>
  [4] The real issues in this appeal are whether the court had jurisdiction to 
  order the discharge of the $25,000 mortgage and the characterization of the 
  payment of $25,000 into court as being &quot;to the credit of the action&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] In our opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the motions judge ought 
  not to have ordered Marks to discharge the $25,000 mortgage unless not only 
  the principal but the interest and costs were paid. Accordingly, we would delete 
  paragraph 4 of the order which requires Marks to discharge the $25,000 mortgage 
  on the Brant Street property. </p>
<p>
  [6] The payment of the $25,000 into court &quot;to the credit of this action&quot; 
  was obviously intended to be for the benefit of Marks and to stand as security 
  for monies that are or may become owing by Sliwinski to Marks at the conclusion 
  of the action. We would amend paragraph 3 to read, &quot;The sum of $25,000 
  in court shall stand as security for monies that are or may become owing by 
  Sliwinski to Marks at the conclusion of this action or unless otherwise ordered 
  by the Superior Court&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appeal is otherwise dismissed. Costs of the appeal are to the appellant 
  Marks fixed in the amount of $2,500 payable forthwith.</p>
