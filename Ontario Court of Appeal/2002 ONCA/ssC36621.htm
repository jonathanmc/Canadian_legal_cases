<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice H. Campbell on April 4, 2001 
  and the sentence imposed on July 5, 2001.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown alleged that the appellant attempted to obstruct justice by 
  “directing” two witnesses in an ongoing criminal proceeding to “make a false 
  statement”.  Although it was part of the Crown’s theory that the appellant attempted 
  to cause the witnesses to make those statements by means of coercion and threats, 
  the Crown did not make those allegations in the information.  The Crown did 
  not seek to amend the information at any point in the trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, counsel for the appellant argued that the Crown was required 
  to prove that the appellant knew that the statements she directed the witnesses 
  to make were false.  The Crown argued that the appellant’s knowledge of the 
  truth or falsity was irrelevant to her liability, and that guilt was established 
  if she used threats or other coercive means to cause the witnesses to change 
  their statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge believed the complainants and disbelieved the appellant 
  and her witnesses.  He found that the appellant had coerced the two witnesses 
  to change the statements they had given to the police.  He made no finding with 
  respect to either the falsity of the altered statements or the appellant’s knowledge 
  of that falsity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The offence of attempt to obstruct justice can be committed in many 
  ways.  Here, the Crown alleged that the obstruction lay in the causing of the 
  witnesses to make false statements.  As pled, the charge required that the Crown 
  prove both that the statements were false and that the appellant knew they were 
  false.  We cannot agree that this allegation is surplusage.  It describes the 
  means by which the offence was committed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the trial judge’s findings, the Crown proved that the appellant attempted 
  to obstruct justice by using threats to cause witnesses to change their statements.  
  This was not, however, the attempt to obstruct justice that the Crown particularized 
  in the information.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We cannot say that the appellant was not prejudiced.  While it was certainly 
  part of the defence that no threats were made by the appellant, it was also 
  part of the defence that the charges should fail because the Crown had not proved 
  that the appellant knew that the statements solicited from the witnesses were 
  false.  As indicated above, this was a defence to the charge as framed by the 
  Crown. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, Crown counsel conceded that it could not show that the appellant 
  knew that the statements she solicited from the witnesses were false.  Given 
  this concession and our finding that knowledge of the falsity of the statements 
  was an essential element of the offence as charged by the Crown, it follows 
  that the conviction must be quashed and an acquittal entered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We need not consider the other grounds of appeal.</p>
