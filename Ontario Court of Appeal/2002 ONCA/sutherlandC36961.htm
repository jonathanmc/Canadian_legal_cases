<p>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Thomas G. Zuber dated August 13, 2001.</p>
<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In concluding that the respondent Comstock Canada Inc. (“Comstock”) 
  was entitled to summary judgment dismissing the appellant’s claim against it, 
  the motions court judge made two crucial findings.  With respect to the claim 
  framed in terms of inducing breach of contract, the motions court judge concluded 
  that all of the material filed made it clear that if there was a breach of contract 
  between the appellant and Thorburn Penny Ltd. (“TPL”), the breach had already 
  occurred before Comstock was approached.  With respect to the claim framed in 
  terms of assisting the breach of a fiduciary duty or receiving the benefit of 
  a breach of fiduciary duty, the motions court judge found that there was nothing 
  more to the relationship between the appellant and TPL than that of contractor 
  and sub-contractor submitting a bid.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We respectfully disagree with the motions court judge’s conclusion 
  that the respondent demonstrated that there was no triable issue on these two 
  crucial points.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the timing of the alleged breach of contract, 
  TPL had submitted its revised bid to the City on the basis that the appellant 
  would do the installation.  Before notifying either the appellant or the City 
  (as it was required to do by the terms of the bidding process) of any change 
  in this arrangement, TPL approached Comstock.  In our view, a trier of fact 
  could infer from the evidence that TPL did not terminate its relationship with 
  the appellant until it had secured the participation of Comstock in its bid.  
  As Comstock had participated in the presentation of a competing bid, Comstock 
  was fully familiar with the terms and requirements of the bid.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the nature of the appellant's involvement in 
  the TPL bid and the possibility of extra-contractual duties arising therefrom, 
  there was evidence of extensive participation and contribution made by the appellant 
  to the development of the design for the project.  In our view, this evidence 
  gave rise to a triable issue as to whether the appellant was, as the motions 
  court judge found, in the position of an ordinary subcontractor, or whether 
  in view of the nature of the appellant's involvement as a member of the design-build 
  team, extra-contractual duties arose.  Again, Comstock’s familiarity with this 
  specific design-built project is relevant here.  While there are significant 
  legal hurdles for the appellant to overcome on this aspect of the claim, the 
  claim based on inducing breach of contract is proceeding to trial and, in our 
  view, it would not be appropriate at this stage to preclude the appellant from 
  proceeding to trial on this theory as well. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As it is our view that competing inferences could be drawn from 
  the material, we conclude that the respondent failed to show that there is no 
  triable issue.  Accordingly we would set aside the summary judgment dismissing 
  the respondent’s claim so as to permit the matter to proceed to trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal.  The appellant 
  says that if successful it should be awarded solicitor client costs of the motion 
  for summary judgment.  We do not accept this submission.  Although ultimately 
  the motion has been unsuccessful, it was nevertheless reasonable.  In the circumstances 
  of this case, it is our view that costs of the summary judgment motion should 
  be in the cause.</p>
