<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas H. Lissaman

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Mr. McRae made three submissions in support 
  of this appeal:</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Dismissal for cause </span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Lissaman J. found as a fact that the respondent was a good employee 
  who worked hard and well for her employer, and Mr. McRae did not dispute that 
  finding.   If her dismissal was for cause, it could arise only from her single 
  act, on the last day of her employment, in refusing to turn over to her employer 
  $2,780 from the licensing fund under her control.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The Supreme Court of Canada has recently held that 
  a single act of dishonesty – in that case, misrepresentation of the employee’s 
  medical status – does not, as a matter of law, in and of itself amount to just 
  cause for dismissal, but rather must be assessed in the context of the relationship 
  between the parties: <i>McKinley v. BC Tel </i>(2001), 200 D.L.R. (4th) 385.  
  That principle is equally applicable to the present case.  Lissaman J. found 
  it “unfortunate that [the respondent] took the position of self-help”, but expressed 
  “some sympathy with the position that she took”.   While unquestionably not 
  commendable, her retention of this money was, in context, comprehensible from 
  her perspective and was supported by her solicitor’s advice.  In these circumstances, 
  Lissaman J. was not prepared to find that that single act constituted just cause 
  for dismissal.   These were findings of fact, and we have not been persuaded 
  that they were unreasonable.</p>
<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Notice </span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>At trial, the respondent’s counsel invited Lissaman 
  J. to disregard Mr. Templer’s letter of December 9, 1997 and the dinner meeting 
  attended by him, the respondent and her fiancé on the following day.  Lissaman 
  J. declined that invitation, but expressed his intention to “pay some attention 
  to those events”.  In the end, he concluded that those events indicated to the 
  respondent that things were changing and that her former employer was purchasing 
  the business of Trailer Leasing Company, her current employer, but that it did 
  not constitute notice “within the strict legal sense”.  In our view, those findings 
  were reasonably supported by the evidence before him, and we would not disturb 
  them.</p>
<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Notice period </span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The respondent was employed by Trailer Leasing 
  Company as its Canadian branch manager, and performed capably in that position, 
  from March 1997 to January 1998, a period of about 11 months.  Following her 
  termination, she was unemployed for 6½ months.  There is no suggestion of failure 
  to mitigate.  Lissaman J., taking into account that (as he found) she had been 
  induced to leave her earlier secure employment for her new position with Trailer 
  Leasing Company, awarded her damages for wrongful dismissal for a 6½ month period.   
  Although on the high side, this period was, on the authorities, within the range 
  of notice awarded to similarly placed employees over similar periods of time 
  and reflected no error in principle, and we do not find it so inordinately high 
  as to warrant intervention.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with 
  costs.</span></p>
