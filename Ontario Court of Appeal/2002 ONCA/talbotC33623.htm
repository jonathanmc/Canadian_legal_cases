  </span> The appellant Gerald Talbot was charged on a 17 count indictment with 
  numerous sexual offences against three young teenaged boys and with counselling 
  two of these boys to commit break and enters.  The Crown’s theory was that the 
  appellant plied the boys with alcohol or drugs or both, to weaken their resistance, 
  and then had sex with them.  The appellant was tried before MacDonald J. and 
  a jury in early in 1994.  The Crown’s case consisted mainly of the evidence 
  of the three boys, two medical experts and three similar fact witnesses.  The 
  defence called no evidence.  The jury found the appellant guilty on 16 of the 
  17 counts.  Some of these counts were stayed on the basis of <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, 
  [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  In January 1995 the appellant was found to be a dangerous 
  offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.</p>

    <p> 2. In the light of <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), 
      the trial judge did not properly instruct the jury on reasonable doubt;</p>
    <p> 3. The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to call a medical expert 
      on how children disclose sexual abuse and then erred in instructing the 
      jury on how they could use the expert’s testimony;</p>

<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>The appellant submits that because

<h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.        THE EVIDENCE OF THE THREE COMPLAINANTS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The indictment alleged that the appellant committed the offences of 
  which he was convicted over a 21-month period between May 1991 and February 
  1993.  These offences consisted of three counts of sexual assault, three counts 
  of anal intercourse, two counts of sexual interference, two counts of invitation 
  to sexual touching, two counts of administering a noxious substance, two counts 
  of making child pornography and two counts of counselling to commit break and 
  enter.  Convictions were entered on nine of these counts, but all seven counts 
  of anal intercourse, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching were 
  stayed on <i>Kienapple</i> principles.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was 39 years old when he began to commit these offences.  
  The three complainants, P.G., K.G. and M.O., were in their early teens.  Each 
  of the three testified for the Crown.  A brief summary of their evidence will 
  put the appellant’s grounds of appeal in context.</p>
<p>            <b>(a)            P.G.</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> P.G., the victim on seven of the counts, first met the appellant in 
  1991.  He was 13 years old and on the run from the Childrens’ Aid Society.  
  Within a few days of meeting the appellant, he moved into the appellant’s home 
  on Queen Street East in Toronto.  The first incident of sexual abuse took place 
  the evening he moved in.  The appellant had a party at his house.  He poured 
  P.G. big plastic cups of vodka and encouraged him to drink them.  P.G. believed 
  he drank the entire 48-ounce bottle that evening.  When he finished the vodka, 
  he smoked two joints of hashish and drank three beers that the appellant gave 
  him.  He became ill, vomited and then laid down in the appellant’s bedroom.  
  The appellant removed P.G.’s clothes, saying “Here, take them off just in case 
  you get any puke on them”.  P.G.’s head was spinning and he couldn’t move.  
  The appellant had anal intercourse with him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Three days later, the second incident of anal intercourse occurred.  
  P.G. had drunk eight or nine beers.  The appellant threatened to kill him if 
  he told anyone about the earlier incident.  The appellant then removed P.G.’s 
  clothes and had sex with him.  P.G. said nothing and continued to live with 
  the appellant.  Sexual activity between the two took place frequently: every 
  day, two or three times a night. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After he had been living with the appellant for a while, P.G. agreed 
  to have nude pictures taken of himself.  Four pictures were taken.  That was 
  the only time the appellant asked him to submit to being photographed nude.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the spring of 1992, the appellant and P.G. moved from Queen Street 
  East to a basement apartment on Derwyn Avenue in Toronto.  Their sexual activity 
  became less frequent, occurring three or four times a week.  In June 1992 they 
  moved again, to Linsmore Crescent in Toronto.  But in the early fall of 1992, 
  the appellant kicked P.G. out of the house.  P.G. then went to live with a friend 
  of his mother but visited the appellant until January 1993.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to sexually abusing P.G., the appellant directed him and 
  one of the other complainants, M.O., to commit several break and enters.  Although 
  convicted of some of them, he did not tell the police of the appellant’s involvement 
  until much later.  Nor, for a long time, did he tell any one – not the Childrens’ 
  Aid Society, his brother, his mother or the authorities – that the appellant 
  had sexually abused him.  He said that he thought of the appellant as an uncle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> P.G. also testified about an incident with a Mr. Rivera, which was relied 
  on by the defence.  When the incident occurred P.G. had known Rivera for about 
  three months.  They had spent almost every weekend together.  One night at a 
  party P.G. drank about ten beers.  Rivera then forced him, at knife point, to 
  take some valium.  Later the two took a cab to Rivera’s house.  P.G. ended up 
  in Rivera’s bed and fell asleep.  He testified that when he awoke Rivera was 
  on top of him having anal intercourse.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Later that day, P.G. went to a birthday party with his girlfriend.  
  He told her about the incident with Rivera and about the appellant’s sexual 
  abuse of him.  He then changed his mind and told his girlfriend that what he 
  had said about the appellant was untrue.  That evening he told the appellant 
  “Rivera screwed me”.  The appellant warned P.G. about Rivera and insisted on 
  calling the police.  The appellant was arrested shortly after this incident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> P.G. had a youth record.  In January 1992, he was convicted of break 
  and enter, carrying a concealed weapon and failing to attend court.  He was 
  sentenced to time served (one month) and one year probation.  In December 1992, 
  he was convicted of theft and again sentenced to probation, this time for fourteen 
  months.</p>
<p>            <b>(b)            K.G. </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> K.G., the victim on three of the counts, was P.G.’s older brother.  
  He had spent five or six years in the care of the Childrens’ Aid Society when 
  he met the appellant through his brother and M.O.  When he was 15 years old 
  K.G. moved into the appellant’s basement apartment on Derwyn Avenue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> K.G. testified about an incident in the summer of 1992.  He and the 
  appellant were at a Chinese restaurant and he had a headache.  The appellant 
  offered him a Tylenol 3, which he took.  The two then returned to Derwyn Avenue 
  and K.G. began drinking Jack Daniels and Pepsi, some of them poured by the appellant.  
  He testified that when he awoke it was dark and he was in bed beside the appellant.  
  He felt drunk and went to the washroom, where he noticed his underwear was inside 
  out.  He asked the appellant what had happened and the appellant replied that 
  he had removed K.G.’s clothes because he seemed sick or too hot.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> P.G. also testified about this incident.  The appellant had asked P.G. 
  to sleep on the couch in the living room, but P.G. could hear the appellant 
  breathing loud and the mattress bouncing.  So he looked through a window into 
  the bedroom and claimed to have seen the appellant from the back, naked, moving 
  up and down.  P.G. could not see his brother.  The next day the appellant told 
  P.G. that he had put 28 valium into K.G.’s drink.  The appellant instructed 
  P.G. not to tell his brother.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> M.O., the victim on six of the counts, was 12 or 13 years old when he 
  met the appellant.  He testified about this meeting.  He was in Grade 8 at the 
  time and enrolled in special education classes.  One day after school. he saw 
  the appellant sitting on his doorstep drinking beer.  The appellant gave M.O. 
  one-half a beer and they started to talk.  The appellant asked M.O. if he had 
  a dad.  When M.O. said no, the appellant asked him if he wanted the appellant 
  to be his dad.  M.O. said yes.  The appellant continued talking.  He said to 
  M.O., “If you love me, you take off your clothes and get on the bed”.  M.O. 
  became scared and asked the appellant what he meant.  The appellant said that 
  people show their love in different ways and “If you love me, you take off your 
  clothes”.  M.O. did so.  The appellant then had anal intercourse with him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> M.O. agreed to do work around the appellant’s home.  He said that he 
  visited the appellant at each of his residences, slept over every two or three 
  days, and had both oral and anal intercourse with him on many of these visits.  
  The appellant also took several nude photographs of M.O.  Ten of these photographs 
  were introduced in evidence at the trial.  The appellant was in two of them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> M.O. also testified that the appellant directed him and P.G. to break 
  into several houses, which they did.  The appellant gave them the equipment 
  to commit these break and enters: a gym bag, a crowbar, a screwdriver, a hammer, 
  flashlights, tape and gloves.  M.O. and P.G. gave the proceeds of their crimes 
  to the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> M.O. was vigorously cross-examined on the inconsistencies between his 
  evidence at trial and his statements to the police.  He admitted that he was 
  a good liar and had fooled his mother and fabricated stories to the police several 
  times.  He also acknowledged that he had told his social worker, hospital personnel 
  and the Catholic Childrens’ Aid Society that the appellant had not sexually 
  abused him.  In convicting the appellant, however, the jury obviously accepted 
  M.O.’s evidence at trial as well as the evidence of P.G. and K.G.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I turn now to the appellant’s grounds of appeal.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>C.        THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h4>
<p><b>            1.            The counts of anal intercourse</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was found guilty by the jury on three counts of anal intercourse 
  contrary to s. 159 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  However, these counts were 
  later conditionally stayed by the trial judge under <i>Kienapple, supra</i>.  
  After his trial this court, in two decisions, declared s. 159 unconstitutional.  
  The court held that s. 159 violated the equality guarantee in s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  and could not be saved under s. 1.  See <i>R. v. M. (C.)</i> (1995), 98 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 481 and <i>R. v. S. (A.)</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 320.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because of this declaration of unconstitutionality, the Crown concedes 
  that the counts of anal intercourse cannot stand.    Counts 4, 9 and 13 will 
  therefore be quashed.</p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'></h4>
<p><b>            2.            The charge on reasonable doubt</b></p>
<p style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is yet another pre-<i>Lifchus</i> trial, post-<i>Lifchus</i> appeal 
  in which the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge on reasonable doubt is challenged.  
  Here the appellant submits, and the Crown acknowledges, that the trial judge’s 
  charge on reasonable doubt fell short of the requirements of <i>Lifchus</i> 
  in two ways.  First, the trial judge told the jury that the words “reasonable 
  doubt” should be given “their ordinary and natural meaning” and not be considered 
  “as a legal term having some special connotation”.  Second, he failed to tell 
  the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is more than proof on the balance 
  of probabilities.  These two shortcomings are apparent in the trial judge’s 
  explanation of reasonable doubt, which he gave to the jury once at the beginning 
  of his long charge and once at the end:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>What is reasonable doubt?  When I speak of reasonable doubt, I use the 
      words in their ordinary and natural meaning.  I do not use them as a legal 
      term having some special connotation.  A reasonable doubt is a doubt based 
      upon reason and common sense, after having considered all of the evidence 
      as a whole.  It is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous doubt.  Reasonable 
      doubt must not be based upon conjecture or speculation, and, as mentioned, 
      it applies only to the essential elements, not to other matters.  Please 
      note that reasonable doubt may arise because of a lack of evidence proving 
      guilt as well because you are unable to determine the credibility or believability 
      of particular witnesses in relation to the essential elements.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind as well, members of the jury, that it is rarely possible to 
      prove anything with absolute or mathematical certainty.  Consequently, the 
      burden of proof on the Crown is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, 
      but not beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These two shortcomings – describing reasonable doubt as an ordinary 
  expression and failing to distinguish the criminal from the civil standard of 
  proof – give rise to the concern that the jury may conclude “probable guilt” 
  is enough to convict.  These shortcomings are, however, found in many pre-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  jury charges in this province.  And as later decisions of both this court and 
  the Supreme Court of Canada have emphasized, they do not automatically amount 
  to reversible error.  Instead, this court must assess the shortcomings in the 
  context of the charge as a whole and of the entire trial.  The court must then 
  make a judgment call whether it was reasonably likely that the jury convicted 
  the appellant by applying the wrong standard of proof, thus depriving the appellant 
  of a fair trial.  See <i>R. v. Rhee </i>(2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) 
  and <i>R. v. Feeley</i> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here my judgment call is that it was not reasonably likely the jury 
  misunderstood the heavy burden of proof on the Crown.  I base this conclusion 
  on the cumulative effect of six considerations.  First, at the beginning of 
  his charge the trial judge emphasized the jurors’ responsibility to protect 
  persons from unjust convictions by convicting only on proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Juries have a direct and deciding voice in the administration of justice.  
      You are engaged in one of the most important duties which a citizen can 
      be called upon to perform.  You are now judges of this court.  On the one 
      hand, it is of fundamental importance that no person shall be found guilty 
      of any criminal offence which he or she did not commit.  On the other hand, 
      you are the guardians of the legal rights of the community in which you 
      live.  That community relies upon you to ensure that those who commit crimes 
      are strictly but fairly dealt with.  Your responsibility as jurors is to 
      protect persons from unjust convictions and, as well, to protect the safety 
      and the security of the community by finding guilt against persons proven 
      beyond a reasonable doubt to have committed crimes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Nopara style='line-height:normal'>This cautionary instruction reduces 
  the likelihood that the jury misunderstood the burden of proof.  See <i>R. v. 
  Satkunananthan</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.).</p>

  </span> Second, the outcome of the trial turned largely on the credibility of 
  the three complainants, and the trial judge linked his instruction on credibility 
  to reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You should determine the credibility of any witness after considering all 
      of the evidence.  Remember that a reasonable doubt may exist as a result 
      of your determinations respecting credibility.  As I am sure you appreciate 
      from Mr. Donohue’s [defence counsel’s] remarks to you, it is a major part 
      of Mr.&nbsp;Talbot’s defence that he is presumed to be innocent, and these 
      three complainants are such incredible witnesses that none of them proves 
      any of their allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is Mr. Donohue’s 
      submission; that is for you to determine.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, despites its shortcomings, the trial judge’s charge on reasonable 
  doubt complies with <i>Lifchus</i> in important ways:  by stating that the burden 
  of proof rests on the Crown and never shifts; by linking the burden of proof 
  to the presumption of innocence; and by indicating that reasonable doubt must 
  be based on reason and common sense but cannot be an imaginary or frivolous 
  doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fourth, the trial judge emphasized the Crown’s burden by repeating the 
  words reasonable doubt – by the Crown’s tally – no less than 171 times in the 
  course of his original charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fifth, though the charge did not expressly differentiate between the 
  criminal and civil standards, it did not contain any misleading statements that 
  might lead the jury to conclude that it could convict on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Sixth, and most important, three key persons at the trial – the two 
  counsel and the trial judge – were all satisfied that the jury understood the 
  high standard of proof needed for a conviction.  That they were so satisfied 
  is evident not just from the failure of either counsel to object to the instructions 
  on reasonable doubt but from an exchange that occurred near the end of the trial.  
  In response to a question from the jury the court reporter read back defence 
  counsel’s closing address, which had emphasized that “probable guilt” could 
  not support a conviction.  The court reporter, however, apparently made an inadvertent 
  slip of the tongue, prompting a discussion between defence counsel and the trial 
  judge about whether the jury should be recalled and the closing address re-read.  
  Neither thought the jury should be recalled and the trial judge, significantly, 
  observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Your address on Friday was perfectly plain that probably guilty is not 
      good enough, it must be guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I gave to them 
      in my charge twice that concept and referred to proof beyond a reasonable 
      doubt on so many occasions through the course of the charge and the recharge, 
      that what I think you have correctly stated was an inadvertent slip on the 
      part of the reporter in reading back your address to the jury, could not 
      possibly affect the decisional process.  I noted the same thing, but it 
      struck me that in the context of all of your comments, and all else that 
      has been said respecting the appropriate burden, that it must have been 
      obvious to them that that was not what you said.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>            <b>3.            The expert evidence</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown called two medical experts, Dr. Dirk Huyer, an expert in the 
  medical aspects of child abuse<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> and Dr. Clive Chamberlain, 
  a psychiatrist, who was qualified as an expert on the sexual abuse of children.  
  On appeal the appellant challenges only the evidence of Dr. Chamberlain. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The three complainants, P.G., K.G. and M.O., did not disclose the appellant’s 
  sexual abuse immediately after it occurred.  Instead, disclosure was delayed, 
  at times inconsistent, and marked by recantations.  The defence relied on the 
  way the complainants disclosed the appellant’s abuse to argue that their allegations 
  were fabricated.  Dr. Chamberlain was called by the Crown to explain to the 
  jury that delayed or inconsistent disclosure and even recantation of claims 
  of sexual abuse by child victims is not unusual.  He testified that it is “a 
  very commonly observed pattern of behaviour of kids who have been involved in 
  sexual situations with adults” and he discussed the reasons for it.  But he 
  also cautioned that “this kind of disclosure on and off and recantation, I don’t 
  think that it, by itself, should tell us anything about the factual veracity 
  of the disclosures that are ultimately made … it ought not to be seen as a certain 
  indicator that a child has been sexually abused”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, defence counsel did not object to the admissibility of Dr. 
  Chamberlain’s opinion evidence.  On appeal, however, relying on the recent Supreme 
  Court of Canada decision in <i>R. v. D. (D.)</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 41, 
  the appellant submits that Dr. Chamberlain should not have been allowed to testify 
  because his testimony did not meet the necessity criterion for the admissibility 
  of expert evidence.  The appellant also submits that, once admitted, the trial 
  judge failed to properly instruct the jury on how they could use Dr. Chamberlain’s 
  evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Supreme Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Mohan</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 402 governs the admissibility of expert evidence.  To be admissible, the 
  evidence must be (i)&nbsp;relevant; (ii) necessary; (iii) not subject to an 
  exclusionary rule; and (iv) given by a properly qualified expert.  Here only 
  the second criterion, necessity, is in question.  Dr.&nbsp;Chamberlain’s evidence 
  was relevant to what inferences, if any, might be drawn from the way the complainants 
  reported the appellant’s sexual abuse, thus permitting the jury to better assess 
  the defence position; his evidence was not subject to an exclusionary rule; 
  and he is recognized as a highly qualified expert in child sexual abuse.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To satisfy the necessity criterion, the expert must give evidence that 
  is likely to be outside the ordinary experience and knowledge of the trier of 
  fact, in this case the jury.  So stated, the necessity criterion attempts to 
  meet the concerns that expert evidence is expensive and time consuming and has 
  the potential to distort the jury’s fact finding function by turning jury trials 
  into a battle of experts.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown argues that Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence satisfied the necessity 
  criterion because the information he provided about children’s disclosure patterns 
  was likely outside the jurors’ ordinary experience and knowledge, yet was important 
  information in assessing the competing inferences to be drawn from late or inconsistent 
  reporting or from recantations.  Over the past 15 years expert evidence similar 
  to that given by Dr. Chamberlain has often been admitted in child sexual abuse 
  cases and its admission has been upheld on appeal.  See <i>R. v. B. (G.)</i> 
  (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 200 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. J. (F.E.)</i> (1989), 53 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 64 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Marquard</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.); 
  <i>R. v. Mair</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 563 and <i>R. v. T. (D.B.)</i> (1994), 
  89 C.C.C. (3d) 466.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> But in <i>D. (D.)</i> – in which the accused was charged with sexual 
  assault and invitation to sexual touching of a 5-year-old – the majority of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada held that expert evidence on the late disclosure 
  of child sexual abuse did not meet the necessity criterion in <i>Mohan</i> and 
  was thus inadmissible.    Major J., writing for the majority, summarized the 
  expert’s evidence as follows, at p. 64:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In diagnosing cases of child sexual abuse, the timing of the disclosure, 
      standing alone, signifies nothing.  Not all victims of child sexual abuse 
      will disclose the abuse immediately.  It depends upon the circumstances 
      of the particular victim.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In Major J.’s view, this evidence “was not unique or scientifically puzzling 
  but was rather the proper subject for a simple jury instruction”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Despite the holding in <i>D (.D.)</i> I would not give effect to the 
  appellant’s submission for two reasons.  First, the expert evidence in <i>D. 
  (D.) </i>differed materially from Dr.&nbsp;Chamberlain’s evidence in this case.  
  The expert evidence in <i>D. (D.) </i>related only to the significance of <i>delay</i> 
  in disclosing sexual abuse allegations.  As summarized by Major J., that expert 
  testified that “the timing of disclosure, <i>standing alone, </i>signifies nothing”, 
  at p. 64.  [Emphasis added.]  And the reason that delayed disclosure means nothing 
  in and of itself is that, as a matter of law, no adverse inference can be drawn 
  from a complainant’s delay in disclosing the allegations.  Major J. put it this 
  way, at p. 66:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The significance of the complainant’s failure to make a timely complaint 
      <i>must not </i>be the subject of any presumptive adverse inference based 
      upon now rejected stereotypical assumptions of how persons (particularly 
      children) react to acts of sexual abuse:  <i>R. v. M. (P.S.) </i>(1992), 
      77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 408-9; <i>R. v. M. (T.E.) </i>(1996), 
      187 A.R. 273 (C.A.).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And further, at pp. 66-67, “[a] delay in disclosure, standing alone, will never 
  give rise to an adverse inference against the credibility of the complainant.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because this principle forms a recognized part of Canadian law, one 
  can easily understand why the Supreme Court found that the information offered 
  by the expert in <i>D.&nbsp;(D.)</i> should have gone to the jury in the form 
  of an instruction from the trial judge.  No expert evidence was needed to establish 
  that the delay in the complainant’s disclosure did not by itself impair her 
  credibility.  The jury was not permitted to draw an adverse inference from this 
  delay as a matter of law and the trial judge should have instructed them accordingly.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The present case is very different.  Instead of dealing with the relevance 
  of delayed disclosure “standing alone”, Dr. Chamberlain testified to patterns 
  of disclosure among sexual abuse victims,  patterns that include not only delays 
  in disclosure but also inconsistencies in disclosure and recantations.  Although 
  no adverse inference can be drawn from the mere fact that disclosure is delayed, 
  the same cannot be said for inconsistent disclosures or recantations.  Indeed, 
  prior inconsistent statements are typically highly damaging to a complainant’s 
  credibility.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, there is, quite rightly, no existing principle of law that would 
  prevent a jury from drawing an adverse inference from inconsistent disclosures 
  or recantations by a complainant.  But the jury should be allowed to put these 
  inconsistent disclosures and recantations in context.  If, as Dr. Chamberlain 
  testified, child victims of sexual abuse often make disclosures marked by delay, 
  inconsistencies, and recantations, then expert evidence may be required to help 
  the jury make an appropriate and informed determination of the complainant’s 
  credibility.  Patterns of disclosure among sexual abuse victims do not form 
  a part of the ordinary experience and knowledge of jurors.  Expert evidence 
  may well be necessary to help jurors draw the proper inferences, and I conclude 
  that it was necessary in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the light of <i>D. (D.),</i> it might have seemed preferable for 
  the trial judge to have dealt with the relevance of delay in a jury instruction, 
  and for the Crown to have limited Dr. Chamberlain’s testimony to the patterns 
  of disclosure involving inconsistencies and recantations.  Accepting, however, 
  that Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence was necessary to help the jury understand the 
  significance of the complainants’ inconsistent disclosures and recantations, 
  to restrict him from offering an opinion on the relevance of delayed disclosure 
  would be unworkable. Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence dealt with patterns of disclosure 
  among sexual abuse victims; delays in disclosure form an integral part of those 
  patterns.  Dr. Chamberlan’s testimony was properly admitted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, even if Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence should not have been admitted, 
  its admission caused no substantial wrong.  If necessary, I would therefore 
  apply the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>. Although the 
  Supreme Court of Canada did not address the proviso in <i>D. (D.)</i> because 
  it had already decided to allow the appeal on another ground, the majority reasons 
  affirm that the jury is entitled to the information on delayed disclosure.  
  The majority said simply that the information should come from the trial judge, 
  not from an expert witness.  Major J. stressed, at p. 67, that an important 
  advantage of a jury instruction over expert evidence is that the information 
  “is given by an impartial judicial officer, and any risk of superfluous or prejudicial 
  content is eliminated”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, though the information on disclosure patterns was given by an 
  expert, Dr.&nbsp;Chamberlain’s evidence was short, balanced and avoided any 
  superfluous or prejudicial content.  In both his examination in chief and his 
  cross-examination he emphasized that neither late or inconsistent disclosure 
  nor recantation prove that sexual abuse has occurred.  If the admission of his 
  evidence amounted to an error of law, the error did not cause a miscarriage 
  of justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also contends that the trial judge did not properly instruct 
  the jury on how they could use Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence.  I do not agree with 
  this contention.  The trial judge quite properly told the jury that if they 
  accepted Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence they could take it into account in assessing 
  the credibility of the complainants, that is in determining whether the complainants 
  fabricated their evidence.  But the trial judge cautioned the jury at least 
  three times that they could not use Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence to conclude that 
  sexual abuse had occurred. For example, in discussing Dr.&nbsp;Chamberlain’s 
  evidence, the trial judge told the jury:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>However, it is very important that you understand and accept that this 
      evidence cannot be used as confirming that the complaints by young persons 
      of sexual acts performed upon them by Mr. Talbot are in fact true, or are 
      more likely to be true because their conduct fits the so-called pattern 
      described by Dr. Chamberlain.  Dr. Chamberlain said himself that the pattern 
      of secrecy, helplessness, denial, disclosure and further denial should not 
      tell you anything about the truth of the matters disclosed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> And later, in comparing Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence with similar fact 
  evidence, he repeated this caution:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This evidence of Dr. Chamberlain’s was admitted since it may help you, 
      if you accept it, in understanding how one or more young persons might not 
      complain about sexual abuse or might deny sexual abuse.  To that extent, 
      Dr. Chamberlain’s evidence may help you to determine the credibility of 
      young persons who now allege various sexual acts performed on them by Mr. 
      Talbot after not complaining or, alternatively, after denying such sexual 
      acts.  Such evidence, expert evidence, may explain away a problem with credibility, 
      depending on how you view that evidence.  However, that expert evidence 
      cannot be used to bolster or add to the credibility of a complainant, because 
      it cannot be used to say that sexual abuse did, in fact, occur.  It is thus 
      distinct from similar fact evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>            <b>4.            The failure to give a “clear and sharp” <i>Vetrovec</i> 
  warning</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge told the jury more than once that they may wish to be 
  cautious before relying on the evidence of P.G. and M.O. because both these 
  complainants had acknowledged committing criminal offences.  In the words of 
  the trial judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Consider the likelihood of fabrication of that evidence in all of the circumstances, 
      including the backgrounds of P.G. and M.O. and the inconsistencies found 
      in their evidence given before you.  If you, as the judges of credibility, 
      applying common sense to the evidence you have before you, feel that caution 
      is appropriate in determining whether to rely upon any of the evidence given 
      to you by either P.G. or M.O., then be cautious.  If you determine that 
      caution is required, what that means is that you feel there are risks in 
      accepting as correct the evidence of that witness, bearing in mind the presumption 
      of innocence which applies to Mr. Talbot and the burden of proof resting 
      on the Crown in respect of each count.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>It is for you to determine whether such caution is indicated.  If you feel 
      it is, it is for you to determine whether there is evidence capable of confirming 
      the evidence to which caution should be applied.  It is for you to determine 
      whether any such confirming evidence is sufficient to overcome the degree 
      of caution which you feel is appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that this direction was inadequate because it 
  allowed the jury to decide whether they should exercise caution before relying 
  on the evidence.  Instead, the appellant submits the trial judge should have 
  given a “clear and sharp” <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, instructing the jury that 
  they must scrutinize carefully the evidence of P.G. and M.O. before accepting 
  it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is a special instruction to a jury to help 
  it assess the credibility of an untrustworthy witness whose evidence is important 
  to the case.  Ordinarily, a trial judge has discretion whether to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
  warning and, having decided to give one, on the nature and strength of the warning.  
  See <i>R. v. Yanover (No. 1)</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. C.A.).  Some 
  cases, however, require the trial judge as a matter of law to give a strong 
  <i>Vetrovec</i> warning – a “clear and sharp” warning – to the jury about too 
  readily accepting the evidence of an unsavoury witness.  See <i>R. v. Brooks</i> 
  (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I acknowledge that the trial judge in this case did not give the jury 
  a “clear and sharp” warning about the evidence of P.G. and M.O.  Therefore, 
  it seems to me that this ground of appeal turns on whether he was required to 
  do so as a matter of law.  If not, the diluted warning he did give was well 
  within his discretion and is not reviewable in this court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that a “clear and sharp” warning was required as a matter 
  of law.  P.G. and M.O. did have checkered pasts.  P.G. had a youth record, M.O. 
  admitted to being a good liar, and both were accomplices in two break and enters.  
  But these considerations do not automatically require a clear and sharp warning 
  about their evidence.  And other considerations strongly suggest that a clear 
  and sharp warning was not required. These two complainants were vulnerable.  
  They were both from broken homes, young and living on the street.  Because of 
  their backgrounds it is hardly surprising that they had some history of lying 
  and criminal involvement.  These histories did not call their credibility into 
  question to the extent that a clear and sharp <i>Vetrovec </i>warning was required.  
  Moreover, the trial judge extensively reviewed for the jury the main parts of 
  their evidence – including its difficulty and inconsistencies – that might adversely 
  affect their credibility.  Weighing all these considerations I cannot conclude 
  that a strong <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was required.  I would therefore not give 
  effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>            <b>5.            The similar fact evidence</b></p>

  </span> The trial judge permitted the Crown to lead similar fact evidence from 
  three witnesses, J.W., J.G. and Kenneth G.  Each witness testified that he was 
  in his teens when he met the appellant.  And each witness testified that the 
  appellant plied him with alcohol until he became drunk or unconscious.  But 
  none of the three witnesses alleged that he was sexually abused by the appellant.  
  The appellant submits that absent an allegation of sexual abuse the “similar” 
  fact evidence was not sufficiently similar and its prejudicial effect outweighed 
  its probative value.  Therefore, the appellant argues that the evidence should 
  not have been admitted.  Before discussing this ground of appeal I will briefly 
  review the evidence of the three witnesses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span

  </span> J.W. testified that when he was 14 years old, M.O. invited him to the 
  appellant’s place on Queen Street to drink and party.  The appellant poured 
  him two drinks of vodka and orange juice, and as he poured each one told J.W. 
  to drink up before M.O. got home. After the second drink, J.W. felt drunk and 
  left.</p>

  J.G.  went upstairs to the appellant’s living room and began drinking beer.  
  After three beers he became drowsy and passed out on the living room floor.  
  He next remembered waking up in the appellant’s bed wearing all his clothes.</p>

  asked the appellant whether he had had sex with J.G.  The appellant said no 
  because J.G. was “too dirty”.</p>

  </span> Of the three similar fact witnesses, the evidence of Kenneth G. was 
  the most cogent.  The defence challenged the admissibility of his testimony.  
  The trial judge ruled that he could testify only about his first meeting with 
  the appellant, which occurred in 1988, well before the incidents alleged in 
  the indictment.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  The trial judge held that the evidence about 
  this first meeting was admissible to show both the appellant’s knowledge of 
  the stupefying effect of alcohol in a young person and his method of seducing 
  and raping young boys, and to rebut defence suggestions that the complainants 
  had collaborated on and fabricated their evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Kenneth 
  G. testified that when he was 17 he met the appellant at a job site where they 
  were both doing masonry work. The appellant suggested that they buy a case of 
  beer. The appellant paid for the beer and the two went to Kenneth G's house 
  to drink it. After drinking four or five beers Kenneth G. passed out. When he 
  awoke, he vomited and passed out again. When he next awoke he found himself 
  in bed with the appellant. The two of them were clad only in their underwear.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Kenneth G. also testified that he did not know any of the complainants, 
  thus negating any suggestion of collusion on his part.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility 
  of proposed similar fact evidence.  Similar fact rulings are therefore entitled 
  to deference on appeal.  In this case, although I think it would have been  
  preferable if the proposed similar fact evidence had been excluded, I am not 
  persuaded that the trial judge’s ruling was unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence had some probative value.  It showed that the appellant 
  used a consistent method to attract young boys, thus permitting the jury to 
  infer that he used this method with each of the complainants.  That inference, 
  if drawn, would support the complainants’ credibility.   Balanced against its 
  probative value, the similar fact evidence had little prejudicial effect because 
  it was far less serious than the allegations with which the appellant was charged.  
  I would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
