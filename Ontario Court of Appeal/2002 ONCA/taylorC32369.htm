  <span>      </span>After a seven week jury trial, the appellant was convicted 
  of first degree murder on the basis that he forcibly confined the deceased while 
  causing his death.  The appellant appeals against his conviction on the grounds 
  that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury and that the jury’s verdict 
  on first degree murder was unreasonable.  For the reasons that follow, we do 
  not agree with the appellant’s submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <b><span>      </span></b>The deceased, Chris Batta, lived in Thornhill with 
  his wife and twenty-one month old daughter.  He worked as a cell phone agent 
  and also ran a business buying and selling electronic equipment, which he advertised 
  in newspapers.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>On December 30, 1996, at 9:45 a.m., the appellant called 
  the deceased and told him that he wanted to sell a VCR to him.  The phone call 
  lasted approximately five minutes.  The appellant then went to the deceased’s 
  apartment, arriving at approximately 11:41 a.m.  On his way, he told a man who 
  drove him part of the way that he was going to visit a man named “Chris” to 
  sell him a VCR for $150.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>According to the deceased’s wife, the deceased had adopted 
  a practice of secretly videotaping customers for safety reasons and for monitoring 
  transactions that might involve stolen equipment.  For approximately thirty-five 
  minutes after the appellant arrived at the deceased’s apartment, the deceased 
  videotaped their interaction.  On the videotape, the deceased is seen inspecting 
  the VCR and commenting on its age and poor condition.  The appellant asked the 
  deceased to offer him a good price because he had come a long way and complained 
  that the trip had otherwise been a waste of his time.  The deceased is recorded 
  as saying that he could have saved the appellant a trip if the appellant had 
  told him about the VCR’s condition over the phone.  The deceased offered the 
  appellant $10 for the VCR.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Between 12:15 and 12:22 p.m., the deceased turned the videotape 
  off.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At approximately 12:22 p.m., the deceased called his brother, 
  telling him that there was a man in his apartment attempting to sell him a VCR 
  for too much money, and asking him if he wanted to buy the VCR.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At approximately 1:00 p.m., the deceased called the superintendent 
  of the apartment building.  He told the superintendent that his mother would 
  be visiting soon, and that there was a man in his apartment who was attempting 
  to sell him a broken VCR.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At approximately 1:15 p.m., an eleven-year-old girl, who 
  lived directly above the deceased’s apartment, began hearing a man yelling and 
  screaming, as well as the sound of objects crashing to the floor.  The yelling 
  and screaming continued for about five minutes and involved only one voice.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>At approximately 1:15 p.m., a neighbour, who lived below 
  the deceased and left her apartment to go out, heard a voice crying “help, police” 
  about three times.  She left to find the property manager, and they searched 
  the second floor for the location of the voice.  They heard the deceased’s baby 
  crying.  Then, approximately four or five minutes after the first cry for help, 
  they saw the appellant emerge from the deceased’s apartment.  They left to find 
  the superintendent and, when they returned a few minutes later, found the deceased 
  lying in the hallway outside his apartment.  They called 911.  Fire fighters 
  were dispatched at 1:21 p.m. and arrived between 1:23 and 1:25 p.m.  The police 
  were dispatched at 1:22 p.m. and arrived at about 1:29 p.m.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The deceased was pronounced dead that evening.  His injuries 
  included sixteen stab wounds to his head and neck, two of which were particularly 
  serious.  The deceased also had marks on his back, six small linear abrasions 
  near his mouth on his chin and neck, and other small abrasions near his eyes.  
  He had bruising to his eyes and a wound on his scalp, both of which were caused 
  by blunt force injuries.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When the police arrived, they noted that the apartment looked 
  ransacked, particularly the master bedroom and en suite bathroom.  The bedroom’s 
  closet doors and the bathroom’s vanity doors were open, and their contents were 
  strewn on the floor.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police found several foot impressions in the deceased’s apartment, 
  including two shoe impressions in the en suite bathroom, which matched shoes 
  seized from the appellant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police also found blood samples in several locations in the 
  deceased’s apartment.   The telephone in the bedroom had blood on the receiver 
  as well as bloody fingerprints on the numbers 9 and 1.  In the en suite bathroom, 
  there was a large pool of blood on the floor near the sink, which matched the 
  deceased’s. The size of the pool indicated that the deceased had bled there 
  for several minutes.  Blood samples from the wall and vanity door of the bathroom 
  showed a mixture of blood.  The dominant blood was the deceased’s and the other 
  blood could not be excluded as the appellant’s.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police found an empty false-bottomed Pledge<i> </i>can with 
  the deceased’s blood and other blood that could not be excluded as being the 
  appellant’s.  The deceased had kept money in the false-bottomed can and had 
  kept the can under the vanity in the en suite bathroom.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police recovered six knives from various locations in the 
  apartment.  DNA samples from one knife matched those of the deceased.  Another 
  knife was broken and had three samples of blood and tissue matching the deceased.  
  DNA samples from a pair of scissors recovered from the kitchen floor also matched 
  the deceased.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Five hair swipes matching the deceased were also found throughout 
  the apartment.  One was on a kitchen cabinet door 53 to 61 inches from the ground.  
  The second was on the laundry room door in the kitchen 9 to 24 inches from the 
  ground.  Finger swipes from that door suggested that the deceased had tried 
  to get up from the floor.  The third swipe was on the master bedroom closet 
  32 inches from the ground.  The fourth was on the shower door 20 inches from 
  the ground.  The fifth was on the en suite bathroom door 16 to 20 inches from 
  the ground. </p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant had injuries to his hands consistent with grabbing 
  a sharp blade.   Several of his tendons were cut.   He also suffered knife cuts 
  to his back above his right shoulder and to his neck behind his right ear.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the killing, the appellant went to stay with a friend in 
  Whitby.  On December 31, 1996, the police searched the appellant’s apartment.  
  They found blood-stained clothing and a blood-stained buck knife with the deceased’s 
  blood on the blade and a mixture of blood on the handle. The appellant’s jacket 
  and shirt had holes consistent with knife penetration.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On January 1, 1997, the appellant changed his 
  appearance by dyeing and cutting his hair and then went to Montreal. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was tried for first degree murder pursuant to s. 
  231(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides that murder is first degree 
  murder when death is caused while forcibly confining the victim.  Under s. 279(2) 
  of the <i>Code</i>, a person commits forcible confinement when he or she confines, 
  imprisons or forcibly seizes another person without lawful authority.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown’s theory was that the deceased and appellant had not 
  met before December 30, 1996, when the appellant tried to sell the deceased 
  a VCR.  When the deceased stated that he would not pay more than $10 for the 
  VCR, the appellant became frustrated.  As a result, while in the kitchen, the 
  appellant grabbed the deceased and began a five-minute controlled domination 
  of the deceased to force him to reveal the location of his money.    </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to the Crown, the appellant used a buck knife he had 
  brought with him to inflict the superficial abrasions on the deceased’s face 
  and neck and the small stab wounds near his eyes.  During the ensuing struggle, 
  the appellant threw the deceased against the cupboards and the deceased picked 
  up a knife and stabbed the appellant.  The appellant took the knife and dragged 
  the deceased out of the kitchen and through the corridor towards the master 
  bedroom and en suite bathroom, creating the series of hair swipes.  In the bathroom, 
  the appellant forced the deceased to produce the money in the false-bottomed 
  Pledge can under the vanity.  He then ransacked the deceased’s closets for more 
  money and left the apartment, leaving the deceased bleeding on the bathroom 
  floor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant testified at trial. According to the appellant, 
  he and the deceased had known each other before December 30, 1996.  The appellant 
  testified that the deceased used to buy cocaine from the appellant and that 
  the appellant visited the deceased’s apartment partly to collect a drug debt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The defence asserted that the appellant had acted in self-defence.  
  The appellant testified that he and the deceased began to discuss the alleged 
  drug debt around 1:10 p.m.  The deceased asked for more time to pay the debt, 
  left the kitchen where they had been talking, and returned with the Pledge can 
  to show the appellant that he could afford to repay the debt.  The deceased 
  gave the appellant $50, which the appellant took.  The appellant then took another 
  $150 from the deceased’s jacket, walked to the foyer, and took out his phone 
  to call a taxi.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At this point, according to the appellant, the deceased stabbed 
  the appellant in the back near his shoulder, the appellant turned around, and 
  the deceased stabbed him again in the back of his neck.  The appellant struggled 
  with the deceased in an attempt to take the knife from him and sliced his hands 
  in the process.  The appellant pushed the deceased into the kitchen counter 
  and tried to gouge his eyes to force the deceased to release the knife.  When 
  the deceased released the knife, the appellant began stabbing him.  When the 
  knife broke, the deceased took a different knife, which the appellant also managed 
  to take from the deceased.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant further testified that the deceased fell to the 
  floor and the appellant put the knife in his pocket without thinking.  Since 
  he was cut, the appellant went down the apartment’s hallway to the en suite 
  bathroom to find out where he was bleeding.  He tried to rinse his hands but 
  found it too painful.  He then left the bathroom and found containers with money 
  in the bedroom closet.  After emptying these containers, he saw the Pledge can 
  sitting on the corner of the desk.  He removed approximately $1,000 from the 
  can and left the apartment.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The jury convicted the appellant of first degree 
  murder. The appellant appeals his conviction, arguing that the trial judge, 
  Marchand J., erred in his charge to the jury and that the jury’s verdict on 
  first degree murder was unreasonable.</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>1)</span></b><span>        </span><b>The Charge to the 
    Jury<u></u></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that Marchand J. erred in several aspects 
  of his jury charge: (1) his definition of “forcible confinement”; (2) the way 
  he related the defence evidence on first degree murder; (3) his instructions 
  on the use of evidence of the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct; (4) his instruction 
  on self-defence; (5) his response to a question from the jury; and (6) his instruction 
  on the use of the appellant’s criminal record in relation to self-defence. We 
  are not persuaded that Justice Marchand erred in any of these respects.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Justice Marchand’s definition of “forcible confinement” was consistent 
  with this Court’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Kimberley</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 129 (Ont. C.A.) and suggests no error.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> His relation of the defence evidence on first degree murder was 
  equally without error.  Justice Marchand did not, as argued, fail to review 
  contentious expert evidence on forcible confinement, nor did he err in his instruction 
  to the jury on how to approach the circumstantial evidence in the case.  Furthermore, 
  after his initial charge to the jury, Justice Marchand granted - in full - a 
  request by defence counsel to refer the jury to particular pieces of evidence 
  and to explain their significance from the defence’s perspective. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There was, moreover, no error in Justice Marchand’s instructions 
  on the use of evidence of the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct. His initial 
  instruction was flawed by leaving open the possibility of using this evidence 
  to distinguish between different levels of culpable homicide, rather than using 
  it only to determine whether there was a culpable homicide at all.  However, 
  both counsel drew this error to the attention of Justice Marchand, who then 
  corrected it by instructing the jury on the proper use of the evidence. His 
  corrected instruction was sufficient, in our view, to ensure that the jury would 
  not misuse this evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that Marchand J. ought to have instructed 
  the jury that the appellant could rely upon self-defence under s. 34(2) of the 
  <i>Criminal Code</i> even if he provoked the initial assault.  But, as this 
  Court held in <i>R. v. Jenkins </i>(1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 30 (C.A.) (leave to 
  appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused February 27, 1997), whether omitting 
  this instruction amounts to an error of law depends on the charge as a whole. 
  In our view, the charge as a whole could not have misled the jury into believing 
  that the appellant could not rely upon self-defence under s.&nbsp;34(2) if he 
  provoked the initial assault.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Justice Marchand’s response to a question from the jury was also 
  error-free.  It should be noted that the response was jointly agreed upon by 
  counsel.  The jury had asked Marchand J. to clarify whether provocation was 
  available if the provoking incident occurred during a violent struggle.  Justice 
  Marchand provided both counsel with a copy of this question, asked them to think 
  about it, and discussed the question and its appropriate response with them.  
  Both counsel then agreed on a response, wrote it down, and gave it to Justice 
  Marchand, who in turn gave it to the jury. This response was entirely adequate, 
  since it did not inappropriately limit the appellant’s use of the defence of 
  provocation even after the struggle had begun.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the jury was properly instructed on the use of the appellant’s 
  criminal record in relation to self-defence.  Marchand J. instructed the jury 
  that they could only use the appellant’s criminal record to assess his credibility, 
  and Marchand J.’s subsequent instructions did not undermine this admonition.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 and <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, 
  [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, the Supreme Court of Canada held that in determining whether 
  a jury verdict is unreasonable, an appellate court must consider “whether the 
  verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably 
  have rendered”.  Since we have concluded that the jury was properly instructed, 
  the question becomes whether the jury’s verdict on first degree murder was one 
  that it could reasonably have rendered based on the evidence.  In particular, 
  because the verdict depended upon a finding that the appellant had murdered 
  the deceased while forcibly confining him, the question is whether the jury 
  could reasonably have concluded that a forcible confinement occurred.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the Crown’s evidence of forcible confinement 
  was equally consistent with the conclusion that no forcible confinement occurred.  
  He also submits that certain aspects of the expert evidence undermine an inference 
  of forcible confinement.  He pointed out that one of the Crown’s experts testified 
  that it was possible that the deceased’s two most serious wounds were inflicted 
  not in the bathroom, but elsewhere in the apartment.  Another expert testified 
  that the evidence did not necessarily suggest that the deceased’s head was being 
  held down when his hair came into contact with the various places in the apartment, 
  and that the blood in the en suite bathroom did not necessarily disclose indications 
  of a struggle.</p>

  </span></span> However, in our view, the respondent provides a compelling and 
  persuasive reply to these submissions.  If certain aspects of the expert evidence 
  undermine a finding of forcible confinement, other aspects support it.  Although 
  it was impossible to determine with certainty where the deceased’s two most 
  serious wounds were inflicted, expert evidence indicated that the large pool 
  of blood on the en suite bathroom floor likely came from these wounds and that 
  it would have taken several minutes for the pool of blood to accumulate.  Although 
  it was impossible to determine with certainty whether the deceased was being 
  held down while the hair swipes were created, expert evidence indicated that 
  some of these swipes were made while the deceased was lying down and either 
  kneeling or crouching.  And although there was no evidence of a struggle in 
  the bathroom, expert evidence indicated that such evidence would not be expected 
  if the deceased had, at the time, been weak or unconscious due to loss of blood.

  </span></span> In addition to expert evidence, there was sufficient evidence 
  from which the jury could reasonably infer that the appellant had forcibly confined 
  the deceased.  First, the superintendent testified that when the deceased called 
  him to ask if he wanted to buy the appellant’s VCR, the deceased seemed “somehow 
  concerned”, as though he “wanted to let somebody know about the situation” that 
  someone was in his apartment attempting to sell him a VCR.</p>

  </span></span> Second, the neighbour living directly above the deceased’s apartment 
  heard a single loud voice yelling and screaming, and the neighbour living below 
  his apartment heard a man crying “help, police” before the appellant emerged 
  from the deceased’s apartment.  This evidence suggests a one-sided confrontation 
  rather than a struggle between two people.  </p>

  </span></span> Third, if the jury did not accept the appellant’s evidence that 
  the deceased voluntarily brought out the false-bottomed Pledge can, it was a 
  reasonable inference that the appellant had managed to find the money in the 
  can by forcing the deceased to reveal its location.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, there was evidence that the appellant had controlled 
  the deceased’s movements while in the deceased’s apartment.  The appellant had 
  told a friend that he was able to move the deceased from the kitchen, where 
  his baby daughter was located.  At various points, the appellant held the deceased 
  by the face and managed to hold him over the sink.  The marks on the deceased’s 
  back, while consistent with falling backward onto the ground, were also consistent 
  with being restrained against the kitchen counter.  The deceased’s superficial 
  wounds to the face and neck were consistent with the appellant’s use of a knife 
  to dominate the deceased and inconsistent with the suggestion of a mutual struggle.  
  And the deceased’s hair swipes suggest that he moved or was moved from the kitchen 
  to the bedroom and en suite bathroom, and that he was lying down and either 
  kneeling or crouching at various points during this movement.  <b></b></p>

  </span></span> Viewing this evidence as a whole, it cannot be said that the 
  jury acted unreasonably in concluding that the deceased had been forcibly confined.  
  There is therefore no basis to interfere with the jury’s verdict on first degree 
  murder.  <b></b></p>
