  </span> This appeal concerns the measure of damages arising from the contamination 
  of the respondents’ property by a gasoline spill from the appellant’s neighbouring 
  gas station. For reasons reported at (2000), 35 R.P.R. (3d) 141, Binks J. assessed 
  the damages and granted judgment against Shell Canada Products Limited as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(a)       $550,000 for costs of remediation,</p>
    <p>(b)       $350,000 for loss of property value due to stigma associated 
      with the contamination,</p>
    <p>(c)       $25,000 plus prejudgment interest for mortgage financing costs,</p>
    <p>(d)       $20,000 for business interruption loss,</p>
    <p>(e)       a direction that the appellant remediate its own property or 
      in default pay the respondents $85,000 as the cost of a barrier between 
      the properties to prevent further leakage,</p>
    <p>(f)        dismissing a counterclaim asking that the recovery be paid into 
      court and used only for reparation of respondents’ property,</p>
    <p>(g)       prejudgment interest on (a) and (b) in the amount of $442,012.81, 
      and</p>
    <p>(h)       the costs of the proceeding.</p>

  </span> The appeal is against items (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g).  In descriptive 
  terms, the appellant says that the trial judge set too high a standard for remediating 
  the soil, should not have found any residual loss in property value after remediation, 
  should not have made a mandatory order against the appellant, should have protected 
  the appellant against the respondents’ potential failure to use the damages 
  award for reparation, and should not have awarded prejudgment interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>The Facts</u></b><u></u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I will refer to the appellant as Shell and the respondents as Tridan. 
  Shell has for some years operated a service station on Bank Street in Ottawa 
  adjacent to a car dealership operated by Tridan.  In September 1990, 9,000 liters 
  of gasoline leaked from an underground fuel line on Shell’s property.  At first 
  it was not known that fuel had in part escaped into the soil under Tridan’s 
  property. Shell undertook a remediation on its own property in accordance with 
  government standards applicable at the time.  Shell did not remove all of the 
  contaminated soil and the evidence indicates that about 3,000 liters of fuel 
  were unaccounted for. In 1991, Tridan discovered that some of the gasoline had 
  migrated into its soil, forming a plume about 14 feet below grade.  Shell accepts 
  responsibility for the required cleanup.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For reasons that have no bearing upon the issues on appeal, the dispute 
  over the extent of cleanup that was appropriate and the consequent costs and 
  damages did not come to trial until October 1999, nine years after the spill.  
  In the meantime, the car dealership carried on profitability but its mortgage 
  financing was threatened by the decreased mortgage value occasioned by the pollution. 
  Tridan faced increased interest charges and Shell, in an effort to minimize 
  its exposure to a claim for damages on that account, executed an indemnity agreement 
  with the mortgagee undertaking to pay for any necessary cleanup on demand by 
  the mortgagee.  The interest rate was consequently reduced to the normal rate 
  and that element of potential loss was avoided.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While the parties were wending their way to trial there were changes 
  occurring in oversight by the Ministry of Environment (MOE).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Several sets of MOE guidelines were in place during the period between 
  the spill and trial, but the two sets that are most commonly referred to by 
  the witnesses are the “Interim Guideline for the Remediation of Petroleum Contamination 
  at Operating Retail and Private Fuel Outlets in Ontario”, dated 1992 (“1992 
  MOE guideline”), and the “Guideline for Use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario”, 
  revised February 1997 (“1997 MOE guideline”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The 1997  MOE guideline currently applies. Its stated purpose is to 
  provide,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… advice and information to property owners and consultants to use when 
      assessing the environmental condition of a property, when determining whether 
      or not restoration is required, and in determining the kind of restoration 
      needed to allow continued use or reuse of the site.  The ministry has provided 
      the guideline, along with the supporting documentation, to assist landowners 
      in making decisions on soil and/or groundwater quality for proposed or existing 
      property uses.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Under the 1997 MOE guideline, the level of permissible pollutants varies 
  depending on whether the property is used for agricultural, residential or commercial 
  purposes.  The relevant criteria for land used for commercial purposes is set 
  out in Table B.  Within Table B, permissible concentration levels vary depending 
  on whether the groundwater is used for drinking purposes and on whether the 
  soil at the contaminated site is fine, medium or coarse.  Lower concentration 
  levels of pollutants are permitted for coarse grain soil, since pollutants can 
  travel more easily through coarse soil than fine soil.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> No one suggests that the guidelines supplant the common law standard 
  of compensation for injury to land. However, Shell asserts that the MOE guideline 
  represents a reasonable standard to apply to commercial lands that are contaminated 
  but unaffected for the purpose being served. The difference in cost between 
  meeting the 1997 MOE guideline and achieving a site which is clean of all contaminants, 
  referred to in the evidence as a pristine site, is approximately $250,000, mostly 
  referable to the amount of soil that must be removed and replaced.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Damages for Reparation 
  of the Tridan Property</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found that the plaintiffs were entitled to have their 
  property remediated to pristine condition and assessed the cost of doing so 
  at $550,000. Normally the assessment would be as of the date of the injury, 
  but in the circumstances of this case the trial judge chose to assess damages 
  as of the date of trial.  No one contested that approach because no work toward 
  reparation had taken place, the business of Tridan had continued throughout 
  and current MOE guidelines were being asserted as the standard. Thus, it made 
  sense for the trial judge to look to current costing information to arrive at 
  an assessment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge might have relied upon those expert witnesses supporting 
  the MOE guidelines as a reasonable measure of reparation and thus the damages 
  suffered.  This is a commercial property on a busy thoroughfare and unlikely 
  to ever be a site for residential use.  It might be concluded that in a practical 
  sense Tridan is not likely to need or want to clean its soil at depth of every 
  particle of pollutant.  However, in the circumstances of this case I cannot 
  say the trial judge erred in deciding that Tridan was entitled to reparation 
  to a pristine state. Where a product that may cause mischief escapes to a neighbour’s 
  property there is responsibility “for all the damage which is the natural consequence 
  of its escape.”  See <i>Rylands v. Fletcher</i>, [1861-73] All E.R. 1 at 7 (Ex. 
  Ch.), cited with approval at p. 13 (H.L.). Of course, they must be reasonable. 
  On all the evidence it is fair to conclude that the damages would not be eliminated 
  by reparations to the point of the MOE guidelines. There would be residual loss 
  of value, referred to as stigma, which would be reduced, as the trial judge 
  found, or eliminated, as I am about to find, by remediation to the pristine 
  level.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Stigma</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An analysis of all the evidence brings me to the conclusion that there 
  is no support for the trial judge’s conclusion that there is a residual reduction 
  of value in a pristine site caused by the knowledge that it was once polluted.  
  It would appear that the trial judge simply misapprehended the evidence of the 
  two principal witnesses for Tridan.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Gordon  Taylor from Royal LePage was qualified as an expert in commercial 
  real estate by the plaintiffs.  He testified as to stigma attaching to previously 
  polluted sites and estimated a reduction of 17% to 18% of fair market value 
  for this site if cleaned up to MOE guideline standards. His testimony was that 
  there would be no impact if in pristine condition.  He is consistent throughout 
  but the point is emphasized in cross-examination [Emphasis added]:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Q.        … [M]y understanding, sir, is that your opinion with respect 
      to the stigma that would attach to the property is based on the fact that 
      the property would be cleaned up to what you call Level II [under the relevant 
      MOE guideline]</p>
    <p>A.        That’s correct.</p>
    <p>Q.        But your view is that even if you cleaned it up, beyond that, 
      if there was any hydrocarbons on the property, it would still affect the 
      value; correct?</p>
    <p>A.        As opposed to being in pristine condition, you mean?</p>
    <p>Q.        Right?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes, it could.</p>
    <p>Q.        But here you are just looking at it from the purposes of cleaning 
      it up to the Level II?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes, I was asked to report what is the impact market value 
      [<i>sic</i>] between the Level II and pristine condition.</p>
    <p>Q.        So, if it is pristine, no impact?</p>
    <p>A.        That would be correct. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also relied upon another Tridan witness, Mr. Peter Boddy, 
  a qualified appraiser, who testified that even after a cleanup there would be 
  a 17% to 18% reduction in market value of the property. However, his report 
  and oral evidence makes it clear that he was assessing a cleanup to MOE standards.  
  In evidence he stated [Emphasis added]:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.        And then having said that, you then proceed to express an opinion 
      of what you think the stigma will be to the Donnelly site even after it 
      is cleaned up?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        And your opinion is based on the fact that it will be cleaned 
      up  to the applicable guidelines; is that correct?</p>
    <p>A.       Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        And by that, we are talking about the Ministry of the Environment 
      guidelines?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The references by the trial judge at pp. 158 and 159 of his reasons 
  to the evidence of Shell’s expert, Mr. Steven Granleese and the concessions 
  he made in cross-examination, do not suggest that stigma would attach to a site 
  cleaned to pristine condition.  Indeed, they make no mention of a pristine site 
  and make equal sense if it is assumed that the witness is referring to a cleanup 
  to MOE standards.  Granleese was called to refute Tridan’s evidence that stigma 
  attaches when the cleanup is to the MOE guideline level.  He was not dealing 
  with this specific property and whatever concession he may have made against 
  his original position, it cannot supplant the Tridan witnessses’ primary assertion  
  that there would be no impact on the value of this property if it was cleaned 
  to the pristine level.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In sum, the evidence compels me to conclude that there is no stigma 
  loss at the pristine cleanup level. This conclusion also makes sense of the 
  trial judge’s holding that cleanup to the pristine standard was justified in 
  this case. If the trial judge’s assessment of stigma damage at $350,000 is taken 
  as the diminution in value at cleanup to the guideline standard, then the more 
  economical route is to proceed to the pristine level at an additional cleanup 
  cost of $250,000 with no stigma damage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the only reasonable conclusion from the totality of the 
  evidence is that a pristine site has no residual loss of value and that paragraph 
  1 of the judgment should be amended to reduce the amount awarded by $350,000. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Shell to remediate its 
  own property</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was evidence that if Tridan excavated and replaced the soil on 
  its site, a barrier would be required to prevent further migration of the gasoline 
  that remains on the Shell site.  If both sites were cleaned at the same time, 
  the barrier would not be needed.  This led the trial judge to direct Shell to 
  remediate at the same time as Tridan or pay a further sum of $85,000, being 
  the estimated cost of a barrier. There is no basis for a mandatory injunction 
  against Shell and no reason to complicate Tridan’s remediation by joining it 
  with that on the Shell site.  It must be kept in mind that these damage recoveries 
  may never be invested on remediation. They are based on costs but are the equivalent 
  of a diminution in property value. A purchaser of the Tridan property in its 
  present form would probably reduce the offering price by, among other things, 
  $85,000 for a barrier when remediation is undertaken.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paragraph 6 of the judgment should be amended so that it reads as a 
  simple obligation to pay $85,000 and paragraph 7, providing for the notice of 
  intention to effect remediation, should be deleted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Counterclaim for payment 
  into court</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In order to avoid a substantial and ongoing claim for increased mortgage 
  interest charges occasioned by the pollution, Shell signed an indemnity in favour 
  of Tridan’s mortgagee undertaking to effect reparation on demand.  Its present 
  concern is that if the judgment award is paid to Tridan it may not be used for 
  remediation and Shell may have to pay twice should the mortgagee issue a demand. 
  To protect its position Shell asks that the reparation costs be paid into court 
  and released only as reparation is undertaken. Shell certainly has a problem, 
  but it is with a non-party to this litigation and a contract that is not before 
  the court for adjudication. An order for payment into court would not only abridge 
  Tridan’s right to deal with its damages as it sees fit, but would also place 
  the court in the position of overseeing the reparations and the satisfaction 
  of the requirements of the indemnity.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge allowed prejudgment interest for the 10 years prior 
  to judgment in the total amount of $442,012.81. Prejudgment interest is compensation 
  for being deprived of damages from the date they are suffered.  If damages are 
  paid on that date, the plaintiff receives the benefit of the money and its investment 
  value.  If not paid, as is the normal circumstance, an interest award is made.  
  Here, if Tridan had undertaken immediate reparation, that model would fit.  
  If the loss had been assessed on property values and costs in 1990, it would 
  fit.  If the respondents had not been able to run a successful business in the 
  interim, a claim for prejudgment interest might be justified. Yet on the actual 
  facts there would be a clear double recovery if prejudgment interest were awarded: 
  the assessment is in dollars current to the trial, Tridan has not suffered since 
  the spill, and the dollars are to be spent in the future.  If the costs of reparation 
  increase, postjudgment interest and investment income will cover the difference. 
  Section 128(4)(d) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. C.43 excludes 
  prejudgment interest on “pecuniary loss arising after the date of the order 
  and that is identified by a finding of the court.” The damages for remediation 
  of the Tridan property came within this exclusion and prejudgment interest should 
  not have been awarded on that amount.</p>
