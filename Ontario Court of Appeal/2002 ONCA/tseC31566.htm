  </span> The appellant, Wanda Tse (“Tse”), was charged with two counts of trafficking 
  in a narcotic, one count of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, 
  one count of possession, and one count of conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic.  
  At the jury trial, presided over by D. Cameron J., the trial judge dismissed 
  on a directed verdict the possession and possession for the purpose of trafficking 
  charges at the conclusion of the Crown’s case.  He did so on the basis that 
  there was insufficient evidence relating to the knowledge component of a possession 
  charge to force Tse to respond to these charges.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span> Tse appeals her convictions.  The principal issue raised by her appeal 
  is whether the trial judge erred in his jury charge by instructing the jury 
  that some of the evidence about the possession and possession for the purpose 
  of trafficking charges could nevertheless be considered by the jury in its deliberations 
  on the other counts in the indictment.  Specifically, did the trial judge’s 
  charge on this issue run afoul of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in <i>R. v. Grdic</i> (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 289 ?</p>

  </span> The appellant and her boyfriend, the co-accused Wai Hung Lau (“Lau”), 
  were charged with unlawfully conspiring with Cho Feng Wu (“Jay”) and with a 
  person or persons unknown, to traffic in heroin between October 24, 1996 and 
  February 6, 1997.  The appellant was also charged with trafficking in heroin 
  on two occasions, November 11 and December 17, 1996.  Lau was charged with trafficking 
  in heroin on November 28, 1996.  Finally, the appellant was charged with possession 
  and possession for the purpose of trafficking on February 6, 1997.  </p>

  </span> The November 11, 1996 drug transaction, which led to one trafficking 
  charge against Tse, involved the purchase of heroin by an undercover officer 
  from a man who identified himself as “Jay” and who the police believe was the 
  unindicted co-conspirator Wu.  Tse’s role was to deliver the heroin to Jay in 
  a car.  The undercover officer and a second officer who was conducting surveillance 
  at the time both identified Tse as the person who delivered the heroin to Jay.  
  The jury acquitted Tse of this charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The December 17, 1996 drug transaction, which led to the other trafficking 
  charge against Tse, involved the purchase of heroin by the same undercover officer 
  from Jay.  On this occasion, Jay went into a Dominion Store and returned with 
  the heroin.  An undercover officer saw Jay and a woman he identified as Tse 
  exchange a small package and money in the aisles of the Dominion Store.  He 
  was about 10 to 15 feet from Jay and Tse at the time of the exchange.  A second 
  officer identified Tse as a woman he followed for about two hours, including 
  to the plaza where the Dominion Store was located, on the evening in question.  
  A third officer stopped the car being driven by the woman under surveillance 
  shortly after the exchange in the Dominion Store.  The driver identified herself 
  as Wanda Tse.  The jury found Tse guilty of the trafficking charge relating 
  to the transaction on December 17, 1996.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On February 6, 1997, Tse and Lau were arrested as they were leaving 
  a house at 714 Ossington Street.  When she was arrested, Tse was carrying a 
  diaper bag.  Inside the bag was a stuffed bear with a zippered compartment.  
  The police found  $440 in this compartment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The house at 714 Ossington Street was the residence of Jonathan Lung, 
  Tse’s ex-husband.  Tse admitted in her testimony that she came to this house 
  often with her small daughter so that her ex-husband could maintain a close 
  relationship with his daughter.  Indeed, Tse would stay overnight at this house.  
  In 1996, Lau moved into the house and Tse became romantically involved with 
  him.  She began to sleep in his bedroom.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On February 6, 1997, the house at 714 Ossington Street was searched.  
  A small quantity of heroin, wrapped in foil, was found in the master bedroom 
  on the second floor.  In the dining room area, the police found a small plastic 
  container and two clear plastic baggies.  The baggies contained heroin.  In 
  the same plastic container, the police found a partially filled bottle of dextrose, 
  a pager and an electronic scale.  At the trial, there was expert evidence that 
  these items were commonly used in the heroin trafficking trade.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The possession and possession for the purpose of trafficking charges 
  against Tse related to the heroin found inside the house at 714 Ossington Street 
  on February 6, 1997.  At the trial, following the close of the Crown’s case, 
  the trial judge directed the jury to acquit Tse of these charges.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Later the same day, the jury sent this question to the trial judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Why were the charges relating to February the 6<sup>th</sup> eliminated?  
      If the jury is supposed to judge the case, why are these charges suddenly 
      off the table?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge responded in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I think I explained to you this morning when you came in that, as a matter 
      of law, I decided there was insufficient evidence to justify forcing Wanda 
      Tse to reply to the charges of possession of a narcotic or possession of 
      a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking with respect to the narcotics 
      found in the house.</p>
    <p>And possession has a legal and technical meaning, but it could have been 
      any number of people who possessed that drug, and it is not clear that there 
      is sufficient evidence there to force Wanda Tse to reply to them.  And it 
      was for that reason that I withdrew those charges.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the trial judge permitted the Crown, over the objection of 
  Tse’s counsel, to ask questions in her cross-examination of Tse about Tse’s 
  knowledge of the heroin and paraphernalia found inside the house at 714 Ossington 
  Street.  The matter was the subject of a fairly lengthy exchange between the 
  trial judge and defence counsel, Mr. Bawden.  The flavour of the exchange, and 
  the trial judge’s ruling, are reflected in these passages:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Bawden: </b>The Crown might otherwise have been inclined to cross-examine 
      Miss Tse as to her knowledge of the existence of the heroin either in the 
      bedroom or in the dining room.  </p>
    <p>And my position would be, inasmuch as she has been discharged on the basis 
      that the jury could not reasonably find that she was in possession of either, 
      then it would be an unfair line of cross-examination.</p>
    <p><b>The Court: </b>No, not on a charge of conspiracy.  She’s still facing 
      a charge of conspiracy.  She’s still facing two charges of trafficking.</p>
    <p><b>Mr.</b> <b>Bawden:</b> Well, at best then, I would submit that . . . 
      . .</p>
    <p><b>The Court: </b>I didn’t say she didn’t possess it.  I am saying that 
      the Crown has not presented sufficient evidence for her to be obliged to 
      respond to the charge.</p>
    <p>But, if she goes into the witness box, I think it’s perfectly proper for 
      the Crown to examine her on that issue either with respect to the substantive 
      offence of conspiracy, the substantive offence of trafficking on the 11<sup>th</sup> 
      of November or the 17<sup>th</sup> of December, or with respect to credibility.</p>
    <p align="center">. . . . .</p>
    <p><b>Mr. Bawden:</b> Once you have concluded though that she should be discharged 
      on those two counts, it constitutes a finding that there is no prima facie 
      case against her, that she’s&nbsp;. . . . . </p>
    <p><b>The Court: </b>As of this moment.</p>
    <p><b>Mr.</b> <b>Bawden:</b> Right.  How then would the Crown be justified 
      in suggesting to her:  “Wanda Tse, those drugs were yours and you knew that 
      they were there all along.”, when the trial judge has that very morning 
      made a finding that the jury could not reasonably make that finding.</p>
    <p><b>The Court: </b>Maybe the Crown is looking for an admission from Wanda 
      Tse.  If Wanda Tse says, “Yes, I admit I owned those drugs.  They were mine.  
      Nobody else knew about them.  They were mine.”  Well, it’s too late for 
      the Crown now.</p>
    <p><b>Mr. Bawden:</b> True.</p>
    <p><b>The Court:</b> Too late on the possession charge.  But the question 
      is totally relevant to the issue of did they agree in some way with one 
      other . . . one or more other people to traffic in heroin . . . . .</p>
    <p><b>Mr. Bawden:</b> Right.</p>
    <p><b>The Court:</b> . . . . . or did they, on the dates charged, traffic?  
      And surely it’s relevant to either of those to determine who controlled 
      that stuff, particularly the stuff downstairs in the dining room.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified at the trial.  She admitted to visiting the 
  house at 714 Ossington Street on many occasions, to leaving some of her clothing 
  there, and to sleeping with Lau in the master bedroom about once a week.  On 
  cross-examination, Tse denied that the heroin and paraphernalia found inside 
  the house belonged to her.  She also said that she was unaware that these items 
  were inside the house and that she did not know to whom they belonged.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The main issue on the four counts that proceeded to the jury was identity. 
  That is because another young Oriental woman, Amy Moy, testified that she was 
  the person who worked with Jay and distributed heroin to the undercover officer 
  on the dates in question.  She also testified that on the second occasion she 
  had been stopped driving Tse’s car and with Tse’s driver’s licence and identified 
  herself to the police as “Wanda Tse”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury brought back guilty verdicts on the conspiracy to traffic charge 
  and on the trafficking charge relating to the Dominion Store transaction.  The 
  jury acquitted the appellant on the trafficking charge relating to the delivery 
  of heroin by a woman in a car to Jay in a parking lot.  The probable reason 
  for the different verdicts was the fact that the identification evidence relating 
  to the woman in the Dominion Store (close range, clear view, coupled with surveillance 
  evidence before and after the transaction, including stopping the car and obtaining 
  the driver’s admission that she was Wanda Tse) was much stronger than the quick 
  views the two officers had of the woman involved in the parking lot transaction.</p>

  </span> In his jury charge, the trial judge dealt separately with the conspiracy 
  and trafficking counts in the indictment.  On the conspiracy count, he reviewed 
  in some detail many of the events that had taken place between October 24, 1996 
  and February 6, 1997.  He made a single reference to the heroin that had been 
  found inside the house at 714 Ossington Street on February 6, 1997, the day 
  Tse was arrested just outside the house.  After describing the arrest, the trial 
  judge continued:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Three hours later, the police, in execution of a search warrant, found 
      a small amount of heroin and tinfoil on top of a bookcase in Lau’s bedroom.  
      At the same time, another officer found a plastic container on a hutch in 
      the dining room which contained two plastic baggies which in turn contained 
      lumps of heroin.  The combined weights of the two finds of heroin was 12.76 
      grams.  The police found in or beside the plastic container a half-used 
      bottle of dextrose, tinfoil, and electronic scales.  Nearby was a pager.  
      Lung, Lau and Tse denied ownership or knowledge of the heroin.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by mentioning the 
  drugs found inside the house because he had already directed a verdict of acquittal 
  with respect to the two counts in the indictment relating to those drugs.  The 
  appellant submits that this component of the trial judge’s charge was contrary 
  to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Grdic, supra</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Grdic</i>, the appellant Grdic was tried on charges that on June 
  23, 1979 he drove while impaired and with a blood alcohol level over .08.  A 
  police constable testified that he had stopped Grdic at approximately 6:30 p.m.  
  A certificate of analysis was introduced to prove that Grdic had provided breath 
  samples at 7:30 and 7:50 p.m. and that the samples indicated a blood alcohol 
  level of .17.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Grdic testified that he had been stopped for impaired driving on June 
  23, but he denied that he was stopped at the time given by the constable.  His 
  testimony was that he was stopped at approximately noon, gave samples of his 
  breath at that time and was definitely home by 5:00 p.m.  Grdic’s daughter gave 
  evidence corroborating his testimony.  The Crown did not attempt to call anyone 
  in rebuttal.  The trial judge dismissed the charges.</p>

  </span> In June 1980, the appellant was tried on a charge that he had perjured 
  himself in his testimony at the previous trial.  At the perjury trial, the Crown 
  called the same police constable who had testified at the original trial and 
  other witnesses, who had not testified at the original trial, to corroborate 
  the constable’s version of the time at which Grdic had been stopped.  The trial 
  judge acquitted Grdic before he was required to elect whether to call evidence 
  on the basis of issue estoppel.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed 
  the appeal from this decision and ordered a new trial.</p>

  </span> The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal from the decision of 
  the British Columbia Court of Appeal and restored the acquittal.  Speaking for 
  a majority of the court, Lamer J. said, at pp. 293-94:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>There are not different kinds of acquittal and, on that point, I share 
      the view that “As a matter of fundamental policy in the administration of 
      the criminal law it must be accepted by the Crown in a subsequent criminal 
      proceeding that an acquittal is the equivalent to a finding of innocence”: 
      see Martin L. Friedland, <i>Double Jeopardy</i> (1969), Clarendon Press, 
      Oxford, p. 129, also Chitty, <i>i</i>, 648; <i>R. v. Plummer</i>, [1902] 
      2 K.B. 339 at 349.  To reach behind the acquittal, to qualify it, is, in 
      effect, to introduce the verdict of “not proven”, which is not, has never 
      been and should not be part of our law.</p>
    <p>If the trial judge did not believe the accused, as he was entitled to, 
      and his remarks might be construed as suggesting that he in fact did not 
      believe the accused, he should have entered a conviction.  Not having done 
      so, Grdic is entitled to the full benefit of his acquittal.</p>
    <p>However, this does not mean that, for the purpose of the application of 
      the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, the Crown is estopped from relitigating 
      all or any of the issues raised in the first trial.  But it does mean that 
      <i>any issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused 
      as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed to have been found 
      conclusively in favour of the accused. . . .   </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> I do not agree that <i>Grdic</i> required the trial judge in the present 
  case to make no mention of the drugs inside the house at 714 Ossington Street.  
  An important feature of <i>Grdic</i> is that there were two trials, with the 
  second being in effect an attempt to re-litigate the first.  However, that is 
  not the situation in this appeal.  The trial in the present case involved two 
  accused and a multi-count indictment.  The evidence concerning  those counts 
  overlapped to some extent.  The fact that the evidence could not sustain a conviction 
  on some counts against the appellant does not mean that it was irrelevant on 
  other counts relating to the appellant and her co-accused.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The house at 714 Ossington Street was central to the conspiracy counts 
  involving Tse and Lau.  There was a good deal of surveillance evidence about 
  activities at the house over the course of many months.  It would have been 
  strange and illogical for the jury to hear all of the evidence relating to that 
  location until the day the accused were arrested outside the house, but hear 
  nothing about what was found inside the house when the police conducted a lawful 
  search on the same day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the inapplicability of <i>Grdic</i> in a single proceeding 
  where there is overlapping evidence relating to multiple counts was clearly 
  articulated and explained by Cory J., for a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, 
  in <i>R. v. Arp</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 355-56:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . <i>I cannot accept the proposition that the principle set out in 
      Grdic, supra, applies to verdicts  rendered by the same trier of fact in 
      respect of charges tried together in a single proceeding.</i>  There is 
      nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable about a jury having reasonable 
      doubt whether the accused committed an act while also finding that it is 
      likely that he committed it.  There may very well be good reasons to exclude 
      similar fact evidence underlying a prior acquittal in a subsequent proceeding.  
      However, the principle has no application where the alleged similar acts 
      are the subject of a multi-count indictment.    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Similar reasoning is found in this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Gassyt</i> 
  (1998), 127 C.C.C.(3d) 546.  In that case, two accused were charged with three 
  counts of conspiracy to commit murder.  At the close of the Crown’s case, the 
  trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on two of the counts.  There was 
  a good deal of overlapping evidence relating to the three counts. Charron J.A. 
  said, at pp. 562-63:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I do not think it can seriously be maintained that any of the evidence 
      which directly pertained to counts one and three was inadmissible on count 
      two. Had the trial proceeded from the beginning on count two alone, I would 
      expect that much the same evidence would have been called.  Most of it was 
      essential to provide the context for the evidence of the second meeting 
      which, everyone agrees, forms the core of the evidence on count two.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this reasoning applies in the present case.  A good deal 
  of the Crown case on the conspiracy charges against Tse and Lau centred on activities 
  at the house at 714 Ossington Street.  In her own testimony, Tse admitted and 
  explained her regular visits to the house.  The evidence of what the police 
  found inside the house, pursuant to a lawful search, on the day Tse and Lau 
  were arrested just outside the house was relevant evidence on the conspiracy 
  charge.  This becomes particularly clear if one removes from the analysis, as 
  Charron J.A. suggested in <i>Gassyt</i>, the existence of the other charges.  
  Applying her analysis to the present case, if Tse had not been charged with 
  offences in relation to the drugs found inside the house on February 6, 1997, 
  there could be no challenge to the use of that evidence at a trial on a single 
  count of conspiracy to traffic.  The existence of the other charges, including 
  the verdicts of acquittal, does not change the situation; the evidence is still 
  relevant and admissible on the conspiracy counts in the indictment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant advances an alternative argument on this issue, namely, 
  that the trial judge should have given a limiting instruction about how the 
  evidence could be used.  It is true that such an instruction has been suggested: 
  see <i>Arp</i> at p. 356 and <i>Gassyt</i> at p. 563.  However, I do not think 
  that the absence of such an instruction is fatal in this case.  I reach this 
  conclusion for three reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the impugned portion of the trial judge’s charge was an exceedingly 
  small component of the evidence reviewed by the trial judge on the conspiracy 
  count.  It was also descriptive in nature and mentioned Lau by name, not Tse.  
  Second, unlike in <i>Gassyt</i>, there was not an almost complete overlap in 
  the evidence between the different charges.  There was no realistic possibility 
  that the jury would seize upon this isolated paragraph, in which Tse is not 
  mentioned, and embark on a forbidden line of reasoning.  Third, trial counsel 
  did not object to the trial judge’s charge on this issue: see <i>Gassyt</i> 
  at p. 564.</p>

  the conspiracy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  The trial judge instructed the jury that it could only 
  “consider J.’s statements made to Mancuso in furtherance of the conspiracy, 
  that is, <i>statements made to promote or bring about the object of the conspiracy 
  to traffic in heroin</i>”. [Emphasis added.]  In my view, this instruction adequately 
  conveyed the meaning of the “in furtherance” requirement.  Moreover, defence 
  counsel at trial did not object to any perceived deficiency in this instruction.</p>

  </span> In his charge to the jury, the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Lau and Tse were arrested, they were in the Honda on Crawford Street 
      having just left 714 Ossington.  Tse’s seventeen-month old daughter  was 
      with them.  Tse had a purse.  She also had a separate carry-all bag with 
      things for the child.  In it was a stuffed bear which contained $440 in 
      a zippered compartment.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that in this passage the trial judge invited 
  the jury to speculate as to the source of the money and the reasons for carrying 
  it inside the stuffed animal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I disagree.  The entire passage is descriptive of the circumstances 
  relating to Tse’s arrest.  I see no invitation about anything to the jury in 
  this passage.  Moreover, I note that Detective Chase, the drug squad officer 
  who seized the money, testified that there was no reason to believe that the 
  money came from the commission of any offence.  Finally, again I observe that 
  defence counsel at trial did not object to this component of the jury charge.</p>
