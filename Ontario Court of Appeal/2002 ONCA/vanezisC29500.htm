  </span></span> The appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of Pamela 
  Bonn after a trial before Glithero J. and a jury.  Pamela Bonn was beaten to 
  death in May 1995.  The central issue at trial was the identity of her killer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown’s case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial.  
  There was no evidence of motive or even evidence that the appellant knew the 
  deceased.  It was admitted at trial that the murder occurred in the appellant’s 
  apartment.  The deceased’s body was found in a nearby park.  The Crown led evidence 
  that a man resembling the appellant was seen pushing a recycling bin from the 
  apartment building to the park.  The appellant was found at his apartment shortly 
  after the movement of the recycling bin.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant 
  committed the murder and moved the body in the recycling bin.  The appellant 
  testified at trial denying any involvement in the murder. </p>

  </span></span> On appeal to this court, the appellant raised a number of grounds 
  of appeal and also made an application to introduce fresh evidence.  When the 
  appeal was heard, we dealt first with the application to introduce fresh evidence.  
  At the conclusion of that argument, we announced our decision that the fresh 
  evidence should be admitted and a new trial ordered.  Counsel agreed that in 
  those circumstances it was not necessary to deal with the remaining grounds 
  of appeal.  Our brief reasons for admitting the fresh evidence follow.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant applied to introduce three items of fresh evidence.  
  Two items were DNA evidence relating to the clothing and body of the deceased.   
  Forensic examination had found three blood stains on the blue jeans that the 
  deceased was wearing when her body was found, and a swab had been taken of a 
  substance, later found to be saliva, from the area around the deceased’s left 
  nipple.  Although DNA analysis of one of the blood stains and of the saliva 
  were attempted prior to trial, there was insufficient DNA present to obtain 
  a result with the technology available at the time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the trial, the appellant’s counsel asked the Centre for 
  Forensic Sciences to conduct further DNA testing using new DNA technology.  
  DNA results were obtained for a previously untested blood stain and for the 
  saliva sample.  The blood stain was found to have a mixed DNA profile.  The 
  dominant profile matched the deceased and the subordinate profile came from 
  at least one male.  The appellant was excluded as a potential source of the 
  subordinate male profile, and the Crown conceded that the likely source was 
  Jeffrey Hertel, a man who had a relationship with the deceased and whom the 
  appellant had advanced at trial as an alternative perpetrator of the crime.  
  The saliva sample excluded both the appellant and Hertel as potential sources.</p>

  </span></span> The third item of fresh evidence related to scabs found on the 
  appellant’s hands at the time of his arrest.  The Crown suggested at trial that 
  the appellant had wounded his hands while beating the deceased, and that the 
  appellant’s scabs were signs of early healing of his wounds.  However, the appellant 
  testified that the scabs were the result of having scraped his hands on a cement 
  ashtray outside a hospital when scavenging for cigarette butts.  The Crown introduced 
  police photographs purporting to depict all ashtrays outside the hospital and 
  put the photographs to the appellant in cross-examination.  None of the ashtrays 
  shown in the photographs were made of cement and all had smooth linings.  However, 
  following the trial, the appellant obtained evidence from hospital employees 
  indicating that there had likely been cement ashtrays in the location suggested 
  by the appellant at the relevant time.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 4981 
  at para. 70, Simmons J.A. summarized the general principles governing the admission 
  of fresh evidence as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The general principles applicable to the admission of fresh evidence are 
      well established.  They are as follows:</p>
    <p>*          Section 683 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> permits an appellate 
      court to accept “fresh evidence” where it is in the interests of justice 
      to do so.</p>
    <p>*          The interests of justice include an interest in preventing miscarriages 
      of justice by having guilt determined based on all of the available evidence, 
      and also an interest in the integrity of the criminal process to which finality 
      and order are essential.</p>
    <p>*          The importance of finality to the integrity of the criminal 
      process clearly requires that special grounds be shown before fresh evidence 
      is admitted.  Fresh evidence must not be admitted as a matter of course.</p>
    <p>*          The four criteria for determining whether it is in the interest 
      of justice that fresh evidence be admitted are set out in <i>Palmer </i>[<i>R. 
      v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759]:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, 
        it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle 
        will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases;</p>
      <p> ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears on a 
        decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
      <p> iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably 
        capable of belief; and</p>
      <p> iv.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken 
        with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected 
        the result.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>*          Satisfaction of the first <i>Palmer</i> criterion is not a condition 
      precedent to admissibility of fresh evidence, but rather one factor to be 
      considered in determining whether the interests of justice warrant its admission.</p>
    <p>*          The second, third, and fourth <i>Palmer</i> criteria are conditions 
      precedent to admissibility of fresh evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the DNA evidence, the Crown concedes that the 
  due diligence criterion has been met and that the evidence is credible.  The 
  Crown submits, however, that the evidence does not bear on a decisive or a potentially 
  decisive issue at trial and that, when taken with all of the other evidence 
  adduced at trial, the DNA evidence could not reasonably be expected to have 
  affected the result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the evidence regarding the ashtrays, 
  the Crown concedes that the evidence is credible, but submits that none of the 
  three other <i>Palmer </i>criteria have been met.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are unable to accept the Crown’s submissions.  We are satisfied 
  that the DNA evidence meets all four <i>Palmer </i>criteria. The issue at trial 
  was the identity of the killer.  The Crown’s case against the appellant was 
  anything but overwhelming.  An earlier trial had resulted in a hung jury.  The 
  new DNA evidence, which might have inculpated the appellant, failed to connect 
  him to the deceased’s body or clothing.  The probable source of the DNA sample 
  from the blood stain was a boyfriend of the deceased and the very man suggested 
  by the appellant as an alternative suspect.   While the Crown suggests that 
  this man’s DNA could have found its way to the deceased’s blue jeans in some 
  other manner, we do not accept the Crown’s submission that this possibility 
  effectively explains away the potential significance of the fresh DNA evidence.  
  In our view, the appellant has made a sufficient case that, when taken with 
  the other evidence adduced at trial, this fresh evidence could reasonably be 
  expected to have affected the result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We are also satisfied that the evidence regarding the ashtrays 
  meets the <i>Palmer </i>criteria.  While this evidence could have been obtained 
  at trial through due diligence, courts have held that the due diligence criterion 
  is not absolute, but represents only one factor, the absence of which is not 
  necessarily fatal.  In <i>R. v. Warsing</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada held that evidence should be admitted even if it fails to meet 
  the due diligence criterion, if the evidence is compelling and the interests 
  of justice require that it be admitted.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the fresh evidence regarding the ashtrays may be less 
  compelling than the DNA evidence, the evidence might well have had an effect 
  on the jury’s conclusion.  The police photographs likely adversely affected 
  the appellant’s credibility in the eyes of the jury by suggesting that the appellant 
  was not telling the truth with respect to the presence of the cement ashtrays.  
  The fresh evidence bolsters the appellant’s explanation of what the jury might 
  otherwise have seen as incriminating evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In our view, taken as a whole, and considered 
  in light of all of the other evidence in the case, the three items of fresh 
  evidence are relevant and could reasonably be expected to have affected the 
  result in this case.</span></p>
