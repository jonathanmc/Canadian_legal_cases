  </span></span> The appellant suffers from AIDS and requires marihuana for medicinal 
  purposes to combat wasting syndrome and chemotherapy-induced nausea.  For years, 
  the appellant has fought for the right to possess marihuana legally.  He believes 
  that officials in the federal Ministry of Health have not been sufficiently 
  attentive to his need for this medication.  After an application to LaForme 
  J., which resulted in an order for a temporary constitutional exemption from 
  the operation of the possession and cultivation provisions of the <i>Controlled 
  Drugs and Substances Act</i>, the Minister of Health gave the appellant an exemption 
  under s. 56 of the Act.  The appellant is not satisfied with this exemption.  
  He believes it is too narrow because it does not exempt his caregivers from 
  liability.  He also believes that the federal government has a duty to make 
  medicinal marihuana available to him, and other very sick people, and that the 
  government is dragging its feet.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appellant applied to the Superior Court of Justice 
  for a declaration that his rights under s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms</i> have been infringed.  Because of this infringement, the appellant 
  sought an order under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> declaring that any 
  individual serving as a caregiver to him are exempt from the operation of the 
  possession, trafficking and cultivation provisions of the <i>Controlled Drugs 
  and Substances Act</i> while engaged in assisting with his medicinal needs. 
   This exemption was to be temporary, being operative until such time as the 
  Government of Canada established a meaningful and effective programme for the 
  distribution of marihuana to the appellant.  Second, the appellant applied for 
  an order directing the government to provide and make available to him a safe, 
  secure and affordable supply of marihuana to be used for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Wright J. dismissed the application.  He held that the caregiver 
  application was an attempt to review a decision by the Minister of Health under 
  s. 56 of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i> and was therefore a 
  matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court under s. 18(1) 
  of the <i>Federal Court Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As to the application for an order that the government supply 
  marihuana, the applications judge found that the appellant “has no real difficulty 
  obtaining marihuana for medicinal purposes and is not dependent on Government 
  to supply him with marihuana” and that he had not established a violation of 
  his rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In any event, the applications 
  judge found that any infringement of the appellant’s rights to liberty and security 
  of the person is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  
  Accordingly, the appellant had failed to establish any violation of s. 7 of 
  the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The court first heard the appeal from this disposition in March 
  2001.  The court reserved its decision.  Shortly after the oral hearing, the 
  Minister of Health announced that draft regulations had been prepared to deal 
  with the medicinal use of marihuana as a result of this court’s decision in 
  <i>R. v. Parker</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 193.  The court invited the parties 
  to adduce further evidence and make further written submissions concerning these 
  regulations.  The parties agreed that this material would be submitted after 
  the regulations were finalized and promulgated at the end of July 2001.  We 
  have now received that material and it is summarized below.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant was first diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1989.  Since 
  that time he has undergone chemotherapy that produces debilitating side effects, 
  including nausea and loss of appetite.  The appellant has tried different medications 
  to relieve these side effects but finds that smoking marihuana provides the 
  best relief for him.  He uses marihuana, under a physician’s supervision, to 
  combat nausea and to stimulate appetite.  He believes that conventional medication 
  has not been effective.  In particular, Marinol, a synthetic and legally available 
  version of one of the active ingredients in marihuana causes side effects that 
  can be virtually unbearable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s medical condition is variable.  At times it is 
  stable; at times he is in crisis.  Sometimes he must spend the entire day in 
  bed.  He is on a demanding drug regime that requires him to take 12 different 
  medications and 7 nutritional supplements.  In total, he takes more than 26 
  drug doses at intervals throughout the day.  Since some of his medication must 
  be taken in relation to food intake, the appellant’s meal times are highly regimented. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In May 1999, LaForme J. granted the appellant an interim constitutional 
  exemption from the applicability and operation of ss. 4 and 7 of the <i>Controlled 
  Drugs and Substances Act</i>.  These sections prohibit the possession and production 
  (cultivation) of various drugs including marihuana.  The exemption was to remain 
  in force until such time as the Minister of Health decided upon the appellant’s 
  application under s. 56 of the Act.  Section 56 provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>56. The Minister may, on such terms and conditions as 
      the Minister deems necessary, exempt any person or class of persons or any 
      controlled substance or precursor or any class thereof from the application 
      of all or any of the provisions of this Act or the regulations if, in the 
      opinion of the Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical or scientific 
      purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On June 9, 1999, Health Canada granted an exemption to the appellant.  
  The exemption allowed him to possess and cultivate marihuana for medicinal purposes.  
  From the appellant’s point of view this exemption is deficient in at least two 
  respects.  First, it only applies to his personal use and cultivation.  At times, 
  he is dependent upon caregivers to provide him with marihuana and to assist 
  him in growing it.  Second, while he successfully grew and harvested some marihuana 
  in the summer of 1999, the appellant is still dependent upon the illicit market 
  for supplies. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant states that some of his caregivers have been charged 
  with trafficking in marihuana as a result of their attempts to assist him.  
  Other caregivers have risked criminal prosecution to assist him in cultivating 
  his crop of marihuana.  The appellant states that it causes him grief and anxiety 
  to put other persons in danger so that he may be supplied with medicine. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Some explanation of the appellant’s use of the term “caregivers” 
  is required.  The appellant applies the term to anyone who provides him with 
  marihuana for medicinal use.  As we understand it, this would include friends 
  who obtain or grow marihuana for the appellant.  However, from the appellant’s 
  point of view, the term would also include persons who deal in marihuana to 
  the public generally.  When they sell marihuana to the appellant, they fall 
  within the caregiver category.  The appellant estimated that approximately 50 
  individuals and organizations have assisted him by supplying marihuana to him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In cross-examination on his affidavit filed in support of the 
  application, the appellant testified that he uses approximately one ounce of 
  marihuana a month.  He has been able to purchase this amount at a cost averaging 
  $300 per ounce.  The appellant conceded that he has been able to purchase the 
  marihuana he needs from one source or another since he began using it in relation 
  to his illness.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As we have indicated, the appellant has, with assistance, cultivated 
  a crop of marihuana.  He did this on the balcony of his apartment in the summer 
  of 1999.  He does not believe that he is able to cultivate marihuana indoors.  
  He lacks the funds and probably the expertise to mount a hydroponics operation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Almost from the time the appellant obtained his exemption, he 
  has raised concerns with the Minister about its adequacy.  He or his counsel 
  have written to the Minister or his officials repeatedly to voice concerns that 
  his caregivers risk prosecution.  Thus, in a letter dated June 14, 1999 to the 
  Minister of Health, the appellant wrote:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The exemption falls far short of what I asked the courts to grant.  You 
      have not granted me access to marijuana and you have given no protection 
      from criminal sanction for my caregivers.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He has complained to the Minister and to the Minister of Justice 
  that there is no policy to protect people from prosecution when they are supplying 
  him and other s. 56 exemptees with marihuana.  The Minister of Health and his 
  officials have indicated that they are studying the issue of caregivers.  The 
  appellant believes that he has never obtained a satisfactory answer from the 
  Minister’s officials.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant has also raised with the Minister the lack of a 
  safe supply of marihuana.  The appellant has complained that the Ministry has 
  failed to take advantage of legal sources of medicinal marihuana from the United 
  Kingdom and the United States.  At the time of the application, Health Canada 
  had indicated that it was embarking on a process for the domestic cultivation 
  of medicinal marihuana.  It was unclear when this source would be available 
  and whether the appellant would be eligible to receive it since the indication 
  was the marihuana would only be used in clinical trials.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the conclusion of his cross-examination, the appellant made 
  a statement that explains the purpose of his application.  It begins as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Today is March 20, 2000.  Years have gone by and the players have changed, 
      but my case remains.  I seek safe, clean, affordable, high-quality, Canadian 
      marijuana for medical purposes.  I seek compassionate access, and immunity 
      for care-givers and care-providers.</p>
    <p>I now share this experience with twenty-one other Canadians that I know 
      of, who are also Section 56 exemptees.  We have been treated recklessly 
      and cruelly by the Federal Government.  We have been misled by the Health 
      Minister’s statements in June 1999, when the Health Minister made a commitment 
      to the Canadian public in a news release, and also in the House of Commons 
      in March 1999.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The June 1999 statement by the Health Minister

  1999 press release:</span></p>

  new s. 56 exemption.  This exemption included stricter conditions on the amount 
  of marihuana that the appellant could produce and possess at one time and was 
  for only 6 months. </p>

  is a member of the board of the Clinical Research Initiative of Toronto.  The 
  Initiative is developing the first clinical cannabis study in Canada.  The study

  A particular problem is that Health Canada has been unable or unwilling to supply 
  medicinal marihuana to be used in the study.  </p>

  in the Communications Directorate of Health Canada.  She attached several press 
  releases and information sheets that indicate announcements from Health Canada 
  about its attempts to establish a Canadian source for medicinal marihuana and 
  the new regulatory approach for Canadians to access marihuana for medical purposes.  
  In view of the new regulations discussed below, we will only summarize the materials 
  concerning a Canadian source for medicinal marihuana.  In short, the Minister 
  of Health announced in December 2000 that a contract had been awarded to a Canadian 
  company to provide Health Canada with a source of affordable, quality, standardized 
  marihuana to meet medical and research needs.  It was estimated that it would 
  take a year before this marihuana would be available.</p>

  </span></span> The <i>Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</i>, SOR 2001-227 
  came into force on July 30, 2001.  The regulations define the circumstances 
  in which patients and caregivers will be authorized by the Minister to possess 
  and cultivate marihuana.  We do not propose to summarize the effect of the regulations 
  or their apparent operation.  It is possible that cases will arise in the future 
  where the validity or operation of the regulations will be in issue.  Suffice 
  it to say that the parties dispute the efficacy of the regulations in making 
  medicinal marihuana available to patients who require it.  At the time the affidavits 
  were filed, no one had actual experience with the regulatory scheme.  The affidavits 
  were therefore somewhat speculative.  The appellant’s affidavits also raise 
  questions about the government’s plan to grow marihuana for medicinal use.  
  The concerns raised in the appellant’s affidavits may be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)        the caregiver exemption is too narrow because it only applies 
      where the caregiver prepares the dosage of marihuana or physically assists 
      the patient in ingesting the marihuana;</p>
    <p>(ii)       a person cannot be a designated-person producer if he or she 
      has been found guilty, within the previous ten years, of a designated drug 
      offence;</p>
    <p>(iii)     a designated-person producer cannot receive any payment for growing, 
      nor grow marihuana for more than one authorized person;</p>
    <p>(iv)      the holder of a designated-person production license must maintain 
      detailed records and these records are subject to inspection by an inspector 
      who may enter any place, except a dwelling house, for that purpose;</p>
    <p>(v)       it may be difficult for some people who require marihuana for 
      medicinal purposes to meet the requirement that they obtain a declaration 
      from a specialist, especially since physician associations such as the Canadian 
      Medical Association do not support the regulations;  one of the appellant’s 
      physician witnesses described the specialist requirement as a tremendous 
      barrier to access to medicinal marihuana;  the specialist requirement may 
      be particularly problematic in rural areas;</p>
    <p>(vi)      physicians required to make the declaration in support of an 
      application for an exemption may find it difficult to comply with the detailed 
      requirements such as specifying the dosage;</p>
    <p>(vii)     while Prairie Plant Systems has been contracted by the government 
      to grow marihuana, it appears that the marihuana will only be made available 
      for medical research and clinical trials;</p>
    <p>(viii)    Health Canada is unable to say what the quality of the marihuana 
      produced by Prairie Plant Systems will be, since the seeds are of unknown 
      origin seized by police.</p>

  </span></span> With respect to the application for a caregiver’s exemption, 
  the applications judge stated that it was not clear whether the Minister had 
  dealt with this request.  He also stated that there was no evidence that a named 
  person who is a caregiver to the appellant had applied for an exemption.  In 
  any event, he held that anything to do with the Minister of Health granting 
  or failing to grant exemptions under s. 56 of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act</i> concerns the administration of the Act.  Therefore, any problem concerning 
  the obtaining of a caregiver exemption falls within the exclusive jurisdiction 
  of the Federal Court of Canada.</p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to government supply of marihuana, the applications 
  judge held that the Federal Court and the Superior Court of Justice had concurrent 
  jurisdiction to consider this part of the application.  He reasoned that since 
  the Act does not deal with the supply of drugs by the Government, the issue 
  did not concern the administration of the Act.  He held, however, that since 
  the applicant is allowed to possess and cultivate marihuana, his rights to liberty 
  and security of the person were not infringed.  Based on the record and particularly 
  the cross-examination referred to above, the applications judge found that, 
  “Mr. Wakeford has no real difficulty in obtaining marihuana for medicinal purposes 
  and is not dependent on Government to supply him with marijuana”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if there was an infringement of the appellant’s right to 
  liberty or security of the person, the applications judge found that this infringement 
  was in accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  He found as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view the Government is acting reasonably in planning to have Mr. 
      Wakeford and others participate in clinical trials rather than to supply 
      marijuana directly to exemptees.  Because we are all individuals the benefits 
      of a particular medication for one person may be of no benefit to another 
      and may even be harmful.  There are risks to using marijuana.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He also found that the appellant had not exhausted other possibilities 
  that may be equally as effective as marihuana.  The applications judge concluded 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In view of the fact that the Government does not have, 
      within Canada, a source of licit marijuana, and that the Government is moving 
      at a reasonable pace to provide clinical trials of marijuana, and that Mr. 
      Wakeford has no real difficulty in obtaining marijuana, and that marijuana 
      is not the only avenue by which Mr. Wakeford may improve his quality of 
      life, the principles of fundamental justice are not infringed by the failure 
      of the Government to supply marijuana directly to Mr. Wakeford.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>To be in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
      justice does not mandate a perfect system of government which is required 
      to meet the desires and demands of its citizens even in the area of personal 
      health.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>This is not the type of case in which the court should 
      take the extraordinary step of requiring the Government to do anything, 
      especially to require the Government to supply marijuana directly to the 
      applicant.</span></p>

  </span></span> As we understand it, the jurisdiction issue applies only to the 
  question of a caregiver exemption.  We do not understand the respondent to disagree 
  with the applications judge’s holding that he had jurisdiction to determine 
  the supply question.  The issue arises because of s. 18 of the <i>Federal Court 
  Act</i>, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>18. (1) Subject to section 28, the Trial Division has 
      exclusive original jurisdiction</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>(a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari, writ of

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent supports the applications judge’s holding that 
  the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction because the appellant’s application 
  concerned the administration of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In order to deal with the jurisdiction issue, it is necessary 
  to properly characterize the appellant’s application concerning a caregiver 
  exemption.  The respondent characterizes the appellant’s application as a challenge 
  to “the Minister’s administrative action and the exercise or the refusal to 
  exercise his discretion pursuant to valid federal legislation, namely, s. 56 
  of the <i>CDSA</i>”.  Since the Minister or his delegates are acting as a “federal 
  board, commission or other tribunal” within the meaning of s. 2 of the <i>Federal 
  Court Act</i>, it follows, says the respondent, that the Federal Court has exclusive 
  jurisdiction.  In our view this is not a completely accurate characterization 
  of the appellant’s application.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the core of the appellant’s application is the unavailability 
  of a safe secure source of marihuana to treat the symptoms of his illness.  
  Because of that unavailability the appellant claims he must rely upon caregivers.  
  It is not apparent, however, that the appellant’s claim is solely a disguised 
  attempt to review the Minister’s administration of s. 56 of the Act.  The order 
  requested is said to be pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Any individual serving in the capacity as a caregiver to the Appellant, 
      who directly or indirectly commits an offence under s. 4 (possession), s. 
      5 (trafficking or possession for the purpose) and s. 7 (production), is 
      exempt from the operation of these provisions if the offence was committed 
      while engaged in assisting the Appellant with his medical needs.  This exemption 
      is operative until such time as the Government of Canada establishes a meaningful 
      and effective program for the distribution of cannabis sativa to the Appellant.</p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Since the appellant invokes s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, he 
  must first establish a violation of his rights.  In this case, the appellant 
  alleges a violation of s. 7 of the Charter.  Although not expressly sought as 
  part of the order requested it is implicit that the appellant also seeks a declaration 
  that his rights under s. 7 have been violated.  This s. 7 violation arguably 
  has three sources:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)       The failure of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i> 
      to provide an exemption for caregivers to the appellant; </p>
    <p>(2)       The failure of the Minister of Health to provide the appellant 
      a sufficiently broad exemption under s. 56 to protect his caregivers; or</p>
    <p>(3)       The failure of the Minister of Health to provide to the appellant’s 
      caregivers a s. 56 exemption.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>While we will deal with each in turn, it is 
  our view that the first source of the s. 7 violation is not a matter exclusively 
  within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.</span></p>

  </span></span> We are of the view that the provincial superior court had jurisdiction 
  to consider whether the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i> violates 
  the appellant’s s. 7 rights because it does not provide a caregiver exemption.  
  While administrative action or, more correctly, inaction led the appellant to 
  the courts, he does not in this aspect of the case seek a review of such action.  
  He claims that the Act in its operation violates his rights.  In our view, the 
  holding in <i>Canada Labour Relations Board et al. v. Paul L’Anglais Inc. et 
  al.</i> (1983), 146 D.L.R. (3<sup>rd</sup>) 202 (S.C.C.), although arising in 
  a division of powers context, can apply to this case.  In that case Gonthier 
  J. relied upon <i>A.-G. Can. et al. v. Law Society of British Columbia et al.; 
  Jabour v. Law Society of British Columbia et al.</i> (1982), 137 D.L.R. (3d) 
  1 (S.C.C.), where the Court held that s. 18 of the <i>Federal Court Act</i> 
  could not oust the inherent jurisdiction of the provincial superior court to 
  declare a federal enactment <i>ultra vires</i>.  As to the argument that the 
  <i>Law Society </i>case did not apply, Gonthier J. said the following at p. 
  213:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I do not see any difference in this context between constitutionality 
      and applicability: both relate to constitutional jurisdiction. In the first 
      instance, a provision is <i>ultra vires</i> and must be set aside. In the 
      second, a provision which is otherwise valid and applicable within the jurisdictional 
      ambit of the Legislature which adopted it, becomes inapplicable when it 
      trenches on the field of jurisdiction of the other legislative power. Parliament 
      has a perfect right to enact that the superintending and reforming power 
      over federal agencies, acting in the administration of the laws of Canada, 
      understood in the sense defined above, will be exercised exclusively by 
      the Federal Court, a court created for the better administration of those 
      laws. <u>However, it cannot confer such an exclusive power on the Federal 
      Court when what is involved is no longer the administration of a law of 
      Canada, but the interpretation and application of the Constitution</u>. 
                                       [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The <i>Law Society</i> and <i>Paul L’Anglais Inc.</i> cases were 
  applied by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the <i>Charter</i> context 
  in <i>Lavers v. British Columbia (Minister of Finance</i>) (1989), 64 D.L.R. 
  (4<sup>th</sup>) 193.  As the court pointed out, the <i>Charter of Rights and 
  Freedoms</i> is as much a part of the Constitution as are the division of powers 
  sections of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>.  Speaking for a five-person court 
  on this issue, Lambert J.A. found at p. 201 that the holdings in those cases 
  are not confined to cases of total unconstitutionality as opposed to cases of 
  the unconstitutional application of otherwise constitutional legislation.  Thus, 
  the superior court has jurisdiction to grant a declaration on <i>Charter</i> 
  grounds that a federal enactment violates a party’s rights and to grant an appropriate 
  remedy.  That said, it might well be that the provincial superior court and 
  the Federal Court have concurrent jurisdiction to consider this aspect of the 
  application.  Whether the applications judge should have declined jurisdiction 
  therefore depends upon application of the factors discussed in <i>Reza v. Canada</i> 
  (1994), 116 D.L.R. (4th) 61 (S.C.C.) at 68:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Ontario Court (General Division) and the Federal Court 
      had concurrent jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application but, under 
      s. 106 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, any judge of the General Division 
      had a discretion to stay the proceedings. <u>Ferrier J. properly exercised 
      his discretion on the basis that Parliament had created a comprehensive 
      scheme of review of immigration matters and the Federal Court was an effective 
      and appropriate forum</u>. In view of our decision in <i>Kourtessis v. M.N.R.</i> 
      (1993), 102 D.L.R. (4th) 456, 81 C.C.C. (3d) 286, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, this

  the court’s discretion to refuse to grant declaratory relief:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It by no means follows, however, that the declaratory judgment should be 
      widely used as a separate collateral procedure to, in effect, create an 
      automatic right of appeal where Parliament has, for sound policy reasons, 
      refused to do so. It must be remembered that the inherent power of the courts 
      to declare laws invalid is a discretionary one, and that discretion must 
      be used on a proper basis. If the power is routinely used whenever any particular 
      step in a criminal proceeding is thought to be unconstitutional, it would 
      result in bringing through the back door all the problems Parliament sought 
      to avoid by restricting appeals.  <u>The policy concern against allowing 
      declarations, even of unconstitutionality, as a separate and overriding 
      procedure is that they will, in many cases, result in undesirable procedural 
      overlap and delay. As long as a reasonably effective procedure exists for

  discretion, it is for this court to make that determination.  In our view, this 
  would have been a proper case to assume jurisdiction.  This is not a case like 
  <i>Reza</i> where Parliament has established a comprehensive scheme of review 
  of proceedings in which the Federal Court has a particular expertise.  Although 
  this declaration is brought under the civil rules, it concerns the application 
  of the criminal law, a matter over which the provincial superior courts have 
  the expertise.  Finally, at least at the time of the application, the appellant 
  had not been charged with any offence under the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act</i>.  Thus, he could not bring his challenge to the application of the legislation

  is that the Minister refused to exempt the appellant’s caregivers under s. 56, 
  this too concerns an attempt to judicially review the actions of the Minister.  
  As such, it is a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court.</p>

  </span></span> The context in which this case arises is important.  Unlike the 
  accused in <i>Parker</i>, the appellant does not bring his constitutional case 
  to the courts as a defence to a criminal prosecution.  Further, as indicated, 
  he has not challenged the constitutionality of s. 56 of the Act, which provides 
  a mechanism for obtaining an exemption from the provisions of the Act.  Nor 
  has the appellant challenged ss. 5 and 7 of the Act, which make it an offence 
  to traffic in or possess marihuana for the purpose of trafficking and to produce 
  marihuana.  Finally, this constitutional challenge does not arise out of a prosecution 
  of one of the appellant’s caregivers for supplying marihuana to the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant claims that his liberty and security interests 
  are infringed because the state has denied him access to a safe, clean and affordable 
  source of medicinal marihuana.  This infringement manifests itself in two ways.  
  First, the government has failed to provide a meaningful exemption for the appellant’s 
  caregivers in circumstances where the appellant must rely upon such caregivers 
  for his medicinal marihuana.  Second the government itself has not provided 
  him with medicinal marihuana.  We deal with the first issue in this part of 
  our reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was possible that the new regulations might have resolved 
  this issue.  However, as our review of the fresh evidence shows, the parties 
  dispute the impact and value of the new scheme in respect of caregivers.  We 
  decline to admit the post-July fresh evidence.  The appellant’s material does 
  not concern the impact of the regulations upon him.  The affiants have raised 
  important questions about the efficacy of the regulations but at the time the 
  fresh evidence was prepared the operation of the regulations was entirely hypothetical.  
  The material does not show that the appellant or his caregivers have applied 
  for exemptions.  In short, the appellant has not yet demonstrated that the regulations 
  as applied to him have an adverse impact upon his liberty or security of the 
  person.  Consideration of the new regulations in the context of this case is 
  premature:  <i>Public School Boards’ Assn. of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General)</i>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 409 at 436.  Put another way in terms of the test for admission 
  of fresh evidence, this evidence if admitted could not be expected to have affected 
  the result.  See <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at 775.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We return to the state of the record when the application was 
  made before Wright J.  As we have indicated, the superior court had jurisdiction 
  on this aspect of the case on the theory that the appellant’s rights were violated 
  because the Act does not provide an exemption for caregivers to the appellant.  
  The other issues about the sufficiency of the appellant’s own s. 56 exemption 
  or the Minister’s failure to grant exemptions to the appellant’s caregivers 
  concern review of administrative action over which the Federal Court has exclusive 
  jurisdiction.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On its face, s. 56 is capable of providing a mechanism to exempt 
  caregivers from the operation of the trafficking provisions.  The Minister may 
  exempt “any person or class of persons or any controlled substance” from the 
  application of any or all of the provisions of the Act &quot;if, in the opinion 
  of the Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical … purpose&quot;.  
  If the appellant’s caregivers have been unable to obtain an exemption, it is 
  not because the Act is inadequate, it is because they have not sought an exemption 
  or the Minister has refused to give one.  The appellant’s rights are not infringed 
  by the state because someone who might have applied for an exemption failed 
  to do so.  The Minister’s refusal to grant an exemption to a caregiver might 
  arguably infringe the appellant’s s. 7 rights, if the appellant could establish 
  a real dependency upon such a person.  Alternatively, the decision might be 
  reviewable on administrative law grounds. That would, however, involve the review 
  of a specific act of the Minister, a matter for the Federal Court.  See <i>Beaudoin 
  v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 378 (F.C.T.D.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The provincial superior court had jurisdiction to consider the 
  appellant’s application for a declaration if he could establish that the provisions 
  of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i> violated his rights.  He has 
  not shown that s. 56 itself violates his rights and therefore has not shown 
  that he is entitled to the remedy he seeks from the provincial superior court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Alternatively, the appellant’s case could be framed on the basis 
  that s. 5 (trafficking) and s. 7 (production) violate the appellant’s rights 
  because they do not exempt his caregivers.  The difficulty with this theory 
  is that since this application is not brought in the context of a criminal prosecution, 
  he cannot rely upon the broad standing rules in <i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i>, 
  [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295.  He must show that his own rights have been violated in 
  order to obtain a s. 24(1) remedy; he cannot rely upon the possible unconstitutional 
  application of these provisions to someone else.  The only claim of direct threat 
  to his liberty or security is the appellant’s claim that he suffers psychological 
  trauma because his caregivers are exposed to possible criminal prosecution.  
  In <i>R. v. Morgentaler</i> (1988), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at 465<i> </i>Dickson 
  J. held as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The case-law leads me to the conclusion that state interference with bodily 
      integrity and <u>serious state-imposed psychological stress</u>, at least 
      in the criminal law context, constitute a breach of security of the person.  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sopinka J. referred to this passage with approval in <i>Rodriguez 
  v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 15 (S.C.C.) 
  at 63.  In our view, the appellant’s anxiety about the plight of other persons 
  exposed to criminal prosecution under valid legislation is probably not the 
  kind of serious state-imposed psychological stress that could trigger s. 7.  
  But, even if it were, the infringement of the appellant’s security, in that 
  context, would accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  The prosecution 
  of offenders under valid federal legislation in accordance with all of the criminal 
  law’s procedural and constitutional safeguards is consistent with the principles 
  of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Can it be said that the failure of Parliament to exempt caregivers 
  from ss. 5 and 7 of the Act violates the appellant’s right to security of the 
  person because it has the effect of depriving the appellant of a secure supply 
  of medicinal marihuana?  In <i>Operation Dismantle v. The Queen</i> (1985), 
  18 D.L.R. (4th) 481 (S.C.C.) at 487, Dickson J. said that “regardless of the 
  basis upon which the appellants advance their claim for declaratory relief -- 
  whether it be s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, s. 52 of the <i>Constitution Act, 
  1982</i>, or the common law -- they must at least be able to establish a threat 
  of violation, if not an actual violation, of their rights under the Charter”.  
  On this point, the appellant is faced with the finding of fact by the applications 
  judge that “Mr. Wakeford has no real difficulty in obtaining marijuana for medicinal 
  purposes”.  We cannot say that this finding is unreasonable.  Although the fresh 
  evidence tendered at the hearing of the appeal shows that on occasion the appellant 
  has experienced some problems, that evidence does not undermine the applications 
  judge’s finding of fact, at least not to the point that it can be said the appellant’s 
  security of the person is threatened.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It seems to us that the appellant’s real complaint is that ss. 
  5 and 7 of the Act are unconstitutional because they do not exempt caregivers.  
  But, that argument is not open to him absent a direct attack on those provisions, 
  which would include notice to the Attorneys General in accordance with s. 109 
  of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  <i>Eaton v. Brant 
  County Board of Education</i> (1997), 142 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.) at 400:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The purpose of s. 109 is obvious. In our constitutional democracy, it is 
      the elected representatives of the people who enact legislation. <u>While 
      the courts have been given the power to declare invalid laws that contravene 
      the <i>Charter</i> and are not saved under s. 1, this is a power not to 
      be exercised except after the fullest opportunity has been accorded to the 
      government to support its validity. To strike down by default a law passed 
      by and pursuant to the act of Parliament or the legislature would work a 
      serious injustice not only to the elected representatives who enacted it 
      but to the people.</u> Moreover, in this Court, which has the ultimate responsibility 
      of determining whether an impugned law is constitutionally infirm, it is 
      important that in making that decision, we have the benefit of a record 
      that is the result of thorough examination of the constitutional issues 
      in the courts or tribunal from which the appeals arise.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> That is the problem here.  As the law now stands it is not possible 
  to obtain a constitutional exemption to valid legislation:  <i>R. v. Parker</i> 
  at p. 267.<a href="#_ftn1"

lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  no jurisdiction to consider an infringement of the appellant’s s. 7 rights in 
  a different context, particularly in the context of a prosecution of the appellant 
  or his caregiver for an offence under ss. 4 and 5 of the Act.  That, however, 
  is not this case.</p>

<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In a letter to the appellant dated

  nothing to fulfil these commitments.  It has not taken sufficent steps to develop 
  a domestic source of safe marihuana for patients and it has not attempted to 
  obtain safe marihuana from reputable foreign sources such as the National Institute 
  of Drug Abuse in the United States and GW&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals in the United

  </span></span> Moreover, asserts the appellant, the <i>Marihuana Medical Access 
  Regulations</i> which came into force on July 30, 2001, after the appeal hearing, 
  do not improve the supply situation for Canadian patients.  The appellant acknowledges 
  that the respondent has contracted with a supplier (Prairie Plant Systems) to 
  produce marihuana for research purposes, but contends that the regulations and 
  contract, taken together, do not guarantee that exemptees will receive a safe 
  supply of marihuana for medical purposes.</p>

  </span></span> We do not agree with these submissions.  Again, we note that 
  the context within which this case arises is not, like <i>Parker</i>, a criminal 
  context where an accused asserts <i>Charter </i>s. 7 rights, and seeks <i>Charter

  to the supply issue.  The operation of the recently promulgated regulations 
  and the results of the supply contract with Prairie Plant Systems are unknown 
  with respect to the appellant.  Accordingly, we proceed on the basis of the 
  record that was before the applications judge.</p>

lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is important to underline that what the appellant seeks on 
  this issue is a <i>remedy</i> for a violation of his constitutional rights, 
  specifically his <i>Charter</i> s.7 rights of liberty and security of the person.  
  Thus, before even considering whether the remedy sought by the appellant under 
  s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> – namely, government supply of marihuana to the 
  appellant for medicinal purposes – is appropriate, it is first necessary to 
  determine whether the appellant’s s. 7 rights have been violated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We cannot say that the appellant has been deprived of his s. 
  7 rights.  The crucial finding of fact by the applications judge on this issue 
  was: “I find that Mr. Wakeford . . . is not dependent on Government to supply 
  him with marijuana”.  On the record before him, this was a reasonable conclusion.</p>

lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, the appellant contends that this finding should not 
  conclude the analysis on the supply issue.  He asserts that the problem is not 
  only the <i>lack</i> of a supply of marihuana which is central to his argument 
  on the caregiver issue.  Rather, the problem is also the absence of a <i>safe</i> 
  supply of a medical product essential for his health.  The appellant asserts 
  that compelling him to grow his own marihuana or to purchase it on the black 
  market violates his s. 7 rights because neither of these options will necessarily 
  provide him with the safe supply he needs.  Limitations of time, physical energy, 
  space, money and expertise are serious constraints on the option of personal 
  growing of marihuana.  The addition of adulterants or contaminants renders dangerous 
  the option of purchasing marihuana on the black market. </p>

      clinical trials.</p>

<p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>As well, in cross-examination on the 
  affidavit the appellant swore in support of his application, the appellant said: 
  “I have achieved a modicum of self-sufficiency through outdoor growing on the 
  balcony”.  These developments and statements by the appellant, taken together, 
  do not suggest that there was, in the appellant’s mind, any linkage between 
  personal growth of marihuana and unsafe supply.</p>

  on the black market supply component of this issue.  In the cross-examination 
  on his affidavit, he acknowledged that in the previous four years he had received 
  marihuana from approximately 50 individuals and organizations and that it was 
  always possible for him to obtain a supply.  He was glowing in his description 
  of his principal suppliers or caregivers.  There was no hint in his description 
  of his caregivers and their products that the appellant was concerned about 
  impurities in their supply.  Moreover, his answers also establish that he is 
  knowledgeable and vigilant about contaminants:</p>

      that’s before a sample, whether it’s smoking a joint or a bowl.</p>

  not err by concluding that the appellant’s s.7 rights were not violated by the 
  respondent’s failure to supply the appellant with a safe supply of marihuana.  
  It is, therefore, not necessary to consider either the principles of the fundamental 
  justice component of the s. 7 analysis or the appropriateness of making the 
  type of positive order the appellant seeks under s.&nbsp;24(1).  In our view, 
  in light of the major change in the legislative landscape represented by the
