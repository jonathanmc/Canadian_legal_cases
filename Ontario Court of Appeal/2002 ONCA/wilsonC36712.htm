<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Dambrot dated June 20, 2001.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dambrot J. concluded that the appellant’s statement of claim contained 
  only a “bald allegation of malice” against the respondent, a Crown Attorney.  
  We agree.  Paragraph 25 of the statement of claim alleges in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Barry [the respondent] caused the charge to be … prosecuted against the 
      Plaintiff … with the malicious intention of securing a conviction against 
      the Plaintiff, notwithstanding that there was an absence of any reasonable 
      and probable grounds, for laying, prosecuting or continuing with the prosecution 
      of the charge.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the statement of claim the appellant does allege, although imperfectly, 
  that the respondent proceeded with the prosecution of the appellant in the absence 
  of any reasonable prospect of conviction [ paragraphs 17 and 18].  In some cases, 
  depending on the entirety of the evidence, the trier of fact may infer malice 
  from the absence of any reasonable prospect of conviction.  The potential availability 
  of that inference at the end of a trial cannot, however, relieve a plaintiff 
  of his or her obligation to properly plead the “full particulars” of an allegation 
  of malice:  Rule 25.06(8).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We also agree with Dambrot J.’s refusal to grant the appellant leave 
  to amend his statement of claim.  The appellant had 9 months advance notice 
  of the respondent’s motion to strike the claim.  If any grounds existed on which 
  the appellant could properly allege malice against the respondent, he had ample 
  time to place those before Dambrot J. in support of his motion for leave to 
  amend.  Specifically, if the appellant had any basis upon which to allege that 
  the respondent had the knowledge relied on to demonstrate malice as against 
  the police, the appellant could easily have put that basis before Dambrot J.  
  Instead, he took the position that he had no particulars to offer in respect 
  of the allegation of malice against the respondent, but that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Something went wrong” in this case and he [the appellant] should have 
      an opportunity to find out what.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court, counsel for the appellant suggested that a letter sent 
  by the appellant’s criminal counsel to the respondent a few days before the 
  respondent withdrew the charges provided a basis upon which to allege that the 
  respondent proceeded with the prosecution knowing that someone other than the 
  appellant was probably guilty.  Aside from the fact that the letter was sent 
  within days of the withdrawal of the charges by the respondent, we see nothing 
  in the contents of the letter which could possibly fix the respondent with knowledge 
  that someone else was probably guilty of the crime with which the appellant 
  was charged.</p>
