  <span>      </span>The importance of the choice of law to the parties is based 
  on the relevant differences between New York and Ontario substantive law. Under 
  Ontario law, the case would be governed by the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c.I.8, as am. by S.O. 1993, c. 10 (Bill 164).  The consequences for the 
  plaintiff would be that he could not claim for pecuniary losses, his non-pecuniary 
  losses would have to meet the “threshold” set out in s.&nbsp;267.1 in order 
  to recover more than the statutory scheme, and his recovery would be subject 
  to the statutory deductible. In contrast, from the defendant’s point of view, 
  under New York law the plaintiff may recover for pecuniary loss subject to a 
  threshold, and there is no monetary deductible.</p>
<p style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US>THE LEGAL TEST</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In <i>Tolofson v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) 
  v. Gagnon</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, the Supreme Court of Canada reconsidered 
  the choice of law rule for actions specifically concerning automobile accidents 
  involving residents of different jurisdictions both within Canada and internationally. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The court overruled the previous rule, as enunciated in<i> 
  </i>Canada in<i> McLean v. Pettigrew</i>, [1945] S.C.R. 62, which allowed courts 
  to apply the law of the forum in which the action was brought as long as: (1) 
  the wrong would have been actionable if committed in that forum; and (2) the 
  wrong was not justifiable by the law of the place where it occurred. In <i>Tolfson, 
  supra,</i> the Court held that the general rule now is that the law of the place 
  where the wrong occurred is the applicable law. On a theoretical basis, the 
  rule reflects the fact that a state has jurisdiction over what occurs in its 
  territory. However, La Forest&nbsp;J. was also satisfied that the rule responded 
  to practical considerations, the most important of which are certainty, ease 
  of application, predictability and meeting normal expectations. La Forest J. 
  emphasized that any exceptions to the rule, as applied to international cases, 
  had to be carefully defined and stated at p. 1054:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>… because a rigid rule on the international level could 
      give rise to injustice, in certain circumstances, I am not averse to retaining 
      a discretion in the court to apply our own law to deal with such circumstances. 
      I can, however, imagine few cases where this would be necessary. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In that context, La Forest J. considered at p. 1057 whether 
  there was room for an exception where the parties, as in this case, are residents 
  of the forum where the action is brought, not of the state where the wrong occurred. 
  However, after considering the reasons offered for the application of an exception 
  in that circumstance, he rejected as unsound the assumptions and arguments in 
  favour of  the exception. First, he disagreed with the assumption that it is 
  within the reasonable expectations of the parties that their home law would 
  apply to an action between them. Earlier in his reasons, he indicated that in 
  his view it was instead reasonable for parties to expect to be governed by the 
  law of the state where they were at the time of the wrong. He also rejected 
  the “public policy” argument that it would be unjust and unfair to apply the 
  law of another state if some aspect of that law was considered contrary to the 
  public policy of the forum as reflected in its own law. Rather, as he stated 
  at p. 1058, his view was that differences in applicable laws “are a concomitant 
  of the territoriality principle.”  La Forest J. emphasized that a strict rule 
  facilitates the principle of order and stated that “[w]hile…the underlying principles 
  of private international law are order and fairness, order comes first. Order 
  is a precondition to justice.” </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>Canada is not a signatory to the <i>Hague Convention on Traffic 
  Accidents</i> which also applies the <i>lex loci delicti</i> rule but allows 
  for an exception where all parties involved in the accident are from the forum 
  where the action is brought. La Forest J. rejected this exception as inapplicable 
  in the interprovincial context. Although he did not preclude its possible application 
  to international situations, my reading is that he had already rejected most 
  of  the arguments in favour of the exception earlier in his analysis of the 
  reasons for and against the rule. For example, he rejected the idea that today 
  there is any problem for courts to hear evidence of, then apply the law of another 
  jurisdiction. In any event, he immediately turned again to another point in 
  favour of a strict rule: because at the outset of an action it may be difficult 
  to determine the ambit of a claim, the existence of an exception to the rule 
  may encourage frivolous cross-claims in order to achieve forum-shopping objectives. 
  In contrast, rejection of exceptions creates certainty in the law and promotes 
  early settlement.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the result, La Forest J. applied the <i>lex 
  loci delicti</i> rule in the <i>Tolofson</i> case, in spite of the fact that 
  by applying Saskatchewan law, the infant plaintiff’s claim was barred by a limitation 
  period and by a bar on claims by gratuitous passengers, whereas the law of the 
  forum, British Columbia, would have allowed the plaintiff’s claim to proceed.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Since the <i>Tolofson</i> decision, there have 
  been a number of international cases decided both in Ontario and in other provinces, 
  where all of the parties were resident in one province, and where courts have 
  applied the <i>lex fori</i>, thereby deviating from the normal rule, and exercising 
  what La Forest J. expressed and intended to be a very limited discretion designed 
  to avoid an injustice: See <i>Hanlan v. Sernesky</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 479 
  (C.A.); (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 603 (O.C.J.); <i>Lebert v. Skinner Estate</i>, 
  [2001] O.J. No. 1038 (S.C.J.); <i>Wong v. Wei</i>, [1999] B.C.J. No. 768 (S.C.); 
  <i>Gill v. Gill</i>, [2000] B.C.J. No. 1106 (S.C.). In <i>Lau v. Li</i>, [2001] 
  O.J. No. 1389 (S.C.J.) (leave to appeal to Divisional Court denied, December 
  6, 2001) the court also applied the reasoning in <i>Hanlan</i> to an interprovincial 
  case and exercised the discretion to apply the law of Ontario and not of Quebec, 
  the place where the accident occurred, notwithstanding the ruling in <i>Tolofson</i> 
  that the discretion is not available in such an interprovincial case.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It appears that the trend of the case law is 
  to broaden what was intended to be a very narrow exception to the general rule, 
  and to apply the <i>lex fori</i> rather than <i>the lex loci delicti</i> generally 
  in cases where the parties are resident in a province of Canada and have no 
  connection with the state where the wrong occurred except to have been there 
  in the accident. Although the exercise of the discretion must be available to 
  address injustice in exceptional cases (such as <i>Hanlan, supra</i>; see para. 
  16 <i>infra</i>), it is my view that exercising the discretion whenever all 
  the parties to the action are from the forum represents a misapplication of 
  the <i>Tolofson</i> decision and a failure to recognize and give effect to the 
  policy behind the enunciation of the rule, which emphasizes the importance of 
  certainty in the choice of law rules as a means of achieving fairness in the 
  application of private international law.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In this case the motions judge reached his conclusion,

  J.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> The  motions judge at pp. 424-5 set out six reasons for concluding 
  that this was a case where the exception to the rule should apply:       </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, where all of the parties are residents 
      of Ontario, it is reasonable to assume that they would expect the law of 
      their province to govern their affairs.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, it accords with the very exception 
      that Mr.&nbsp;Justice La Forest anticipated in <i>Tolofson</i> at p.&nbsp;1057&nbsp;S.C.R. 
      . . .</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Third, it accords with the <i>Hague Convention 
      on Traffic Accidents</i>, which allows for an exception where all parties 
      involved in the accident are from the forum and which, as an international 
      convention, is worthy of regard notwithstanding that Canada is not a signatory 
      to that convention.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Fourth, it permits the public policy as 
      determined by the Ontario legislature to be applied to a case where all 
      of the parties are residents of Ontario.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Fifth, it allows the trial judge in this 
      action to apply our own law to the determination of the proceeding (which, 
      by the plaintiff’s concession, the trial judge will have to apply to the 
      assessment of damages in any event).</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sixth, it avoids the imposition on the defendants 
      of a significant injustice in that it allows them the benefits of the application 
      of Bill 164 in a factual situation which, but for the location of the accident, 
      has every other connection to Ontario.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>However, as discussed above, 
  La Forest J. considered but rejected the arguments that parties expect the law 
  of their province to govern an incident that occurred in another jurisdiction; 
  that public policy differences are sufficient to ground an exception; and that 
  any advantages in allowing judges to apply their own law could provide a basis 
  to deviate from the generally applicable rule.  He also pointed out that the 
  value of the <i>Hague Convention </i>approach in international cases was its 
  requirement of reciprocity among member states.  </p>

  </span></span> With respect to the motions judge, in my view his reasoning constitutes 
  an error in light of the <i>Tolofson</i> case.  He based his decision in part 
  on the public policy of Ontario as reflected in Bill 164, and his view that 
  that policy should be made applicable to claims brought in Ontario courts, if 
  possible.   However, this public policy argument was specifically rejected by 
  La Forest J. in <i>Tolofson</i>. He concluded that international comity requires 
  that respect be given to the policy of the forum where the wrong occurred, even 
  where the action is to be tried in another forum.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is not mere differences in public policy that can ground the 
  exception to the general rule of <i>lex loci delecti;</i> the exception is only 
  available in circumstances where the application of the general rule would give 
  rise to an injustice.  Every difference in the laws of the two forums is going 
  to benefit one side or the other and be perceived as unjust to the one not benefiting. 
  Because La Forest J. anticipated the exercise of discretion being necessary 
  only in a very unusual case, an injustice that would require a court to exercise 
  the discretion must be something beyond ordinary differences between the laws 
  of the forums. La Forest J. did not articulate the criteria he envisaged for 
  any particular circumstance to qualify as an injustice. However, as an example, 
  the type of injustice the court sought to remedy in <i>Hanlan </i>was the unavailability 
  to an Ontario plaintiff of a complete category of claim or cause of action according 
  to the <i>lex fori</i> – the claims of family members for damages pursuant to 
  s. 61 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the injustice referred to by the motions judge 
  is that if the law of New York State were to apply, the defendant insurance 
  company<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> would be open to liability for 
  pecuniary damages without a deductible, whereas under Ontario law, this would 
  not be the case. In my view, this is not the type of injustice which allows 
  the court to intervene by exercising the discretion referred to by La Forest 
  J. Rather, it is the necessary effect of applying the rule that the <i>lex loci 
  delicti</i> is the applicable law. This articulation of the injustice appears 
  to be merely another way of applying the public policy of Ontario as defined 
  in its law, and effectively treating the fact that all of the parties are from 
  the forum as in itself creating an injustice. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This is not a situation where this court is 
  seeking to substitute its discretion for that of the trial judge in which case, 
  of course, this court is not entitled to intervene. Rather, the motions judge 
  erred by finding that the precondition for the exercise of discretion -- an 
  injustice of the gravity contemplated by La Forest J. -- was present in the 
  circumstances of this case.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The respondent also raised the argument that 
  s. 267.1 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which bars an action in Ontario for pecuniary 
  losses, is a procedural rule. Because the Ontario courts would apply their own 
  procedural as opposed to substantive law, that section could bar the claim for 
  pecuniary loss even if the substantive law of New York applied.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>That issue is answered as well by the <i>Tolofson</i>

  passengers were substantive provisions of the Saskatchewan law and therefore 
  applied as part of the <i>lex loci delicti</i> to the action brought in British 
  Columbia.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Feldman J.A.  Unlike my colleague, I do not view the issue in this appeal to 
  be the substantive law to be applied in adjudicating the plaintiff’s claim against

  on which to interfere with the discretion exercised by Nordheimer J. in holding 
  that the law in Ontario should be applied.  As I have found no basis on which

  </span></span> As this appeal is about the exercise of judicial discretion in 
  the context of the choice of law which is to govern the determination of an 
  international tort wherein the parties all reside in the domestic forum and 
  the tort occurred in the foreign forum, I find it helpful to make brief reference 
  to the nature of judicial discretion and the test for appellate review of the 
  exercise of judicial discretion.  In addition, it is necessary to consider the 
  limited guidance provided by La Forest J., on behalf of a majority of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada, in <i>Tolofson v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) v. 
  Gagnon,</i> [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, 120 D.L.R. (4th) 289 for the exercise of discretion 
  in the choice of law in circumstances similar to those that pertain to this 
  case.</p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his treatise, <i>Judicial Discretion</i> (New Haven: Yale 
  University Press, 1989) Chief Justice Aharon Barak has provided a thorough analysis 
  of judicial discretion.  As the context for his analysis, at pp. 7-9 Justice 
  Barak defined judicial discretion in the following discussion:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>To me, discretion is the power given to a person with authority to choose 
      between two or more alternatives, when each of the alternatives is lawful.  
      Justice Sussman referred to this definition, saying, “Discretion means freedom 
      to choose among different possible solutions.”  Hart and Sacks offered a 
      similar definition: “Discretion means the power to choose between two or 
      more courses of action each of which is thought of as permissible.”  Judicial 
      discretion, then, means the power the law gives the judge to choose among 
      several alternatives, each of them being lawful. . . .</p>
    <p>Discretion assumes the freedom to choose among several lawful alternatives.  
      Therefore, discretion does not exist when there is but one lawful option.  
      In this situation, the judge is required to select that option and has no 
      freedom of choice.  No discretion is involved in the choice between a lawful 
      act and an unlawful act.  The judge must choose the lawful act, and he is 
      precluded from choosing the unlawful act.  Discretion, on the other hand, 
      assumes the lack of an obligation to choose one particular possibility among 
      several.  Discretion assumes the existence of several options, of which 
      the judge is entitled to choose the one that most appeals to him.  In the 
      words of Justice Cardozo,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Other cases present a genuine opportunity for choice – not a choice between 
        two decisions, one of which may be said to be almost certainly right and 
        the other almost certainly wrong, but a choice so nicely balanced that 
        when once it is announced, a new right and a new wrong will emerge in 
        the announcement.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus, discretion assumes a zone of possibilities rather than just one point.  
      It is founded on the existence of a number of options that are open to the 
      judge. . . .</p>
    <p>The zone of lawful options may be narrow, as when the judge is free to 
      choose between only two lawful alternatives.  Or the range of lawful options 
      may be considerable, as when the judge stands before many lawful alternatives 
      and combinations of alternatives.  In this sense one may distinguish between 
      narrow and broad discretion.  This distinction, of course, is only relative.

  </span></span> The standard of appellate review of judicial discretion has been 
  considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in a number of cases.  In <i>Reza

  Court held that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

  </span></span> In <i>Friends of Oldman River Society </i> at pp. 76-77 La Forest 
  J. stated that in <i>Harelkin v. University of Regina,</i> [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561, 
  96 D.L.R. (3d) 14 the Supreme Court had essentially adopted the following standard 
  of review articulated by Viscount Simon L.C. in <i>Charles Osenton &amp; Co. 
  v. Johnston</i>, [1942] A.C. 130 at 138 (H.L.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by the 
      judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well-established, and any 
      difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well-settled principles 
      in an individual case.  The appellate tribunal is not at liberty merely 
      to substitute its own exercise of discretion for the discretion already 
      exercised by the judge.  In other words, appellate authorities ought not 
      to reverse the order merely because they would themselves have exercised 
      the original discretion, had it attached to them, in a different way.  But 
      if the appellate tribunal reaches the clear conclusion that there has been 
      a wrongful exercise of discretion in that no weight, or no sufficient weight, 
      has been given to relevant considerations such as those urged before us 
      by the appellant, then the reversal of the order on appeal may be justified.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Metropolitan Stores</i>, at p. 155 the 
  Supreme Court applied the standard of review explained by Lord Diplock on behalf 
  of the House of Lords in <i>Hadmor Productions Ltd. v. Hamilton</i>, [1983] 
  2 A.C. 191 at 220, [1982] 1 All E.R 1042 at 1046:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before adverting to the evidence that was before the judge and the additional 
      evidence that was before the Court of Appeal, it is I think appropriate 
      to remind your Lordships of the limited function of an appellate court in 
      an appeal of this kind.  An interlocutory injunction is a discretionary 
      relief and the discretion whether or not to grant it is vested in the High 
      Court judge by whom the application for it is heard.  On an appeal from 
      the judge’s grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction the function 
      of an appellate court, whether it be the Court of Appeal or your Lordships’ 
      House, is not to exercise an independent discretion of its own.  It must 
      defer to the judge’s exercise of his discretion and must not interfere with 
      it merely on the ground that the members of the appellate court would have 
      exercised the discretion differently.  The function of the appellate court 
      is initially one of review only.  It may set aside the judge’s exercise 
      of his discretion on the ground that it was based on a misunderstanding 
      of the law or of the evidence before him or on an inference that particular  
      facts existed or did not exist, which, although it was one that might legitimately 
      have been drawn on the evidence that was before the judge, can be demonstrated 
      to be wrong by further evidence that has become available by the time of 
      the appeal, or on the ground that there has been a change of circumstances 
      after the judge made his order that would have justified his acceding to 
      an application to vary it.  Since reasons given by judges for granting or 
      refusing interlocutory injunctions may sometimes be sketchy, <i>there may 
      also be occasional cases where even though no erroneous assumption of law 
      or fact can be identified the judge’s decision to grant or refuse the injunction 
      is so aberrant that it must be set aside on the ground that no reasonable 
      judge regardful of his duty to act judicially could have reached it</i>.  
      It is only if and after the appellate court has reached the conclusion that 
      the judge’s exercise of his discretion must be set aside for one or other 
      of these reasons that it becomes entitled to exercise an original discretion 
      of its own.                                    [Emphasis added.]</p>

      discretion, that decision cannot be replaced simply because the appellate 
      court has a different assessment of the facts (<i>Stein v. The Ship “Kathy 
      K”</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802; see also <i>R. v. Oickle</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R.

  </span></span> In <i>Tolofson</i> the Supreme Court of Canada radically changed 
  the Canadian law concerning choice of law in tort in the context of interprovincial 
  torts.  La Forest J., on behalf of a majority of the Supreme Court, rejected 
  the forum law bias (<i>lex fori</i>) inherent in the traditional common law 
  approach to choice of law in tort.  The pre-eminence of the <i>lex fori</i>, 
  established by <i>Phillips v. Eyre</i> (1870) L.R. 6 Q.B. 1 (Ex. Ch.), as interpreted 
  in <i>McLean v. Pettigrew</i>, [1945] S.C.R. 62, was abolished.  Under the new 
  rule, the law of the place of the tort (<i>lex loci delicti</i>) is paramount 
  and applies without exception in respect to interprovincial torts.  Following 
  a lengthy analysis of common law tort choice of law principles, La Forest J. 
  rested his reasons for the new rule on articulated principle, consistency of 
  approach to choice of law, territorial sovereignty and certainty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although not required to do so on the facts of <i>Tolofson</i>, 
  La Forest J. made a number of brief observations concerning the choice of law 
  in cases of international torts.  While some room was conceded for the operation 
  of what appears to be a public policy exception  to the <i>lex loci delicti</i> 
  rule at the international level, it was thought that such cases would be rare.  
  However, one of the cases that fit into the exception was the fact paradigm 
  that exists in this appeal:  the plaintiff and the defendant are residents of 
  the domestic forum and are the sole parties to a tort that took place in a foreign 
  forum.  While it may be argued that La Forest J.’s references to a choice of 
  law rule applicable to foreign torts was <i>obiter dicta</i>, it is clear that 
  the courts have interpreted and applied <i>Tolofson</i> as establishing as the 
  choice of law rule in the case of foreign torts the same rule as in the case 
  of domestic torts, the <i>lex loci delicti</i>, with the exception that the 
  <i>lex fori</i> may be chosen to prevent an injustice.  The cases referred to 
  by Feldman J.A., including the decision of this court in <i>Hanlan v. Sernesky</i> 
  (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 479, are illustrations of the exercise of judicial discretion 
  in cases of international torts to apply the <i>lex fori</i> in circumstances 
  where the court was of the opinion that the application of the <i>lex loci delicti</i> 
  could give rise to an injustice.  For an analysis of <i>Tolofson </i> and a 
  discussion of its application by trial level courts in respect to the choice 
  of law in cases of interprovincial and international torts, see Castel &amp; 
  Walker, <i>Canadian Conflict of Laws</i> (Markham: Butterworths, 5th ed., loose-leaf, 
  2002) at pp. 35.8 to 35.27.</p>

  </span></span> The reasons of the motion judge, which are reported in (2000), 
  50 O.R. (3d) 419, disclose that he was aware that discretion to supplant the 
  <i>lex loci delicti</i> with the <i>lex fori</i> would be exercised on rare 
  occasions.  The motion judge quoted the following passages from <i>Tolofson</i> 
  at pp. 1054, 1062, 1057 and 1060, respectively, which contain La Forest J.’s 
  reference to a choice of law rule for international torts:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I have already indicated, of course, that I view the <i>lex loci delicti</i> 
      rule as the governing law.  However, because a rigid rule on the international 
      level could give rise to injustice, in certain circumstances, I am not averse 
      to retaining a discretion in the court to apply our own law to deal with 
      such circumstances.  I can, however, imagine few cases where this would 
      be necessary.</p>
    <p><b>. . . . .</b></p>
    <p>On the whole, I think there is little to gain and much to lose in creating 
      an exception to the <i>lex loci delicti</i> in relation to domestic litigation.  
      This is not to say that an exception to the <i>lex loci delicti</i> such 
      as contained in the Hague Convention is indefensible on the international 
      plane, particularly since it is enshrined in a convention  that ensures 
      reciprocity.</p>
    <p><b>. . . . .</b></p>
    <p>There might, I suppose, be room for an exception where the parties are 
      nationals or residents of the forum. Objections to an absolute rule of <i>lex 
      loci delicti</i> generally arise in such situations: [citations omitted.]</p>
    <p><b>. . . . .</b></p>
    <p>With the general rule of <i>lex loci delicti</i>, in cases involving parties 
      from two or more jurisdictions, chances are that the lawsuit will take place 
      in the country in which the tort took place.  But when all parties are from 
      another state, the likelihood is that the lawsuit will take place in their 
      home jurisdiction.  There is some merit to allowing judges in this situation 
      to apply their own law.</p>

        which allows for an exception where all parties involved in the accident

        of regard notwithstanding that Canada is not a signatory to that convention.</p>

  65 B.C.L.R. (3d) 222 (S.C.), which is based on the same fact paradigm as the 
  case under appeal.  The law of British Columbia, the home forum of the parties, 
  provided for a more limited recovery than the law of California where the motor 
  vehicle accident took place.  Kirkpatrick J. placed particular emphasis on this 
  fact, stating that the legislature of British Columbia had established a public 
  policy in limiting the recovery available to the plaintiff.  As the motion judge 
  stated at p. 423: “Kirkpatrick J. considered that this public policy, which 
  was clearly at odds with the laws of California, militated significantly against 
  the application of California law.”</p>

  fori</i> was consistent with that made by Platana J. in <i>Hanlan</i>, which 
  involved an accident that had occurred in Minnesota between two persons who 
  were insured in, and were residents of, Ontario.  In its endorsement dismissing 
  an appeal from that decision, this court said at p. 480:</p>

      to apply the <i>lex fori </i>in circumstances where the <i>lex loci delicti</i> 
      rule would work an injustice.  Justice Platana purported to exercise the 
      discretion and ruled that in the particular circumstances before him, the 
      operation of the <i>lex loci</i> rule would work an injustice.  In coming 
      to this conclusion, it is apparent that Mr. Justice Platana considered the

  </span></span> Given the limited attention accorded by La Forest J. to the choice 
  of law rule for international torts in the passages from his reasons for judgment 
  quoted by the motion judge, I confess to having some difficulty in applying 
  the test for appellate review of the exercise of the motion judge's discretion.  
  As <i>Tolofson</i> was concerned only with the choice of law rule applicable 
  to interprovinicial torts, La Forest J.’s limited reference to a choice of law 
  rule for international torts may be because he anticipated that the Supreme 
  Court would provide a definitive consideration of that issue when it came before 
  the Supreme Court for its consideration.  Indeed, it may be said that because 
  he was deciding a choice of law rule for interprovincial torts, La Forest J. 
  was taking care not to extend the reach of that rule to cases of international 
  torts.  Although <i>Tolofson</i> signaled a major change in the choice of law 
  rule for interprovincial torts, it can also be read as an indication that courts 
  should proceed cautiously in respect to an international tort choice of law 
  rule until that issue is before the Supreme Court of Canada for determination.  
  Moreover, it may be that by referring to an exception in cases of international 
  torts, La Forest J. was keeping the definitive decision on the choice of law 
  rule for international torts open for the future.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nevertheless, as I have observed, subsequent courts have taken 
  <i>Tolofson</i> to stand for a broad principle that covers international torts, 
  with discretion in the court to choose the <i>lex fori</i> where the <i>lex 
  loci delicti</i> “could give rise to injustice”.  As <i>Tolofson</i> has been 
  applied to recognize a discretionary exception to the choice of law in the case 
  of international torts, particularly in respect to the fact paradigm in this 
  appeal, in my view it is not for this court to impose limits on the exercise 
  of that discretion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It would be wrong, in my view, to interpret <i>Hanlan</i> as 
  standing for the proposition that all cases that contain a fact paradigm similar 
  to that of <i>Hanlan</i> and this case will give rise to an injustice thereby 
  justifying the court to choose the <i>lex fori</i> rather than the <i>lex loci 
  delicti</i>.  However, I view <i>Hanlan</i> as a case in which this court accorded 
  deference to the exercise of the motion judge’s discretion in the circumstances 
  of that case.  Indeed, all of the trial court decisions to which we have been 
  referred in which the court has exercised a discretion in the choice of law 
  in cases of international torts are no more than examples of cases in which 
  the court has exercised its discretion in choosing the <i>lex fori</i> or the 
  <i>lex loci delicti</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Unfortunately, little guidance is found in the reasons of La 
  Forest J. respecting the nature of the injustice which might lead a judge to 
  exercise his or her discretion in the choice of law to govern the dispute.  
  However, he did envision a judge choosing the <i>lex fori</i> in circumstances 
  such as those addressed in the <i>Hague Convention on Traffic Accidents</i>:  
  when all of the parties are nationals or residents of the forum, not the state 
  where the accident occurred.  He appears to give two reasons why, in such circumstances, 
  it would be appropriate to choose the <i>lex fori</i>.  At p. 1062 he suggests 
  that it is because the choice of the <i>lex fori</i> emanates from its enshrinement 
  in a convention “that ensures reciprocity”.  At p. 1060 he notes that in the 
  fact paradigm of this case there “is some merit to allowing judges. . . to apply 
  their own law”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In respect to the second reason, although La Forest J. did not 
  expand upon this statement, in my view, it is not unreasonable to conclude that 
  the merit may lie in a desire to limit the number of occasions when judges of 
  the forum would be required to apply foreign law, which must be proved, with 
  the attendant expense involved in expanding a trial to allow such proof.  As 
  well, it is to be assumed that judges are  experienced in applying their domestic 
  law which, in this fact paradigm, includes the application of the legislated 
  policy of compensation in force in the home forum.  In this regard, to insist 
  on the <i>lex loci delicti</i> would preclude an Ontario court from awarding 
  damages based on the Ontario statutory no-fault compensation regime for personal 
  injuries sustained as a result of motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the level of comity, it is difficult to see what interest 
  New York state would have in applying its statutory compensation regime to a 
  claim between two non-resident parties litigating in their home forum.  In my 
  opinion, the better view is that Ontario has a greater interest in the compensation 
  of an Ontario resident  by another Ontario resident being determined by Ontario 
  law, rather than by New York law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In exercising his discretion in favour of the <i>lex fori</i>, 
  the motion judge considered six factors which, it would appear, he derived from 
  <i>Tolofson</i>.  In essence, what the motion judge did was to interpret the 
  local legislative policy governing the compensation of Ontario residents injured 
  in a motor vehicle accident by another Ontario resident to give it wide extraterritorial 
  scope.  An Ontario resident injured in a foreign state by the negligence of 
  another Ontario resident, each of whom was insured in Ontario by an Ontario 
  insurer, should be compensated under the Ontario statutory no-fault compensation 
  regime for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  To insist 
  on the application of the <i>lex loci delicti</i> in this fact paradigm would 
  preclude an Ontario court from awarding damages in compliance with Ontario’s 
  statutory compensation regime and would, thus, result in giving rise to an injustice 
  of the nature of contemplated in <i>Tolofson</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To conclude that the motion judge wrongly exercised his discretion 
  in favour of the <i>lex fori</i> because the plaintiff stands to recover greater 
  damages under New York law than under Ontario law does not produce an injustice 
  in the sense that the plaintiff will be denied an assessment of damages according 
  to the law.  Moreover, this conclusion would effectively deny the existence 
  of any discretion to choose the <i>lex fori</i> whenever that law produces a 
  lower assessment of damages than the <i>lex loci delicti</i>.  In my view, such 
  a categorical denial is not warranted.  Had the Supreme Court of Canada intended 
  the <i>lex loci delicti</i> to be the choice of law rule in the case of all 
  international torts, it would not have provided for the discretion exercised 
  by the motion judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As Justice Barak has pointed out, when we say that a judge has 
  a discretion we mean that there is no legal rule that compels the judge to make 
  a particular decision.  Rather, if the judge considers relevant factors, it 
  is accepted that different judges can reasonably interpret the factors in different 
  ways and reach different, but reasonable, decisions.  Thus, where no legal rule 
  unambiguously requires a particular legal decision, there are no constraints 
  that require a given result.  In such cases, judges no doubt believe that neither 
  party has the right to any particular decision.  They identify their task as 
  selecting the decision that is best on the whole, all things considered, and 
  they talk not about what they <i>must</i> do but about what they <i>should</i> 
  do.  It can be said, therefore, that discretionary decisions illustrate that 
  judging is an art, not a science, and that the judge, in considering the relevant 
  factors, blends analogy, craft, political wisdom, and experience into a decision 
  which his or her reasons, no matter how carefully crafted, may fail to capture 
  or express his or her full insight.  Such decisions may also illustrate that 
  there are no right answers to hard questions, that insight is subjective, and 
  that the decision is only what seems right, for better or for worse, to the 
  particular judge on a particular day.  Such, then, is the nature of discretionary 
  decision making and, no doubt, accounts for the significant deference to be 
  accorded to discretionary decisions reached by judges.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the circumstances of this appeal, the discretion accorded 
  to the motion judge permitted him to choose between two alternatives, each of 
  which was lawful.  Unlike the domestic tort choice of law rule which is absolute 
  and admits of no exceptions, the motion judge in this international tort choice 
  of law case was not precluded from choosing the <i>lex fori</i>.  It cannot 
  be said that this choice was either <i>prima facie</i> unlawful or wrong.  Although 
  the motion judge’s discretion  was narrow in the sense that he was free to choose 
  between only two lawful alternatives, nevertheless he had that choice and on 
  appellate review the court must defer to the exercise of his discretion, even 
  though  the appellate court may have exercised it differently.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motion judge addressed the factors for and against the exercise 
  of the discretion which the court clearly possessed and gave appropriate weight 
  to those factors.  It is not for this court to reconsider the same discretionary 
  factors.  To do so is to embark on the road of substituting this court’s discretion 
  for that of the motion judge should a reconsideration of the factors produce 
  a result that differs from that reached by the motion judge.  This is not a 
  case, for example, like <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</i> (2001), 
  201 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 219 (S.C.C.), in which, because the lower court failed 
  to address the factors for and against the exercise of discretion which it possessed, 
  this court is entitled to consider the discretionary factors.  Moreover, I am 
  satisfied that the motion judge reached a decision that is not so clearly wrong 
  as to amount to an injustice.  I would not interfere with Nordheimer J.’s exercise 
  of his discretion in choosing the <i>lex fori</i> as the law which is to govern 
  the determination of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
