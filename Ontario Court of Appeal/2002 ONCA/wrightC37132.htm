<p>On appeal from the order of Justice James dated September 20, 2001, setting

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant made an offer to settle, which 
  was accepted by the respondent and then included in an order of Justice Timms, 
  who was presiding at a settlement conference.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>When the appellant subsequently received a letter 
  from her lawyer with the terms of the settlement, she took the position that 
  the wording of the settlement offer, which she had signed, was not what she 
  had intended. She immediately advised her lawyer of the mistake and asked him 
  to advise the other side, which he did. Counsel for the respondent took the 
  position that there was no mistake and that he would move to enforce the settlement, 
  but did not do so.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Counsel for the appellant then brought a Rule 
  14.10 motion over the counter to have the order rectified. That procedure, however, 
  is reserved for uncomplicated, procedural or unopposed matters. Counsel for 
  the appellant expected the motion to be opposed. Justice James made the order 
  which appeared to be unopposed at the time. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent subsequently moved before Justice James for an 
  order enforcing the settlement. On that motion, the affidavit of the appellant 
  from the Rule 14.10 motion as well as evidence filed by both the appellant and 
  the respondent were before the court. The appellant pleaded the mistake. The 
  respondent swore in his affidavit that he had accepted the offer to settle on 
  the basis that he believed  it was a reasonable offer from the appellant’s viewpoint.

lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In his brief reasons, Justice James set aside 
  his Rule 14.10 order as it was not a proper over-the-counter motion, and reinstated 
  the order of Justice Timms without referring to the mistake issue. We agree 
  that it would have been preferable had Justice James referred to his decision 
  on the mistake issue in his reasons for judgment. However, we are satisfied 
  that on the record before him and before us, there is no basis to conclude that 
  the respondent knew or ought to have known that the appellant made a unilateral 
  mistake in making her offer. In those circumstances, there is no basis for this 
  court to set aside the order.</span></p>

  on costs. Costs will be payable to the respondent fixed at $4,000.</span></p>
