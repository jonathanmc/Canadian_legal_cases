<h1>COURT 
  OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO </h1>
<p class="boldcenter">FINLAYSON, CATZMAN and BORINS JJ.A.</p>
<p> BETWEEN: </p>
<p>GEORGE ZRAIK and GRACE COSTA<br>
  Appellant </p>
<p> - and - </p>
<p> LEVESQUE SECURITIES INC. and ALFRED DROSE<br>
  Respondents </p>
<p>Peter R. Jervis, for the appellant</p>
<p>Alan A. Farrer and Leah K. Bowness, for the respondents</p>
<p>Heard: November 28, 2001 </p>
<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Todd L. Archibald dated June 17, 1999. 
</p>
<p class="boldcenter" >ADDENDUM ON COSTS</p>
<p >FINLAYSON J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] I have read the material submitted by the appellant 
  and the respondents on the issue of costs.  The increase in the monetary award 
  authorized by this court places the judgment significantly above the appellant’s 
  Offer to Settle of January 22, 1999 provided for in Rule  49 of the <em>Rules 
  of Civil Procedure</em>.  Accordingly, the cost disposition below should be varied 
  to provide that the appellant is entitled to his costs on a party-and-party 
  basis up to January 22, 1999 and thereafter on a solicitor-and-client basis.</p>
<p>[2] It is not our practice to apply the provisions 
  of Rule 49 to the awarding of costs in this court.  While the respondents argue 
  that success was divided, it appears to me that the increase in the amount of 
  the monetary award more than justified the appeal and entitled the appellant 
  to his entire costs of the appeal.  The appellant is entitled to his costs of 
  the appeal on a party-and-party basis.</p>
