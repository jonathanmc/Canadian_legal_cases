<p>On appeal from the judgment of Croll J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated 
  September 10, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] After a twelve-day trial, Croll J. found the appellants liable under s. 
  50 of the Commercial Tenancies Act and made an award of double the value of 
  goods removed from the respondent's premises. The trial judge found that each 
  of the appellants was responsible for the removal of the goods from the commercial 
  premises leased by a numbered company in which the appellants were the sole 
  officers, directors and shareholders. The trial judge also found that the conduct 
  of each of the appellants was intended to defeat the rights of the respondent 
  landlord to the rent then in arrears and that as such it was fraudulent within 
  the meaning of s. 50 of the Commercial Tenancies Act. In making those findings, 
  the trial judge properly recognized that because of the penal nature of s. 50 
  and the stigma of dishonesty flowing from a finding under that section, she 
  would apply an increased degree of probability for findings of fact that would 
  be commensurate with all the circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants' main argument is that there was insufficient evidence to 
  support the trial judge's findings of responsibility and intent. Those were 
  findings of fact. Although there was little direct evidence linking the appellants 
  to the removal of goods, there was circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellants' 
  responsibility for the removal and to their intent to defeat the respondent's 
  entitlement to rent. The trial judge carefully analyzed the evidence and clearly 
  set out the basis for her conclusions. We see no basis upon which to interfere 
  with those conclusions. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellants also take issue with the trial judge's findings that they 
  were responsible for the amount of approximately $37,000 for damages to the 
  vacated premises. The respondent's claim for damages at trial totalled $61,223.81. 
  The trial judge reviewed the evidence in support of the damage claim and after 
  deducting amounts for inducements paid to the new tenants and an amount for 
  an hourly rate she considered too high, she awarded damages in the amount of 
  $37,437.88. This court accords considerable deference to a trial judge's award 
  of damages. In our view, there was evidence to support the trial judge's award 
  and accordingly we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge's award of solicitor-client costs was an exercise in discretion. 
  Given the trial judge's finding as to fraudulent intent, we are not prepared 
  to interfere with the exercise of that discretion. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.</p>
