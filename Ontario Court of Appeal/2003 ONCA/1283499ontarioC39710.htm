<p>On appeal from the judgment of Thompson J. of the Superior Court of Justice 
  on February 27, 2003.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent (Wired Nightclub) was charged under the Liquor Licence Act 
  in the Provincial Offences Court. The proceedings were adjourned from time to 
  time until July 29, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [2] On July 26, 2002, the Regional Senior Justice of the Peace issued the following 
  written direction: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Due to bereavement leave resulting from the passing of Her Worship Brode's father 
  last evening, the P.O.A. court scheduled for Friday, July 26, 2002, Monday, 
  July 29, 2002 and Tuesday, July 30, 2002 are directed closed due to insufficient 
  judicial resources. The clerk of the court is hereby directed to adjourn all 
  matters &#133;</p>
<p>
  [3] On July 29, 2002, counsel for the respondent appeared in Provincial Offences 
  Court. The court clerk was present, but there was no Justice of the Peace in 
  the courtroom. A court reporter kept a record of the proceedings. After some 
  discussion with counsel, the clerk suggested a date of September 16, 2002. Counsel 
  agreed and the matter was adjourned to that date. </p>
<p>
  [4] The same counsel appeared for the respondent on September 16, 2002. He indicated 
  that he was present only to contest the jurisdiction of the court. He argued 
  that jurisdiction was lost on July 29, 2002 when the matter was adjourned by 
  a clerk of the court. The Justice of the Peace held that she had jurisdiction. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] On October 11, 2002, the respondent moved for an order in the Superior Court 
  in the nature of prohibition seeking an order prohibiting any further proceedings 
  in the Provincial Offences Court. In February 2003, the Superior Court judge 
  allowed the application and issued an order prohibiting further proceedings 
  in the matter. </p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown appealed. The court allowed the appeal with reasons to follow. 
  I agree with the application judge that there is no authority for the procedure 
  followed in Provincial Offences Court on July 29, 2002. There is nothing in 
  the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 comparable to s. 474(2) of 
  the Criminal Code authorizing such a procedure. The court, meaning the presiding 
  judicial officer, not a member of the court staff designated by the court or 
  by a Regional Senior Justice of the Peace, has the jurisdiction to adjourn a 
  proceeding. Section 146 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, 
  does not create jurisdiction: R. v. Sztuke (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 559 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [7] Although I am satisfied that the procedure followed on July 29, 2002 was 
  not authorized by law, the events of July 29 constitute a failure by the Provincial 
  Offences Court to exercise its jurisdiction over the offence and the offender 
  on that day. Section 31 of the P.O.A. has direct application. It reads in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The court retains jurisdiction over the information or certificate even if the 
  court fails to exercise its jurisdiction at any particular time &#133;</p>
<p>
  [8] The application judge held that s. 31 did not apply because the clerk of 
  the court and not the court had purported to act on July 29, 2002. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Section 31 speaks of the &quot;court&quot; doing or not doing something, to 
  wit, a judge or justice of the peace making an active judicial determination 
  in open court on the record. There must be an active judicial hearing or trial 
  where the court is represented by a judge or justice of the peace. The section 
  does not speak about a clerk doing the work of a judicial officer. If the judge 
  or justice of the peace fails to exercise his or her jurisdiction or does not 
  comply with the Provincial Offences Act respecting adjournments, then this section 
  acts to prevent a loss of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [9] With respect, the application judge's reasoning is inconsistent with the 
  language of s. 31. Section 31 does not require &quot;an active judicial determination 
  in open court&quot; or &quot;an active judicial hearing&quot;. To the contrary, 
  s. 31 specifically contemplates a failure to act. In my view, the phrase &quot;fails 
  to exercise its jurisdiction&quot; contemplates a case where the court does 
  nothing. The fact that another entity, in this case the clerk of the court, 
  purported to act in the place of the court does not change the fact that the 
  court failed to exercise its jurisdiction. </p>
<p>
  [10] In concluding that s. 31 of the P.O.A. did not address a situation like 
  that which occurred on July 29, 2002, the application judge relied heavily on 
  R. v. Krannenburg (1980), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 205 (S.C.C.). As Crown counsel points 
  out, Krannenburg, supra, interpreted a jurisdictional curative provision in 
  the Criminal Code that was much more limited than 31 of the P.O.A.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Criminal Code has now been amended and the present curative jurisdictional 
  provision may be found in s. 485(1): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Jurisdiction over an offence is not lost by reason of the failure of any court, 
  judge, provincial court judge or justice to act in the exercise of that jurisdiction 
  at any particular time &#133;</p>
<p>
  [12] Section 485(1) of the Criminal Code cannot be distinguished from s. 31 
  of the P.O.A. Several courts have held that s. 485(1) preserves the jurisdiction 
  over the offence where a court fails to act on a remand date: R. v. Jarvis (1986), 
  N.S.J. No. 429 (C.A.); R. v. Fogarty (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (N.S.C.A.); 
  R. v. Chisan, [1988] A.J. No. 935 (C.A.), leave to S.C.C. refused (1989), 100 
  N.R. 239; R. v. Okemajsim (1989), 77 Sask. R. 247 (Q.B.). I agree with those 
  authorities.</p>
<p>[13] Jurisdiction over the offence with which the respondent was charged was 
  not lost by virtue of s. 31 of the P.O.A. If jurisdiction over the person was 
  lost, it was regained when counsel appeared on September 16, or alternatively 
  it could be, and still can be regained by the issuance of a summons.</p>
<p>
  [14] The appeal is allowed, the order prohibiting further proceedings in the 
  Provincial Offences Court is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Provincial 
  Offences Court. In doing so, it should be made clear that the practice of having 
  a non-judicial officer adjourn the court on any given day is not authorized 
  by law and should not continue. It may be that the practice makes administrative 
  sense, but unless and until the relevant legislation is amended, it is improper.</p>
