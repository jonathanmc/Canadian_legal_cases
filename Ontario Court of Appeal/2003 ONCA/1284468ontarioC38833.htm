<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the judgment declaring the rights of the tenant 
  (respondent) under the terms of a lease entered between the tenant and the landlord 
  (appellant).</p>
<p> [2] In detailed reasons for judgment, the trial judge determined issues relating 
  to the validity of an option to purchase the premises, the basic rent for the 
  first year of the lease, the obligation of the landlord to deliver the leased 
  premises in good working order, the right of the tenant to set-off certain monies 
  against the rent and the abatement of rent during the period taken to correct 
  deficiencies.</p>
<p> [3] It is important to note at the outset that numerous findings of credibility 
  were made against the landlord by the trial judge.</p>
<p> [4] The main issue at trial was the option to purchase contained in the offer 
  to lease. On this issue, there was overwhelming evidence that the parties intended 
  that the tenant would have the option to purchase the entire property on which 
  the leased premises were situated, which option the trial judge found was properly 
  exercised. We are agreement with the trial judge that the most important terms 
  of the option were agreed to.</p>
<p> [5] On the issue of the basic rent, the landlord had ample opportunity to 
  review the changes made by the tenant. The landlord initialed those changes 
  and the trial judge accepted the position advanced by the tenant. This issue 
  was in large part decided on the credibility of the parties.</p>
<p> [6] The remaining issues are interrelated. The tenant submitted an extensive 
  list of problems with the leased premises. It included numerous building code 
  deficiencies, preventing the occupation of the premises for a number of months.</p>
<p> [7] The trial judge held that the terms of the lease obligated the landlord 
  to deliver the major structural, mechanical and electrical systems of the premises 
  in good working order at the time the tenant took possession. Given the trial 
  judge's obligation to interpret the lease as a whole, we cannot say that 
  his interpretation of any specific provision in the lease was unreasonable. 
  The trial judge also held that there had been a subsequent agreement between 
  the parties whereby the tenant would pay for certain replacements and repairs 
  to the premises and deduct those expenses from the rent due.</p>
<p> [8] The trial judge concluded that because of the municipality's refusal 
  to permit occupancy, the tenant was entitled to an abatement of rent until the 
  building code deficiencies had been rectified and that the tenant was entitled 
  to set-off against the rent the costs to repair the deficiencies.</p>
<p> [9] In our view, the findings and conclusions of the trial judge are based 
  on the evidence and we see no reason to interfere.</p>
<p> [10] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000. The closing on the 
  option to purchase in extended to 90 days from this date.</p>
