<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with Dambrot J.'s interpretation of the agreement of purchase 
  and sale to the extent that he found, in order for there to be a binding contract, 
  that Imperial's acceptance had to be delivered to the purchaser in writing. 
  He found that Imperial's written acceptance of the offer was delivered to the 
  purchaser on September 30, 1999. The evidence fully supports that finding. As 
  a result of this finding, on September 30, 1999 a binding contract was created. 
</p>
<p>[2] While it is true that Imperial inserted the date of September 23, 1999 
  as the "acceptance" date, we do not find the last sentence of clause 
  5.1 to be determinative as to the actual date of acceptance. </p>
<p>[3] In the circumstances of this case, the acceptance date was particularly 
  important because it served as the foundation for the crucial 60-day due diligence 
  period. In our view, it would be wrong to interpret the last sentence of clause 
  5.1 as permitting Imperial to unilaterally shorten that period by inserting 
  into the contract a date that did not accurately reflect its own internal approval 
  process or the respondent's reasonable view as to the date on which the contract 
  was created. That date was, as Dambrot J. found, September 30th.</p>
<p>[4] Consequently, we are satisfied that Dambrot J. came to the right conclusion, 
  although we do not agree with him that there was no contract. Rather, we are 
  satisfied that there was a contract, albeit one that became operative on September 
  30th. </p>
<p>[5] It follows that the purchaser was entitled to withdraw when it did on November 
  26th and, accordingly, it was entitled to the return of its deposit.</p>
<p>[6] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $12,500.00 
  inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
