<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice Bonnie J. Wein of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated April 18, 2002 and September 24, 2002. <br>
</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal from the dismissal of their motion to add the respondent 
  Marsh &amp; Co. Hospitality Realty Inc. as a defendant to the proceeding. They 
  also appeal from the costs award in the amount of $7,070.07. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] This action, commenced in September 1999, arises out of an agreement of 
  purchase and sale of a restaurant between the appellant 1351428 Ontario Limited, 
  as purchaser, and the defendant 1037598 Ontario Ltd., as vendor. The individual 
  appellants are shareholders and directors of the corporate purchaser and the 
  individual defendant Ted Tsanas (&quot;Tsanas&quot;) is a shareholder, director 
  and officer of the corporate vendor. The defendant Brian Grove Holdings Ltd 
  was the landlord of the premises in question. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] In October 2001, the appellants sought leave to amend their statement of 
  claim to include additional causes of action against Tsanas arising out of his 
  alleged conduct as real estate agent in respect of the transaction. Leave to 
  amend was granted and no appeal is taken from this order.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] On the same motion, the appellants sought to add the respondent Marsh &amp; 
  Co. Hospitality Realty Inc. (&quot;Marsh&quot;) as a party defendant based, 
  in part, on the allegation that Marsh is vicariously liable for Tsanas's conduct 
  as a real estate broker employed by, or acting as agent for, Marsh. The proposed 
  pleading against Marsh extended beyond allegations of vicarious liability and 
  included a claim for damages for negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary 
  duty, breach of contract, negligence, and breach of statutory duty. Leave to 
  add Marsh as a defendant to the action was refused and it is that part of the 
  order which is the subject-matter of this appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] Rule 5.04(2) reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">5.04 (2) At any stage of a proceeding the court 
  may by order add, delete or substitute a party or correct the name of a party 
  incorrectly named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result 
  that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] None of the existing defendants to the action opposed the motion to add 
  a party or took part in this appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] In response to the motion, Marsh denied that Tsanas was ever an employee 
  of Marsh. Marsh acknowledged, however, that for a period of time Tsanas had 
  acted as an assistant to one of its real estate agents, Ron Scribner, and as 
  such, that he had had the use of Marsh's office, letterhead and equipment. Marsh 
  acknowledged further that Scribner, with Tsanas acting as his assistant, had 
  acted as agent for the appellants in respect of two other restaurant properties 
  but not in respect of the restaurant in question in this transaction. Marsh 
  relied on the written agreement of purchase and sale to show that the parties 
  intended that there be no agent on this transaction. Marsh further alleged that 
  it would be irremediably prejudiced if it were added as a party defendant because 
  of the intervening death of Ron Scribner in November 2000. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] The specific allegations of prejudice were set out as follows in affidavits 
  filed by Marsh's principal, Garry Marsh: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">10. There is no one at Marsh &amp; Co. who can testify 
  as to the details of the working relationship between Mr. Scribner and Mr. Tsanas. 
  Mr. Scribner died in November 2000. That was one year and two months after the 
  plaintiffs commenced this action. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">7. There is no reason I am aware of to believe that 
  Mr. Tsanas exceeded his role as an assistant to Mr. Scribner, as alleged &#133; 
  Mr. Scribner would be the only person at Marsh &amp; Co. who could provide full 
  testimony on this issue in defence of Marsh &amp; Co. Mr. Scribner died in November, 
  2000, a year after this lawsuit was commenced. </p>
  
<p>[9] The motions judge was satisfied that Scribner's evidence &quot;cannot be 
  replaced by other available evidence&quot; and that Marsh would be irremediably 
  prejudiced, if the motion was allowed. On that ground alone, she was satisfied 
  that the motion should be dismissed. Alternatively, she ruled that, even if 
  she were wrong on the issue of prejudice, she would nonetheless dismiss the 
  motion because of the following circumstances: the nature of the allegations 
  were known at the time the action was commenced; there had been a delay in proceeding 
  with the motion; and, it could be said that there was no tenable cause of action. 
  She based her finding on the latter point on her examination of the written 
  agreement of purchase and sale. Although the document had been signed in Marsh's 
  office, in contradistinction to earlier agreements of purchase and sale prepared 
  by Marsh, it deleted any reference to agency. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] In my respectful view, the motions judge erred in dismissing the motion 
  on either basis. I will deal firstly with the issue of prejudice.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The form of prejudice that militates against granting leave to add a party 
  under rule 5.04 must be such, as the rule expressly provides, that it &quot;could 
  not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.&quot; Prejudice may be alleged 
  by one of the existing parties to the action or by the person sought to be added 
  as a party litigant. It is implicit from the very nature of the motion that 
  the prejudice in question must result from the addition of a party to an already 
  existing action and not simply from the fact that the party sought to be added 
  would sue or be sued as the case may be. It is for this reason that, not surprisingly, 
  the most common circumstance that gives rise to an allegation of prejudice in 
  opposition to a rule 5.04 motion is the expiry of a limitation period. While 
  the expiry of a limitation period is by no means the sole circumstance that 
  can justify the refusal of leave under rule 5.04, in this case, the absence 
  of such a circumstance best exemplifies the kind of prejudice that is not contemplated 
  under the rule. I say this for the following reason.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] It is unquestionable that the appellants, at this point in time, can commence 
  a separate action against Marsh based on the same allegations that are contained 
  in their proposed pleading. While Scribner's intervening death could give rise 
  to some evidentiary issues in the action, it is irrelevant to the appellants' 
  right to bring an action against Marsh. Further, given the nature of the allegations 
  against Tasanas in the expanded pleading, it is inconceivable in my view that 
  the two actions would not be properly consolidated under rule 6.01. Rule 5.04 
  cannot be considered in isolation. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] The motions judge accepted Marsh's argument that non-compensable prejudice 
  would result if the motion were granted because of the intervening death of 
  a potentially important witness. While Marsh's argument may hold some superficial 
  attraction, it is my respectful view that, in these circumstances, it cannot 
  provide a justification to refuse the appellants' motion. In fairness to the 
  motions judge, the appellants did not argue the motion on this basis. <br>
</p>
<p>[14] I would add that it is also my respectful view that the record does not 
  support the motions judge's finding that Scribner was the only person who, in 
  a material way, could address the claim against Marsh. There is no doubt that, 
  based on Marsh's affidavits, Scribner may well have been a relevant, if not 
  important, witness. The extent of Scribner's involvement, if any, is, however, 
  disputed by the appellants. Moreover, it is clear from the proposed pleading 
  that the appellants' claim against Marsh is based on alleged facts that extend 
  far beyond the details of any particular relationship that may have existed 
  between Scribner and Tsanas. In my view, it is not possible to make any determinative 
  finding on Scribner's involvement, and its relevance, based on the record at 
  this stage of the proceedings.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] It is also my respectful view that the motions judge erred in her alternative 
  basis for denying the motion. As the motions judge herself acknowledged in her 
  reasons, it is clear that the merits of the proposed claim cannot be considered 
  at this stage of the proceedings. While a pleading that does not disclose a 
  reasonable cause of action should not be permitted as an amendment under rule 
  5.04, this is not the situation here. There is no suggestion that the proposed 
  pleading is defective. The motions judge's consideration of the written documentation 
  to determine the extent to which it could support the allegation that there 
  was an agency relationship constituted a weighing of the evidence that went 
  beyond the permissible scope of inquiry. <br>
</p>
<p>[16] The remaining considerations regarding the appellants' knowledge of the 
  relevant facts at the time the action was commenced and their delay in bringing 
  the motion had no bearing on the prejudice alleged by Marsh. Nor could these 
  considerations, in the context of this case, provide an independent basis for 
  denying the motion in the absence of prejudice. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the motions judge's 
  order and grant leave to add the respondent as a party defendant. I would also 
  set aside the order as to costs and would award no costs on the motion. I would 
  award the appellants their costs of the appeal in the amount of $1,700 as requested.</p>
