<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas Coo of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, dated December 2, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 4722 (S.C.J.).</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Ole Miss Place Inc. owns a building in Mississauga in which the respondent 
  numbered company is a commercial tenant. The tenant wanted to renew the lease 
  but when it sought to exercise the option to renew, Ole Miss Place Inc. refused. 
  The tenant then applied for, and obtained, a declaration that it had validly 
  exercised its right of renewal. </p>
<p>
  [2] Ole Miss Place Inc. appeals. It argues that the lease expressly provides 
  that the tenant could renew only if, among other things, it was not in default 
  at the time it sought to exercise its right of renewal. Ole Miss Place Inc. 
  says that because the tenant was in default at the time it sought to renew, 
  Ole Miss Place Inc. had the right to refuse the purported renewal. </p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I agree and would, therefore, allow the appeal. 
  </p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant, Ole Miss Place Inc. (&quot;the Landlord&quot;), is the owner 
  of 3050 Confederation Parkway in Mississauga (&quot;the building&quot;). The 
  building is a mixed-use property with retail on the first floor, five floors 
  of office space, and a residential unit on the top floor that is occupied by 
  the Landlord's property manager, Anna Prokop. The building has approximately 
  70,000 square feet of rentable area and between twenty and twenty-five commercial 
  tenants.</p>
<p>
  [5] In July 1993, the previous owner of the building leased unit 104 to Da Silva 
  Contractors Inc. for a term of ten years from March 1, 1993 to February 28, 
  2003. The Landlord acquired the property in 1999. At that time, Da Silva was 
  operating a bar on the premises and there were problems with drunken patrons. 
  As a result, the Landlord gave notice of its intention to terminate Da Silva's 
  lease.</p>
<p>
  [6] On November 26, 1999, the Landlord consented to Da Silva assigning its lease 
  to the respondent, 1383421 Ontario Inc. (&quot;the Tenant&quot;). </p>
<p>
  [7] Section 8:01 of the lease stipulates that the premises are to be used solely 
  as a caf&eacute;/restaurant. Section 18:01 is an option to renew clause that 
  permits the Tenant to renew the lease for an additional five years, provided 
  that three conditions are met: (1) the Tenant is not in default under the lease; 
  (2) the Tenant is in actual possession of the leased premises; and (3) the Tenant 
  gives written notice of its intention to exercise the option to renew at least 
  180 days prior to the expiration of the lease.</p>
<p>
  [8] On August 1, 2002, the Tenant notified the Landlord by letter that it intended 
  to exercise the option to renew. On August 15, 2002, the Landlord's solicitor 
  wrote to the Tenant, informing it that the Landlord was not prepared to renew 
  the lease because the Tenant was in breach of several of the lease provisions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] The alleged breaches related to the Tenant operating its business as a bar 
  and serving alcohol to its patrons until they became so intoxicated that they 
  would vomit and urinate around the building, harass other occupants of the building, 
  and create disturbances. The Landlord took the position that, as a result of 
  the continued over-serving, the Tenant was in breach of sections 8:01, 8:02, 
  8:03 and 8:04 of the lease agreement and that the alleged breaches constituted 
  acts of default. The Landlord purported to terminate the lease immediately. 
  It gave the Tenant until September 3, 2002 to remove its belongings.</p>
<p>
  [10] The Landlord continued to accept rent after delivering the notice of intention 
  to terminate the lease.</p>
<p>
  [11] The lease expired on February 28, 2003. </p>
<p>
  [12] The Tenant brought an application before the Superior Court for a declaration 
  that it was entitled to exercise, and had validly exercised, its lease renewal. 
  On December 2, 2002, the applications judge granted the Tenant's application 
  and declared that it had validly renewed the lease on August 1, 2002.</p>
<p>
  EVIDENCE ON THE APPLICATION</p>
<p>
  (1) Evidence of Over-serving</p>
<p>
  [13] The Landlord responded to the Tenant's application by filing affidavits 
  sworn by Anna Prokop, property manager for the Landlord, and Marek Klimaszewski, 
  building supervisor for the Landlord. These affidavits contained four types 
  of information of the Tenant's over-serving of alcohol to its patrons: (i) observations 
  of the Landlord's employees; (ii) complaints from other tenants in the Building; 
  (iii) evidence of police attendances; and (iv) infractions and offences under 
  the Liquor Licence Act.</p>
<p>
  (i) Observations of the Landlord's employees</p>
<p>
  [14] At paragraph 17 of her affidavit dated September 23, 2002, Ms. Prokop states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There have been constant problems with patrons of the Tenant drinking to excess 
  and then annoying other tenants. These incidents include numerous occasions 
  of patrons vomiting on the property, urinating in public, breaking windows, 
  fighting and engaging in disruptive conduct. There have also been regular problems 
  with noise.</p>
<p>
  At paragraph 46, Ms. Prokop states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The Tenant] frequently serves people who are intoxicated. The fact that patrons 
  stagger out of the leased premises, fall down on the ground, vomit on other 
  tenants' premises, and urinate on the walls and street indicate that patrons 
  are well past the limit at which they should have been cut off&#133;. I have 
  observed patrons outside the leased premises drinking&#133;. The Tenant routinely 
  leaves its business open beyond the licensed hours. </p>
<p>
  [15] Ms. Prokop deposed that the on-site superintendent for the building kept 
  a log of incidents involving the Tenant and attached, as an exhibit to her affidavit, 
  the log of incidents from December 15, 1999 to April 9, 2000. That log shows 
  eleven incidents of patrons vomiting or urinating at various places around the 
  building and two fighting incidents, both of which resulted in broken windows. 
  </p>
<p>
  [16] Also attached as an exhibit to Ms. Prokop's affidavit is the log from September 
  22, 2001 to August 29, 2002. That log shows: (i) seventeen incidents in which 
  patrons were vomiting, urinating and/or consuming alcohol at various places 
  around the building; (ii) an incident where five intoxicated persons were fighting 
  outside the building; (iii) an incident where a patron attacked a security/maintenance 
  employee; (iv) an incident where an intoxicated patron attempted to break into 
  and steal the vehicle owned by another tenant; and (v) an incident where a patron, 
  after consuming alcohol outside of the Tenant's premises, broke a glass bottle 
  at the entrance of the building. </p>
<p>
  [17] At paragraph 20 of her affidavit, Ms. Prokop explains that no log reports 
  were kept from April 2000 to September 2001 because the Landlord had several 
  temporary employees during that period.</p>
<p>
  [18] At paragraph 22 of her affidavit, Ms. Prokop states: &quot;In addition 
  to those incidents listed in the log I personally have witnessed numerous additional 
  problems.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [19] Marek Klimaszewski corroborates Ms. Prokop's evidence stating: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On numerous occasions I have seen patrons of the [Tenant] leave the leased premises 
  who were obviously extremely intoxicated. I have observed these patrons vomit 
  and urinate in the public areas of the building on numerous occasions. Often 
  patrons remove liquor from the premises. On one such occasion I was [attacked] 
  by a drunken patron.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Klimaszewski confirms that he kept a log of incidents involving the 
  Tenant. The log, attached to his affidavit as an exhibit, reports the incidents 
  he personally observed. At paragraph 3 of his affidavit, Mr. Klimaszewski states: 
  &quot;On many other occasions I came to the building and observed urine or vomit 
  on the premises or had the cleaner report their presence. I have also observed 
  empty beer bottles of a type of Polish beer sold by the Tenant scattered around 
  the property.&quot;</p>
<p>
  (ii) Complaints from other tenants in the building</p>
<p>
  [21] Ms. Prokop deposed that she had received numerous complaints from other 
  tenants about the Tenant and its patrons. She stated that another tenant in 
  the building cited the manner in which the Tenant and its business lowered the 
  tone of the building as one significant reason for choosing not to renew its 
  lease. </p>
<p> [22] After the Tenant filed its Application, Ms. Prokop approached tenants 
  that had previously made oral complaints and asked them to put their complaints 
  in writing. Numerous tenants responded. Ms. Prokop attached the responses to 
  her affidavit as exhibits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Letter from Ann Tessaro for Public Works and Government Services Canada 
    dated September 19, 2002: &quot;This letter is to confirm that Correctional 
    Services Canada employees have experienced problems with patrons of the bar 
    at 3050 Confederation Parkway. There have been instances of patrons harassing 
    employees with catcalls and whistles. Patrons have parked illegally in the 
    [handicapped-designated] parking spots.&quot;</li>
  <li>Letter from The Wisdom Center (tutoring center for children) dated September 
    18, 2002: &quot;[I]t's a matter of regret that recently we have received complaints 
    from different parents about the bar located at the entrance of the building, 
    3050 Confederation Parkway. The parents who come to drop off and pick up their 
    children, &#133; notice noise, drunk people and this type of environment is 
    giving a bad reflection on the children who come here for education.&quot; 
  </li>
  <li>Letter from Canadian Network Training Ltd. dated September 19, 2002: &quot;We 
    bring to your attention complaints forwarded to us by several of our evening 
    students who have consistently noticed issues relating to the unbecoming conduct 
    [or] behaviour of some of the patrons that frequent the [Tenant's] establishment. 
    Many of these complaints range from acts of a lewd nature to the outright 
    desecration of property, which is not courteous to witness. Consequently, 
    many of our students have reservations of leaving the building to [go to] 
    their parked cars alone after their training at night.&quot;</li>
  <li>Letter from Inter-Cultural Neighbourhood Social Services (Mississauga) dated 
    September 20, 2002: &quot;[W]e wish to register strong complaint concerning 
    the [Tenant's] establishment&#133;. As a community agency delivering programs 
    to seniors and pre-school aged children, among others - our staff is often 
    appalled at the state of the property around our site when opening the office 
    each day. Patrons of the licensed premises - upon leaving the bar, are often 
    so drunk that they are sick all over the concrete steps leading to our offices 
    - or in the connecting breezeway between the ground and mezzanine levels of 
    the building. On occasion, patrons of the bar have wandered into our offices 
    during the regular business day - in a drunken state - asking for someone 
    to telephone a taxi for them&#133; &quot;</li>
  <li>Letter from Dr. Henry Szczutkowski, dentist, dated September 23, 2002: &quot;I 
    am concerned about the customers of [the Tenant], because they are often drunk, 
    noisy, using bad language, and sometimes verbally harassing our patients that 
    are passing by the bar. Also, they are using the lobby of the garage as a 
    toilet. I think that these kind of activities are unacceptable in our neighborhood.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [23] Ms. Prokop further deposed that many other tenants who had complained to 
  her did not put their complaints in writing.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Police Attendances</p>
<p>
  [24] Mr. Siemiradzki, the Tenant's sole director and shareholder, filed an affidavit 
  in support of the Tenant's application. He deposed that he knew of only one 
  police attendance at the premises. He stated that, in or about May 2002, three 
  individuals attempted to enter the Tenant's premises. He refused them service 
  because they were intoxicated. The individuals began fighting in the parking 
  lot outside the caf&eacute;. He contacted the police, and was informed that 
  security had already contacted them and officers were being dispatched.</p>
<p>
  [25] At paragraph 25 of her first affidavit, Ms. Prokop disputed Mr. Siemiradzki's 
  contention that there has been only one police attendance. She stated that in 
  addition to the incident to which he referred, she personally called the police 
  on two occasions. The first call regarded a drunken patron who was driving erratically 
  at great speed around the parking lot and the second concerned a patron who 
  was so drunk that he could barely walk to his car.</p>
<p>
  [26] Attached to Ms. Prokop's affidavit is a police incident report. The report 
  indicates that there have been eighteen incidents at the Building since February 
  2000. Only six of the eighteen entries list a unit number; in all six of these 
  entries, the Tenant's unit number is given. Ms. Prokop deposes that since the 
  incident report was obtained, one further incident occurred in which the person 
  who operates the restaurant adjacent to the Tenant's caf&eacute; reported that 
  an intoxicated person attempted to drive away in his van.</p>
<p>
  (iv) Infractions and offences under the Liquor Licence Act</p>
<p>
  [27] Pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c.F-31, Ms. Prokop requested access to the Liquor License file with respect 
  to the Tenant. The file was provided to her by the Ministry and is attached 
  as an exhibit to her second affidavit. The file shows that the Tenant has been 
  the subject of seventeen Inspection Reports and three Notices of Proposal to 
  Revoke Licence. It also shows that the Tenant's licence has been temporarily 
  suspended by the commission on more than one occasion for such infractions as 
  serving liquor outside the prescribed hours and failing to clear the signs of 
  service and consumption within forty-five minutes of closing. </p>
<p>
  (2) Notice of Default </p>
<p>
  [28] In her affidavit, Ms. Prokop states that the incidents of the Tenant's 
  patrons vomiting and urinating around the Building and causing other disturbances 
  &quot;were repeatedly brought to the attention of [the Tenant] on numerous occasions. 
  There were constant promises to correct these problems but they never have been 
  corrected.&quot; Most of the notices were oral, as it was &quot;easier to deal 
  with the principals of the Tenant from time to time directly in Polish.&quot; 
  However, written notice was given on three occasions.</p>
<p>
  [29] In a letter to the Tenant from the Landlord dated January 13, 2000, the 
  Landlord states: </p>
<p class="indent"> As you are aware we have serious concerns about the impact 
  of your business on the building and its tenants. </p>
<p class="indent">We reserve the rights to require strict compliance with the 
  terms of the lease and in particular article 8. </p>
<p class="indent">We have previously had verbal communication and warnings. Please 
  treat this notice as a final written notice regarding the ways of conducting 
  the business in accordance with the rules and regulations failure of which might 
  lead to the legal action taken against you in order to terminate the tenancy.</p>
<p>
  [30] In a letter from the Landlord to the Tenant dated October 19, 2000, sections 
  8:02(a) and 8:03(a)(i) and (c) of the lease agreement are set out followed by: </p>
<p class="indent"> Not only&#133;[are you] breaking Building Rules and Regulations, 
  but you are also acting against the law. </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> constantly parking on the designated handicapped parking by the bar 
        employee</li>
      <li> allowing the bar customers to leave the premises with the bottles of 
        beer</li>
      <li> extended hours of operation (please provide us in writing about exact 
        hours for seven days a week) </li>
      <li>occasionally leaving garbage outside of the premises (rather than disposing 
        it immediately, [which] is interfering with the Health Regulations and 
        building appearance.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  [31] In a letter from the Landlord to the Tenant dated June 3, 2002, the Landlord 
  states: </p>
<p class="indent"> We noticed several disturbances caused by your c[u]stomers 
</p>

    
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> May 22, 2002 - completely intoxicated man urinated on the wall of the 
        building; </li>
      <li>Door facing North ([t]oward Tarbush Restaurant) is constantly open - 
        loud music and smoke is disturbing the c[u]stomers of other establishment; 
      </li>
      <li>May 25, 2002 - outside glass of your premises was broken; </li>
      <li>May 26, 2002 - your c[u]stomers occupied all designated handicap parking 
        spaces until 3:15 AM, then leaving the premises completely drunk was driving 
        around the Parking lot and almost caused the collision with the car belonging 
        to the Correctional Services (parked legally overnight by permit). </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
  <p>
  The letter requested immediate repair of the broken glass. The letter also reminded 
  the Tenant that the only permitted use of the leased premises, as per section 
  8:01(a) of the Lease, is a caf&eacute;/restaurant, and that the Tenant was bound 
  by all of the terms and obligations in the Lease.</p>
<p>
  [32] Mr. Klimaszewski stated in his affidavit that he brought each of the incidents 
  noted in his log report to the attention of Mr. Siemiradzki, the owner of the 
  Tenant.</p>
<p>
  (v) Other</p>
<p>
  [33] In Mr. Siemiradzki's affidavit filed in support of the Tenant's application, 
  he states that the Tenant's business complies in all respects with the business 
  contemplated under the lease. He says that the Landlord's allegations are untrue 
  and inaccurate. Apart from these general statements, he does not specifically 
  deny the allegations of over-serving, or that the Tenant's patrons are vomiting 
  and urinating around the building or causing other disturbances.</p>
<p>
  [34] Mr. Siemiradzki was cross-examined on his affidavit. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) he was notified of some incidents of patrons urinating and 
  vomiting outside the building. However, he never saw these incidents himself, 
  and when notified, he would clean it up immediately;</p>
<p class="indent">ii) he never saw patrons outside whistling or yelling at women;</p>
<p class="indent">iii) he was aware of fights between patrons;</p>
<p class="indent">iv) he was not aware of his patrons becoming extremely intoxicated. 
  However, intoxicated persons sometimes enter his premises; he always refuses 
  them service and asks them to leave; and</p>
<p class="indent">v) he calls a taxi about 100 times per week for his patrons.</p>
<p>
  [35] Ms. Prokop was cross-examined on her affidavit. For the most part, she 
  confirmed the evidence in her affidavit. She agreed that whenever Mr. Siemiradzi 
  is informed that a patron has urinated or vomited around the building, he sends 
  staff to clean it up. </p>
<p>
  [36] Mr. Klimaszewski was also cross-examined on his affidavit. He confirmed 
  the statements in his affidavit regarding the problems with the Tenant's patrons 
  urinating, vomiting and fighting around the Building. In cross-examination, 
  he testified that he called the police on two occasions: (1) when a fight occurred 
  between five or six people in the parking lot; and (2) when a patron tried to 
  break into the car of another tenant. He agreed that when the incidents of urinating 
  or vomiting were reported to Mr. Siemiradzki, the Tenant would clean up the 
  mess.</p>

  time as is otherwise provided herein unless such default reasonably requires

<p>
  OPTION TO RENEW</p>
<p  class="indent"> Section 18:01</p>
<p  class="indent">Provided that: </p>
<p  class="indent">1. The Tenant is not in default under this Lease;</p>
<p  class="indent">2. The Tenant is in actual possession of the Leased Premises; 
  and</p>
<p  class="indent">3. The Tenant has given written notice to the Landlord at least 
  one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the Term of its 
  intention to exercise the following options then: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The Tenant shall have the option to renew the Term for 
  five (5) years, such renewal term to begin upon the expiration of the Term and 
  all the terms of this Lease shall apply to such renewal term, except that &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) during the said renewal term, the Tenant shall pay Minimum 
  Rent equal to the fair market rent for comparable premises (without regard to

<p>
  THE ISSUES </p>
<p>
  [38] The central issue on this appeal is whether the applications judge erred 
  in finding that the Tenant validly renewed the lease.</p>
<p>
  [39] A second issue is whether the Landlord's acceptance of rent payments, after 
  delivery of the Notice of Termination, operates to bar the Landlord from refusing 
  to renew the lease.</p>
<p>
  [40] Third, if it is determined that the Tenant did not validly renew the lease 
  and that the Landlord was entitled to refuse to renew, the court must determine 
  whether to exercise its jurisdiction and grant equitable relief in favour of 
  the Tenant.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #1 - Did the Tenant validly renew the lease? </p>
<p>
  [41] Section 18:01 of the Lease gives the Tenant the option to renew provided 
  that the Tenant: (1) is not in default under the lease; (2) is in actual possession 
  of the premises; and (3) has given written notice to the Landlord, at least 
  180 days prior to the expiration of the lease term, of its intention to exercise 
  the option.</p>
<p>
  [42] The Landlord concedes that the Tenant met the latter two conditions but 
  argues that the Tenant was in default on August 1, 2002, when it purported to 
  renew the lease, and therefore could not validly exercise the option to renew. 
  </p>
<p>
  [43] After the applications judge set out the Landlord's argument that continued 
  over-serving of patrons by the Tenant and the resulting problems constituted 
  default by the Tenant, he concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have decided that the tenant is entitled to the declaration 
  which it seeks, in effect and in essence for the reasons set forth in the revised 
  factum of the applicant. It seems to me that the way in which the landlord ought 
  to have and may indeed in the immediate future ought to exercise its rights 
  under the lease to remove the tenant is to take those steps which are envisaged 
  by the lease itself and to give appropriate notices of continuity of breach 
  and then to take steps to seek removal. I don't think that's what happened here, 
  on the basis of the material which I have, which I find at least in part, more 
  than modestly puzzling; and in this regard I make special reference to the cross-examination 
  of Anna Prokop.</p>
<p class="indent">I have great sympathy for what may be the circumstances at least 
  as they are perceived by the landlord. I don't think any final determination 
  of the extent of &quot;misconduct&quot; on the part of the tenant's representatives 
  can be made on the material before me. I am not however prepared to conclude 
  that there has, on the balance of probabilities, been that outrageous reach 
  of conduct upon which the landlord seeks to rely in this proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [44] In the Tenant's revised factum, to which the applications judge refers, 
  the Tenant denied that it was in breach of the lease provisions and argued that 
  (1) pursuant to section 8:02(b) of the Lease, the Landlord was obliged to give 
  the Tenant notice of the alleged breach and sufficient notice had not been given 
  and (2) the Landlord had waived its right to forfeiture of the lease by accepting 
  rent after the notice of termination was delivered. Alternatively, the Tenant 
  asked for relief from forfeiture.</p>
<p>
  [45] Setting aside the matters of forfeiture and relief from forfeiture, which 
  are dealt with below as Issues 2 and 3, it appears that the applications judge 
  found the Tenant not to be in breach because: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the Landlord ought to have given notice of the breaches 
  and taken steps to remove the Tenant;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) he could not make a final determination of the extent of 
  the Tenant's misconduct on the material that was before him; and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) he could not conclude, on a balance of probabilities that 
  the Tenant was guilty of that &quot;outrageous reach of conduct&quot; alleged 
  by the Landlord. </p>
<p>
  [46] I will deal with each of these reasons in turn.</p>
<p>
  The Landlord's Giving of Notice</p>
<p>
  [47] The question for the applications judge was whether the Tenant was in default 
  under the Lease at the time of renewal. In answering that question, it appears 
  that the applications judge concluded that the Landlord had to give notice of 
  default and/or take steps for removal before it could rely on the Tenant's default 
  as a basis to refuse to permit the renewal.</p>
<p>
  [48] I begin by noting that nothing in the renewal clause requires the Landlord 
  to give notice of default. This is by way of contrast to other lease provisions 
  that expressly require that notice be given by the Landlord. For example, section 
  15:01(b) provides that the Landlord must give notice of certain types of default 
  and provide the Tenant with an opportunity to rectify before exercising the 
  right of re-entry. </p>
<p>
  [49] The Landlord's right, upon notice, to take steps to remove the Tenant or 
  re-enter is quite distinct from the Tenant's right to exercise the option to 
  renew. In the circumstances, the absence of a notice requirement in the renewal 
  clause strongly suggests that notice is not required. </p>
<p> [50] While there appears to be no Canadian jurisprudence on point, there is 
  strong English authority for the proposition that a landlord need not give notice 
  of the breach in order to refuse renewal. In West Country Cleaners (Falmouth) 
  Ltd. V. Saly [1966] 3 All E.R. 210 (C.A.), a tenant was found to be in breach 
  of its obligations to paint the inside of leased premises once every three years 
  or more often, as needed. The court held that as the tenant was in breach at 
  the relevant date, it was not entitled to renew the lease. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [51] I see no reason in law to impose such a notice requirement upon the Landlord 
  particularly where, as in this case, the Landlord has repeatedly made the Tenant 
  aware that it was in breach of the lease. </p>
<p>
  [52] Thus, with respect, the Landlord's actions (or lack thereof) in respect 
  of notice and removal are not relevant to the question of whether the Tenant 
  was in breach. The applications judge erred in relying on the Landlord's failure 
  to give notice when determining whether the Tenant had validly renewed the lease. 
  </p>
<p>
  Determination of Misconduct - (i) Burden of Proof</p>
<p>
  [53] When the applications judge says that he is unable to make &quot;any final 
  determination of the extent of [the Tenant's] misconduct&quot;, I understand 
  him to have concluded that he could not decide whether the Tenant was in default. 
  To so conclude, in the circumstances, is an error in law.</p>
<p>
  [54] Where, as in the instant case, performance of the lease covenants is a 
  precondition to renewal, the onus rests on the tenant to show due performance. 
  That is, the Tenant has the burden of proof to show that it was not in default. 
  See Fingold v. Hunter, [1944] 3 D.L.R. 43 at 46 (Ont. C.A.), in which this court 
  held that where &quot;[d]ue performance of the lessee's covenants is a condition 
  precedent....The burden is upon the lessee in such a case to show that he had 
  performed the terms upon which his right depends.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [55] Since the onus to establish that there was no default rested on the Tenant, 
  if the evidence was not sufficient to determine that matter, the Tenant failed 
  to meet its onus and the application ought to have been dismissed on that basis 
  alone.</p>
<p>
  Determination of Misconduct - (ii) Is the Tenant in Default?</p>
<p>
  [56] In addition, in my view, the application ought to have been dismissed on 
  the basis that the Tenant was in default at the time of renewal. </p>
<p>
  [57] In determining whether the Tenant was in default, one must begin from the 
  proposition that it is not necessary that the Tenant perform all lease terms 
  perfectly throughout the course of the tenancy. As explained by Lord Kerr in 
  Bass Holdings Ltd. v. Morton Music Ltd., [1987] 2 All E.R. 1001 at 1005-1006 
  (C.A.), what is required is that there be no subsisting breach on the operative 
  date: </p>
<p class="indent"> This brings me to the classification of breaches of covenants 
  by reference to the time of their occurrence and subsistence, on which the present 
  issues turn. As explained below, there is clearly a long-standing conveyancing 
  practice, going back more than two centuries, whereby tenants' options in leases 
  are made subject to provisos dealing with the observance of the tenants' covenants....In 
  all such cases the provisos link the required observance of the covenants to 
  a point in time in the nature of a terminus ad quem. This may be either the 
  date of the exercise of the option as here, or the date of the expiry of the 
  option, or, in cases of options for renewals or for the purchase of the freehold, 
  the date of the expiry of the lease. For present purposes the particular date 
  referred to in the proviso (the operative date) does not matter. What matters 
  is whether the breach (or breaches) of covenant on which the landlord relies 
  as precluding the exercise of the option has only occurred in the past, so that 
  its effect is spent by the operative date in question, or whether there is still 
  a breach (or at any rate a cause of action based on a breach, whether for forfeiture 
  or damages or both) which subsists on the operative date. I will refer to the 
  breaches of covenant in these two situations respectively as 'spent breaches' 
  and 'subsisting breaches'.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The upshot of [the] authorities is that spent breaches will 
  not destroy the tenant's right to exercise the option, but subsisting breaches 
  will....[T]he reasoning is in effect as follows. Firstly, it must be accepted 
  that absolute and precise compliance by the tenant with every single covenant 
  throughout the period of the lease prior to the operative date is virtually 
  impossible of attainment. If this were required as a condition precedent, then 
  the option would in practice be worthless or merely at the mercy of the landlord. 
  Therefore the parties cannot have intended that the absence of spent breaches 
  should be a condition precedent. Secondly, however, it is natural and sensible 
  that the landlord should require the tenant not to be in breach of any covenant 
  on the operative date and that all outstanding claims for breach of covenant 
  should have been previously satisfied, so that the lease is then effectively 
  clear. The proviso is therefore to be construed as intended to apply to subsisting 
  breaches, with the result that the relevant condition precedent is the absence 
  of any subsisting breach.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">But it must also be borne in mind that the condition requiring 
  the absence of any subsisting breach on the operative date involves not only 
  that any breach should have ceased, but also that there should be no subsisting 
  cause of action in respect of any breach.</p>
<p>
  [58] In considering the question of whether there was a subsisting breach at 
  the operative date, one must have regard to the doctrine of spent breach recognized 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in Sail Labrador Ltd. v. Challenge One (The), 
  [1999] 1 S.C.R. 265. At paras. 68 - 69, Bastarache J. stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> One example of the flexibility courts have applied to performance 
  in option contexts is the doctrine of spent breach. This doctrine mitigates 
  against the severity of the application of the strict performance rule to options 
  by preventing deficiently performed conditions precedent which have been remedied 
  by the time the option is to be exercised from rendering the option void. For 
  example, in Bass Holdings Ltd. v. Morton Music Ltd., [1987] 2 W.L.R. 397 (Ch. 
  D.), a lease contract included an option to renew provided the tenant was not 
  in breach of any of the tenant's covenants contained in the lease. The tenant 
  was at one time in breach of this condition because his rent was overdue. However, 
  he had remedied that breach by the time he sought to exercise the option. In 
  its interpretation of the contract, the court found that such &quot;spent&quot; 
  breaches do not prevent the exercise of the option. The language here may be 
  somewhat confusing. In reality, this doctrine simply provides that the option 
  clause is interpreted to mean that conditions precedent are met providing that 
  the positive covenants of the underlying contract have been performed at the 
  time of the exercise of the option. There is, therefore, no breach, even though 
  some payments were made late. Late payment can be remedied because this possibility 
  is implied in the interpretation of the option clause.</p>
<p class="indent">The doctrine of spent breach has also been recognized by Canadian 
  appeal courts. In Birchmont Furniture Ltd. v. Loewen (1978), 84 D.L.R. (3d) 
  599 (Man. C.A.), a lease contained an option to purchase &quot;provided there 
  be no default by the Tenant in any of the terms and conditions expressed or 
  implied in the within Lease&quot; (p. 599). The tenant had defaulted under the 
  lease, but there were no outstanding defaults when the time came to exercise 
  the option. The Manitoba Court of Appeal, per Hall J.A., confirmed the trial 
  judge's interpretation of the option clause and allowed the tenant to exercise 
  the option because the deficient performance of the lease had been remedied 
  prior to the exercise of the option. See also Petrillo v. Nelson (1980), 114 
  D.L.R. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [59] As well, in Jardine v. Attorney General for Newfoundland, [1932] A.C. 275 
  (P.C.) at 288, the court noted the importance of determining whether the relevant 
  conditions were &quot;broken once and for all, or were conditions of a continuing 
  nature so that the licensee was from the moment of the original breach of a 
  condition continuously committing a breach thereof.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [60] Moreover, if a tenant is in breach after the operative date but before 
  the lease expires, the landlord is entitled to refuse to renew the lease. In 
  Loveless v. Fitzgerald (1909), 42 S.C.R. 254, lessees gave proper written notice 
  of their intention to extend the lease. Subsequently, the lessees breached a 
  covenant in the lease not to assign the lease without leave. At the end of the 
  original lease term, the lessor refused to grant the extension and brought an 
  action for possession. The lessees submitted that since the breach occurred 
  after notice had been given, it could not disentitle them to the lease extension. 
  They submitted that the lessor could only rely on forfeiture and that forfeiture 
  had been waived by the acceptance of two rent payments. The Supreme Court of 
  Canada rejected the lessees' argument, holding that the lessees' right to extend 
  was dependent upon the lessees fulfilling the covenants until the expiration 
  of the original lease term. Since a covenant had been breached, the lessor was 
  justified in refusing the extension. </p>
<p>
  [61] Accordingly, in order to determine whether the Tenant was in default, the 
  following questions must be answered. (1) What is the &quot;operative date&quot; 
  for renewal? And (2) Was there a subsisting breach as of the operative date? 
  In answering this question, regard must be had to whether the breach was of 
  a continuing nature. A final question must be asked in order to determine whether 
  the Landlord can refuse to renew, namely, whether the Tenant was in breach after 
  the operative date but before the lease expired. </p>
<p>
  The Operative Date</p>
<p>
  [62] The operative date is a matter of interpretation of the option to renew 
  clause. </p>
<p>
  [63] In Advanced Car Specialties Ltd. v. Jakobsons (1982), 34 O.R. (2d) 630 
  (H.C.J.) the court was faced with determining the operative date for an option 
  to renew. The lessee had a right to renew its lease if it had &quot;well and 
  truly performed its covenants and obligations under the lease&quot; (at p. 631). 
  At p. 635, Cromarty J. noted that it was common ground that the operative date 
  must be one of: (a) the date the lessee must give notice to exercise its right 
  to renew; (b) the date of the lessor's refusal to renew; or (c) the expiry date 
  of the lease. On the facts of that case, it was unnecessary for the court to 
  determine the operative date because the alleged breaches had been remedied 
  prior to the earliest of the three dates. </p>
<p>
  [64] Applying the same logic to this case, the operative date would be one of: 
  (a) August 1, 2002 - the date the Tenant was required to (and did give) notice 
  that it was exercising its right to renew; (b) August 15, 2002 - the date the 
  Landlord informed the Tenant that it was refusing renewal; or (c) February 28, 
  2003 - the expiry date of the current lease.</p>
<p>
  [65] In my view, although not spelled out in the option to renew clause, it 
  is implicit that August 1, 2002 is the operative date. The renewal clause requires 
  the Tenant to notify the Landlord 180 days prior to the expiry of the lease 
  term (i.e. August 1, 2002) of its intention to renew the lease otherwise the 
  right to renew is lost. In addition, the renewal clause provides for arbitration 
  three months in advance of the lease expiry date if the parties are unable to 
  agree on minimum rent. It would make little sense for the parties to arbitrate 
  prior to the operative date. I note that, to the extent the parties turned their 
  minds to this matter, it appears that they proceeded on the basis that the notice 
  date of August 1, 2002, was the operative date.</p>
<p>
  Subsisting Breach</p>
<p>
  [66] The evidence on the record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that 
  the Tenant is regularly serving patrons after they are drunk. The Tenant continues 
  to run its business in that fashion despite numerous warnings, in writing and 
  orally.</p>
<p>
  [67] Where, as in this case, the breach is continued over-serving, it is no 
  answer for the Tenant to say that it cleans up the vomit or urine or replaces 
  windows broken by its patrons. The breach is the continued over-serving rather 
  than the situations that result from over-serving. In that sense, the Tenant 
  is continuously committing a breach.</p>
<p>
  [68] The Landlord may reasonably deem the continued over-serving of patrons 
  to be a nuisance or annoyance within the meaning of section 8:03(i) as it interferes 
  with the enjoyment of the building by the other tenants and their customers 
  and harms the business and reputation of the Landlord.</p>
<p>
  [69] The continued over-serving of patrons and the resulting activities of those 
  patrons in terms of urinating, vomiting and fighting in and around the Building 
  is also a breach of the Tenant's covenant in section 8:02(a) to conduct its 
  business in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the Building 
  as a whole. </p>
<p>
  [70] It may well be that the Tenant is also in breach of the covenants in sections 
  8:01 and 8:04(a) but that need not be decided in light of finding the Tenant 
  to be in breach of two other covenants in the lease.</p>
<p>
  [71] I have no difficulty in concluding, on the record, that there was a subsisting 
  breach on the operative date of August 1, 2002 due to the manner in which the 
  Tenant was running its business, that the Tenant was in default as a consequence 
  and that the Landlord was justified in refusing to renew the lease.</p>
<p>
  [72] The record also supports a finding that the breach continued after the 
  operative date but before the lease expired. On the basis of Loveless v. Fitzgerald, 
  supra, the Landlord is entitled to refuse to renew the lease on that ground 
  as well. </p>
<p>
  Outrageous Conduct</p>
<p>
  [73] The applications judge stated, as a further reason for granting the Tenant's 
  application, that he was unwilling to find &quot;that outrageous reach of conduct 
  upon which the landlord seeks to rely&quot;. This statement appears to be a 
  response to the Landlord's argument that very offensive conduct can amount to 
  a breach at common law even if it is not a breach of the lease. In light of 
  my conclusion that the Tenant was in default under the terms of the Lease, there 
  is no need to decide whether such a proposition is sound in law.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #2 - Is the Landlord barred from refusing to renew the lease?</p>
<p>
  [74] The Tenant argues that the Landlord's acceptance of rent after delivery 
  of a notice of termination extinguishes the Landlord's right to forfeiture and 
  serves to bar the Landlord from refusing to renew the lease on the basis of 
  breaches by the Tenant. With respect, it seems to me that such arguments are 
  misguided. </p>
<p>
  [75] A right of forfeiture may arise when a tenant breaches a condition or covenant 
  in a lease. The breach will give rise to a right of forfeiture if the lease 
  grants the landlord a right of re-entry upon breach of that condition or covenant. 
  In such a case, if the landlord, with full knowledge of the breach, subsequently 
  accepts rent payments, the landlord will be deemed to have waived its right 
  to forfeiture. See Jardine, supra, and Lippman v. Lee Yick, [1953] O.R. 514 
  (H.C.J.).</p>
<p>
  [76] Acceptance of rent by the Landlord after the known breaches is relevant 
  to the Landlord's right of forfeiture. However, forfeiture relates to the right 
  to terminate an existing lease term, not the option to create a new lease term. 
  The matter in issue on this appeal is not whether the Landlord waived its right 
  of forfeiture but whether the Tenant validly exercised the option to renew the 
  lease. </p>
<p>
  [77] The argument that acceptance of rent amounts to a waiver of the Tenant's 
  breaches, such that the Landlord is barred from raising the breach in the context 
  of lease renewal, is not legally sound. In Jardine, the Privy Council stated 
  that acceptance of rent payments with knowledge of a breach waives the right 
  to forfeiture; it does not waive the covenant or condition itself. The court 
  stated, at p. 289: &quot;In the case of a forfeiture clause, acceptance of rent 
  after a known breach of a covenant or condition is not waiver of the covenant 
  or condition or some part thereof, but waiver of the right to forfeit which 
  has arisen from the breach&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [78] In any event, the Landlord served a notice of immediate termination of 
  the lease as a result of defaults by the Tenant. As this court held in ARC v. 
  Delia Catering Inc. (1997), 14 R.P.R. (3d) 275 (C.A.), where notice of termination 
  is immediate, the subsequent acceptance of rent does not constitute a waiver 
  by the landlord.</p>
<p>
  [79] Finally, when, as in the instant case, the breach is properly characterized 
  as a continuing breach, acceptance of rent with knowledge of the breach does 
  not constitute waiver of the right to forfeiture. See Jardine, supra, at pp. 
  287-288.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #3 - Should the court grant relief for failure to renew the Lease?</p>
<p>
  [80] The court's equitable jurisdiction to grant the Tenant relief from a failure 
  to renew the lease properly is limited. One condition necessary for the jurisdiction 
  to be exercised is that &quot;the tenant has made diligent efforts to comply 
  with the terms of the lease which are unavailing through no default of his or 
  her own&quot;. See Ross v. T. Eaton Co. (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 115 at 125 (C.A.) 
  and 120 Adelaide Lease Holds Inc. v. Oxford Properties Canada Ltd. [1993] O.J. 
  No. 2801 at para. 9 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [81] The Tenant was in default under the terms of the lease as a result of the 
  Tenant's deliberate acts. It does not satisfy the condition. In the circumstances, 
  the Tenant has no right to equitable relief.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [82] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs of the application and the 
  appeal to the Landlord. Costs of the appeal are fixed in the amount of $6,000 
  plus disbursements and GST.</p>
