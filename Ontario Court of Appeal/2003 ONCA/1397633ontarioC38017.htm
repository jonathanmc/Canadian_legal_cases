<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant appeals against a judgment dated March 8, 2002 in which the 
  court declares &quot;that the [appellants] had no right to terminate the lease 
  dated August 7, 1998 on the basis of paragraph 5 of Schedule E to the Lease.&quot; 
  </p>    <P>
  [2] The March 8, 2002 judgment was granted on an application for relief from 
  forfeiture. In her endorsement, the application judge did not make a specific 
  statement to the effect that Oxford Properties Group Inc. and Patria Properties 
  Inc. (the &quot;landlord&quot;) were not entitled to terminate the lease dated 
  August 7, 1998. Rather, she made the following findings that are relevant to 
  the declaration:</p>    <P>
  i) the landlord had &quot;failed to prove the facts necessary to invoke paragraph 
  5 of Schedule E&quot;; </p>    <P>
  ii) the landlord was not acting in good faith because it was obvious that the 
  landlord had searched for a reason to rid itself of 1397633 Ontario Inc. (the 
  &quot;subtenant&quot;); and</p>    <P>
  iii) the landlord should have raised any issue relating to paragraph 5 of Schedule 
  E of the lease on a previous relief from forfeiture application that was dealt 
  with on September 11, 2001. </p>    <P>
  [3] In our view, it was not open to the application judge to make the declaration 
  contained in the March 8, 2002 judgment on an application for relief from forfeiture.</p>    <P>
  [4] As noted by the application judge, in terminating the lease by notice dated 
  January 23, 2002, the landlord relied on section 5 of schedule E of the lease. 
  That section provides as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 5. Termination</p>
<P class="indent">In the event the Tenant's annual Gross Revenue does not exceed 
  $200,000 by the end of the third full year of the Term or any year thereafter, 
  the Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon sixty (60) days 
  written notice to Tenant. </p>
<P>
  [5] We accept the landlord's submission that, because that provision is not 
  based on default or breach of the lease by the tenant, it is not a right of 
  re-entry or forfeiture and that relief from forfeiture is not therefore available: 
  see Maverick Professional Services Inc. v. 592423 Ontario Inc. (2001), 42 R.P.R 
  (3d) 59 (Ont. CA.). </p>    <P>
  [6] In our view, the only basis on which the application judge could have granted 
  the March 8, 2002 judgment was by treating the subtenant's application as a 
  request for a declaration that the landlord was not entitled to exercise the 
  right of termination contained in section 5 of schedule E of the lease. However, 
  if the application proceeded in that way, it was the subtenant who had the burden 
  of demonstrating that the landlord was not entitled to exercise the right on 
  which it relied. In that regard, the subtenant failed to adduce any evidence 
  that the Gross Revenue for the premises had reached $200,000 by the end of the 
  third full year of the term.</p>    <P>
  [7] Moreover, we accept the landlord's submission that it was not required, 
  as a matter of contract, to insist on audited or even certified statements of 
  monthly income in order to exercise its right of termination. Accordingly, the 
  affidavit from a representative of the landlord attaching copies of the monthly 
  sales statements from the subtenant and Ziam Enterprises Ltd. (the &quot;tenant&quot;) 
  was sufficient to demonstrate that the landlord was entitled, as a matter of 
  contract, to exercise its right of termination based on the information it had 
  received.</p>    <P>
  [8] While we agree that the application judge's finding that the landlord was 
  not acting in good faith was relevant and important to the subtenant's request 
  for relief from forfeiture, it does not justify the judgment that was issued. 
  Leaving aside the issue of the effect of an explicit finding of bad faith, we 
  are not aware of any basis for holding that absence of good faith precludes 
  a commercial landlord from exercising its contractual rights. </p>    <P>
  [9] Finally, we see no basis for any conclusion that the landlord was precluded 
  from exercising its right of termination because it failed to raise any issue 
  concerning Gross Revenue on the September 11, 2001 relief from forfeiture application. 
  As of the date of that application, the landlord had not exercised its right 
  of termination and it did not have the information necessary to permit it to 
  do so. More importantly, as has already been noted, a contractual right of termination 
  is distinct from a right of forfeiture. The latter is subject to the court's 
  discretionary power to grant relief from forfeiture. The former is not. Given 
  that the court had no power to grant discretionary relief relating to the right 
  of termination, we see no basis for holding that failing to rely on it as a 
  means of resisting the application for relief from forfeiture precludes its 
  exercise. </p>    <P>
  [10] In light of our conclusions, the declaration that was issued in this matter 
  cannot stand. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment dated March 
  8, 2002 is set aside. The appellant may deliver brief written submissions on 
  costs within seven days. The respondent may reply within seven days thereafter.</p>
