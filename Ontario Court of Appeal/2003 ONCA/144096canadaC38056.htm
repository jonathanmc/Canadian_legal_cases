<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John R.R. Jennings dated March 26, 2002.</p>
<p>MORDEN J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The three plaintiffs in this action appeal from a summary judgment granted 
  by Jennings J. dismissing their action for damages for wrongful seizure and 
  wrongful storage of aircraft on the ground that it is barred by s.106(1) of 
  the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.), which reads:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">No action or judicial proceeding shall be commenced against an officer for 
  anything done in the performance of his duties under this or any other Act of 
  Parliament or a person called on to assist an officer in the performance of 
  such duties more than three months after the time when the cause of action or 
  the subject-matter of the proceeding arose.</p>
<p>[2] The appellants submit that s. 106(1) has no application to the facts of 
  this case or, at least, does not have the same application to the two respondents, 
  Nelson Plamondon, a customs officer, and the Attorney General of Canada representing 
  the Government of Canada. It is more convenient to state the issues raised by 
  this appeal after I have set forth a brief statement of the basic facts alleged.<br>
</p>
<p>I FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The personal plaintiff, Ron Williams, is in the business of buying and 
  selling aircraft and aircraft parts and repairing aircraft. He operates the 
  plaintiff 144096 Canada Ltd. as Capital City Helicopters. The plaintiff 144096 
  Canada Ltd. (USA) was incorporated in the State of Delaware. Mr. Williams is 
  the president of both corporate plaintiffs.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In October of 1995, 144096 Canada Ltd. brought five Cessna aircraft into 
  Canada from the United States and landed them at the airport in Ottawa. Mr. 
  Williams said that that the purpose was to store these planes for the winter. 
  He did not intend to import them &quot;on a permanent basis&quot;. He obtained 
  permission from the customs authorities to keep the planes in Canada &quot;until 
  January 1996.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In January 1996, Mr. Williams had four of the planes flown out of Ottawa 
  with the intention of taking them back to the United States. The weather turned 
  bad and these aircraft returned to Smiths Falls, Ontario. By reason of mechanical 
  difficulties, the fifth plane could not be moved from Ottawa.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] On April 13, 1996, Mr. Plamondon, on behalf of Canada Customs, seized the 
  five planes and a helicopter owned by one of the corporate appellants on the 
  basis that there had been a breach of the Customs Act. The appellants commenced 
  a proceeding against the Minister of National Revenue under s. 129 of the Customs 
  Act to challenge the seizure. This proceeding concluded with a decision of Blais 
  J. of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dated August 31, 2000 in 
  which he held that the Customs Act had not been breached. The Minister of National 
  Revenue commenced an appeal from this decision but withdrew it on February 19, 
  2001.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The helicopter was returned to Mr. Williams on June 26, 2001 and the five 
  aircraft in August of 2001. The appellants allege that the aircraft while under 
  seizure were improperly stored and accordingly were damaged such that they are 
  no longer air-worthy. They are &quot;almost worthless.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[8] Mr. Plamondon also made a separate seizure. On May 1, 1996 he seized a 
  Cessna 185 owned by the appellant 144096 Canada Ltd. and returned it on or about 
  June 25, 1996.<br>
</p>
<p>II HISTORY OF PROCEEDING<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The appellants commenced this action on May 22, 1998. They amended their 
  statement of claim on April 5, 2001. The relief sought, as set forth in the 
  amended statement of claim, includes the following claims:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the sum of $500,000 for the negligent and/or wilful damage to the aircraft 
  arising out of negligent and/or wilfully wrongful storage;<br>
  (b) the sum of $1,630,000 for the loss of use of the aircraft due to the negligent 
  and/or willful acts of the defendants and due to wrongful seizure and for falsely 
  inflating the values of the aircraft in order to increase the penalties for 
  breach of the provisions of the Customs Act and the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c. E-15;<br>
  (c) the sum of $250,000 for damage due to wrongful seizure of the Cessna 185 
  aircraft;<br>
  (d) the sum of $250,000 for damage to loss of shareholder value due to the above 
  damage;<br>
  (e) the sum of $250,000 for punitive damages for wrongful seizure and heavy 
  and highhanded conduct by the defendants.<br>
</p>
<p>In the following two sub-paragraphs in the amended statement of claim the appellants 
  allege that all of the relief claimed is based on breach of common law rights 
  and rights under ss. 7 and 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
  The only addition to the original prayer for relief in the amended statement 
  of claim is set forth in paragraph (b) above.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The first statement of defence was delivered on June 25, 1998 and the 
  amended statement of defence, apparently, sometime in March of 2002. The plea 
  of s. 106(1) of the Customs Act was first raised in the amendment to the statement 
  of defence.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The reasons of the motions judge endorsed on the record after the hearing 
  read as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel agreed that if the motion to amend succeeded 
  they wished to treat the amended statement of defence as delivered, and to argue 
  the defendant's motion for summary judgment. With respect to the tort claims, 
  there is no dispute that the seizures took place in 1996, and that this action 
  was commenced in 1998. The defendant Plamondon is an officer as defined in s. 
  2(1) of the Customs Act. S. 106(1) of the Act requires that any proceeding be 
  commenced against an officer within 3 months of when the cause of action arose. 
  That was 1996. This action, brought 2 years later, is out of time as it relates 
  to Plamondon.</p>
<p class="indent">The Crown's liability can only be vicarious by reason 
  of the operation of s. 3(a) and s. 10 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings 
  Act. Further, s. 24(a) of the C L and P Act gives the Crown the right to raise 
  the limitation defence - see Al's Steak House v. Deloitte Touche (1997) 102 
  OAC 144.</p>
<p class="indent">For both of these reasons the tort claims are statute-barred.</p>
<p class="indent">The claim (amended) in para 1(f) appears to raise a 
  claim for damages for breach of ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter.</p>
<p class="indent">No facts are pleaded to support the claim.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming the challenge is to the validity of s. 106 
  of the Customs Act, there has been no compliance with the mandatory provisions 
  of s. 109 of the CJA.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless, s. 7 of the Charter does not apply to the 
  owners of the goods seized - the corporate plaintiffs. See Ford Credit v. MNR 
  1994 100 BCLR (2d) 162 at 173/4.</p>
<p class="indent">S. 8 is not engaged unless a privacy right is infringed. 
  Nothing in the material raises a privacy expectation. In this situation, there 
  can be no expectation of privacy in planes imported for leasing-out. Francoeur 
  v. Canada [1994] FCJ No. 695 (aff'd on appeal)</p>
<p class="indent">S. 8 has no application to a forfeiture order (Reg v. 
  Harb (1994) 88 C.C.C. (3d) 204) and in my opinion, to a seizure.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly there is nothing in the material to suggest 
  a valid Charter damage claim.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, under the provisions of Rule 20.04(2) and 
  (4) summary judgment will issue dismissing the plaintiff's action. The defendants 
  not asking for costs, none are awarded.</p>
<p><br>
  III STATUTORY PROVISIONS<br>
</p>
<p>[12] I have set out s. 106(1) in the first paragraph of these reasons. Other 
  statutory provisions which bear on this appeal are ss. 3(a) and (b), 10, 24(a) 
  and 32 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 and 
  s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38. These 
  provisions read as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Crown Liability and Proceedings Act<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Crown is liable in tort for the damages for which, 
  if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be liable</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the 
  Crown; or<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) in respect of a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, 
  occupation, possession or control of property.<a href="#1">[1] </a><a name="r1"></a><br>
</p>
<p class="indent">10. No proceedings lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph 
  3(a) in respect of any act or omission of a servant of the Crown unless the 
  act or omission would apart from the provisions of this Act have given rise 
  to a cause of action in tort against that servant or the servant's representative. 
  <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a><br>
</p>
<p class="indent">24. In any proceedings against the Crown, the Crown 
  may raise<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) any defence that would be available if the proceedings were 
  a suit or an action in a competent court between subject and subject; <a href="#3">[3]</a> 
  <a name="r3"></a><br>
</p>
<p class="indent">32. Except as otherwise provided in this Act or in any 
  other Act of Parliament, the laws relating to prescription and the limitation 
  of actions in force in a province between subject and subject apply to any proceedings 
  by or against the Crown in respect of any cause of action arising in that province, 
  and proceedings by or against the Crown in respect of a cause of action arising 
  otherwise than in a province shall be taken within six years after the cause 
  of action arose.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Public Authorities Protection Act<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">7.(1) No action, prosecution or other proceeding lies 
  or shall be instituted against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution 
  or intended execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority, or 
  in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such duty 
  or authority, unless it is commenced within six months next after the cause 
  of action arose, or, in case of continuance of injury or damage, within six 
  months after the ceasing thereof.</p>
<p>IV ISSUES<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The appellants' case was presented in fragmented form and the respondents' 
  responses to it were somewhat selective. In what follows I have followed a form 
  of organization intended to cover all of the issues raised and those necessarily 
  related to them.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The basic issue in this appeal is whether the motions judge was right 
  to dismiss the appellants' action on the ground that it was not commenced within 
  the three month limitation period provided in s. 106(1) of the Customs Act.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] In addition to pointing out that s. 106(1) by its terms applies only to 
  Crown officers and not to the Crown, the appellants submit that there are additional 
  reasons why it should be held to be inapplicable:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(i) With respect to the case against the Crown, the 
  liability is direct under s. 3(b) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. 
  Accordingly, even if the vicarious liability of the Crown for the acts of Mr. 
  Plamondon and other Crown employees would make s. 106(1) applicable (as to which 
  no submissions were made by the appellants), s. 106(1) is not applicable because 
  the Crown's liability is direct. The applicable limitation period would be the 
  six years set forth in the concluding clause of s. 32 of the Crown Liability 
  and Proceedings Act or, possibly, by virtue of the preceding part of the section, 
  six years under Ontario law. I assume it is the six-year period provided for 
  in s. 45(1)(g) of the Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Mr. Plamondon's acts respecting the appellants 
  were motivated by malice and intent to damage the appellants.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) By reason of ss. 1(a) and 2 of the Canadian Bill 
  of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44 s. 106(1) is invalid.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) The claims based on ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter 
  are not subject to s. 106(1).<br>
</p>
<p>[16] There are other issues to be addressed in the appeal, some related to 
  the foregoing, such as: (a) the validity of the respondents' position that the 
  Crown, in addition to Mr. Plamondon, is entitled to the protection of s. 106(1) 
  of the Customs Act; (b) if no federal limitation provision is available to the 
  Crown, a determination of the applicable provincial provision; (c) whether the 
  claim for wrongful storage, as opposed to wrongful seizure, is barred by the 
  running of a limitation period; and (d), whether the respondents may rely upon 
  the failure of the appellants to serve a notice under s. 109 of the Courts of 
  Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. I shall deal with these issues, where appropriate, 
  in the reasons that follow.<br>
</p>
<p>V ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>1. Is the liability of the Crown direct under s. 3(b) of the Crown Liability 
  and Proceedings Act and not vicarious under s. 3(a) of the Act?<br>
</p>
<p>[17] Section 3(b) is quoted above. It is difficult to see how, by its terms, 
  it could have application to the claim based on wrongful seizure. I should say, 
  at this point, that there is no necessary connection, in general or on the facts 
  of this case, between a wrongful seizure of property and a subsequent wrongful 
  treatment of the property. Separate acts are involved in each case. With this 
  distinction in mind, it appears, according to the wording of s. 3(b), which 
  includes &quot;possession&quot;, that the Crown could be liable under this provision 
  for damage to the aircraft while the aircraft were in the Crown's possession, 
  assuming that the possession was that of the Crown and not of particular employees.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] However, I am inclined to think that the better view is that s. 3(b) is 
  not applicable to this case. It is a provision that recognizes cases at common 
  law where the duty of the defendant to the plaintiff is direct and not vicarious, 
  as in occupier's liability cases. I refer to Hogg and Monahan, Liability of 
  the Crown, 3rd ed. (2000) at p. 130 which states that a statutory provision 
  in identical terms to s. 3(b) &quot;is for breach of occupier's duties.&quot; 
  At pp. 130-131 the authors say:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">What is covered here are the duties of care owed by an occupier of property 
  to persons entering the property. Breach of these duties would provide an injured 
  visitor with a cause of action against the occupier of the land, even if the 
  immediate cause of the accident was the act or omission of an employee of the 
  occupier. It will be recalled that it was the absence of any Crown liability 
  under this head that defeated the plaintiffs in Adams v. Naylor, [[1946] A.C. 
  543 (H.L.)] and Royster v. Cavey, [[1947] 1 K.B. 204 (C.A.)], the two cases 
  that finally drove the United Kingdom Parliament to abolish Crown immunity in 
  tort.</p>
<p>[19] I note that the section has been applied in cases that are not occupier's 
  liability cases: Mart Steel Corporation v. The Queen, [1974] 1 F.C. 45 (T.D.) 
  (claim based on nuisance) and Domestic Converters Corp. v. Artic Steamship Line, 
  [1984] 1 F.C. 211 (C.A.) (claim for damages to goods stored in shed owned by 
  Crown which collapsed due to accumulation of snow on the roof). In each of these 
  cases the duty of the Crown related directly to its ownership or control of 
  property.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] I also refer to Levy Brothers Company Ltd. v. The Queen, [1960] Ex. C.R. 
  61, result affirmed [1961] S.C.R. 189, where the Exchequer Court doubted that 
  s. 3(b) was intended to apply to cases based on claims for injury to, or loss 
  of, goods bailed to the Crown, assuming that the Crown is properly a bailee.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] The appellants' most specific argument in this part of the case is that 
  the Crown was a trustee of the aircraft in its possession and, accordingly, 
  responsible to the appellants for any damage resulting from a breach of that 
  duty. This argument is based on the recent decision of this court in Authorson 
  v. Canada (Attorney General) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 417. In Authorson the court 
  dealt with the question whether the Crown owed fiduciary duties in the context 
  of a legislative scheme for the administration of pension benefits for disabled 
  veterans and held that the Crown owed fiduciary duties to these disabled veterans. 
  In the present case, the appellants have not pleaded a trust or a fiduciary 
  relationship, and have advanced no evidence on this subject nor referred to 
  any law in support of their position, apart from Authorson, which is clearly 
  distinguishable on its facts.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Quite apart from the foregoing, one must consider on what date the limitation 
  period began to run with respect to the claim for wrongful storage. It cannot 
  be April 13, 1996, the day of the seizure of the five aircraft and the helicopter 
  because the storage only began on that date. The storage ended in June 2001 
  with respect to the helicopter and in August 2001 with respect to the aircraft. 
  The allegation is that the damage occurred when the aircraft were in the respondents' 
  possession. There is no evidence relating to when the damage ended. The action 
  was commenced in May 1998. In these circumstances I do not think that a summary 
  judgment can be granted based on the running of the limitation period in s. 
  106(1) of the Customs Act, assuming it to be applicable.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] In summary, under this heading, I have concluded that the claim for the 
  seizure of the aircraft does not come within s. 3(b) and, with respect to the 
  damage caused by the storage, it cannot be concluded at this stage of the litigation 
  when the limitation period, whatever it be, began to run. If s. 3(b) is applicable 
  to the claim based on storage, I observe, for the reasons given in paragraph 
  30 below, that the applicable limitation period would be six months as provided 
  in s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, and not six years as submitted 
  by the appellants.<br>
</p>
<p>2. Accepting that s. 106(1) of the Customs Act is applicable to the claims 
  against Mr. Plamondon, what is the applicable limitation provision relating 
  to the claims against the Crown?<br>
</p>
<p>[24] The respondents submit, and the motions judge held, that by virtue of 
  s. 24(a) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, the applicable limitation 
  period respecting the claim against the Crown is also the period provided for 
  in s. 106(1) of the Customs Act. The reasoning is as follows. Section 24(a) 
  provides that &quot;[i]n any proceedings against the Crown, the Crown may raise 
  any defence that would be available if the proceedings were a suit or an action 
  in a competent court between subject and subject.&quot; Because the &quot;subject&quot;, 
  Plamondon, has available to him the &quot;defence&quot; of 106(1), the Crown 
  may also rely on s. 106(1).<br>
</p>
<p>[25] While as a matter of principle and policy it makes sense to me that the 
  limitation period governing claims against an employee should also be applicable 
  to the claim against the employer based on the employer's vicarious liability 
  for the employee's tort, I am not sure that this is brought about by s. 24(a) 
  of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. I say this because the subject of 
  limitation periods governing proceedings against the Crown (as well as proceedings 
  by the Crown) is comprehensively dealt with in s. 32 of the Act, set forth above, 
  and while the pleading of a limitation period is often, in common parlance, 
  referred to as pleading a defence, the word &quot;defence&quot; is capable of 
  an interpretation that is confined to a substantive defence, such as a justification 
  that defeats a claim: Black's Law Dictionary, 7th ed. (1999) at p. 430; Jowitt, 
  The Dictionary of English Law (1959) at pp. 598-599; and Walker, The Oxford 
  Companion to Law (1980) at p. 346.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] In Al's Steak House &amp; Tavern Inc. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche (1997), 
  13 C.P.C. (4th) 90 (Ont. C.A.) Rosenberg J.A. dealt with ss. 24(a) and 32, among 
  other sections, of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. He gave as an example 
  of a defence covered by s. 24(a) the common law defence of consent in a tort 
  action based on assault. When it came to determining the applicable limitation 
  period in that case, he applied s. 32, specifically, that part of it which made 
  provincial law applicable, with the result that he held that s. 7(1) of the 
  Public Authorities Protection Act was applicable to an action against the federal 
  Crown. He did not hold that s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act 
  was made applicable through the application of s. 24(a). With respect, the motions 
  judge erred in interpreting Al's Steak House as holding that s. 24(a) made s. 
  7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act applicable.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The problem I have is indicated above. If s. 24(a) was intended to apply 
  to a &quot;defence&quot; based on a limitation provision, then a large part 
  of s. 32, which expressly provides for limitation periods, is unnecessary. This 
  supports the view that Parliament did not intend to deal with limitations twice 
  within a span of nine sections.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] In support of the submission that the respondent Crown may rely on s. 
  106(1) of the Customs Act through the operation of s. 24(a) of the Crown Liability 
  and Proceedings Act, the respondents rely on Al's Steak House &amp; Tavern Inc. 
  v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, supra and Patterson Estate v. Storry, [2002] 6 W.W.R. 
  183 (Q.B.). I have already observed that Al's Steak House relied upon s. 32 
  and not s. 24(a) in determining the applicable limitation provision. Patterson 
  Estate v. Storry, and the cases cited in it, most notably Scaglione v. McLean 
  (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 464 (Gen. Div.) which appears to be the first decision 
  in a line of cases to the same effect, clearly do apply s. 24(a) in determining 
  the applicable limitation period.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] I have stated my reservations respecting the application of s. 24(a), 
  but by reason of the lack of argument on the question and the respect properly 
  owed to decisions to the contrary, I do not express a final conclusion on the 
  question. For the reasons that I shall give, if s. 106(1) of the Customs Act 
  is not applicable, then s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, set 
  forth above, clearly is applicable. On the evidence in this case nothing turns 
  on which provision is applicable, even though s. 106(1) provides for a three-month 
  limitation period and s. 7(1) a six-month period.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] In my view, by reason of s. 32 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings 
  Act, s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act applies to this case. 
  This is clearly covered by Al's Steak House. I acknowledge that before us the 
  Crown did not rely on s. 7(1) of the Public Protection Authorities Act. It relied 
  exclusively on s. 106(1) of the Customs Act. It did, however, plead s. 7(1) 
  of the Public Authorities Protection Act in its statement of defence and I do 
  not see how we can ignore it. It takes precedence over any six-year limitation 
  period provided for in Ontario law and the six-year limitation provision provided 
  for in the concluding part of s. 32 can have no application because the causes 
  of action in this case arose entirely in Ontario.<br>
</p>
<p>3. What is the Effect of Mr. Plamondon's Alleged Malice and Intention to Injure 
  on the Application of s. 106(1) of the Customs Act?<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The appellants submit that the respondents are not entitled to rely upon 
  s. 106(1) because Mr. Plamondon's seizure and storage of the aircraft in question 
  was not &quot;done in the performance of his duties under [the Customs Act] 
  or any other Act of Parliament&quot;. Rather, the appellants submit that Mr. 
  Plamondon's actions were motivated by malice and an intention to inflict damages 
  on the appellants.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] The principal authority upon which the appellants rely is Al's Steak House 
  &amp; Tavern Inc. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, supra. At p. 108 Rosenberg J.A. 
  said for the court:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Crown has the protection of s. 7 of the Ontario Public Authorities Protection 
  Act for the claims based upon malicious prosecution by the Crown agents only 
  if the acts were done &quot;in pursuance or execution or intended execution 
  of any statutory or other public duty or authority.&quot;</p>
<p>[33] After referring to passages in Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, 
  Rosenberg J.A. then said at pp. 108-109:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, it is at least arguable that conduct motivated by malice is not 
  within the scope of the duties of either a government investigator or a public 
  prosecutor. If so, s. 7 may have no application.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As noted earlier, the plaintiff has pleaded malice on the part of both the 
  Crown prosecutor and the National Revenue investigators. It would not be appropriate 
  to strike out the statement of claim in relation to the claims of malicious 
  prosecution at this stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p>[34] The respondents submit that this argument is not in law open to the appellants 
  because the &quot;broad wording&quot; of s. 106(1) - &quot;anything done&quot; 
  by &quot;an officer&quot; &quot;in the performance of his duties under this 
  or any other Act of Parliament&quot; - covers the entire range of conduct for 
  which the Crown, as employer of the customs officer, could be vicariously liable. 
  My response to this submission is that there is substantially similar broad 
  wording in s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, as considered in 
  Al's Steak House, but the interpretation of acting outside the terms of the 
  statute was recognized and applied in that case.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] The respondents then submit that if Mr. Plamondon was acting outside the 
  scope of his duties, the action against the Crown would have to be dismissed 
  because there could be no vicarious liability in the circumstances. They cite 
  no authority for this. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that there 
  is ample authority which holds employers vicariously liable for the wrongful 
  acts (to use a general term) of their employees. The conduct of Mr. Plamondon 
  could be &quot;in the course of his employment&quot; but not &quot;in the performance 
  of his duties under&quot; the legislation, if these words are interpreted as 
  requiring good faith performance. See The Queen v. Levy Brothers Company Ltd., 
  [1961] S.C.R. 189 at 191-192; Boothman v. Canada, [1993] 3 F.C. 381 (T.D.); 
  Scaglione v. McLean, supra; and Atiyah, Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts 
  (1967) at pp. 196-202. Because the particular facts of this case have yet to 
  be found, this is not the occasion for making some of the fine distinctions 
  found in the case law on the subject.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] The respondents also submit that the appellants have not properly pleaded 
  this issue nor is there sufficient evidence bearing on it to defeat the motion 
  for summary judgment. I shall deal with these points briefly.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] As far as the pleading is concerned, it would have been better if the 
  appellants had delivered a reply in which they pleaded facts that showed that 
  the limitation period defences were not available. The ground is, however, covered 
  in paras. 34 and 36 of the amended statement of claim, which read:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">34. The plaintiffs state and the fact is that Nelson Plamondon has intentionally 
  or negligently inflicted damages and business losses to the plaintiffs by his 
  heavy handed and high handed conduct and by the wrongful seizure of the aircraft 
  in question.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">36. The plaintiffs state and the fact is that Nelson Plamondon and the Crown 
  in Right of Canada have negligently or deliberately cause[d] damage to the plaintiffs 
  by the aforementioned acts or omissions.</p>
<p>[38] As far as the evidence is concerned, I think that there is sufficient 
  evidence set forth in the affidavit of Mr. Williams. Some of it is as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) &quot;Nelson Plamondon lied to a Justice of the Peace in order to obtain 
  a warrant for the search and seizure of the aircraft and the business premises 
  of the corporate defendant, 144096 Canada Ltd.&quot; Particulars of the false 
  information are set forth.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) &quot;The defendants deliberately or negligently falsified the valuations 
  of the aircraft in order to inflate the penalties associated with the breach 
  of the Customs Act and the Excise Tax Act and in order to prevent the plaintiffs 
  from paying any such penalties being much too high and therefore continuing 
  the seizure for a lengthy period of time than would have otherwise occurred.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) &quot;The Crown could have released the planes at any time but did not 
  do so. It insisted on maintaining the seizure as security for the payment of 
  forfeit. &#133; There was no reason to keep the aircraft as security as the 
  companies had been in business for approximately 30 years and are solvent.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) &quot;Mr. Plamondon instructed the authorities at Smiths Falls Airport 
  to continue the seizure of [the Cessna 185 aircraft] although he knew at the 
  time that this aircraft was not one of the ones which he alleged breached Customs 
  Regulations or the Customs Act. I brought this to his attention immediately 
  upon hearing that the aircraft was under seizure. He seized it on the pretext 
  of having to verify that it was lawfully imported into Canada. This could have 
  been checked in a matter of minutes but he took almost two months to do this. 
  All of the documentation was provided to him to prove that it was lawfully in 
  Canada.&quot;</p>
<p>[39] The respondents did not deliver an affidavit of Mr. Plamondon in response 
  to the allegations of malice that are set out in Mr. Williams' affidavit. This 
  could be regarded as adding strength to the allegations and, at the very least, 
  it is hardly an example of parties to a summary judgment motion putting their 
  best foot forward. In their factum in this court the appellants stated as part 
  of the facts that &quot;[n]one of the allegations of fact that Mr. Plamondon 
  committed malicious or negligent conduct nor that the Crown failed to store 
  the aircraft properly are disputed in the material before the Court.&quot; There 
  is no denial of this in the respondents' factum.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] In summary, by reason of the allegation and evidence of malice and intention 
  to injure on the part of Mr. Plamondon, the application of the relevant limitation 
  periods must await a trial.<br>
</p>
<p>4. The Application of the Canadian Bill of Rights<br>
</p>
<p>[41] The appellants have submitted that s. 106(1) of the Customs Act is unconstitutional 
  on the basis of ss. 1(a) and 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights. In short, they 
  submit that s. 106(1) should be construed so that it does not deprive them of 
  their property rights. This point was not raised before the motions judge or 
  in the appellants' pleading (which did raise the Charter issues with which I 
  shall deal shortly). The appellants, once again, rely upon the decision of this 
  court in Authorson v. Canada, supra, which applied the Canadian Bill of Rights 
  to the legislation in question in that proceeding. The legislation in Authorson 
  did involve a deprivation of property rights. This decision is distinguish-able 
  from the present case on the short ground that s. 106(1) merely provides for 
  a limitation period and not for the deprivation of property rights. More directly, 
  s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights has no application to the claim of a 
  corporation: British Columbia (Deputy Sheriff) v. Canada, [1992] 4 W.W.R. 432 
  (B.C. C.A.) and Bertram S. Millar Ltd. v. The Queen (1986), 31 D.L.R. (4th) 
  210 (F.C.A.). The seized aircraft are owned by the corporate plaintiffs. Accordingly, 
  this ground of appeal must fail.<br>
</p>
<p>5. Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ss. 7 and 8.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] The appellants submit that all of their claims are based not only on the 
  common law, but also on ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter. The appellants submit that 
  by reason of the decision of this court in Prete v. Ontario (1993), 16 O.R. 
  (3d) 161, which held that s. 11(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 
  R.S.O. 1980, c. 406 (now s. 7(1) of R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38) should be construed 
  as not being applicable to claims under the Charter, s. 106(1) of the Customs 
  Act should be interpreted in the same manner.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] I do not think that there is any genuine issue for trial respecting the 
  claims under either sections 7 or 8 of the Charter. <br>
</p>
<p>[44] First, with respect to s. 7, assuming that by its terms it could apply 
  to claims such as those asserted in this action, it has been held by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada that s. 7 does not apply to a claim by a corporation: Irwin 
  Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927 at 1004 and Dywidag 
  Systems International Canada Ltd. v. Zutphen Brothers Construction Ltd., [1990] 
  1 S.C.R. 705 at 709.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] Second, with respect to s. 8 of the Charter, the appellants by their citation 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128 
  at 145-46 and their submissions in their factum, accept that the court must 
  address whether the appellants had a reasonable expectation of privacy with 
  respect to the aircraft. They have not, however, identified any material in 
  the record that would indicate that they had any reasonable expectation of privacy 
  in the aircraft. This was the motions judge's conclusion and the appellants 
  have not challenged this conclusion in their factum or in oral argument. Accordingly, 
  this ground of appeal must also fail.<br>
</p>
<p>6. Section 109 of the Courts of Justice Act <br>
</p>
<p>[46] Stated briefly, this provision requires that a notice of a constitutional 
  question be served on the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General 
  of Ontario as a condition of a court being able to adjudge legislation to be 
  invalid. The motions judge relied upon the appellants' failure to comply with 
  this provision as one of the reasons for dismissing the action and the respondents, 
  initially, relied upon it in response to the appeal. When the court brought 
  to the attention of the respondents' counsel that the legislation in question 
  was not liable to be adjudged invalid in the motion for summary judgment, no 
  matter which way it was decided, they withdrew their argument based on s. 109.<br>
</p>
<p>VI DISPOSITION<br>
</p>
<p>[47] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the motions 
  judge except in so far as it dismissed the claims based on the Charter, and 
  in its place I would grant an order dismissing the motion subject to the exception 
  relating to the Charter claims. I would award to the appellants their costs 
  of the motion and of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. I would fix the 
  costs of the motion at $7,000.00 for fees and disbursements, plus applicable 
  G.S.T. and the costs of the appeal at $8,000.00 for fees and disbursements, 
  plus applicable G.S.T.<br>
