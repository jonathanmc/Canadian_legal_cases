<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Paul U. Rivard of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated June 5, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MORDEN J.A.: </p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant is the landlord under a thirty-year lease to the respondent, 
  Leon's Furniture Limited, to run from November 1, 1970 to October 31, 
  2000, with two rights of renewal by Leon's for terms of ten years each. 
  The appellant brought an application before Rivard J. for a declaration that 
  the lease was terminated on the ground that Leon's had sublet the premises 
  to the respondent Marca School of Hair Design Inc. for the period September 
  1, 2000 to August 31, 2005 with a right of renewal for a further five years 
  without seeking or obtaining the landlord's consent as required by the 
  terms of the lease. Rivard J. dismissed the application. By reason of this conclusion 
  Rivard J. did not deal with a counter-application by Leon's for an order 
  granting it relief from forfeiture, if necessary, nor a motion by Marca, the 
  sub-tenant, for an order vesting in it a leasehold interest in the premises 
  in the event that the application succeeded and the counter-application failed.</p>
<p>
  [2] The landlord had earlier, in 1992 and 1997, consented to subleases between 
  Leon's and Marca respecting the landlord's premises at 2902-2904 
  Danforth Avenue, Toronto. The issue relating to the termination of the lease 
  turns on the proper interpretation of the 1992 and 1997 consent documents. The 
  application judge regarded them as authorizing the new sublease commencing on 
  September 1, 2000. For the reasons that I shall give, it is my opinion that 
  they did not authorize any further subletting beyond the thirty-year term of 
  the lease and that, accordingly, the landlord had not consented to the five-year 
  lease that commenced on September 1, 2000. Following this, I give my reasons 
  why Leon's is not entitled to relief from forfeiture and why Marca is 
  not entitled to relief that it seeks. I turn now to the facts.</p>
<p>The Facts </p>
<p>
  [3] The lease between the landlord and Leon's, which was to run from November 
  1, 1970 to October 31, 2000, with two rights of renewal for terms of ten years 
  each, covered several properties on Danforth Avenue in the City of Toronto. 
  The two properties in question in this proceeding are 2902 and 2904 Danforth 
  Avenue which, as the addresses indicated, are beside each other. They appear 
  to be referred to in the lease and in some of the documents relating to the 
  lease as, simply, "2902 Danforth Avenue".</p>
<p>
  [4] The habendum read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said demised premises for and during the term of THIRTY 
  (30) YEARS to be computed from the 1st day of November, 1970, and thence forth 
  next ensuing and fully to be completed and ended on the 31st day of October, 
  2000.</p>
<p>
  [5] The lease contained the following lessee's covenant respecting assignment 
  and subletting: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Lessee will not assign the entire term or remainder thereof without leave 
  and such leave may, notwithstanding any statutory enactment to the contrary, 
  be arbitrarily or unreasonably refused by the Lessor in its sole and uncontrolled 
  discretion. It is provided however that the Lessee may from time to time sub-lease 
  the demised premises or any portion thereof for such portion of the term not 
  exceeding in length of time the entire term less one day with the leave of the 
  Lessor which shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>
  [6] The lease contained the following provision respecting renewal: </p>
<p class="indent">
  PROVIDED FURTHER that with respect to Premises 2902 Danforth Avenue, the Lessee 
  shall have the right to renew the within lease for a further second term of 
  TEN (10) YEARS on the same terms and conditions save that the rental payable 
  shall be the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($20,000.00) per annum for said 
  premises, upon delivery to the Lessor of the Lessee's intention to renew 
  at least six months prior to the expiry of the first term of this lease, and 
  provided further that the Lessee shall have the further right to renew the within 
  lease with respect to said premises #2902 Danforth Avenue for a further third 
  term of TEN (10) YEARS on the same terms and conditions save that the rental 
  payable shall be the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS (20,000.00) per annum for 
  said premises, and save and except as to any further renewal, upon delivery 
  to the Lessor of the Lessee's intention to renew at least six months prior 
  to the expiry of the second term of this lease.</p>
<p>
  [7] Finally, the lease contained a proviso "for re-entry by the lessor 
  on non-payment of rent or non-performance of covenants".</p>
<p>
  [8] On July 6, 1992 Leon's and Marca signed an offer to sub-lease with 
  respect to approximately 6770 square feet at 2902 Danforth Avenue for five years 
  commencing on August 1, 1992 with an option to renew for a further three years. 
  This document contained the following condition: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Lessor consenting in writing to this Sub-Lease Agreement, or failing such, 
  the Sub-Lessor obtain [another version says "shall obtain] judicial approval 
  of the Sub-Lease Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [9] On July 14, 1992 Leon's sent to the landlord a draft copy of a sub-lease 
  from Marca to the Board of Education of East York of space at 2944 Danforth 
  Avenue, which was also one of the properties covered by the lease, then occupied 
  by Marca as a sub-tenant of Leon's and, also, the offer to sub-lease at 
  2902 Danforth Avenue between Leon's and Marca. In its letter to the landlord 
  Leon's said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We are sending copies of both subleases to you for your review in order to obtain 
  your consent to both as required under our head lease with you. If you have 
  any questions concerning the subleases, please do not hesitate to contact the 
  writer.</p>
<p>
  [10] The landlord signed a consent form dated August 20, 1992 to which was attached 
  a copy of the 1992 sub-lease relating to 2902 Danforth Avenue. It read: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#8230; [T]he Landlord having leased to Leon's Furniture Limited (the 
  Tenant) by Lease Agreement and Indenture dated September 13, 1970 (the Agreement) 
  certain premises, described in the Agreement and although acknowledges never 
  having received any net rental income whatsoever, hereby consents to the subletting 
  by the Tenant to the Subtenant of part of the leased premises for a term of 
  less than that of the term of the Agreement on the following terms and conditions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Consent is given on the condition and understanding that: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The Landlord retains its rights against the Tenant and is 
  not prejudiced in any way by this Consent in respect of its said right relating 
  to any act, omission or other breach by the Tenant of any of the terms of the 
  Agreement &#8230;. </p>
<p class="indent">2. This Consent shall not be deemed to authorize any further 
  or other subletting or assignment of or with respect to the leased premises 
  (emphasis added.);</p>
<p>
  [11] On the same day, August 20, 1992, the landlord signed a consent form relating 
  to the sub-lease of part of 2944 Danforth Avenue by Marca to the Board of Education 
  of the Borough of East York. In the heading of this document there appeared 
  a line reading: "EXPIRY DATE OF SUBLEASE June 30, 2000." The document 
  reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The Landlord] hereby consents to the subletting of the sublease by the Subtenant 
  1 [Marca] in favour of the Subtenant 2 [the Board of Education] for the leased 
  premises for a term less than that of the term of the Agreement on the following 
  terms and conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The Landlord retains its right against the Tenant and Subtenants 
  and is not prejudiced in any way by this consent in respect of its right relating 
  to any act, omission or other breach by the Tenant of any of the terms of the 
  Agreement &#8230;.</p>
<p class="indent">2. This consent shall not be deemed to authorize any further 
  or other subletting or assignment of or with respect to the premises occupied 
  by agreement dated October 13, 1970;</p>
<p>
  [12] Terence Leon, an officer of Leon's, admitted under cross-examination 
  that at the time of the 1992 sub-lease Leon's did not then know whether 
  it would elect to renew the main lease, which was set to expire on October 31, 
  2000. Joseph Chimenti, the sole officer, director, and shareholder of Marca, 
  also admitted under cross-examination that he did not know whether Marca would 
  want to enter into a new sub-lease for a term starting after August 31, 2000. 
  Mr. Chimenti also specifically stated that the 1992 consent was only intended 
  to be effective to August 31, 2000. He did not believe that the consent covered 
  the next ten-year term.</p>
<p>
  [13] In 1997, when Marca wished to sublet additional space at 2902 Danforth 
  Avenue (and 2904 Danforth Avenue) Leon's wrote the landlord on May 6, 
  1997 and requested the landlord's consent to the new sub-lease. The letter 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Further to our recent telephone conversation, this letter will 
  confirm that Marca Hair Styling School now wishes to sublease an additional 
  three thousand square feet (3,000 sq. ft.) from us at 2904 Danforth Avenue. 
  The term will run from June 1, 1997 until August 31, 2000 provided that we receive 
  the Landlord's consent to the sublease.</p>
<p class="indent">During our conversation, you indicated you felt that the request 
  was likely to be looked upon favourably since we are both familiar with Marca.</p>
<p class="indent">For your convenience we have drafted consents to the sublease 
  in duplicate for your review.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact 
  me. Otherwise we would appreciate obtaining the consents at your earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>
  [14] The landlord signed and returned its written consent in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#8230;[T]he Landlord having leased to Leon's Furniture Limited (the Tenant) 
  by Lease Agreement and Indenture dated September 13, 1970 (The Agreement) certain 
  premises, described in the Agreement and although acknowledges never having 
  received any net rental income whatsoever, hereby consents to the subletting 
  by the Tenant to the Subtenant of part of the leased premises for a term of 
  less than that of the term of the Agreement [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [15] Leon's advised the landlord that the 1997 sub-lease would expire 
  no later than August 31, 2000, which was less than the existing term of the 
  main lease. Once again, Leon's representative admitted under cross-examination 
  that at the time of the 1997 sub-lease Leon's did not know whether it 
  would elect to renew the head lease which expired on October 31,2000. Marca's 
  representative also admitted that in 1997 Marca did not know whether it would 
  want to enter into a new sub-lease for terms starting after August 31, 2000.</p>
<p>
  [16] In August 1999 Leon's agreed with Marca that if Leon's elected 
  to renew its lease with the landlord, it would sublet the same space to Marca 
  commencing on September 1, 2000. Leon's letter to Marca dated August 16, 
  1999 read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Further to your letter of July 23, 1999 and our telephone conversation 
  of August 13, 1999, this letter will confirm our agreement that, upon our renewing 
  our head lease with the Landlord, you will renew your sub-leases with us for 
  2902 and 2904 Danforth Avenue for five (5) years at $9.00 per square foot with 
  a second five (5) year renewal option at $10.00 per square foot. The remaining 
  terms of the lease will remain the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Would you kindly confirm your acceptance of these terms by signing 
  below.</p>
<p>
  [17] Leon's informed the landlord by correspondence dated October 4, 1999 
  that it was exercising its option to renew the main lease of 2902 Danforth Avenue 
  for a ten-year term. It did not inform the landlord whether it would sublet 
  the premises for any part of the ten-year term. On May 2, 2000 Leon's 
  further informed the landlord that it would not be renewing the lease for 2944 
  Danforth Avenue.</p>
<p>
  [18] The 1992 and 1997 sub-leases expired on August 31, 2000. The 2000 sub-lease 
  commenced on September 1, 2000. The renewal term under the main lease commenced 
  on November 1, 2000.</p>
<p>
  [19] Gary Blustein, the landlord's representative, stated on his cross-examination 
  that the period of August to December, 2000 was a difficult one as he was preoccupied 
  with the condition of his hospitalised son and another family member who was 
  stricken by a terminal illness. He was also contending with repair and lease 
  difficulties affecting 2944 Danforth Avenue. He did not turn his attention to 
  the sub-tenancy issue involving Marca until early January 2001 when his father 
  informed him that he had not received rent cheques from Leon's for 2902 
  Danforth Avenue for the months of November and December 2000. The cheques were 
  normally received by the elder Mr. Blustein on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>
  [20] On or about January 5, 2001, Mr. Blustein advised Leon's in a telephone 
  discussion that the rent cheques were not received for 2902 Danforth Avenue. 
  He also raised the issue that Leon's did not have the landlord's 
  consent to sublet 2902 Danforth Avenue. The landlord's correspondence 
  of the same date confirmed that any payments with respect to rent would be accepted 
  without prejudice to any rights the landlord might have. I turn now to the issues 
  to be resolved.</p>
<p>
  [21] The first issue is whether the landlord's consents to the 1992 and 
  1997 sub-leases authorized the further subletting by Leon's to Marca commencing 
  on September 1, 2000. If they did not, Leon's claim for relief from forfeiture 
  must be considered. Finally, if Leon's is not entitled to relief from 
  forfeiture, Marca's claim for relief under s. 21 of the Commercial Tenancies 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.L.7 must be considered.</p>
<p> Did the Landlord's Consents to the 1992 and 1997 Sub-leases Authorize the 
  Subletting by Leon's to Marca of the Five-Year Term commencing September 1, 
  2000 with an Option to Renew for a Further Five-Years?</p>
<p>
  [22] In addressing this issue I should begin with a statement of the application 
  judge's reasons. He accepted the submission of the respondents that, because 
  the landlord had confirmed in 1992 and again in 1997 that it had no objection 
  to Marca as a sub-tenant, the purpose of the sub-lease provisions in the lease 
  respecting the landlord's consent would not be furthered by requiring 
  a fresh consent to the 2000 sub-lease. He was of the view that the facts of 
  the case were sufficiently similar to those in St. Jane Plaza Ltd. v. Sunoco 
  Inc. (1992), 24 R.P.R. (2d) 161 (Ont. Gen. Div.), a decision of Borins J., to 
  be governed by the result in that case. Because the application judge's 
  conclusion is based squarely on St. Jane, I shall examine that case in some 
  detail.</p>
<p>
  [23] The central facts in St. Jane were as follows. The landlord entered into 
  a lease with Sun Oil Company Limited for the period of twenty-five years from 
  April 15, 1966 to April 14, 1991. The lease contained three successive five-year 
  options permitting the tenant to renew the lease on the same terms and conditions.</p>
<p>
  [24] In 1977, as a result of a restructuring of Sun Oil, it became necessary 
  for it to assign its leases to Sunoco Inc., a newly incorporated wholly owned 
  subsidiary of Sun Oil. In 1977, Sun Oil twice wrote to St. Jane asking for its 
  consent to the assignment and received no response. In 1978, Sunoco wrote to 
  the landlord to notify it that the lease had been assigned and to advise that 
  all aspects of the relationship would remain unchanged. Borins J. found that 
  Sun Oil's letters were received by the landlord.</p>
<p>
  [25] In February 1990, Sunoco wrote to the landlord to advise it that it was 
  exercising its right to renew the lease for the first of the five-year renewal 
  terms commencing April 15, 1991. This was the event that triggered the landlord's 
  application to terminate the tenancy on the ground that Sun Oil had assigned 
  the lease to Sunoco without the landlord's consent, contrary to a term 
  of the lease that stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#8230; AND The Tenant will not assign or sublet without leave except that no 
  subletting to one of the Tenant's authorized dealers shall require any 
  such consent.</p>
<p>
  and, also that the term had been breached by a subletting to two authorized 
  dealers concurrently.</p>
<p>
  [26] At p. 165-166 Borins J. said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  St. Jane's primary ground for seeking to terminate the lease is that its 
  assignment from Sun Oil to Sunoco on June 1, 1977, occurred without its consent, 
  as required by cl. (f). There are several reasons why St. Jane cannot succeed 
  on this ground. Before reviewing them, it is helpful to state a number of facts 
  on which they are based. The primary fact is that for 14 years St. Jane sat 
  back and accepted rent cheques from the assignee of the lease, Sunoco. It was 
  in frequent correspondence with Sunoco over that period. It was not until the 
  spring of 1991 that it complained that the lease had been assigned without its 
  consent. &#8230; As well, of course, St. Jane was notified of the proposed assignment 
  and its consent was requested, but it failed to respond to the request and, 
  until the spring of 1991, made no objection to Sunoco's right to continue 
  as a tenant of the property. Finally, because the lease and its extension are 
  disadvantageous to St. Jane, as the annual rent is much below the current market 
  rent, St. Jane has now raised the question of the assignment in order to terminate 
  the lease to enable it to attempt to obtain a higher rent for the premises.</p>
<p>
  [27] At p. 166 he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The purpose of a clause in a lease prohibiting a lessee from assigning it without 
  the lessor's permission is for the protection of the lessor. It is to 
  permit the lessor to ascertain whether or not the proposed assignee would be 
  objectionable as a tenant, or the business which it would carry on would be 
  undesirable: McCallum, Hill &amp; Co. v. Imperial Bank of Canada (1914), 7 Sask. 
  L.R. 333, 7 W.W.R. 981, 22 D.L.R. 203 (S.C.), at p. 208 [D.L.R.]. &#8230; As 
  well, I share the view of Herold D.C.J. in Ordex Developments Ltd. v. Sherwood 
  Communications Group Ltd., released August 10, 1990 [Docs. York 367752/89, M175623/89 
  (Ont. Dist. Ct.), that where a tenant requests the landlord's consent 
  to an assignment and the request is refused or ignored, the tenant may, after 
  subletting without the landlord's consent, bring an application under 
  s. 23(2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 232, to determine if 
  the consent was unreasonably withheld. Approached from this perspective, I am 
  satisfied that the landlord's consent was unreasonably withheld, and that 
  the assignment of the lease from Sun Oil to Sunoco was not in violation of cl. 
  (f) of the lease. </p>
<p>
  [28] Following this he said at pp.166-167: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The acceptance by St. Jane from Sunoco of rent for period of 14 years constitutes 
  the acceptance of Sunoco as the tenant and constitutes a waiver by St. Jane 
  of the forfeiture of the balance of the lease: Colwell &amp; Jennings Ltd. v 
  J.W. Creaghan Co., 28 M.P.R. 40, [1951] 4 D.L.R. 840 (N.B. S.C.) at p. 841 [D.L.R.]; 
  Roman Catholic Episcopal Corp. of St. Albert v. R.J. Sheppard &amp; Co. (1913), 
  6 Alta. L.R. 128, 3 W.W.R. 814, 9 D.L.R. 619 (T.D.); Mascan Corp. v. 278143 
  Ontario Ltd. (1984), 3 O.A.C. 225 (C.A.). Furthermore, St. Jane's delay 
  of 14 years in seeking to terminate the lease has created a situation which 
  would result in an inequity in favour of Sunoco were an order to be made declaring 
  its lease to be terminated.</p>
<p>
  [29] He concluded his reasons at p. 167: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It follows that St. Jane's application is dismissed and that the cross-application 
  of Suncor [Sun Oil's successor] and Sunoco is granted. Accordingly, there 
  will be an order declaring that St. Jane unreasonably withheld its consent to 
  the assignment of the lease from Sun Oil to Sunoco, that the assignment was 
  a valid assignment, that the lease is full force and effect, that Sunoco validly 
  exercised its option to extend the lease, and that Sunoco is entitled to possession 
  of the premises known municipally as 2665 Jane Street, North York, Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [30] The application judge in the present case, stated the "main issue" 
  before him to be as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Given that the landlord had already given consent in 1992 and 1997 to Marca 
  being a subtenant of 2902 Danforth, was Leon's required to obtain a fresh 
  consent to renew Marca's subtenancy in 2000?</p>
<p>
  [31] Soon after this, he quoted what Borins J. said at p. 166 of his reasons 
  on the purpose of a consent to assignment clause in a lease. He then said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [21] The Respondents submit that since the landlord confirmed in 1992 and again 
  in 1997 that it had no objection to Marca or its business, the purpose of the 
  sublease provision would not be furthered by requiring fresh consents in 2000.</p>
<p>
  [22] In my view, the fact situation in the St. Jane Place Ltd. case is sufficiently 
  similar to the facts of this case to warrant the application of the same principles.</p>
<p>
  [32] The "sufficiently similar" facts in the two cases that he observed 
  were, briefly: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Both leases were for lengthy periods and contained options 
  to renew (para. 23);</p>
<p class="indent">(2) "In the St. Jane Plaza Ltd. case, Borins J. said at p. 162: 
  "Provided that the lessee exercises its option to renew the lease, in reality 
  it is a lease for a term of forty years". Similarly, in the event Leon's exercised 
  its options to renew in this case, it was a lease for a term of 50 years" (para. 
  25);</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In both cases the landlord was searching for reasons to 
  terminate the lease because the rent was below market value and in neither case 
  was the assignee (St. Jane) or sub-tenant (this case) an undesirable tenant 
  (paras. 28 and 29).</p>
<p>
  [33] With respect, it is difficult to see what "principles" in St. 
  Jane the learned application judge had in mind. The possible factual similarities 
  do not indicate any principles. As I have said earlier in these reasons, I think 
  that the case must turn on the proper interpretation of the consents given by 
  the landlord. There is no mention of the terms of these consents in the application 
  judge's reasons.</p>
<p>
  [34] I accept that an important purpose of requiring a landlord's permission 
  for assignment (or subletting) is as stated in St. Jane but it does not, of 
  course, automatically follow if Marca could have satisfied these purposes, no 
  consent was required in 2000 or that the earlier consents carried through to 
  the final renewal term provided for in the lease.</p>
<p>
  [35] Further, I have difficulty in appreciating the bearing of the statement 
  in paragraph 25 of the reasons respecting this lease being for a term of fifty 
  years "in the event Leon's exercises its options to renew". 
  It may be that it is part of an implicit statement that the terms of the consent 
  have to be read as extending to a time just short of the fifty years. If this 
  is so, I shall address the point in the course of my interpretation of the terms 
  of the consent.</p>
<p>
  [36] The application judge's comparison of the case before him with St. 
  Jane does not consider what appears to me to be the essential reasoning underlying 
  Borins J.'s conclusion. This reasoning is founded on the fact that the 
  tenant had sought the landlord's consent to the assignment of the lease 
  and that the landlord had unreasonably refused to give it. Borins J. granted 
  an order on the cross-application of the tenant (assignee) declaring that St. 
  Jane had unreasonably withheld its consent to the assignment and that the assignment 
  was a valid one.</p>
<p>
  [37] In the present case, Leon's never sought the landlord's consent 
  to the 2000 sub-lease and, accordingly, in its counter-application it could 
  not claim a declaration that the consent had been wrongfully withheld. Rather, 
  Leon's sought, if necessary, an order granting it relief from forfeiture 
  of the lease.</p>
<p>
  [38] In short, I do not think that St. Jane is of assistance in resolving the 
  present case. As I have said, its resolution turns on the terms of the consents 
  to the 1992 and 1997 sub-leases. I turn to this issue now.</p>
<p>
  [39] The consent documents are set forth in paragraphs 10 (the 1992 consent) 
  and 14 (the 1997 consent) above. The duration of the consents is stated to be 
  "for a term less than that of the term of the Agreement". What is 
  "the term of the Agreement"? In my view it is the thirty-year term 
  in the habendum in the lease, set forth above. I say this because this was the 
  only term in existence at the time the consents were given. The possible future 
  terms that would result from the exercise of the option to renew were just that, 
  possibilities, and, according to the evidence of Terence Leon, referred to above, 
  in both 1992 and 1997 Leon's did not know whether it would in fact exercise 
  its right to renew. </p>
<p>
  [40] Other considerations support this interpretation. I refer to the following 
  provision in the 1992 consent: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2. This Consent shall not be deemed to authorize any further or other subletting 
  or assignment of or with respect to the leased premises;</p>
<p>
  [41] This appears to be a direct answer to the contention that the 1992 consent 
  covered any further subletting. Further, if the consent were intended to cover 
  a period just "less than" the term resulting from the exercise of 
  the two renewal options there would be no room for any "further or other 
  subletting".</p>
<p>
  [42] The consents have to be read in a particular context and not as unprompted 
  and unilateral gestures on the part of the landlord. They were given in response 
  to requests by Leon's for consents to two specific subleases. The first, 
  1992, was to end on August 31, 2000. The second sublease was to end on the same 
  date. These requests naturally assist in interpreting the scope of the consent 
  document granted in response to them. It makes eminent sense that they should 
  be read as covering a period ending just short of October 31, 2000, "a 
  term of less than that of the term of the Agreement", which is just two 
  months more than the termination dates of the subleases.</p>
<p>
  [43] With respect, it does not make sense to interpret the scope of the consent 
  to include a period of time slightly more than twenty years in addition to that 
  sought in the requests.</p>
<p>
  [44] I deal now with two specific submissions made by Leon's in support 
  of the view that the consents covered a period of time ending just before the 
  end of the second renewal term.</p>
<p>
  [45] First, Leon's submits that a fresh consent in 2000 was unnecessary 
  because the purposes of the requirement of a consent to sub-lease as set forth 
  in St. Jane were met, i.e., the landlord must be taken to have approved both 
  Marca and its use of the premises in the 1992 and 1997consents. In this regard, 
  Leon's contrasts the case of a proposed new sub-tenant. I have dealt with 
  a part of this argument earlier in these reasons in considering the application 
  judge's reasons but would add the following consideration at this point.</p>
<p>
  [46] In my view, quite apart from the time limit indicated in the consent itself, 
  it does not automatically follow that an earlier consent to a sub-lease to a 
  sub-tenant can reasonably be regarded as a consent for all time, particularly 
  in the case of a corporate sub-tenant. The ownership, management and employees 
  of a corporation can all change over time such that at a later date quite new 
  facts may be presented to a landlord whose consent to a sub-lease is sought. 
  Accordingly, it does not make sense that one consent should be regarded as good 
  for all time.</p>
<p>
  [47] I might add that even if the general purpose of requiring a consent could 
  be said to have been met in this case such that it would be reasonable to say 
  that it should cover the period to 2020, this would not carry the day for Leon's 
  unless the actual terms of the consent reflected this purpose. I have already 
  dealt with the terms, contrary to Leon's position.</p>
<p> [48] Second, Leon's bases an argument on a comparison of the form of the 1992 
  consent respecting Marca's sub-lease to the Board of Education of the Borough 
  of East York respecting the premises at 2944 Danforth Avenue with the consent 
  relating to 2902 Danforth Avenue which is referred to and quoted in paragraph 
  11 of these reasons. The former consent has the words &quot;EXPIRY DATE OF SUBLEASE 
  June 30, 2000&quot; in its heading, whereas the heading of the consent relating 
  to 2902 Danforth Avenue did not have wording of this kind in its heading. Leon's 
  submits that &quot;[u]nlike the consent with respect to 2944 Danforth, which 
  refers to the expiry date of the subject sub-lease, the consent with respect 
  to 2902 Danforth does not refer to the expiry date of the subject sub-lease 
  but instead consents 'to the subletting by the Tenant [Leon's] to the Subtenant 
  [Marca] of part of the leased premises for a term less than that of the term 
  of the Agreement [the Head Lease]'.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [49] With respect, there is no "instead" about it. There is no significant 
  difference between the two consents. The consent relating to 2944 Danforth Avenue 
  contains substantially the same operative language respecting the temporal scope 
  of the consent as the consent relating to 2902 Danforth Avenue, that is, "for 
  a term less than that of the term of the Agreement". The statement of 
  the expiry of the sub-lease does not make the 2944 Danforth Avenue consent different. 
  In this regard it may be noted that the 2902 Danforth Avenue consent had a copy 
  of the sub-lease, which was to expire on August 31, 2000, attached to it.</p>
<p>
  [50] Finally, with respect to what maybe considered to be the legal framework 
  relating to this issue, I note that it has been held that an option to renew 
  a lease, when exercised, results in a fresh demise relating to a new term: see 
  Avlor Investments Ltd. v. J.K. Children's Wear Inc. (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 
  225 (Gen. Div.) at 231. "Where a lease contains an option to renew the 
  lease the exercise of the option will ordinarily involve the creation of a new 
  lease, &#8230;" Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed (London: Butterworth's 
  1981), Vol. 27(1) para. 467 at p. 435. This supports the view that "the 
  term" in the consent was the initial thirty-year term in the lease and 
  that the renewal terms would be new terms.</p>
<p>
  Leon's Claim to Relief from Forfeiture</p>
<p>
  [51] By reason of my conclusion that Leon's sublet to Marca without the 
  consent of the landlord and that, accordingly, the landlord, pursuant to the 
  proviso for re-entry in the lease, is entitled to terminate the lease, I am 
  obliged to consider Leon's claim for relief from forfeiture.</p>
<p>
  [52] Before doing so I should deal with a preliminary argument raised by Leon's. 
  It is that its breach is not sufficiently serious to warrant the remedy of termination. 
  It cites Waddams, The Law of Contracts, 4th ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 1999) 
  at 425-26 and Wickham Machine Tool Sales Ltd. v. Schuler AG, [1974] A.C. 235 
  (H.L.) at 251. The appellant did not respond to this argument. I think that 
  it is answered by the parties' express agreement in the proviso in the 
  lease that the landlord was entitled to re-enter the premises on non-performance 
  of any of the covenants. The tenant's only relief, if any, must be sought 
  in the claim for relief from forfeiture to which I now turn.</p>
<p>
  [53] I should say at this point that what follows is my conclusion on the substantial 
  legal issues that were raised but not an ultimate resolution of the claim for 
  relief from forfeiture. This latter question turns on important issues of fact 
  which, on the materials before the court, I am unable to decide in a fair or 
  satisfactory manner. With respect to it, I feel obliged to direct the trial 
  of an issue under rule 38.10(b). It follows that, at the present time, it is 
  not known whether the respondent Marca's motion for relief under s. 21 
  of the Commercial Tenancies Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, need be heard and determined. 
  For this reason I would refer it for determination in the Superior Court, if 
  necessary.</p>
<p>
  [54] The most relevant statutory provisions concerned with relief from forfeiture 
  are ss. 20(1) and 20(7) in the Commercial Tenancies Act: </p>
<p class="indent"> 20(1) Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to 
  enforce a right of re-entry or forfeiture, whether for non-payment of rent or 
  for other cause, the lessee may, in the lessor's action, if any, or if there 
  is no such action pending, then in an action or application in the Ontario Court 
  (General Division) [now the Superior Court of Justice] brought by the lessee, 
  apply to the court for relief, and the court may grant such relief as, having 
  regard to the proceeding and conduct of the parties under section 19 and to 
  all the other circumstances, the court thinks fit, and on such terms as to payment 
  of rent, costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty, or otherwise, including 
  the granting of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future as the 
  court considers just. </p>
<p class="indent">20(7) This section does not extend,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) to a covenant or condition against the assigning, underletting, 
  parting with the possession, or disposing of the land leased; or to a condition 
  for forfeiture on the bankruptcy of the lessee, or on the lessee making an assignment 
  for the benefit of creditors under the Assignment and Preferences Act, or on 
  the taking in execution of the lessee's interest; or</p>
<p>
  [55] The landlord relies on s. 20(7) as a complete answer to Leon's claim 
  for relief. Leon's counters with the submission s. 20(7) does not stand 
  in the way of the application of the equitable relief from forfeiture provided 
  in s. 98 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 which reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A court may grant relief against penalties and forfeitures, on such terms as 
  to compensation or otherwise as are considered just.</p>
<p>
  [56] I acknowledge that the question is not free of difficulty but I conclude, 
  for the reasons I shall give, that s. 20(7) does not stand in the way of resort 
  to the equitable jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>
  [57] First, I note that the wording of s. 20(7) does not prohibit resort to 
  another source of jurisdiction for relief. It merely says that the "section", 
  itself, does not extend to the case described. It does not impose or provide 
  for forfeiture. Accordingly, the decisions relied upon by the landlord, all 
  of which held that the general equitable jurisdiction provided by s. 98 of the 
  Courts of Justice Act, or its predecessors, could not override statutory provisions 
  imposing penalties and forfeitures are not in point: Webb v. Box (1909), 19 
  O.L.R. 540 (Div. Ct.); McBride v. Comfort Living Housing Co-operative Inc. (1992), 
  7 O.R. (3d) 394 (C.A.); Taylor v. Ontario (Minister of Consumer and Commercial 
  Relations), [1997] O.J. No. 1444 (Gen. Div.); and Dovale v. Metropolitan Toronto 
  Housing Authority (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 181 (Sup. Ct.).</p>
<p>
  [58] I do not think that the issue has been resolved by authority in Ontario. 
  It is true that in Wakefield v. Cottingham, [1959] O.R. 551 (C.A.), in an appeal 
  by a tenant from a forfeiture order based on the tenant's subletting without 
  the landlord's consent, Porter C.J.O., speaking for a majority of the 
  court, gave s. 20(7) (then s. 19(7) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1950, 
  c. 199) as a reason why the tenant was not entitled to relief from forfeiture. 
  He said at p. 555: </p>
<p class="indent"> Further, the procedure provided in s. 19 for relief against 
  forfeiture does not apply to the covenant in issue. Subsection (7) provides</p>
<p class="indent">This section shall not extend, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) to a covenant or condition against the assigning, under-letting, 
  parting with possession, or disposing of the land leased.</p>
<p>
  [59] No express reference to the court's equitable jurisdiction was made 
  in either the reported argument or the court's reasons. I would point 
  out, however, that before he made reference to what is now s. 20(7), Porter 
  C.J.O. said: "I think Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son, [1891] 1 Q.B. 417 applies". 
  I discuss Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son later in these reasons. The court in that 
  case considered at length the equitable jurisdiction of the court and exercised 
  it in refusing relief from forfeiture. Accordingly, it may be that Porter C.J.O. 
  also exercised the equitable jurisdiction of the court in denying relief from 
  forfeiture.</p>
<p>
  [60] In the subsequent decision of this court in Pink Panther Food Corp. v. 
  N.D. McLennan Ltd. (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 651, the court approved the holding 
  in Wakefield that the court could not approve a subletting under s. 23(2) of 
  the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 232 (now s. 23(2) of the Commercial 
  Tenancies Act) where the tenant had not sought the required consents before 
  entering into the subleases. It addressed the equitable jurisdiction of the 
  court as follows at p. 658: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We should record that the present appeal did not raise before the judge of first 
  instance and does not raise before us any question of the possible invocation 
  of the equitable jurisdiction of the court to grant relief to a tenant who has 
  entered into a sublease and permitted the subtenant to enter into possession 
  of the premises without first seeking the consent of the landlord required by 
  the lease, and that nothing in our disposition of this appeal affects the possible 
  invocation of such equitable jurisdiction, if it exists.</p>
<p>
  [61] I should also refer to the judgment of Laskin J.A. in Re Rexdale Investments 
  Ltd. and Gibson, [1967] 1 O.R. 251 (C.A.) at p. 260 in which he referred to 
  the "possibility" of resort to the equitable jurisdiction of the 
  court to relieve from forfeiture in a case that might not be covered by the 
  relief from forfeiture provided for in the Landlord and Tenant Act. In addition, 
  I refer to Greenwin Construction Co. Ltd. v. Stone &amp; Webster Canada Ltd. 
  (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 345 (Sup. Ct.) at pp. 351-52 where the court, apparently 
  claiming more for Rexdale Investments than Laskin J.A. stated, held that s. 
  20(7) did not "occupy the field" and that resort could be had to 
  the equitable jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>
  [62] On the foregoing, it is fair to say that the point is an open one.</p>
<p>
  [63] I think that the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in the much-cited 
  case of Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son, [1891] 1 Q.B. 417, referred to above, establishes 
  that the equitable jurisdiction does exist in the circumstances of this case. 
  In Barrow, the tenant, in breach of a covenant in a lease, sublet part of the 
  leased premises without seeking the landlord's consent. The sublease was 
  prepared by the tenant's solicitors who omitted to look at the head lease 
  and forgot that it contained the covenant against subletting without consent.</p>
<p>
  [64] It might have been thought that the case would have been governed by s. 
  14(6)(i) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, c. 41 which was 
  in identical terms to s. 20(7) of the Commercial Tenancies Act in all of relevant 
  respects. It read: </p>
<p class="indent"> 14.(6.) This section does not extend -</p>
<p class="indent">(i.) To a covenant or condition against the assigning, under-letting, 
  parting with the possession, or disposing of the land leased; or to a condition 
  for forfeiture on the bankruptcy of the lessee, or on the taking in execution 
  of the lessee's interest </p>
<p>
  Section 14(2) provided for relief from forfeiture in substantially the same 
  terms as does s. 20(1) of the Ontario Act set forth earlier in these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [65] Lord Justice Kay, for himself and Lopes L.J., considered the court's 
  equitable jurisdiction and held that, on the facts, the tenant was not entitled 
  to relief in forfeiture. Lord Esher M.R. gave separate reasons for arriving 
  at the same conclusion. Kay L.J. addressed s. 14 of the Conveyancing and Law 
  of Property Act, 1881, as follows at p. 430: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now, by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, these enactments [earlier statutes] are 
  repealed; but a locus penitentiae is given to the lessee by requiring, in case 
  of any breach of covenant, that the lessor shall serve upon him a notice specifying 
  the breach and requiring him to remedy it, and to make compensation in money, 
  before exercising his right of re-entry; otherwise the High Court may grant 
  relief upon proper terms. But it is expressly provided that this does not extend 
  to a covenant against assigning, under-letting, parting with the possession 
  or disposing of the land leased. Forfeiture for breach of this covenant is left 
  to be dealt with according to the ordinary law and practice of Courts of Equity 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [66] Because s. 20(7) is a copy of s. 14(6)(i) in the 1881 legislation, I think 
  that it should receive the same interpretation. I have not seen any authority 
  that departs from or criticizes this holding in Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son. 
  In fact, it appears to have been approved by the House of Lords in Shiloh Spinners 
  Ltd. v. Harding, [1973] A.C. 691 at 725. I do not think that Barrow v. Isaacs 
  &amp; Son is distinguishable on the basis that what was s. 14(1) in the English 
  legislation (which provided for the service on the lessee of a notice specifying 
  the particular breach complained of and other matters) is s. 19(2) in the Ontario 
  Act and not in s. 20.</p>
<p>
  [67] Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son has been cited for its statement of the principles 
  of the equitable jurisdiction of the court relating to relief from forfeiture. 
  In view of what may reasonably be considered to be a re-statement of these principles 
  in Shiloh Spinners Ltd., I shall not relate what Barrow v. Isaacs &amp; Son 
  said on this subject. Shiloh Spinners Ltd. was applied by McKinlay J. in Liscumb 
  v. Provenzano et al. (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 129 (H.C.J.) whose judgment was affirmed 
  by this court (1986) 55 O.R. (2d) 404.</p>
<p> [68] In Shiloh Spinners Ltd., Lord Wilberforce put a modern stamp on the scope 
  of the equitable jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture that was wider 
  than that previously believed to exist: see Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity, 
  Doctrines and Remedies, 4th ed. (Sydney: Butterworths, 2000) at pp. 581-587.</p>
<p>
  [69] The core of Lord Wilberforce's opinion is set forth in the following 
  passage on pp. 723-24: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I would fully endorse this: it remains true today that equity expects men to 
  carry out their bargains and will not let them buy their way out by uncovenanted 
  payment. But it is consistent with these principles that we should reaffirm 
  the right of courts of equity in appropriate and limited cases to relieve against 
  forfeiture for breach of covenant or condition where the primary object of the 
  bargain is to secure a stated result which can effectively be attained when 
  the matter comes before the court, and where the forfeiture provision is added 
  by way of security for the production of that result. The word "appropriate" 
  involves consideration of the conduct of the applicant for relief, in particular 
  whether his default was wilful, of the gravity of the breaches, and of the disparity 
  between the value of the property of which forfeiture is claimed as compared 
  with the damage caused by the breach.</p>
<p>
  [70] The reasons as a whole appear to indicate that the strict view that there 
  could not be relief from forfeiture except under the two "classical" 
  headings of (1) where the object of the transaction and the insertion of the 
  right to forfeit is to secure the payment of money, and (2) the heads of fraud, 
  accident, mistake or surprise, was not endorsed. See, particularly, pp. 722 
  c-e and 724 e-g.</p>
<p>
  [71] I turn now to a consideration of the application of the principles relating 
  to relief from forfeiture to the evidence in this case. As I have said, I do 
  not think that I can decide the question in a fair and satisfactory manner on 
  the materials before the court and that the decision should follow the trial 
  of an issue. I shall now state the basis of my concerns. </p>
<p>
  [72] Is this an "appropriate" case in which to relieve against forfeiture? 
  In addressing this question, one would first consider Leon's "conduct" 
  and whether its default was "wilful". The landlord has submitted 
  that it was wilful because Leon's knew that the landlord was concerned 
  with the failure of Leon's and Marca to police the obligations to repair 
  under the sub-leases relating to 2944 Danforth Avenue and that, accordingly, 
  it did not seek the consent. (I shall say more on the subject of the alleged 
  non-repair later in these reasons.) Leon's evidence on this, given in 
  relation to whether there was a breach of the lease, appears to be that it misread 
  (as matters have turned out) the existing consents. For what relevance it may 
  have, I refer back to the evidence given by Marca's representative on 
  cross-examination that the 1992 consent was only intended to be effective to 
  August 31, 2000 and that he did not believe that it covered the next ten-year 
  term. As was noted in Shilo Spinners at p. 722 the heads of fraud, accident, 
  mistake or surprise "entailed the exclusion of mere inadvertence and a 
  fortiori of wilful defaults". On the record I cannot properly determine 
  Leon's state of mind on this question.</p>
<p>
  [73] With respect to the disparity between the value of the property of which 
  forfeiture is claimed as compared with the damage caused by the breach, I would 
  have to say that because the rent payable under the lease was substantially 
  less than that which would have been payable at current market rates, the loss 
  to Leon's would be substantial. </p>
<p>
  [74] I should say something about one aspect of the foregoing. Leon's 
  has argued that the landlord should not succeed because its motivation in proceeding 
  against Leon's is to rid itself of an unprofitable lease. Leon's 
  refers to previous proceedings by the landlord against Leon's in this 
  regard. I do not think that this is a relevant consideration. If the law and 
  the facts support the landlord's claim to termination of the lease, the 
  basis of its motivation is irrelevant.</p>
<p>
  [75] I turn now to what may be considered to be the composite subject of the 
  gravity of the breach, the damage caused by the breach, and (turning from specific 
  factors to the general basis of relief from forfeiture) whether "the stated 
  result" of the object of the covenant against subletting without the consent 
  of the landlord "can effectively be attained when the matter comes before 
  the court". It seems to me that these three matters overlap each other 
  in some substantial respects. </p>
<p>
  [76] On one level, it can be said that the breach is serious because the landlord 
  is saddled with a sub-tenant who has occupied and is now occupying the premises 
  without the landlord's consent.</p>
<p>
  [77] I think, however, that in addressing this question we should go deeper. 
  The covenant in question enables the lessee to sublet with the leave of the 
  landlord and that the leave "shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably 
  withheld". Further, in cases where the landlord does not grant leave, 
  the tenant may apply to the court under s. 23(2) of the Commercial Tenancies 
  Act for an order determining that the leave is unreasonably withheld and permitting 
  the sub-lease to be made. </p>
<p>
  [78] On the evidence, it appears that the landlord would not have granted its 
  consent to the sub-lease and so the question is: what would a court have decided 
  on an application under s. 23(2)? If the answer is that the court would have 
  permitted the sub-lease to be made, then it could be said that the gravity of, 
  or the damage caused by, the breach is not serious. </p>
<p>
  [79] It may be that this line of inquiry ending with this conclusion does not 
  literally satisfy the requirements of "obtaining" before the court 
  the "stated result" but I think that it serves the same purpose. 
  </p>
<p>
  [80] Following on from this, the question is what would the result of a s. 23(2) 
  application have been in this case?</p>
<p>
  [81] The landlord's reason why it would not consent to the sub-lease to 
  Marca is its position that Marca was in breach of its repair obligations under 
  the sub-lease of 2944 Danforth Avenue. There is dispute in the evidence with 
  respect to the nature and extent of the alleged disrepair. Marca submits that 
  when it vacated the premises at 2944 Danforth Avenue they were in better condition 
  than when the sub-lease began and, further, the landlord never raised any concerns 
  about the state of disrepair before May 2000.</p>
<p>
  [82] Further, there is evidence the landlord could not have had any real concern 
  with Marca as an occupier of its building because the landlord's representative 
  had said that if Marca were interested in moving back to 2944 Danforth Avenue, 
  maybe a deal with it could be made.</p>
<p>
  [83] Related to the foregoing, the landlord did, in fact, ultimately enter into 
  a direct lease of 2944 Danforth Avenue with the school board, the occupier of 
  the premises when a substantial part of the alleged non-repair occurred. Further, 
  no claim for non-repair was ultimately made against Leon's and Marca. 
  This, it is submitted, shows that the alleged non-repair could not have been 
  significant. </p>
<p>
  [84] With respect with the foregoing, the landlord's position is that 
  it was obliged, because of economic pressure, to make a deal with the school 
  board and this involved the landlord assuming part of the cost of the repairs 
  and not asserting a claim against Leon's and Marca because this would 
  have enabled them to pursue a claim for indemnity against the school board. 
  </p>
<p>
  [85] Marca submits, further, that the alleged repairs relate to capital improvements 
  respecting the elevators, electrical and mechanical features of the building, 
  and the roof and walls, all of which are the landlord's obligation. </p>
<p>
  [86] Leon's advances the further position that the disrepair at 2944 Danforth 
  Avenue should not be a relevant consideration because it does not relate to 
  the particular premises in question in this proceeding, those at 2902-2904 Danforth 
  Avenue (albeit that both properties were covered by the same lease) and, further, 
  that their repair obligations had been "passed on" to the school 
  board, the sub-tenant. I do not think that it is necessarily an answer to the 
  landlord's concerns with respect to the suitability of Marca as a tenant 
  that the non-repair occurred at 2944 Danforth Avenue and not at the leased premises. 
  It is open to a court to conclude that it has some bearing on the suitability 
  on Marca as a sub-tenant of the premises in question.</p>
<p>
  [87] Further, assuming it to be the case that all of the alleged non-repair 
  occurred while the school board was the sole occupant of 2944 Danforth Avenue, 
  this does not absolve Marca from responsibility respecting the non-repair. The 
  1992 sub-lease between Marca and the school board included a covenant by the 
  board to repair and the sub-lease also provided that the board covenanted to 
  indemnify and save Marca harmless "from all claims, actions, costs and 
  losses &#8230;. arising during the Term". The foregoing position is reflected 
  in a letter from Leon's to Marca dated August 24, 2000 which forwarded 
  the landlord's specific request for repairs at 2944 Danforth Avenue and 
  reminded Marca that its obligations under the sub-lease included repair, replacement 
  and indemnification and requested Marca to "make the appropriate repairs 
  consistent with your obligations under your lease". </p>
<p>
  [88] The foregoing respecting the nature, extent, and responsibility for the 
  alleged non-repair cannot be properly determined on the materials before the 
  court.</p>
<p>
  [89] With respect to the governing principles relating to an application under 
  s. 23(2) I refer to Federal Business Development Bank v. Starr (1988), 65 O.R. 
  (2d) 793 (C.A.) in which this court affirmed a judgment of Donnelly J. reported 
  at 55 O.R. (2d) 65 (H.C.J.) in which he said at pp. 72-73: </p>
<p class="indent"> These cases illustrate that the test of a landlord's reasonableness 
  extends beyond and is moving away from the restrictive two-part test based on 
  the personality of the proposed assignee or the intended use of the premises 
  as established in the early English authorities.</p>
<p class="indent">The more liberal approach, close to the "reasonable man" standard, 
  is to consider the surrounding circumstances, the commercial realities of the 
  market-place and the economic impact of an assignment on the landlord. ..</p>
<p>
  [90] The cases reviewed by Donnelly J. show that the onus of demonstrating that 
  a landlord's refusal is unreasonable rests upon the applicant for an order 
  under s. 23(2).</p>
<p>
  [91] With reference to the foregoing, I feel obliged to refer to the following 
  statement of the application judge, which was made in the context of his consideration 
  of whether Leon's had breached the lease. "In this case, there is 
  no evidence that Marca was an undesirable tenant, nor is there any reason given 
  by the landlord for refusing to consent to the sublease". With respect, 
  quite apart from the consideration that the landlord was not asked for its consent, 
  I do not read the record the same way. What the findings on the evidence should 
  be is, of course, another matter.</p>
<p>
  [92] The onus on Leon's to satisfy the court that it is entitled to relief 
  from forfeiture is a particularly heavy one. With respect to the s. 23(2) aspect, 
  the onus, as I have just noted, would have been on Leon's. This is reinforced 
  by the burden on Leon's now to satisfy the court it is entitled to relief 
  from forfeiture. It must be kept in mind that the cause of this proceeding is 
  Leon's failure to seek consent at the proper time. I do not think that 
  any doubts on the significance of evidence and the weight to be assigned to 
  relevant factors should be resolved in its favour.</p>
<p>
  [93] In the foregoing, I have referred to certain key factual issues relating 
  to relief from forfeiture that I am unable to resolve on the state of record 
  before the court. I recognize that there may be other relevant factual issues. 
  After the facts have been found, the decision whether or not to grant relief 
  from forfeiture is a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised within the 
  framework of the relevant equitable principles. I have set forth the major principles. 
  I recognize, further, the possibility that after all the facts have been found 
  other principles may be seen to be relevant to the exercise of the discretion.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [94] For the foregoing reasons, I would: (1) allow the appeal, set aside the 
  judgment below, and in its place grant a declaration that the lease dated October 
  13, 1970 with respect to the premises at 2902/2904 Danforth Avenue, Toronto, 
  has been terminated and that the appellant is entitled to possession of these 
  premises, unless the respondent Leon's Furniture Limited obtains an order 
  granting it relief from forfeiture; (2) direct that Leon's Furniture Limited's 
  claim for relief from forfeiture proceed to trial in the Superior Court of Justice 
  and that its application be adjourned to the Superior Court for this purpose; 
  (3) direct that Marca School of Hair Design Inc.'s motion for leave under 
  s. 21 of the Commercial Tenancies Act also be determined in the Superior Court 
  of Justice, should Leon's Furniture Limited claim for relief for forfeiture 
  be dismissed; (4) direct that any of the parties may make a motion in the Superior 
  Court of Justice for an order directing what steps, if any, ought to be taken 
  respecting pleadings and discovery before trial; and (5) reserve to the trial 
  judge the determination of the costs of the original application, of this appeal, 
  and of the trial.</p>
