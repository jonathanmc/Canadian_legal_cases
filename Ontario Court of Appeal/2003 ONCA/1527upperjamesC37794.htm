<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Under the operative paragraph of the agreement of purchase and sale, the 
  appellant was entitled to easements to park "up to a maximum of 36 vehicles". 
  After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge found that the appellant's loss 
  under this head of damages was limited to the value of the equivalent of 20 
  parking spaces. In doing so, he specifically accepted expert evidence that, 
  having regard to the appellant's practice of using 16 parking spaces in front 
  of its building, the loss of 36 parking spaces should be reduced by reference 
  to those 16 spaces, and concluded that the appellant's damages for loss of the 
  parking rights should therefore be calculated on the basis of 20 lost parking 
  spaces, which he found to be $40,650. No issue was taken before us regarding 
  the propriety of that figure.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge further found that the appellant had failed to prove any 
  claim for damages for diminution in the value of its property resulting from 
  the potential impairment of the operation or sale of its banquet hall by reason 
  of insufficient parking facilities. In doing so, he specifically accepted expert 
  evidence that the compensation for the value of the lost parking spaces made 
  up for the diminution of the capital value of the remaining property, and concluded 
  that the appellant had not proved any damages in support of its claim for injurious 
  affection.</p>
<p>[3] In our view, there was acceptable credible evidence before the trial judge 
  on which he could make these findings and reach these conclusions, and he committed 
  no palpable and overriding error in doing so.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed, with costs, fixed in the sum of $11,000, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
