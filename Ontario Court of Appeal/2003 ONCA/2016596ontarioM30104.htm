<p>O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  [1]	This is a motion by Wildlands League ("Wildlands") for leave
  to intervene as a friend of the court on a leave to appeal motion brought by
  Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario as represented by the Minister of
  Natural Resources ("MNR"), and if the MNR is granted leave to appeal,
  on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [2] The motion is brought under Rule 13.02 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  13.02 Any person may, with leave of a judge or at the invitation of the presiding
  judge or master, and without becoming a party to the proceeding, intervene
  as a friend of the court for the purpose of rendering assistance to the court
  by way of argument.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the leave application in which the proposed intervener seeks to participate,
  the MNR requests leave to appeal the order of Stortini J., dated April 4, 2003,
  which was issued in an application for judicial review brought by the respondent
  on this motion and on the leave motion, 2016596 Ontario Inc. ("the company").
  The company owns approximately 46 000 acres of land immediately to the east
  of Lake Superior Provincial Park ("Park") for the purpose of harvesting
  timber. It requested, among other things, a declaration that it is entitled
  to use the Sand River Road ("Road"), which runs through a portion
  of the Park. The company's position before Stortini J. was that it is
  entitled to use the Road in order to transport crew and equipment to its forestry
  operations pursuant to the terms of the Lake Superior Provincial Park Management
  Plan, 1995. </p>
<p>
  [4]	Stortini J. granted the company's application and declared that it
  is entitled to use the Road as a forest access road to travel to and from its
  lands east of the park. Stortini J. further declared that the terms and conditions
  of the use of the Road are set out in the 1995 Lake Superior Provincial Park
  Management Plan, under the heading "Sand River Road".</p>
<p>
  [5]	The MNR supports Wildlands' motion for leave to intervene as a friend
  of the court on the motion for leave to appeal Stortini J.'s order, and
  if leave is granted, on the appeal. The company opposes the intervention motion. </p>
<p>
  [6] The test to be applied on motions such as this is set out by Dubin C.J.O.
  in Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Canada Ltd. (1990),
  74 O.R. (2d) 164 (C.A.) at p. 167: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Although much has been written as to the proper matters to be considered in
  determining whether an application for intervention should be granted, in the
  end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are the nature of the case,
  the issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being able to make
  a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing injustice
  to the immediate parties. </p>
<p>
  [7] The considerations that apply in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal
  were recently noted by Weiler J.A. in Iness v. Canadian Housing and Mortgage
  Corporation (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 255 (C.A.). She stated at p. 258 that matters
  considered in granting leave include: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) whether the Divisional Court exercised appellate jurisdiction (in which
  case the applicant for leave is seeking a second appeal) or whether the Divisional
  Court was sitting as a court of original jurisdiction; (b) whether the appeal
  involves the interpretation of a statute or regulation including its constitutionality;
  (c) the interpretation, clarification or propounding of some general rule or
  principle of law; and (d) whether the interpretation of the law or agreement
  in issue is of significance only to the parties or whether a question of general
  interest to the public or a broad segment of the public would be settled for
  the future. </p>
<p>
  [8] In its factum on the leave motion, the company argues that the MNR has
  failed to provide any evidence of the public importance of the proposed appeal
  and has failed to even address the issue in its factum on the leave motion. </p>
<p>
  [9] Wildlands submits that it will assist the court in deciding the leave motion
  by demonstrating that the issues on the motion engage the public interest.
  Wildlands further argues that if it is granted leave to intervene, it will
  submit that the reopening, reconstruction and use of the Road without regard
  to the public environmental screening process of an Environmental Study Report
  of the undertaking will undermine ecological and recreational park values and
  set a very poor precedent that threatens the integrity of the provincial park
  network in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [10]	In order to understand Wildlands' proposed submissions, it is necessary
  to briefly discuss the legislative context. Currently, Declaration Order MNR-59/2
  exempts most MNR park programs from formal environmental assessment under the
  Environmental Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E-18. The Declaration Order is
  subject to a number of terms and conditions, including a condition that provincial
  park programs be "planned, implemented and managed" according to
  specified guidelines and policies. MNR submits on the leave motion that these
  policies include Policy 11.03.01, which requires that all major undertakings
  in provincial parks, including Lake Superior Provincial Park, be screened for
  impacts. MNR further contends that the proposed use of the Road would be a
  major undertaking and thus an Environmental Study Report is required under
  Policy 11.03.01. Such a Report considers environmental impacts of the project
  and requires the MNR to evaluate alternatives to the project. Policy 11.03.01
  also requires public consultation at the project planning level. MNR raises
  as one of the seven issues on the proposed appeal, "Did the Court below
  err in allowing access to the Sand River Road despite the need for an environmental
  review pursuant to a Declaration Order made under the Environmental Assessment
  Act?" </p>
<p>
  [11] Wildlands concedes that there may be some overlap in its submissions with
  the position of the MNR, but it contends that it will nonetheless provide assistance
  on the merits of the case regarding the public interest in the conditions to
  the Declaration Order and the need for an Environmental Study Report in particular.
  According to Wildlands, the government does not cover the field in representing
  the public interest, which is demonstrated by the fact that the MNR consults
  the public when it engages in an Environmental Study Report.</p>
<p>
  [12] In support of its motion to intervene, Wildlands filed the affidavit of
  Evan Ferrari, sworn July 8, 2003. Wildlands also seeks leave to file this affidavit
  on the motion for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, on the appeal. Mr.
  Ferrari is the Director, Parks and Protected Areas, at Wildlands. In his affidavit,
  he describes Wildlands' work and provides his opinion as to why "reopening,
  reconstructing and using the Sand River Road is likely to cause harm to the
  Park's ecological well-being." </p>
<p>
  [13] In resisting the intervention motion, counsel for the company argues that
  Wildlands is not advancing any new legal argument and that the MNR represents
  the public interest. Counsel for the company also argues that the affidavit
  of Mr. Ferrari should not form part of the record on the leave motion or, if
  leave is granted, on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [14] I am satisfied that Wildlands can present a useful perspective that will
  contribute to the resolution of the leave motion, and if leave is granted,
  to the appeal, without causing injustice to the immediate parties. Wildlands
  has a longstanding interest and expertise in environmental issues concerning
  protected areas in the Great Lakes Region and was involved in the evolution
  of the Lake Superior Provincial Park Management Plan that is the subject of
  these proceedings. The MNR has raised the issue whether Stortini J. erred in
  allowing access to the Road despite the need for an environmental review under
  the Declaration Order, and Wildlands can offer further submissions on the relevance
  and significance of such a review both on the leave motion, and if leave is
  granted, on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [15] I agree with the respondent company, however, that I should not make an
  order allowing Wildlands to add to the record on the leave to appeal motion,
  or if leave is granted, on the appeal. Adding to the record may work an injustice
  to the respondent company. In any event, the decision whether to admit this
  evidence is for the court hearing the leave motion, and if leave is granted,
  the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [16] I thus grant Wildlands leave to intervene as a friend of the court on
  the following conditions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. That it takes the record as it is and will not be permitted to introduce
  further material;</p>
<p class="indent">2. That it will not seek costs on the leave motion, or if
      leave is granted, on the appeal. Costs may, in the discretion of the panel,
      be awarded against
  it on the leave motion, and if leave is granted, on the appeal. </p>
<p class="indent">3. That it
    will deliver its factum on the leave motion, which will not duplicate the
  argument of the moving party, and is not to exceed 10 pages, on or before
  July 24, 2003.</p>
<p class="indent">4. If leave to appeal is granted, then the panel hearing the
  leave motion will allocate time for Wildlands' oral submissions on the
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [17] The respondent company may, if it wishes, file a reply factum to the intervener
  factum of Wildlands. Such factum must be filed on or before July 31, 2003 and
  must not exceed 7 pages. </p>
<p>
  [18] In its materials on the motion to intervene, the moving party included
  an endorsement of Caputo J., dated June 13, 2003, in which he declared that
  paragraph two of Stortini J.'s order from which leave is to appeal is
  being sought, "does not require the Applicant [the company] to comply
  with Ministry of Natural Resources (the MNR) Policy #11.03.01 or any other
  policy or guidelines of the MNR related to Declaration Order MNR-59/2 passed
  pursuant to the Environmental Assessment Act." Caputo J. indicated that
  written reasons are to follow. </p>
<p>
  [19]	The MNR has not included Caputo J.'s order in its Motion Record
  on the leave motion. I am of the view that the panel hearing the leave motion
  should have before it a copy of Caputo J.'s order and any reasons for
  it in a Supplementary Motion Record filed by the MNR. As Caputo J.'s
  order appears to be an interpretation of Stortini J.'s order, the MNR
  does not need to file a separate motion for leave to appeal Caputo J.'s
  order. </p>
<p>
[20]	There will be no costs of this motion.</p>
