<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: September 12, 2003</p>
<p>[1] On the record before us, we are not satisfied that the findings of the 
  applications judge are supportable. The applications judge inferred from the 
  parties' acknowledgement that business tax had been eliminated, that they took 
  that fact into account when negotiating the rent.</p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, that inference is weak and directly conflicts with the one 
  objective piece of evidence in the record: the terms of the offer to lease and 
  lease. Moreover, the parties did not put before the court other objective evidence, 
  for example, the rental history of the property, that would have permitted a 
  reasoned consideration of section 444.1(1) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990. 
  c. M.45, as amended.</p>
<p>
  [3] In the light of these considerations we think that the fairest disposition 
  of this appeal and of the application is to order the trial of the issue whether 
  the remedial provisions of section 444.1(1) have been met.</p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of Mesbur J. is set aside 
  and the trial of an issue is directed. The costs of the application and the 
  appeal shall be reserved to the trial judge. The trial judge may have regard 
  for the court's view that a fair figure for the costs of the appeal is $7000 
  inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
