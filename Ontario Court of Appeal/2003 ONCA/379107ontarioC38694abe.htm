<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not satisfied that we should interfere with the decision of Jennings 
  J. who found that none of the confidential material provided by the appellant 
  to the respondent was used by or assisted the respondent in obtaining the Goldlist 
  contract. His finding in this respect is supported by the evidence of the employee 
  of Goldlist most involved in the negotiations with the respondent.</p>
<p>[2] The finding is further supported by the evidence accepted by the trial 
  judge that the minimum price agreed upon between Goldlist and the respondent 
  occurred in February 1998 before any confidential information had been supplied 
  by the appellant to the respondent.</p>
<p>[3] While the appellant submits that the trial judge overlooked evidence that 
  showed there had been a misuse of the confidential information, we are not satisfied 
  that the trial judge made any palpable or overriding error.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed and the respondent is entitled to its 
  costs in the amount of $10,000.</p>
