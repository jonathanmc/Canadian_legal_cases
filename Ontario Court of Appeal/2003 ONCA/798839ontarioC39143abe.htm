<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] We agree with Farley J. that the original statement of claim did not cover 
  the claims in issue. </p>    <P>
  [2] We also agree that prior to September 28, 1992 when an order was made granting 
  the amendment to the statement of claim, there was no &quot;proceeding calling 
  into question an interest&quot; in the claims. </p>    <P>
  [3] The question of whether the curative provision in s. 136 applies to the 
  situation in issue was not argued before Farley J. It was raised in this appeal 
  by the appellant. The respondent argues that it did not have the opportunity 
  to put before Farley J. evidence, including viva voce evidence that a substantial 
  wrong or injustice had been occasioned. Thus, we are not in a position to decide 
  this issue.</p>    <P>
  [4] We, therefore, dismiss the appeal on issues one and two. The issue of whether 
  to apply s. 136 is remitted to Farley J. In the circumstances, there will be 
  no costs. </p>
