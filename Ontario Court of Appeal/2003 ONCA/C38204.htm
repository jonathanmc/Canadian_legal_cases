<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Arthur M. Gans of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 6, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT ON COSTS</p>
<p>[1] We have received the written submissions in respect of the quantum of costs. 
  We do not accept the appellant&#146;s contention that this appeal involved a 
  novel issue of law or that it raised a matter of public interest. We do agree, 
  however, that the costs claimed by the respondents are excessive having regard 
  to the nature of the proceedings. We therefore fix the costs on a partial-indemnity 
  basis at $15,000 all inclusive payable to each of the respondents Deloitte &amp; 
  Touche and the Canadian Underwriters.</p>
