<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: January 24, 2003</p>
<p>[1] This a motion by the respondents for directions. Principally they seek 
  an order quashing the appeals that have been brought by the individual appellants 
  on a number of grounds. In the view that we take, for the most part, the grounds 
  advanced for quashing the appeals are without merit. </p>
<p>[2] It is argued that Lillian Streisfield is in contempt of court for failing 
  to comply with that portion of the formal judgment of Carnwath J. that required 
  her to deliver possession of the Herberman home to the Dora Herberman estate. 
  In our view, this misreads the formal judgment. The judgment does not order 
  that Lillian Streisfield deliver possession of the home, although it does award 
  a variety of relief to the respondents in connection with the home. The formal 
  judgment, however, in paragraph 6, established the mechanism for obtaining possession 
  of the home. Under that paragraph, leave was granted to the respondents to issue 
  a writ of possession with respect to the property. The respondents have not 
  availed themselves of that means of executing the judgment and, accordingly, 
  this ground must fail.</p>
<p>[3] The second ground for quashing the appeals is that the notices of appeal 
  were filed out of time, contrary to rule 61.04(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 
  We do not agree. Although the principal reasons for judgment of Carnwath J. 
  were released on August 20, 2001, which would normally be the date when the 
  30 day period begins for appealing from the judgment, that time was effectively 
  extended to January 17, 2002 when issues regarding the payment of occupation 
  rent were adjudicated by the trial judge and the formal judgment was signed 
  and entered. This court recently dealt with a similar issue in Byers (Litigation 
  Guardian of) v. Pentex Print Master Industries Inc., [2003] O.J. No. 6. The 
  reasoning of that judgment is conclusive, and compels our finding that the notices 
  of appeal in this case were not filed out of time. </p>
<p>[4] Relief is asked with respect to issues concerning the administration of 
  the Dora Herberman estate. Those matters are properly dealt with through the 
  Estate List of the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, applying the Estate 
  Rules. Therefore, we decline to provide directions respecting the administration 
  of the estate.</p>
<p>[5] However, there are two issues raised by the respondents that have merit. 
  First, an appeal has been launched by Lillian Streisfield in her capacity as 
  litigation administrator on behalf of the estate of Gerald Streisfield. Pursuant 
  to rule 15.01(1), she is unable to personally represent the estate. Rule 15.01(1) 
  requires that the estate be represented by a solicitor. In the circumstances, 
  we order that if a solicitor is not retained by March 15, 2003 to represent 
  the estate of Gerald Streisfield in its appeal, a motion may be made to this 
  court to dismiss that appeal.</p>
<p>[6] The second issue concerns the appeal by Steven Streisfield. It is an appeal 
  only in respect to that part of the judgment that ordered him to pay costs of 
  the trial. He has not complied with s. 133(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, which requires that he obtain leave to appeal, nor with 
  rule 61.03(1)(16). His non-compliance was brought to his attention by O'Connor 
  A.C.J.O. in June 2002, when an earlier version of this motion was heard by the 
  Chief Justice. Mr. Streisfield has taken no steps to comply with these procedural 
  requirements, notwithstanding the admonition of the Chief Justice that he do 
  so. Accordingly, we order that if he does not comply with s. 133(b) and rule 
  61.03(1)(16) by February 3, 2003, the appeal of Steven Streisfield is quashed. 
</p>
<p>[7] We feel bound to express our concern regarding the slow pace at which these 
  appeals are progressing. Unfortunately, some appeals from the Superior Court 
  of Justice in Toronto have been delayed as a result of trial transcripts not 
  having been prepared within a reasonable time. This was a lengthy trial. It 
  seems to have taken about 17 days. The transcripts have been ordered and paid 
  for. At this time, because we have no information about the status of the transcripts, 
  we do not feel that we should order that the appeal be expedited. It is difficult 
  to do so without the completion of the transcripts. However, it is our view 
  that, should the transcripts not be forthcoming within a reasonably short time, 
  the proper motion can be made with respect to that issue and the possibility 
  of ordering that the appeal be expedited.</p>
<p>[8] In our view, although the motion to quash was largely unsuccessful, this 
  is not a proper case in which to order costs.</p>
