<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice S. Casey Hill of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 28, 2000, reported at [2000] O.J. No. 4979. </p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] Does a young person, when represented by counsel, have an absolute right 
  to waive the reading of charges in proceedings in youth court? In a decision 
  dated November 28, 2000, Justice Hill answered that question in the negative. 
  A.A., the young person in this matter, appeals from that decision.<br>
</p>
<p>Background<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant was charged with assault and sexual assault. At the time 
  of his first appearance on those charges in the Brampton youth court, he was 
  represented by counsel. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Through counsel, A.A. waived the reading of the charges. Crown counsel 
  consented to the waiving of reading of the charges.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The presiding justice of the peace initially indicated that waiver was 
  not permitted. He then gave counsel for the appellant the opportunity to make 
  submissions on the matter. Counsel responded with legal argument based on s. 
  12(2) of the Young Offenders Act, R.S. C. 1985, c. Y-1, as amended. He maintained 
  that a young person has an absolute right to waive reading of the charges. After 
  being pressed by the justice of the peace to give a reason why A.A. wished the 
  court to waive the reading of the charges, counsel indicated that the appellant's 
  request was based on his embarrassment about the charges.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The justice of the peace read the charges. From a reading of the transcript 
  of the proceedings, it appears that the justice of the peace did so on the basis 
  that the court has a residual discretion to deny the waiver and order the charges 
  read.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] A.A. brought an application for certiorari, asking the court to quash the 
  ruling of the justice of the peace that the charges be read. The applications 
  judge dismissed the application on the basis that a judicial officer retains 
  discretion, as an incident of the court's control over its own process, to read 
  the charges against a young person even where there has been a waiver.<br>
</p>
<p>Relevant Legislation<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Section 12 of the Act sets out the process to be followed at a first appearance 
  in youth court.</p>

  
<p class="indent">12.(1) A young person against whom an information is 
  laid must first appear before a youth court judge or a justice, and the judge 
  or justice shall<br>
  (a) cause the information to be read to the young person;<br>
  (b) where the young person is not represented by counsel, inform the young person 
  of the right to be so represented; and<br>
  (c) where the young person is a young person referred to in subsection 16(1.01), 
  inform the young person that the young person will be proceeded against in ordinary 
  court in accordance with the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with 
  the offence unless an application is made to the youth court by the young person, 
  the young person's counsel or the Attorney General or an agent of the Attorney 
  General to have the young person proceeded against in the youth court and an 
  order is made to that effect.<br>
  12.(2) A young person may waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(a) where 
  the young person is represented by counsel.<br>
  </p>
<p>The Decision Below<br>
</p>
<p>[8] In my view, the applications judge was correct in both result and reasoning. 
  The most critical portion of those reasons bears repeating and so is set out 
  below.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[13] The waiver option, linked as it is to legal representation, 
  contemplates that counsel has in hand protection of the young person's rights 
  and advice as to the charge(s) and jeopardy faced. Despite the policy statements 
  of s. 3 of the Act, and the helpful submissions of Mr. Reid, I am not persuaded 
  that the objective of s. 12(2) of the Act is to place exclusively in the control 
  of the young person the decision as to whether the charge(s) will be read in 
  court.</p>
<p class="indent">[14] Counsel submitted that the young person, presumed 
  to be innocent, should be entitled to avoid the embarrassment of a public reading 
  of the charges faced. While maintenance of privacy and avoidance of embarrassment 
  may be the young person's purpose, or indeed an incidental benefit of a waiver 
  of the charges being read, there must exist a residual discretion in the court 
  to have the charges read aloud. This discretion, an incident of the court's 
  control of its own process, takes account of factors respectful of the rights 
  of the young person as well as relevant public interest variables. This interpretation 
  of s. 12 of the Act, advocates a case-by-case approach. Having said that, considering 
  the protection presumptively afforded a young person where there exists an informed 
  waiver, the right of the young person to participate in the process (s. 3(1)(e) 
  of the Act), and considering that the charges will be read in open court on 
  arraignment (s. 51 of the Act, s. 801(1) of the Criminal Code), it will be the 
  exceptional case where the charges need be read at the young person's first 
  appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">[15] In the instance of an adult charged with a criminal 
  offence, the information and the indictment are public documents and the media 
  are, as a general rule, at liberty to inspect the charging document and to report, 
  at the first court appearance of the accused, the identity of the accused and 
  the charge(s) laid. In a young offender proceeding, it seems the court records, 
  including the information, are unavailable for public inspection (ss. 41, 44.1 
  of the Act) and the media are prohibited from publishing or broadcasting the 
  identity of the young person or any information revealing his or her identity 
  (s. 38 of the Act). Where the charge or charges are not read aloud at a young 
  person's first appearance, the public, including the media and members of the 
  community present in the courtroom, will receive no information as to the nature 
  of the charge or charges laid by the authorities. These circumstances detract 
  substantially from the open court principle.</p>
<p class="indent">[16] The presiding judicial officer, at the young person's 
  first appearance, may, seeing the harried condition of duty counsel as she or 
  he attempts to deal with multiple defendants, or seeing or hearing aspects of 
  possible miscommunication between retained counsel and the young person, wish 
  the charge(s) read despite the statement of waiver. Apart from these circumstances 
  of constructive non-representation by counsel, the court may observe in the 
  demeanor of the young person a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of the 
  charge(s) and the solemnity of the occasion justifying a reading aloud of the 
  criminal accusation to get the young person's attention.</p>
<p class="indent">[17] I would, as well, not wish to discount the importance, 
  in rare cases, of an exercise of the court's residual discretion to have the 
  criminal charge(s) read aloud, despite waiver, to allow members of the public 
  present in court to hear the charges(s) laid by the government. For example, 
  widely held public concern that the local police force never lays charges in 
  instances of gang violence or in cases of historical sexual assaults, or public 
  concern that the police force engages in under-charging whenever the children 
  of the local municipal councillors are brought before the court, may be dispelled 
  at the outset by a reading of the charge(s) without in any fashion diminishing 
  the force of the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p class="indent">[18] Where a judicial officer, in every first appearance 
  by a young person with legal representation, despite an announced waiver, requires 
  the charge(s) be read, there is an abuse of discretion. On the current record, 
  there are strong indications that the presiding judicial officer was adhering 
  to an invariable practice of this sort. However, given the submission by the 
  Applicant's counsel before me that he was not arguing the existence of jurisdictional 
  error should this court hold that the court maintains a residual discretion 
  to have the charge(s) read despite a waiver from the young person, no final 
  determination need be made on this point. In other words, the Applicant was 
  unprepared to advance an argument that the justice of the peace exercised an 
  existing discretion in an arbitrary manner. In any event, having regard to the 
  particular facts of this case, and considering the discretionary nature of the 
  writ of certiorari, and the possible impact that the curative provisions in 
  s. 485(1) of the Criminal Code may hold in retaining jurisdiction over the offences 
  (Regina v. B.(J.E.), [1993] O.J. No. 3757 (C.A.)), the relief requested is denied. 
  Some further observations are warranted on the particular facts of this case.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>[9] In addition to the reasons given by the applications judge, I would add 
  the following three observations.<br>
  <br>
  [10] First, the modern approach to construction of legislation was stated by 
  E.A. Driedger in Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) 
  at 87 and recently cited with approval in R. v. Sharpe, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45 at 
  para. 33.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, 
  the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical 
  and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the 
  Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
<p>[11] Section 12 of the Act is designed to ensure that young persons understand 
  the charges that they face. Section 12(1) directs the judicial officer presiding 
  over a first appearance to have the charges against the young person read aloud 
  in court. It is only when the young person is represented by counsel that s. 
  12(2) provides that the young person &quot;may&quot; waive the reading of the 
  charge(s).<br>
  <br>
  [12] The language of s. 12(2) is clearly permissive in nature, as demonstrated 
  by the use of the word &quot;may&quot;. There is nothing in s. 12 to suggest 
  that Parliament intended to limit the court's jurisdiction to control its own 
  process nor is there anything in its terms that suggests that the right of the 
  represented young person to waive the reading is absolute. Clear language would 
  be necessary, in my view, to derogate from the undisputed obligation and power 
  of the presiding officer to control the court process. And, as the applications 
  judge points out, there may be occasions when it is desirable to have the charges 
  read even when a represented young person has requested a waiver under s. 12(2). 
  Such situations include where the presiding officer is concerned about possible 
  miscommunication between counsel and the young person or where it appears to 
  the court that a young person may fail to appreciate the seriousness of the 
  charges or solemnity of the court process. <br>
  <br>
  [13] Section 3(2) of the Act states that the Act is to be construed in accordance 
  with the principles set out in s. 3(1). Those principles recognize the special 
  position of young persons and the need for protection of society. Section 12(2), 
  when read in the context of the entire Act and particularly s. 3(1), reflects 
  the need for a careful balancing of the interests of the young person with the 
  need for protection of society. Thus, a contextual and purposive reading of 
  s. 12(2) reinforces the conclusion that s. 12(2) is designed to give the young 
  person a right of waiver without dictating that the presiding judicial officer 
  is bound by the waiver. The permissive language in s. 12(2) is consonant with 
  the obligation of the presiding officer to ensure that all relevant considerations 
  are brought to bear when making decisions in respect of its processes. Recognition 
  of the residual power of the presiding officer is a recognition that the presiding 
  officer must consider and balance all relevant rights, including the right of 
  waiver given to the represented young person.<br>
  <br>
  [14] Second, the decision by the presiding officer to read the charges in the 
  face of an express waiver is an exercise of discretion. As such, it must comply 
  with the legal requirements that prevent an exercise of discretion from being 
  arbitrary. The presiding officer must hear from both sides before coming to 
  a decision. Hearing does not include an inquisitorial approach that requires 
  counsel to disclose a young person's reasons for requesting waiver. This is 
  not to say that a young person's motive or reason is necessarily irrelevant, 
  however, the court does not have the right to invade solicitor-client privilege. 
  The decision, as an exercise of discretion, brings with it an obligation to 
  give reasons. The reading of charges when a young person is represented cannot 
  be an invariable practice as that would amount to an improper fetter on discretion.<br>
  <br>
  [15] Third, the reading of charges is not to be done as a form of punishment. 
  Until found guilty of an offence, the presumption of innocence is operative. 
  Punishment, therefore, is not properly considered at the time of the first appearance 
  and to read the charges for such a purpose would be improper.<br>
  <br>
  [16] I conclude by reiterating the applications judge's observation that it 
  would be rare for a judicial officer to have the charges read despite an express 
  waiver. This is particularly true where, as in the instant case, the Crown has 
  consented to the waiver.<br>
  <br>
  Conclusion<br>
  <br>
  [17] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
