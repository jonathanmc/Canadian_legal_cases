<p>On appeal from the Order of Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This case represents another in a number of recent cases arising in the 
  employment context, following the seminal case of Weber v. Ontario Hydro, (1995), 
  125 D.L.R. (4th) 583 (S.C.C.), where the issue is where lies the jurisdiction 
  to hear and determine the claim. I refer to Regina Police Association Inc. v. 
  Regina (City) Board of Police Commissioners, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 360 (SCC), Allen 
  v. Hamilton (City), [2001] O.J. No. 596 (S.C.C.), Goudie v. Ottawa (City), [2003] 
  S.C.J. No. 12, Johnson-Paquette v. Canada, [2000] F.C.J. No. 441 (F.C.A.), Pleau 
  v. Canada (Attorney General) (1999), 182 D.L.R. (4th 373 (N.S.C.A.), Guenette 
  v. Canada (Attorney General) (2002), 216 D.L.R. (4th) 410 (Ont. C.A.), Vaughn 
  v. Canada, [2003] F.C.J. No. 241 (Fed. C.A.), Re Durham Regional Police Services 
  Board and Durham Regional Police Association (2000), 95 L.A.C. (4th) 323 (Ont. 
  Arbitrator).</p>
<p>
  [2] In this case, the respondent OPP officers allege that they were transferred 
  or reassigned as a form of disguised discipline, and seek civil redress and 
  compensation from the alleged responsible officers. The appellant officers moved 
  for an order dismissing the claim on the basis that the pleading disclosed no 
  cause of action which could be pursued in the civil courts and that the matter 
  must be pursued through arbitration.</p>
<p>
  [3] The motion judge held that the essential element of the claim was disciplinary 
  in nature and clearly outside the collective agreement. He therefore dismissed 
  the motion and ordered the action to proceed.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons which follow, I would allow the appeal, set side the order 
  of the motion judge and dismiss the action. Although the claim is disciplinary 
  in nature, the provisions of the Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15, 
  together with the limited provisions of the collective agreement, form a complete 
  code relating to police discipline, leaving no room for redress by court action.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] The underlying &quot;facts&quot; are contained in the only pleading before 
  the court which is the statement of claim. As the appellants neither filed a 
  statement of defence nor any evidence on the motion, for the purposes of jurisdiction, 
  the parties have impliedly agreed on those underlying facts.</p>
<p>
  [6] The respondents are OPP detectives who were assigned to the Windsor Drug 
  Enforcement Unit. The appellants are senior officers of the OPP. Investigations 
  into certain conduct of each of the respondents resulted in their transfer by 
  the appellants to other duties and alleged retraining in other locations within 
  the province. The respondents claim that these actions by the appellants that 
  appeared to be administrative or operational, amounted to a disguised form of 
  discipline without following the appropriate procedures, and for the bad faith 
  purpose of embarrassing the appellants. They claim that the respondents took 
  these actions for the purpose of dislodging the respondents as a working group 
  in Windsor drug enforcement. They knew that the respondents had not done anything 
  that would warrant discipline. Therefore they avoided the discipline process 
  by the improper transfers and job assignments in order to embarrass, harass 
  and intimidate the respondents. The respondents seek compensation damages as 
  well as punitive, aggravated and exemplary damages from the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [7] Following delivery of the statement of claim, the appellants moved for an 
  order dismissing the action on the basis that the court has no jurisdiction 
  over its subject matter. The appellants' position was that the claim in its 
  essence involves the terms and conditions of employment covered by the OPP collective 
  agreement with the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [8] The motion judge made a brief endorsement dismissing the motion which stated: 
  &quot;[E]ssential element of claim is disciplinary in nature and clearly outside 
  the Collective Agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [9] On this appeal, the appellants agree that the matter is disciplinary in 
  nature, but take the position that discipline is a matter that is part of the 
  management rights clause which is incorporated into the collective agreement 
  by s. 26 of the Public Service Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 47 and therefore any 
  disciplinary complaint must be grieved in accordance with the grievance provisions 
  of the collective agreement.</p>
<p>
  [10] The Attorney General for Ontario was granted the right to intervene. The 
  intervenor's position is that if the claim is disciplinary in nature, it is 
  properly dealt with under the Police Services Act which sets out the code for 
  discipline of police officers, or by judicial review of action or inaction under 
  that Act, and not by civil action.</p>
<p>
  THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>
  [11] There are two statutes as well as the collective agreement which govern 
  employment matters for OPP members: the Public Service Act, the Police Services 
  Act and the collective agreement, which is titled Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p>
  The Public Service Act </p>
<p>
  [12] Part II of the Public Service Act provides for collective bargaining between 
  OPP members and the Crown. Section 26(3) of the Act makes the Ontario Provincial 
  Police Association the exclusive bargaining agent for the members of the force 
  of certain named ranks (s. 26(2)) from cadet to sergeants to whom the section 
  applies in respect of collective bargaining. (All of the respondents are of 
  the affected ranks.) The Association and the Crown were parties to the Memorandum 
  of Understanding for the period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002 (herein, 
  the &quot;collective agreement&quot;).</p>
<p>
  [13] Section 26(3) of the Public Service Act provides a non-exclusive definition 
  of the terms and conditions of employment for which the Association can bargain, 
  including: &quot;the procedures applicable to the processing of grievances, 
  the methods of effecting promotions, demotions, transfers, lay-offs or reappointments&#133;.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [14] Section 26(4) defines the matters which are deemed to be included in every 
  collective agreement as the exclusive functions of the employer including &quot;discipline&quot; 
  and &quot;transfer&quot;: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Except in relation to matters governed by or under the Police Services Act, 
  every collective agreement shall be deemed to provide that it is the exclusive 
  function of the employer to manage, which function, without limiting the generality 
  of the foregoing, includes the right to determine employment, appointment, complement, 
  organization, work methods and procedures, kinds and location of equipment, 
  discipline and termination of employment, assignment, classification, job evaluation 
  system, merit system, training and development, appraisal and the principles 
  and standards governing promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and reappointment, 
  and that such matters will not be the subject of collective bargaining nor come 
  within the jurisdiction of the Negotiating Committee or an arbitration board. 
</p>
<p>The Collective Agreement </p>
<p>
  [15] The only provisions in the collective agreement specifically dealing with 
  transfer or discipline are article 33 dealing with informal disciplinary procedure, 
  and articles 22 and 23 dealing with notice of transfer and temporary postings.</p>
<p>
  [16] The collective agreement contains a grievance procedure, but section 4.01(c) 
  defines &quot;Grievance&quot; to exclude matters that arise under the Police 
  Services Act and its Code of Conduct: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;Grievance&quot; means a personal complaint of an employee, made in writing, 
  concerning a working condition or term of employment which is applicable to 
  employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding and which is set out in 
  the Memorandum, the Regulations under the Public Service Act or the Police Services 
  Act, the Manual of Administration, or the Management Board of Cabinet Directives 
  and Guidelines. Matters which arise pursuant to the Police Services Act and 
  the Code of Offences thereunder, other than a working condition or term of employment, 
  shall not be the subject of a grievance under this Memorandum of Understanding 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>The Police Services Act</p>
<p>
  [17] Part V of the Police Services Act deals with the handling of complaints 
  regarding the professional conduct of all OPP officers including supervisors, 
  raised both by members of the public as well as internally by the police service. 
  Part V deals with the making of complaints, the investigation of complaints, 
  the resolution of complaints without a hearing, the holding of a hearing to 
  determine if misconduct has occurred, a range of outcomes where misconduct is 
  found, an appeal to the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services (the 
  Police Commission) and a further appeal to the Divisional Court. Section 74 
  of the Act as well as the Code of Conduct set out in Regulation 123/98 under 
  the Act, define professional misconduct for the purposes of Part V.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [18] Does the Superior Court have jurisdiction to hear and determine the respondents' 
  claims?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [19] The issue and legislative context in this case are very similar to those 
  in the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in Regina Police Association 
  v. Regina Police Commissioners, supra, although the question the court had to 
  answer there was different in that the claim was originally brought not to court, 
  but to an arbitrator who declined jurisdiction. The issue therefore was whether 
  the arbitrator was correct to decline jurisdiction, which required the court 
  to determine whether the dispute arose out of the collective agreement. </p>
<p>
  [20] The court ultimately agreed with the arbitrator that the dispute did not 
  arise out of the collective agreement. However, in order to make that determination, 
  the court was required to examine the legislative scheme which governed the 
  relationship between the parties in order to determine which forum was intended 
  to determine the particular dispute. In that case the dispute was also disciplinary 
  in nature, arising from the forced resignation of a police officer without using 
  the disciplinary procedures set out in the Police Act.</p>
<p>
  [21] The Saskatchewan Police Act contained provisions similar, although not 
  identical, to those in the Ontario Police Services Act regarding discipline 
  of officers. The collective agreement grievance procedure also contained a similar 
  exclusion from arbitration for circumstances covered by the Police Act and its 
  regulations.</p>
<p>
  [22] The Supreme Court described the analytical process for determining jurisdiction 
  in paragraphs 25 and 26 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> To determine whether a dispute arises out of the collective 
  agreement, we must therefore consider two elements: the nature of the dispute 
  and the ambit of the collective agreement. In considering the nature of the 
  dispute, the goal is to determine its essential character. This determination 
  must proceed on the basis of the facts surrounding the dispute between the parties, 
  and not on the basis of how the legal issues may be framed: see Weber, supra, 
  at para. 43. Simply, the decision-maker must determine whether, having examined 
  the factual context of the dispute, its essential character concerns a subject 
  matter that is covered by the collective agreement. Upon determining the essential 
  character of the dispute, the decision-maker must examine the provisions of 
  the collective agreement to determine whether it contemplates such factual situations. 
  It is clear that the collective agreement need not provide for the subject matter 
  of the dispute explicitly. If the essential character of the dispute arises 
  either explicitly, or implicitly, from the interpretation, application, administration 
  or violation of the collective agreement, the dispute is within the sole jurisdiction 
  of an arbitrator to decide: see, e.g., Weber, at para. 54; New Brunswick v. 
  O'Leary, supra, at para. 6.</p>
<p class="indent">Before proceeding to an analysis of the ambit of the collective 
  agreement, it is important to recognize that in Weber this Court was asked to 
  choose between arbitration and the courts as the two possible forums for hearing 
  the dispute. In the case at bar, The Police Act and Regulations form an intervening 
  statutory regime which also governs the relationship between the parties. As 
  I have stated above, the rationale for adopting the exclusive jurisdiction model 
  was to ensure that the legislative scheme in issue was not frustrated by the 
  conferral of jurisdiction upon an adjudicative body that was not intended by 
  the legislature. The question, therefore, is whether the legislature intended 
  this dispute to be governed by the collective agreement or The Police Act and 
  Regulations. If neither the arbitrator, nor the Commission have jurisdiction 
  to hear the dispute, a court would possess residual jurisdiction to resolve 
  the dispute. I agree with Vancise J.A. that the approach described in Weber 
  applies when it is necessary to decide which of the two competing statutory 
  regimes should govern a dispute.</p>
<p>
  [23] It is the position of the respondents, relying on this passage from the 
  Supreme Court, that this is a case where neither an arbitrator nor the police 
  commission have jurisdiction and therefore it is a case where the court has 
  the residual jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>
  [24] I do not agree with this submission. In my view the analysis and conclusion 
  reached by the Supreme Court are equally applicable in this case. There the 
  union claimed that the dispute regarded resignation, which fell within the collective 
  agreement. The court analyzed the issue based on the facts, which were agreed, 
  and concluded that the true nature of the dispute regarded discipline. The court 
  then stated at paras. 30-32: </p>
<p class="indent"> I turn now to the collective agreement to determine whether 
  the dispute falls within the ambit of its provisions. In determining whether 
  the dispute falls within the ambit of the collective agreement, we must bear 
  in mind that the legislature intended that the members of the Regina Police 
  force be governed by two separate schemes, the collective agreement and The 
  Police Act and Regulations. In determining whether the dispute is arbitrable, 
  we cannot interpret the collective agreement in a manner that would offend the 
  legislative scheme set out in The Police Act and Regulations. The provisions 
  of the collective agreement, therefore, must be interpreted in light of the 
  scheme set out in The Police Act and Regulations. This is recognized in Article 
  8 of the collective agreement itself, which emphasizes that the collective agreement 
  is not intended to be utilised in any circumstances where the provisions of 
  The Police Act and Regulations apply. &#133; </p>
<p class="indent">As Vancise J.A. outlined extensively in his dissent, both The 
  Police Act and the Regulations specifically address the procedural issues at 
  the investigative, adjudicative and appeal stages of a disciplinary process. 
  The detailed provisions in the legislative scheme governing disciplinary matters 
  are a clear indication that the legislature intended to provide a complete code 
  within The Police Act and Regulations for the resolution of the disciplinary 
  matters involving members of the police force. This is reflective of a well-founded 
  public policy that police boards shall have the exclusive responsibility for 
  maintaining an efficient police force in the community. The ability to discipline 
  members of the force is integral to this role. Accordingly, no discretion exists 
  to select another legal mechanism, such as arbitration, to proceed against a 
  police officer in respect of a disciplinary matter: see, e.g., Re Proctor and 
  Sarnia Board of Commissioners of Police (1979), 99 D.L.R. (3d) 356 (Ont. C.A.), 
  at p. 371 (per Wilson J.A. in dissent), majority reversed, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 727; 
  P. Ceyssens, Legal Aspects of Policing (loose-leaf), at p. 5-2. Generally, when 
  both parties agree that it is appropriate, a resignation is an acceptable means 
  of resolving a disciplinary dispute. However, where a mutually agreed settlement 
  is impossible, both parties to the dispute must resort to the disciplinary procedures 
  provided under the collective agreement and/or the legislation governing their 
  labour relationship. These procedures are meant to be all-inclusive in order 
  to ensure certainty and fairness when the parties cannot reach a negotiated 
  agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">Having examined the ambit of the collective agreement, and of 
  The Police Act and Regulations, it is clear that the dispute between Sgt. Shotton 
  and the Employer did not arise, either explicitly or inferentially, from the 
  interpretation, application, administration or violation of the collective agreement. 
  The essential character of the dispute was disciplinary, and the legislature 
  intended for such disputes to fall within the ambit of The Police Act and Regulations. 
  As a result, I agree with Vancise J.A. that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction 
  to hear and decide this matter.</p>
<p>
  [25] In this case, it is clear that this matter, as characterized, is disciplinary 
  in nature. That is effectively conceded on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [26] What may distinguish this case from the Regina Police Association case 
  on the facts, is that s. 26 of the Public Service Act deems certain matters 
  to be included in the OPP collective agreement as management rights matters, 
  including discipline. It is because of this provision that the appellants took 
  the position throughout that the matter must go to arbitration. Arguably, s. 
  26(4) could be taken as the expression of an intention by the legislature that 
  there are some matters of discipline that are beyond the areas covered by the 
  Police Services Act regime and are left to management within the context of 
  the collective agreement. In that context, although they may be grievable matters, 
  because they are left to the discretion of management, the scope of grievance 
  would be very limited. The Informal Disciplinary Procedure which is set out 
  in article 33 of the collective agreement, is the only discipline matter referred 
  to in the collective agreement. It contemplates the potential for informal discipline 
  in respect of a matter which might result in a charge under the Police Services 
  Act, and provides a regime for a meeting with an Association representative 
  present.</p>
<p>
  [27] With that exception, the legislative scheme in Ontario, like the one in 
  Saskatchewan, is intended to create a complete substantive and procedural code 
  for discipline of police officers within the provisions of the Police Services 
  Act and its regulations. As stated by the Supreme Court, this scheme accords 
  with a well founded public policy which gives police boards the &quot;exclusive 
  responsibility for maintaining an efficient police force in the community. The 
  ability to discipline members of the force is integral to that role&quot; (para. 
  31). I see no basis on which to distinguish the analysis and conclusion reached 
  by the Supreme Court in the Saskatchewan case from this case and the Ontario 
  scheme for police discipline. </p>
<p> [28] The respondents also argue that because the appellants did not use the 
  procedures under the Police Services Act, there is no remedy for them through 
  the Act to seek redress. In Weber, the court stated that where an arbitrator 
  is not empowered to grant a remedy, the court of inherent jurisdiction may then 
  take jurisdiction. The court had in mind, for example, the imposition of an 
  injunction in labour matters. In any event, Bastarache J. also dealt with a 
  similar argument raised in the Regina Police Association case, that because 
  the police officer was forced to resign, he was not disciplined under the provisions 
  of the Act and therefore he had no procedural avenue to access the Commission 
  and appeal the decision under the Act.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [29] Bastarache J. did not accept this argument. He pointed out that the rationale 
  for the exclusive jurisdiction approach articulated in Weber was that violence 
  would be done to the comprehensive statutory scheme contemplated by the legislature 
  by allowing disputes to be heard in a forum that was not the one specified in 
  the legislative scheme. Consequently, the court in Weber held that disputes 
  which arose both expressly as well as those which arose only inferentially out 
  of a collective agreement, had to go to arbitration. Extrapolating from that 
  approach, Bastarache J. concluded that the legislature had provided a comprehensive 
  scheme regarding discipline within the Police Act and Regulations, which included 
  the investigation and adjudication of discipline matters, and that formalistic 
  interpretations of the Act must be avoided if they would deny the Commission 
  jurisdiction in such cases. As a result, although the chief of police did not 
  follow the correct procedure in disciplining the police officer, the officer's 
  constructive dismissal could be appealed to the police commission. Bastarache 
  J. went on to note that the Commission would have the jurisdiction to determine 
  its own jurisdiction in the case, although he stated that it did have jurisdiction 
  in that case.</p>
<p>
  [30] A similar analysis applies in this case. Section 70(1) of the Police Services 
  Act allows a police officer to appeal to the Commission after receiving notice 
  of the decision made by the chief of police after a hearing. In this case there 
  was no hearing and no notice. However, giving the Act a liberal interpretation, 
  although the procedure of the Act was not followed, the Commission is not deprived 
  of jurisdiction and an appeal would lie to the Commission. Again, it would be 
  for the Commission to decide its own jurisdiction on the evidence placed before 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [31] Finally, the respondents submit that under ss. 68(1) and (5) of the Police 
  Services Act, transfer is not one of the consequences that can be imposed by 
  the chief of police as a disciplinary measure and, therefore, the disguised 
  discipline complained of is outside the scope of the Act. There are two responses 
  to this submission. The first is that s. 68(5) includes a direction that an 
  officer undergo specified training or participate in a specified program or 
  activity. Applying a liberal interpretation of these provisions, they can be 
  viewed as encompassing what occurred in this case, where the respondents were 
  temporarily reassigned to other duties and told that they were going to be given 
  further training.</p>
<p>
  [32] Second, a similar argument was made in the Regina Police Association case, 
  that constructive dismissal was not one of the consequences that could be imposed 
  as discipline under the Police Act, and therefore there was no recourse under 
  the Act. Bastarache J. dealt with the issue, applying his admonition that formalistic 
  interpretations must be avoided, stating that &quot;even if the Police Act and 
  Regulations do not expressly provide for the type of disciplinary action that 
  was taken in the case at bar, the action may still arise inferentially from 
  the disciplinary scheme which the legislature has provided&quot; (para. 35).</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [33] The provisions of the Police Services Act and Regulations dealing with 
  police discipline matters, and supplemented by s. 26(4) of the Public Service 
  Act which deems discipline to be incorporated into the OPP collective agreement 
  as a management right, form a complete code governing all discipline for the 
  OPP. There is no gap which would give the Superior Court jurisdiction to hear 
  the matter as a civil cause of action, the essential nature of which matter 
  is discipline including disguised discipline.</p>
<p>
  [34] I would therefore allow the appeal with costs, set aside the order of the 
  motion judge and dismiss the action with costs. If the parties cannot agree 
  on costs, the appellants may provide a bill of costs with 7 days and the respondents 
  may make any submission on the bill of costs within 5 days thereafter. All submissions 
  are to be addressed to the Chief Legal Officer of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The respondents rely on two Ontario cases, 
  Praskey v. Metropolitan Toronto police Services Board (1997), 26 C.C.E.L. (2d) 
  251(C.A.) and Saxon v. Fryer (1997), (unreported, Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) which 
  effectively held that because the Police Services Act and Regulations set out 
  a complete disciplinary scheme for police officers, discipline matters are outside 
  the collective agreement, and therefore the collective agreement does not oust 
  the jurisdiction of the court over such a matter. Those courts did not have 
  the benefit of the Supreme Court analysis in the Regina Police Association case 
  and of the conclusion in that case.</p>
