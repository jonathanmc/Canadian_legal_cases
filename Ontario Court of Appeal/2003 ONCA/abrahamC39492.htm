<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John F. McGarry of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 9, 2003.</p>
<p>GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The main issue in this appeal is whether Bonnie Abraham is precluded by 
  the governing legislative scheme from claiming the costs she incurred in hiring 
  a substitute caregiver for herself, when her husband could no longer care for 
  her due to the serious injuries he suffered in a car accident. For the reasons 
  that follow, we have determined that she is not barred from making this claim 
  and we would therefore allow the appeal and reverse the motions judge.</p>
<p>[2] Leonard Abraham was seriously injured in a car accident on December 3, 
  1996. His wife, Bonnie Abraham, was not involved in the accident. Since well 
  before the accident, Bonnie had suffered from a serious medical condition for 
  which she required the care giving services of an aid or attendant. Before the 
  accident, Leonard provided most of these services. He received no remuneration 
  for this work. Unfortunately, due to the injuries Leonard sustained in the accident, 
  his ability to continue these services is permanently impaired. The accident 
  has also rendered him substantially unable to perform the essential tasks of 
  his regular employment.</p>
<p>[3] In this action Leonard sues for damages for his injuries. Given the date 
  of the accident, the relevant legislation is the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability 
  Act, S.O. 1996, c. 21, known as Bill 59. </p>
<p>[4] Bonnie also claims damages pursuant to s. 61 of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. F.3. These include a claim for the expenses she has incurred for replacement 
  care giving that Leonard can no longer provide. </p>
<p>[5] Section 36 of the Statutory Accidents Benefits Schedule (SABS) under Bill 
  59 required Leonard to elect between receiving an income replacement benefit 
  and a caregiver benefit. He elected the former. </p>
<p>[6] The parties stated a case seeking the court's opinion on two questions. 
</p>
<p>[7] The first is whether the substitute caregiver expenses claimed by Bonnie 
  are &quot;health care&quot; expenses within the meaning of s. 224(1) and s. 
  267.5(3) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. It is agreed that if they 
  are, the respondents cannot be sued for them. </p>
<p>[8] The second is whether, in any event, Bonnie cannot claim these expenses 
  because her claim is derivative of Leonard's claim and Leonard elected to take 
  an income replacement benefit rather than a caregiver benefit.</p>
<p>[9] The motions judge found that the expenses Bonnie claimed were not &quot;health 
  care&quot; expenses but that she could not advance a claim for them because 
  of Leonard's election.</p>
<p>[10] Leonard and Bonnie Abraham appeal the answer to the second question. The 
  defendants cross-appeal the answer to the first question. Because the second 
  question only arises if the motions judge correctly answered the first question, 
  we will deal with the cross-appeal first.</p>
<p>THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE</p>
<p>[11] The two provisions of the Insurance Act that are relevant to this issue 
  are the definition of &quot;health care&quot; in s. 224(1) and the protection 
  from liability for &quot;health care&quot; expenses in s. 267.5(3). These are 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">224. (1) Definitions - In this Part,</p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;health care&quot; includes all goods and services for which payment is 
  provided by the medical, rehabilitation and attendant care benefits provided 
  for in the Statutory Accidents Benefits Schedule. (&quot;soins de sant&eacute;&quot;) 
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">
  267.5 (3) Protection from liability; health care expenses - Despite any other 
  Act and subject to subsections (4) and (6), the owner of an automobile, the 
  occupants of an automobile and any person present at the incident are not liable 
  in an action in Ontario for damages for expenses that have been incurred or 
  will be incurred for health care resulting from bodily injury arising directly 
  or indirectly from the use or operation of the automobile.</p>
<p class="indent">
  [12] The cross-appellants say that both s. 14 (the Medical Benefit section) 
  and s. 15 (the Rehabilitation Benefit section) of SABS entitle Leonard Abraham 
  to receive payment for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by him or 
  on his behalf as a result of the accident, in providing substitute care giving 
  for his wife. Sections 14 and 15 provide:</p>
<p class="indent">
  14.(1) The insurer shall pay an insured person who sustains an impairment as 
  a result of an accident a medical benefit.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (2) The medical benefit shall pay for all reasonable and necessary expenses

<p class="indent">
  (a) medical, surgical, dental, optometric, hospital, nursing, ambulance, audiometric 
  and speech-language pathology services;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (b) chiropratic, psychological, occupational therapy and physiotherapy services;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (c) medication;</p>

  (4) The insurer is not liable to pay a medical benefit under clause (2)(a), 
  (b) or (h) for expenses related to professional services rendered to an insured 
  person that exceed the maximum rate or amount of expenses established under

  Insurance Commission or Financial Services Commission of Ontario, as they may 
  be amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (5) Subject to subsection (6), the insurer is not liable to pay a medical benefit 
  under clause (2)(g) for expenses related to transportation unless the expenses 
  are authorized by, and are calculated by applying the rates set out in, the

  Insurance Commission or Financial Services Commission of Ontario, as they may 
  be amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="indent">

  expenses related to the first 50 kilometres of transportation in the insured 
  person's automobile to and from a treatment session.</p>
<p class="indent">
  15. (1) The insurer shall pay an insured person who sustains an impairment as 
  a result of an accident a rehabilitation benefit.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (2) The rehabilitation benefit shall pay for reasonable and necessary measures 
  undertaken by an insured person to reduce or eliminate the effects of any disability 
  resulting from the impairment or to facilitate the insured person's reintegration 
  into his or her family, the rest of society and the labour market.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) Measures to reintegrate an insured person into the labour market include 
  measures that are reasonable and necessary to enable the person to,</p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) engage in employment that is as similar as possible to employment in which 
  he or she engaged before the accident; or</p>
<p class="indent">
  (b) lead as normal a work life as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (4) In determining whether a measure is reasonable and necessary for the purpose 
  of subsection (3), the insurer shall consider the insured person's personal 
  and vocational characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (5) The rehabilitation benefit shall pay for all reasonable and necessary expenses 
  incurred by or on behalf of the insured person as a result of the accident for 
  a purpose referred to in subsection (2) for, </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) life skills training;</p>
<p class="indent">

<p class="indent">
  (i) home modifications and home devices, including communication aids, to accommodate 
  the needs of the insured person, or the purchase of a new home if it is more 
  reasonable to purchase a new home to accommodate the needs of the insured person 
  than to renovate the insured person's existing home;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (j) vehicle modifications to accommodate the needs of the insured person, or 
  the purchase of a new vehicle if it is more reasonable to purchase a new vehicle 
  to accommodate the needs of the insured person than to modify an existing vehicle;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (k) transportation for the insured person to and from counselling sessions, 
  training sessions and assessments, including transportation for an aide or attendant;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (l) other goods and services that the insured person requires, except services 
  provided by a case manager.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (6) The insurer is not liable to pay a rehabilitation benefit under any of clauses

<p class="indent">
  (7) For the purpose of clause (5)(i), expenses incurred to renovate the insured

<p class="indent">
  (10) The amount of the rehabilitation benefit for the purpose of a new vehicle 
  shall not exceed the cost of the new vehicle, less the trade-in value of the 
  existing vehicle.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (11) Subject to subsection (12), the insurer is not liable to pay a rehabilitation 
  benefit under clause (5)(k) for expenses related to transportation unless the 
  expenses are authorized by, and are calculated by applying the rates set out 
  in, the Transportation Expense Guidelines published in The Ontario Gazette by 
  the Ontario Insurance Commission or Financial Services Commission of Ontario, 
  as they may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (12) The insurer is not liable to pay a rehabilitation benefit under clause 
  (5)(k) for expenses related to the first 50 kilometres of transportation in 
  the insured person's automobile to and from a counselling session, training 
  session or assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">
  [13] The cross-appellants argue that because the expenses claimed by Bonnie 
  Abraham are for medical and rehabilitation benefits, they therefore constitute 
  &quot;health care&quot; expenses from which they are protected by s. 267.5(3). 
  We disagree. </p>
<p>[14] In our view the medical and rehabilitation benefits provided by SABS are 
  for expenses that relate to the medical and rehabilitation needs of the person 
  who sustained an impairment as a result of the accident. In this case they would 
  be the medical and rehabilitation needs of Leonard himself. They do not apply 
  where the needs are of someone not involved in the accident. The language of 
  ss. 14 and 15 of SABS makes this clear.</p>
<p>[15] This conclusion is fortified by s. 13 of SABS. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">13. (1) The insurer shall pay an insured person who sustains 
  an impairment as a result of an accident a caregiver benefit if the insured 
  person meets all of the following qualifications:</p>
<p class="indent">
  1. At the time of the accident,</p>
<p class="indent">
  i. the insured person was residing with a person in need of care, and</p>
<p class="indent">
  ii. the insured person was the primary caregiver for the person in need of care 
  and did not receive any remuneration for engaging in caregiving activities.</p>
<p class="indent">
  2. As a result of and within 104 weeks after the accident, the insured person 
  suffers a substantial inability to engage in the caregiving activities in which 
  he or she engaged at the time of the accident.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (2) The caregiver benefit shall pay for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred 
  as a result of the accident in caring for a person in need of care.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) The amount of the caregiver benefit shall not exceed,</p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) for the first person in need of care,</p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) $250 per week, or</p>
<p class="indent">
  (ii) if the optional caregiver and dependant care benefit referred to in section 
  27 has been purchased and is applicable to the insured person, the amount fixed 
  by the optional benefit; and</p>
<p class="indent">
  (b) for each additional person in need of care,</p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) $50 per week, or</p>
<p class="indent">
  (ii) if the optional caregiver and dependant care benefit referred to in section 
  27 has been purchased and is applicable to the insured person, the amount fixed 
  by the optional benefit. </p>
<p class="indent">
  (4) The insurer is not required to pay a caregiver benefit for any period longer 
  than 104 weeks of disability, unless, as a result of the accident, the insured 
  person is suffering a complete inability to carry on a normal life.</p>
<p>[16] This section provides for a caregiver benefit payable to an insured who 
  sustains an impairment as a result of an accident where the insured was the 
  primary caregiver for another and was rendered by the accident unable to continue 
  to be the caregiver. It much more aptly describes the situation of Leonard and 
  Bonnie Abraham. It supports the conclusion that the substitute caregiver services 
  in this case are not covered by the medical or rehabilitation benefits provided 
  by ss. 14 and 15 of SABS. Thus caregiver benefits are not included within the 
  definition of &quot;health care&quot; benefits in s. 224(1). Hence s. 267.5(3) 
  provides the cross-appellants with no protection from Bonnie Abraham's claim 
  for replacement care giving expenses.</p>
<p>[17] We therefore agree with the answer given by the motions judge to the first 
  question and would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>THE DERIVATIVE CLAIM ISSUE</p>
<p>[18] The motions judge found that Bonnie Abraham could not claim her expenses 
  for substitute care giving because hers was a derivative claim. Since her husband 
  could not claim a caregiver benefit, having elected to take an income replacement 
  benefit, she could not do so either.</p>
<p>[19] In our opinion, this mistakes the nature of Bonnie's claim under s. 61 
  of the Family Law Act. That section requires only that Leonard be entitled to 
  recover damages. That is his assertion in this action. The resulting cause of 
  action that the statute gives to Bonnie is her own, and it entitles her to claim 
  her own replacement care giving expenses.</p>
<p>[20] Leonard's election to take the income replacement benefit rather than 
  the caregiver benefit under s. 13 of SABS might or might not have barred him 
  from suing in tort for expenses for replacement care giving for his wife, had 
  he done so. We need not decide that issue in this case. It is sufficient to 
  say that his election under SABS affects him but not Bonnie. It can serve as 
  no bar to her statutory cause of action and the damages she can claim as a result.</p>
<p>[21] We therefore allow the appeal and answer the second question in the negative. 
  We dismiss the cross-appeal. The expenses claimed by Bonnie Abraham are not 
  barred but are recoverable in tort in her derivative claim under s. 61 of the 
  Family Law Act.</p>
<p>[22] Given our conclusions on these two questions, we reverse the costs order 
  of the motions judge and award the appellants costs of $3,000 plus G.S.T. for 
  the motion. We order costs of the appeal to the appellants in the same amount.</p>
