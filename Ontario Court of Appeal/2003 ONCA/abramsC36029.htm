<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice David G. Stinson of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 20, 2001. </p>
<p> CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] The primary issue in this appeal concerns the duties of a securities broker 
  and brokerage firm to a retail client, in particular, the duties associated 
  with the client's investments in special warrants and special shares of private 
  companies. The secondary issue concerns the entitlement of a broker and brokerage 
  firm to raise the doctrine of estoppel by representation against a retail client 
  based on the client's written represent-ations in subscription agreements entered 
  into by him as a prerequisite of participating in the investments.</p>
<p> [2] The appellants appeal from the judgment of Stinson J. of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated February 20, 2001 by which they were ordered to pay the 
  respondent the sum of $150,800, that is, fifty per cent of the respondent's 
  losses on his investments, plus interest and costs. The trial judge concluded 
  that the broker, Anne Spork, breached duties owed to the appellants' client, 
  Philip Abrams, to make a balanced presentation regarding the prospective investments 
  and to warn him of the risks associated with the investments. The brokerage 
  firm, Sprott Securities Limited, was held vicariously liable for Spork's negligence. 
  By virtue of Spork's conduct, the trial judge concluded that both appellants 
  were precluded from relying on Abrams' representations in the subscription agreements 
  as the basis of an estoppel against him. The trial judge also determined that 
  the appellants did not owe Abrams a fiduciary duty and that Sprott had not negligently 
  conducted due diligence reviews of the private companies in whose securities 
  Abrams invested; nor had Sprott breached any duty of disclosure to Abrams. Finally, 
  the trial judge held that Abrams failed to take reasonable care in signing the 
  subscription agreements. Consequently, the appellants' liability for Abrams' 
  losses was reduced by fifty per cent due to Abrams' contributory negligence. 
</p>
<p> [3] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge committed 
  no error in his finding of negligence against the appellants or in his determination 
  that Spork's negli-gence precluded them from relying on Abrams' representations 
  to raise an estoppel against him. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p> [4] At the time of trial, Abrams was an 82 year-old semi-retired businessman. 
  During his active business career, he amassed a personal net worth of about 
  $2 million through an importing and exporting business operated by a private 
  company, Transpacific Sales Ltd. (&quot;Transpacific&quot;), which was owned 
  by Abrams and his family.</p>
<p> [5] From the early 1980s to 1996, Abrams made numerous investments in various 
  securities, including mortgages, fixed income and trust units, and mutual funds. 
  By the mid 1990s, he began to actively invest in initial public offerings (&quot;IPOs&quot;) 
  of shares that had not previously traded on the stock market. Prior to his involvement 
  with Sprott, he used the services of nine separate brokerage firms to facilitate 
  his trading.</p>
<p> [6] In 1996, after Abrams approached Sprott concerning its services, Sprott 
  became the tenth brokerage firm used by Abrams and Spork became Abrams' broker 
  at that firm. Sprott offers services to institutional clients and high net worth 
  individuals. It specializes in small and mid-range capitalized equities. Spork 
  is a director, registered securities representative and vice-president of Sprott.</p>
<p> [7] Prior to the two transactions at issue in this appeal, Abrams made several 
  successful investments through Sprott, including investments in private placements 
  and IPOs by public companies. None of those investments involved the securities 
  of private companies.</p>
<p> [8] In the fall of 1996, Spork informed Abrams of the opportunity to invest 
  in special warrants of Credit Card Communications Canada Inc. (&quot;CCCC Inc.&quot;) 
  and special shares of Vanity Software Publishing Corporation (&quot;Vanity&quot;) 
  (collectively, the &quot;Investments&quot;). Both CCCC Inc. and Vanity were 
  private companies in the start-up phase of their respective businesses. CCCC 
  Inc., a high technology company, proposed using credit card swipe technology 
  in combination with cellular telephones. Vanity's proposed busi-ness involved 
  the development and marketing of computer software. Although it was intended 
  that both companies would proceed in the future with IPOs of their common shares, 
  at the time of the Investments neither companies' shares were available for 
  trading on any securities exchange and neither company had ever undertaken an 
  IPO. </p>
<p> [9] Abrams invested a total of $301,600 in the Investments. Before allowing 
  Abrams to participate in the Investments, Sprott required that he sign two written 
  subscription agreements. Abrams testified at trial that he did not read either 
  agreement in detail. </p>
<p> [10] Subsequently, when CCCC Inc.'s business failed and neither CCCC Inc. 
  or Vanity proceeded with an IPO, Abrams lost the entirety of his invested funds. 
  He sued the appellants for damages, claiming that his losses were caused by 
  their breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and negligent misrepresentation in 
  connection with the Investments. </p>
<p> II. ADDITIONAL FACTS</p>
<p> (1) Abrams' Investment Experience</p>
<p> [11] Abrams was not a novice investor. On the contrary, his securities trading 
  was frequent and considerable. During an average month in 1996, he carried out 
  approx-imately two dozen or more securities transactions. In November 1996, 
  he engaged in more than sixty such transactions. Abrams not only initiated most 
  of his trades, he also traded on margin, sometimes borrowing up to $800,000 
  to invest in securities.</p>
<p> [12] By May 1996, Abrams' investments with his principal broker, Scotia McLeod, 
  had a market value of more than $2.4 million. In the same year, he purchased 
  equities having a total value of $4.9 million and disposed of equities valued 
  in total at $2.7 million. He also acquired mutual funds with a total worth of 
  almost $6.7 million and disposed of mutual funds having a total worth of about 
  $5.6 million. </p>
<p> [13] The trial judge found that Abrams followed his investments closely. He 
  had daily contact with one or two of his brokers. He regularly charted the progress 
  of his mutual funds investments, selling them if their value fell for one or 
  two days in succession. He was similarly attentive to and enthusiastic about 
  prospective IPOs. Every month he vetted a list of IPO opportunities provided 
  by Scotia McLeod, obtained information concerning IPO opportunities from his 
  other brokers, and selected one or two IPOs in which to invest. </p>
<p> [14] In a new client application form completed by Spork for Abrams, Spork 
  described Abrams' investment knowledge as &quot;good&quot; in contrast to &quot;sophisticated&quot;, 
  &quot;limited&quot; or &quot;poor/new&quot;. Although the accuracy of that description 
  was not confirmed by Abrams and he did not sign the Sprott application form, 
  Abrams was aware that his investment knowledge had been characterized as &quot;sophisticated&quot; 
  in application forms signed by him with some of the other brokerage firms with 
  whom he dealt. Some of those forms were provided to Sprott.</p>
<p> [15] The trial judge concluded that Abrams was an intelligent and astute businessman. 
  He said that by the Fall of 1996: &quot;[Abrams] could not be described as an 
  unsophisticated or inexperienced investor&quot; and &quot;[Abrams] had sufficient 
  knowledge, experience and ability to understand a variety of investment options 
  (although not all) and the risks associated with them. He sought a variety of 
  investment opportunities, sought inform-ation relating to them, and made up 
  his own mind.&quot;</p>
<p> (2) Abrams' Dealings with Spork</p>
<p> [16] Abrams declined to open a managed account with Sprott, contrary to Spork's 
  recommendation that he do so. Instead, he told Spork that he was interested 
  in Sprott's ideas but wanted to invest on his own. Abrams communicated with 
  Spork approximately twice per week. He made several investments through Sprott 
  based on investment ideas and advice provided by Spork. In addition, he sometimes 
  used Sprott to purchase portions of IPOs promoted by other brokers. Most of 
  Abrams' transactions with Sprott involved the delivery of purchased securities 
  to Scotia McLeod, with payment for the securities effected through the latter 
  firm. Consequently, Spork was often unable to determine Abrams' exact holdings.</p>
<p> [17] The trial judge described Abrams' relationship with Spork in these terms: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Abrams was by no means dependent nor exclusively reliant 
  upon Ms. Spork when choosing his investments. Rather, I find as a fact that 
  Mr. Abrams made his own investment decisions, taking into account the advice 
  and information provided to him by Ms. Spork, the input of other registered 
  representatives, his own assessment and analysis of that information and the 
  risk/benefit that a particular investment presented.</p>
<p> (3) The Investments </p>
<p> [18] In September 1996, Sprott agreed with CCCC Inc. to act as its agent in 
  attempting to raise U.S. $11 million through the sale of special warrants and 
  an additional U.S. $3 million through an IPO of CCCC Inc.'s common shares. Because 
  the special warrants offering was a private placement pursuant to prospectus 
  exemptions under applicable securities legislation, a minimum investment of 
  $150,000 by each investor was required. After CCCC Inc. obtained a receipt for 
  a preliminary and final prospectus for its planned IPO, the special warrants 
  would be convertible to common shares of CCCC Inc. </p>
<p> [19] At about the same time, Sprott also agreed to act as Vanity's agent in 
  attempting to raise Cdn. $2 million through the sale of special shares, with 
  the expectation that Vanity would thereafter complete an IPO of its common shares. 
  As in the case of CCCC Inc.'s special warrants, the Vanity special shares were 
  offered as a private placement exempt from prospectus requirements, thereby 
  necessitating a minimum investment of $150,000 by each investor. Upon clearance 
  by securities regulators of a prospectus for Vanity's planned IPO, each special 
  share would entitle the holder thereof to acquire one common share of Vanity 
  at no additional cost. </p>
<p> [20] Sprott's corporate finance department carried out due diligence reviews 
  concerning CCCC Inc. and Vanity, accumulating in the process various business, 
  financial and legal records and information regarding each company. The department 
  then held a presentation meeting regarding each of the Investments with the 
  registered representatives of Sprott's retail department in order that the representatives 
  could market the Investments to interested Sprott clients. Spork attended both 
  meetings.</p>
<p> [21] At the CCCC Inc. presentation meeting, Spork received a brochure describing 
  the company's operations, a business plan and a term sheet regarding the special 
  warrants offering, all of which she subsequently provided to Abrams. Although 
  Abrams asserted that Spork recommended the special warrants offering and made 
  positive representations to him concerning CCCC Inc.'s profitability, the trial 
  judge rejected those claims, finding instead that Spork merely informed Abrams 
  of an &quot;interesting investment opportunity&quot; and that Abrams made his 
  own decision about whether to invest in the warrants. </p>
<p> [22] After the Vanity presentation meeting, Spork provided Abrams with an 
  executive summary describing Vanity's business and product, together with a 
  business plan, copies of which she received at the meeting. She told Abrams 
  that the Vanity special shares were an interesting prospect and that Vanity 
  seemed to have good management. The trial judge rejected Abrams' claim that 
  she also told him that Vanity was very profitable.</p>
<p> [23] Abrams invested $151,580 in CCCC Inc.'s special warrants and $150,020 
  in Vanity's special shares. As I have mentioned, he ultimately lost the entirety 
  of his invested capital.</p>
<p> (4) The Subscription Agreements</p>
<p> [24] In accordance with Sprott's standard procedures for private placements, 
  Sprott's syndication department forwarded subscription agreements to all subscribers 
  for the Investments. Subscribers were required to sign the agreements prior 
  to participating in the Investments. </p>
<p> [25] Abrams acknowledged at trial that he assumed that he would not be allowed 
  to purchase the CCCC Inc. special warrants unless he signed the CCCC Inc. subscription 
  agreement. The trial judge concluded that Abrams knew that Sprott relied on 
  his signed subscription agreements when deciding whether to sell the special 
  warrants and special shares to him.</p>
<p> [26] Abrams signed the CCCC Inc. and Vanity subscription agreements in his 
  personal capacity on October 21, 1996 and November 13, 1996, respectively. Under 
  his signa-tures in several places in both agreements, in the spaces reserved 
  for a description of his position, he inserted the word &quot;janitor&quot;. 
  At trial, he said that there were things in the agreements that he regarded 
  as &quot;biased&quot; and that his use of the word &quot;janitor&quot; was intended 
  to qualify his signatures. He did not inform the appellants of that intention 
  or of his failure to read the details of the agreements before signing them.</p>
<p> [27] Although Abrams signed the agreements in his personal capacity, the profits 
  and losses associated with his involvement in the Investments in fact belonged 
  to Trans-pacific. Abrams never disclosed Transpacific's interest in the Investments 
  to the appel-lants prior to this litigation.</p>
<p> [28] Each agreement contained provisions describing the constraints on the 
  resale or marketability of the applicable securities and a series of acknowledgements, 
  representations and warranties by the subscriber, which were expressed to survive 
  closing. In both agreements, Abrams made representations or provided acknowledge-ments 
  concerning his financial and business experience and knowledge and confirmed 
  that he was able to bear the &quot;economic risk&quot; of the Investments. In 
  the Vanity agreement, for example, he expressly acknowledged that he was &quot;knowledgeable, 
  sophisticated and experienced&quot; in business and financial matters. As well, 
  in each agreement, he repres-ented or acknowledged that he was &quot;capable 
  of evaluating the merits and risks&quot; of the applicable investment and agreed 
  that he intended that his representations and acknowledgements be relied upon 
  by Sprott and the offering company. In the CCCC Inc. agreement, he acknowledged 
  that CCCC Inc. was not a &quot;reporting issuer&quot; and that holders of securities 
  in CCCC Inc. &quot;may not be able to sell such securities for an indefinite 
  period of time&quot;. That acknowledgement appeared in the CCCC Inc. subscription 
  agreement in bold print.</p>
<p> [29] Abrams also signed various schedules to the CCCC Inc. subscription agreement. 
  One such schedule, which he was not required to complete, contained the following 
  additional subscriber acknowledgements: &quot;I acknowledge that: &#133;(c) 
  I may lose all of my investment, AND &#133;(e) I will not receive a prospectus&#133;because 
  the Issuer has advised me that it is relying on a prospectus exemption&#133;&quot;</p>
<p> III. ISSUES</p>
<p> [30] The appellants advance two arguments in support of their appeal. First, 
  they argue that the trial judge erred in finding that they were negligent in 
  failing to advise Abrams of the risks associated with the Investments. Second, 
  they maintain that the trial judge erred in holding that they were precluded, 
  by Spork's conduct, from asserting an estoppel against Abrams based on his representations 
  in the subscription agreements. If they are unsuccessful in those submissions, 
  the appellants do not challenge the trial judge's assignment of fifty per cent 
  liability to them. Abrams does not cross-appeal against any aspect of the trial 
  judgment although he argues, in response to the appellants' submissions, that 
  the trial judge erred in failing to find that Sprott owed, and breached, a duty 
  of full disclosure to him. </p>
<p> IV. ANALYSIS</p>
<p> (1) The Negligence Finding </p>
<p> [31] On this appeal, the appellants do not challenge the trial judge's holding 
  that Spork owed a duty to warn Abrams of the risks of the Investments. Rather, 
  they assert that the scope of the applicable duty to warn is constrained by 
  the trial judge's findings of fact concerning Abrams' knowledge and experience 
  as an investor and the nature of his relationship with the appellants. I agree. 
</p>
<p> [32] The appellants further submit that the trial judge did not identify the 
  risks which Spork failed to warn against and that the trial judge's reasons, 
  properly understood, must be taken to refer to the risk attendant upon investing 
  in private companies, whose shares are not available to be publicly traded on 
  any securities exchange, in contrast to the risk of investing in a public company, 
  whose shares are traded on one or more exchanges. Since Abrams admitted at trial 
  that Spork told him that CCCC Inc. and Vanity were private companies and that 
  there would be a delay before they were listed on any stock exchange, the appellants 
  claim that they discharged their duty to warn him of the risk of the Investments. 
  I am unable to accept that argument, for the following reasons. </p>
<p> [33] The appellants properly submit that the extent of a broker's duty to 
  a client, beyond the duty of executing instructions and acting honestly, is 
  a question of fact in each case. As well, the content and scope of a broker's 
  duty to warn is defined with reference both to the knowledge and skill of the 
  client and to the nature of the relation-ship between the client and broker. 
  As Winkler J. stated at 233-34 in Carom v. Bre-X Minerals Ltd. (1999), 44 O.R. 
  (3d) 173 (S.C.), aff'd (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 315 (Div. Ct.), rev'd on other grounds 
  (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 236 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada 
  denied [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 660: </p>
<p class="indent"> [A] duty to warn does not arise merely because of the broker-client 
  relationship. In Reed v. McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd. (1990), 52 B.C.L.R. (2d) 
  265 at p. 271, [1991] 2 W.W.R. 617 (C.A.), the court stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> The extent of the duty of broker to client beyond the bare 
  duty of executing instructions and being honest is thus a question of fact in 
  each case of what passes between broker and client. A duty to warn does not 
  arise from the mere relationship of broker to client, but from the facts.</p>
<p class="indent">In essence, the existence of a duty to warn is dependent on 
  the standard of care owed to a particular client. Accordingly, the specifics 
  of the relationship between the broker and the client must be analyzed to determine 
  whether a broker has a duty to warn a client&#133;For example, it cannot be 
  said that the same standard of care exists between [a discount brokerage firm, 
  which does not provide advice, and its client] as would exist between a broker 
  and a client who relied on the broker to manage a discretionary trading account. 
  Nor can it be said that the standard of care for a client who is interested 
  only in speculating is the same as that for a client who relies upon the broker 
  for advice on a long-term investment.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">The standard of care owed by an investment advisor to a particular 
  client is concordant with the services that the advisor undertook to provide 
  to the client, that is, whether the client was to be provided advice as opposed 
  to mere information or whether the advisor was given discretion to trade on 
  behalf of the client.</p>
<p> [34] The standard of care which applies to an inexperienced investor is considerably 
  higher than the standard that exists between a broker and a seasoned investor. 
  In Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd. v. Fresaid Enterprises Ltd., [1993] R.J.Q. 2359 
  (Q.S.C.), aff'd [1998] A.Q. No. 403 (Q.C.A.), Hesler J. addressed this proposition 
  at p. 2370: &quot;Certainly the obligations of the broker have to be inversely 
  proportional to the experience and skills of the client and the degree of independence 
  the latter asserts in decisions regarding investments.&quot;</p>
<p> [35] The trial judge found that Abrams was a knowledgeable and experienced 
  investor, who was neither vulnerable nor exclusively reliant upon Spork in making 
  investment decisions. Further, Abrams made his own decisions regarding the Investments 
  at issue in this appeal. In addition, Abrams' account with Spork was not a managed 
  account and Abrams does not contend that the appellants had the discretion to 
  effect trades on his behalf without his prior authorization.<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> 
  Based in part on those facts, the trial judge held that the relationship between 
  the parties was not fiduciary in nature.</p>
<p> [36] As indicated by the trial judge, however, the fact that the relationship 
  between the parties was not fiduciary in character does not mean that the appellants 
  owed no duty of care to Abrams. The trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> As was more recently observed by Colin Campbell J. in 875121 
  Ontario Ltd. [v. Nesbitt Burns Inc. (1999), 50 B.L.R. (2d) 137 (Ont. S.C.)] 
  at 156: &quot;[T]he fact that [the broker] did not have a fiduciary duty to 
  [the client] in respect of investment advice does not relieve [the broker] of 
  a duty to take care in respect of the advice given, a duty which sounds in negligence.</p>
<p> [37] Spork occasionally provided investment advice and recommendations to 
  Abrams, which he sometimes followed. Thus, she did not function exclusively 
  as a mere order-taker for Abrams' investment decisions. Further, as Abrams' 
  registered representative at Sprott, Spork was bound in her dealings with him 
  by the professional standards of conduct articulated in the Canadian Securities 
  Institute's Conduct and Practices Handbook (the &quot;CP Handbook&quot;). Those 
  standards inform, but do not govern, the standards of care set by the courts 
  for acceptable professional conduct: Hunt v. TD Securities Inc., supra, at para. 
  62, per Gillese J.A. and Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377 at 425, per 
  LaForest J.</p>
<p> [38] The reasons of the trial judge reflect his understanding that two standards 
  set out in the CP Handbook are especially relevant in this case: </p>
<p class="indent"> A. The Registered Representative must display absolute trustworthiness 
  since the client's interests must be the foremost consideration in all business 
  dealings.</p>
<p> I. Know your client. A diligent and business-like effort must be made to learn 
  the essential and current financial and personal circumstances and investment 
  objectives of each client. Relevant documentation should reflect material information 
  about and any material changes to the client's status.</p>
<p  class="center">…</p>
<p class="indent"> The [registered representative] has a responsibility to ensure that: </p>
<p  class="center">…</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) the client is made aware of all salient material, such as positive and 
  negative factors involved in a transaction, prior to executing a trade on the 
  client's behalf. A balanced presentation must be offered to the client in the 
  interest of complete disclosure and relative objectivity&#133;[emphasis added].</p>
<p> [39] The evidence at trial established that: (a) Spork brought the Investments 
  to Abrams' attention; (b) although both Investments were in the high risk category, 
  Spork failed to so advise Abrams; (c) Spork assumed that, as a knowledgeable 
  investor, Abrams knew the risk profile of the Investments; and (d) although 
  Spork told Abrams that the Investments involved the securities of private companies 
  that were not listed on any securities exchange, she did not tell him that the 
  planned IPOs of CCCC Inc. and Vanity might never take place and that the companies 
  might never be listed on any exchange.</p>
<p> [40] The trial judge held: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, Ms. Spork's failure to discuss the risks associated 
  with these investments was a breach of her duty to Mr. Abrams. The higher risk 
  associated with the securities was plainly a negative factor; her failure to 
  discuss that aspect leads me to the conclusion that she failed to make a balanced 
  presentation to him. The testimony of both the plaintiff's and the defendants' 
  experts supports this conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not consider that Mr. Abrams' relative sophistication (and 
  Ms. Spork's assumption in this regard) negated her duty to explain the risks 
  associated with this type of investment. I find as a fact that Mr. Abrams was 
  not familiar with the concept of either special warrants or special shares as 
  offered to him by Ms. Spork in the CCCC Inc. and Vanity financings, respectively&#133;I 
  conclude that had the risks been properly explained, Mr. Abrams may well have 
  refrained from making these two investments [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [41] Later in his reasons, when reviewing the appellants' claim of estoppel 
  in relation to the subscription agreements, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Ms. Spork had a duty to make a balanced presentation to Mr. 
  Abrams. Part of that obligation included disclosure of the level of risk associated 
  with the investments. Accordingly, implicit in the information that Ms. Spork 
  provided to Mr. Abrams, was a representation that she had fully disclosed the 
  level of risk associated with the investments. Thus, the representation made 
  by Mr. Abrams that he understood the transactions and that they were suitable 
  for him, which was relied upon by the defendants as giving rise to the estoppel, 
  was founded on the previous representation made by Ms. Spork to him. Ms. Spork's 
  representation, however, was not true, since she did not disclose the level 
  of risk associated with the investments [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [42] What, then, are the &quot;risks&quot; and the &quot;level of risk&quot; 
  associated with the Investments which lay at the heart of the trial judge's 
  negligence finding?</p>
<p> [43] Spork testified that there is &quot;slightly more risk in a private company 
  [in contrast to a public company] because your market is limited&quot;. The 
  trial judge referred to that testimony in his reasons. On that basis, the appellants 
  argue that the &quot;higher risk&quot; noted by the trial judge was the additional 
  risk which accompanies an investment in special warrants or special shares of 
  a private company as opposed to an investment in an IPO or a private placement 
  of a public company. In my view, that argument does not assist the appellants, 
  for two reasons. </p>
<p> [44] First, there is no evidence that Spork told Abrams that the Investments 
  involved a &quot;higher risk&quot; than investments in the securities of public 
  companies. Spork admitted in her testimony that she did not tell Abrams that 
  the Investments were in the high risk category. Further, she did not claim that 
  she engaged in any discussion with Abrams concerning the comparative risks of 
  the Investments.</p>
<p> [45] Second, and importantly, the trial judge did not limit his references 
  to the &quot;risks&quot; and the &quot;level of risk&quot; only to the fact 
  that the Investments were securities offered as private placements of private, 
  as opposed to public, companies; nor did he confine his discussion of risk to 
  a single &quot;risk&quot;. In my view, the appellants' characterization of the 
  &quot;risks&quot; referenced by the trial judge significantly understates the 
  multiple material risks associated with the Investments.</p>
<p> [46] The trial judge concluded that: &quot;Abrams was not familiar with the 
  concept of either special warrants or special shares as offered to him by Ms. 
  Spork in the CCCC Inc. and Vanity financings, respectively&quot;. The trial 
  judge had earlier indicated in his reasons, as I have previously mentioned, 
  that Abrams' ability to understand various investment options did not extend 
  to all investment options. Those findings, which are not contested by the appellants 
  before this court, confirmed that Abrams, notwithstanding his prior investment 
  experience, had no familiarity with the acquisition of warrants or special shares 
  of private companies, which have only a limited trading market. Thus, for Abrams, 
  his own lack of prior experience with and knowledge of these types of securities 
  represented a &quot;risk associated with these Investments&quot;.</p>
<p> [47] The Investments, however, also encompassed several other risks, including: 
  (a) the fact that the offerors were both start-up companies, without any proven 
  track record in the marketplace. Investments in start-up companies, whether 
  private or public, are specu-lative and intrinsically riskier than investments 
  in mature businesses; (b) the risks inherent to the business fundamentals of 
  both CCCC Inc. and Vanity as, for example, whether the business plans of both 
  companies were well-conceived and whether there was customer demand for their 
  proposed products; and (c) the risk of limited liquidity for the capital invested 
  in the Investments.</p>
<p> [48] Liquidity concerns an investor's ability to have recourse to his or her 
  invested capital. These Investments carried with them the risk that a subscriber's 
  access to his or her invested capital could be significantly limited if, as 
  ultimately occurred, CCCC Inc.'s and Vanity's planned IPOs did not proceed. 
  A liquidity risk may, but need not, signify a risk of loss of invested capital. 
  The failure of CCCC Inc. or Vanity to proceed with their planned IPOs would 
  not inevitably result in the loss of the capital which Abrams invested in their 
  securities. Markets, although restricted, exist for the securities of private 
  companies. The material risk, then, was that if the IPOs did not proceed, Abrams' 
  ability to access his invested capital would be highly constrained for an indeterminate 
  time because the purchased securities would have no public trading market. The 
  likelihood of the actual occurrence of the IPOs was thus a critical factor and 
  the liquidity of Abrams' invested funds was a component of the &quot;level of 
  risk&quot; of the Investments. </p>
<p> [49] There is no suggestion that Spork warned Abrams of the risk that the 
  planned IPOs of CCCC Inc. and Vanity might never proceed. On the contrary, Spork 
  testified at trial that she told Abrams that CCCC Inc. and Vanity &quot;would 
  do their [IPOs] 6 to 10 months down the road&quot;. That statement not only 
  failed to contain a warning that the IPOs might never take place, it led Abrams 
  away from considering that possibility and its liquidity implications. Similarly, 
  the appellants do not claim that Spork alerted Abrams to the possibility that 
  the business of CCCC Inc. or Vanity might fail. In the case of CCCC Inc., that 
  is precisely what transpired.</p>
<p> [50] Spork conceded at trial that she did not recall discussing any negatives 
  concerning the Investments with Abrams. She was thus unable to confirm that 
  she had met her professional obligations under the CP Handbook to ensure that 
  Abrams was made aware of both the positive and negative factors involved in 
  the Investments. </p>
<p> [51] Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the trial judge did not err in 
  concluding that Spork failed in her duty to warn Abrams of the risks associated 
  with the Investments. Indeed, in my view, that conclusion is unassailable.</p>
<p> (2) Reliance on Abrams' Representations </p>
<p> in the Subscription Agreements</p>
<p> [52] Abrams made a deliberate decision, motivated by his admitted desire to 
  avoid the legal consequences of the subscription agreements, not to read them 
  in their entirety. By signing them, however, he represented or acknowledged 
  to Sprott and the applicable offering company that he was capable of evaluating 
  the merits and risks of the Investments, that he was financially able to bear 
  the economic risk of the Investments and, in the case of CCCC Inc., that he 
  was aware that he might not be able to sell the securities for &quot;an indefinite 
  period of time&quot;. By the terms of the agreements, Abrams' statements were 
  expressed to be made with the intention that they be relied upon by Sprott and 
  the offering companies, and that they would survive the closing of the transactions 
  concerning the Investments.</p>
<p> [53] Abrams also sought to qualify his obligations under the agreements by 
  inserting the word &quot;janitor&quot; below his signatures in several places 
  in the agreements, a description of his position which he knew to be false, 
  with the subsequently asserted intention of signalling to the appellants that 
  he did not intend to be bound by the agreements notwithstanding his representations 
  to the contrary in both documents.</p>
<p> [54] Abrams' approach to the signing of the subscription agreements is most 
  troubling. His conduct is contrary to the normal practices and requirements 
  of ordinary commerce, upon which reasonable people are entitled to rely. I also 
  agree with the appellants' submission that Abrams' conduct, if condoned, could 
  be viewed as calling into question the utility and efficacy of written agreements 
  in consumer securities transactions. Abrams' conduct cannot be condoned. That, 
  however, is not the end of the matter. The consequences of his conduct must 
  be considered in light of whether Spork's own conduct, for which Sprott is also 
  liable, precipitated the representations by Abrams.</p>
<p> [55] This court has recognized the general proposition that the deliberate 
  tactic of not reading a commercial agreement before signing it will not relieve 
  the signatory from his or her obligations under the agreement. As stated by 
  Robins J.A. in Fraser Jewellers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection 
  Co. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) at 10: </p>
<p class="indent"> As a general proposition, in the absence of fraud or mis-representation, 
  a person is bound by an agreement to which he has put his signature whether 
  he has read its contents or has chosen to leave them unread: Cheshire, Fifoot 
  &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract, 13th ed. (1996) at p. 168. Failure to read 
  a contract before signing it is not a legally acceptable basis for refusing 
  to abide by it. A businessman executing an agreement on behalf of a company 
  must be presumed to be aware of its terms and to have intended that the company 
  would be bound by them. The fact that [the signatory] chose not to read the 
  contract can place him in no better position that a person who has. Nor is the 
  fact that the clause is in a standard pre-printed form and was not a subject 
  of negotiations sufficient in itself to vitiate the clause [citations omitted; 
  emphasis added].</p>
<p>See also 978011 Ontario Ltd. v. Cornell Engineering Co. (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 
  783 (C.A.) at 793-4.</p>
<p> [56] That general proposition, however, is not determinative of whether the 
  appellants are entitled in this case to rely on Abrams' written representations, 
  thereby escaping all liability to him. In my opinion, the trial judge correctly 
  found that the appellants are precluded from doing so. I reach that conclusion 
  for three reasons.</p>
<p> [57] First, application of the general proposition recognized in Fraser Jewellers, 
  as affirmed in Cornell Engineering, depends on the absence of misrepresentation 
  by the party seeking to rely on the written agreement. As well, in Fraser Jewellers 
  it was held that the party seeking to rely on the agreement had no legal obligation 
  to draw the relevant clause in the agreement to the attention of the signing 
  party because no special relationship existed between the parties that imposed 
  such an obligation. Neither of these factors applies here.</p>
<p> [58] Unlike the facts in Fraser Jewellers, the relationship between the appellants 
  and Abrams gave rise to a duty of care owed to Abrams. As I have already indicated, 
  Spork breached that duty of care by failing to warn Abrams of negative factors 
  concerning the Investments, that is, the risks associated with them as earlier 
  described in these reasons. </p>
<p> [59] In addition, the trial judge held that: &quot;[I]mplicit in the information 
  that Ms. Spork provided to Mr. Abrams, was a representation that she had fully 
  disclosed the level of risk associated with the investments&#133;Ms. Spork's 
  representation, however, was not true&quot;. The trial judge further stated: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, it does not matter whether Ms. Spork's non-disclosure 
  is characterized as fraudulent or innocent. The fact remains that Ms. Spork 
  failed in her duty to inform Mr. Abrams about the risks. Disclosure of those 
  risks would, in my view, have made Mr. Abrams hesitate or seek further information 
  before signing the subscription agreements. </p>
<p> [60] The trial judge thus held that Spork made a false representation to Abrams 
  regarding the discharge by her of her duty to warn. He further found that full 
  disclosure by Spork of the risks of the Investments would have made a difference 
  to Abrams. More-over, as I have mentioned, Spork represented to Abrams that 
  CCCC Inc. and Vanity &quot;would do their [IPOs] 6 to 10 months down the road&quot;. 
  While that statement may have reflected Spork's honest belief at the time it 
  was made, in fact there was no certainty when, or if, either IPO would be made. 
  Consequently, the representations made by Spork to Abrams take this case outside 
  the protection of the general proposition articulated in Fraser Jewellers, that 
  is, that a signatory to an unread agreement will be prevented from later attempting 
  to resile from the agreement.</p>
<p> [61] Second, as recognized by this court in Cornell Engineering at pp. 794-95, 
  contracting parties are obliged to respect the interests of the other where: 
  &quot;First, one party relies on the other for information necessary to make 
  an informed choice and, second, the party in possession of the information has 
  an opportunity, by withholding (or concealing) information, to bring about the 
  choice made by the other party.&quot; Although the trial judge found that Abrams 
  did not repose trust and confidence in Spork sufficient to create a fiduciary 
  relationship between them, he expressly held that Abrams was entitled to and 
  did rely on Spork to provide information to him concerning the Investments. 
  He further held that, without that information, Abrams was not in a position 
  to make an informed decision about whether to invest in the special warrants 
  and special shares. It is significant in that regard that Spork was bound under 
  the professional standards of conduct set out in the CP Handbook to &quot;display 
  absolute trustworthiness since the client's interests must be the foremost consideration 
  in all business dealings [emphasis added].&quot;</p>
<p> [62] Finally, a person cannot rely by way of estoppel on a statement induced 
  by his or her own misrepresentation. As observed by the trial judge, support 
  for that principle may be found in George Whitechurch, Ltd. v. Cavanagh, [1902] 
  A.C. 117 (H.L.). See also Wood v. Smart (1914), 16 D.L.R. 97 (Man. K.B.) and, 
  as referenced therein, Porter v. Moore, [1904] 2 Ch. 367.</p>
<p> V. OTHER ISSUES</p>
<p> [63] On my view of this appeal, it is unnecessary to address Abrams' argument 
  that Sprott had an obligation to disclose to him the full information acquired 
  by it during its due diligence reviews of CCCC Inc. and Vanity.</p>
<p> VI. DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [64] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal. Abrams is entitled 
  to his costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount 
  of $9,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
