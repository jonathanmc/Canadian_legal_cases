<p>Application for judicial review under s. 57 of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, 
  c. 18 of the Order of Surrender of the Minister of Justice of Canada dated December 
  8, 2000.</p>    <p>GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The applicant, Richard Adam, is a Canadian citizen. The respondent, the 
  United States of America, seeks to extradite him to stand trial in Florida on 
  charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and 
  related offences.</p>    <P>
  [2] The first chapter in this extradition story began with the applicant's arrest 
  on August 22, 1997. The last chapter began on December 1, 2000 when the Minister 
  of Justice ordered the applicant's surrender to the United States. After failing 
  in his attempt to judicially review that order, Mr. Adam sought to have the 
  Minister of Justice amend it to make it conditional on receiving assurances 
  that Mr. Adam would be given enhanced credit in the United States for the five 
  years he has spent in pre-trial custody in Canada.</p>    <P>
  [3] Mr. Adam brings this application for judicial review of the Minister's refusal 
  to amend his order. The Minister moves to quash the application on the basis 
  that the court has no jurisdiction to hear it. </p>    <P>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this court has jurisdiction 
  to hear the application for judicial review, but that the application must be 
  dismissed.</p>    <P>
  THE BACKGROUND</p>    <P>
  [5] This matter has a tortuous history. In outline, it started on August 22, 
  1997 when the applicant was arrested pursuant to a warrant of apprehension. 
  He was taken first to the Windsor County Jail. Several months later, he was 
  transferred to the Toronto (Don) Jail. He made a number of unsuccessful bail 
  applications, and as a result, he has been held there ever since. Thus he has 
  been in custody for some five and one-half years, in the crowded and adverse 
  conditions all too typical of holding jails.</p>    <P>
  [6] In October 1997, the extradition judge ordered that the applicant be committed 
  for extradition, and in March of 1998 the Minister of Justice ordered his surrender 
  to the United States. In April of 1998, this court set aside the order of the 
  extradition judge and ordered a new hearing, which rendered moot any judicial 
  review of the Minister's surrender order. </p>    <P>
  [7] In July 2000, following the new hearing, the extradition judge ordered committal 
  and on December 1, 2000 the Minister ordered the applicant to be surrendered 
  to the United States.</p>    <P>
  [8] The applicant appealed the order of committal and sought judicial review 
  of the Minister's surrender order. On October 30, 2001 both were dismissed by 
  this court. On October 3, 2002 the Supreme Court of Canada refused leave to 
  appeal.</p>    <P>
  [9] While that application for leave was pending, Mr. Greenspan, who had been 
  newly retained by the applicant, wrote to the Minister on July 5, 2002 making 
  fresh submissions with respect to surrender. He submitted that the applicant's 
  surrender should take place only on condition that the Minister receive assurances 
  that the applicant would be given enhanced credit in the United States for his 
  five years spent in pre-trial custody in Canada, on at least a two-for-one basis 
  due to the extremely offensive conditions in which the applicant had been living 
  while in custody in the Toronto (Don) Jail.</p>    <P>
  [10] On August 16, 2002, having had no response from the Minister, counsel for 
  the applicant wrote again and brought to his attention the recent decision of 
  this court in Pacificador v. Canada (Minister of Justice) (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 
  685 (C.A.).</p>    <P>
  [11] On October 9, 2002, counsel for the applicant served and filed an application 
  for judicial review of the Minister's surrender decision of December 1, 2000 
  and of the Minister's refusal to consider the applicant's subsequent submissions.</p>    <P>
  [12] By letter dated October 30, 2002, the Minister replied to the applicant's 
  letters of July 5 and August 16, 2002. He did so in the following terms:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Mr. Adam made extensive submissions to my predecessor during 
  the year 2000. Over 22 months have elapsed since the warrant ordering your client's 
  surrender was signed on December 1, 2000. During this period, the Court of Appeal 
  for Ontario considered and dismissed your appeal on October 30, 2001. Your application 
  for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed on October 
  3, 2002. There would have to be a truly compelling reason for me to accept further 
  submissions at this late date.</p>
<P class="indent">There should be both finality to the ministerial phase of the 
  extradition process and respect for the decisions of the courts. Mr. Adam could 
  have raised the issue you now raise either with my predecessor or as a ground 
  of review before the Court of Appeal for Ontario at the time of the judicial 
  review application. I do not think it is appropriate for me to now consider 
  amending the order of my predecessor. In any event, I see no merit to your contention 
  that it would be contrary to the Charter to surrender Mr. Adam without the assurance 
  you seek.</p>
<P class="indent">Whether or how Mr. Adam will be credited for time spent in custody 
  in Canada is entirely a matter for the consideration of the American authorities 
  applying their own laws in the event of a conviction. Having considered all 
  of the relevant circumstances of this case and the applicable law, including 
  the Pacificador decision, I see no justification for me to dictate to the United 
  States of America and the relevant trial judge the manner in which they may 
  deal with this issue.</p>
<P>
  [13] The applicant then amended his application to add a request for judicial 
  review of this refusal by the Minister.</p>    <P>
  [14] Finally, on November 12, 2002 Laskin J.A. allowed the applicant's motion 
  for an order that he not be surrendered until the court's final decision on 
  the judicial review.</p>    <P>
  ANALYSIS</p>    <P>
  [15] I turn first to the issue of this court's jurisdiction to hear the applicant's 
  request for judicial review. In this context, several sections of the Extradition 
  Act, S.C. 1999, c.18 are relevant.</p>    <P>
  [16] Section 40(1) provides for the Minister to make a surrender order. It says:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 40. (1) The Minister may, within a period of 90 days after 
  the date of a person's committal to await surrender, personally order that the 
  person be surrendered to the extradition partner. </p>    
<P>
  [17] Section 42 permits the Minister to reconsider and amend his order prior 
  to it being carried out. It says:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 42. The Minister may amend a surrender order at any time before 
  its execution.</p>    
<P>
  [18] Section 57(1) gives this court original jurisdiction to hear an application 
  for judicial review of a surrender order. This section reads as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 57. (1) Despite the Federal Court Act, the court of appeal 
  of the province in which the committal of the person was ordered has exclusive 
  original jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for judicial review 
  under this Act, made in respect of the decision of the Minister under section 
  40.</p>    
<P>
  [19] Lastly, s. 62(1) provides for a stay in executing the surrender order. 
  It reads as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 62. (1) No person may be surrendered</p>
<P class="indent15">(a) until a period of 30 days has expired after the date of 
  the committal for surrender; or </p>
<P class="indent15">(b) if an appeal or a judicial review in respect of a matter 
  arising under this Act, or any appeal from an appeal or judicial review, is 
  pending, until after the date of the final decision of the court on the appeal 
  or judicial review.</p>
<P>
  [20] In moving to quash this application, counsel for the Minister argues that 
  this scheme gives this court jurisdiction to review only the Minister's initial 
  surrender order. He argues that this jurisdiction does not extend to a decision 
  made following a request for reconsideration. He says that if it were otherwise, 
  an applicant could engage in an endless series of requests for the Minister 
  to reconsider, each time seek judicial review of each and thereby frustrate 
  the principle that extradition proceedings are to be conducted expeditiously.</p>    <P>
  [21] In my view this argument fails for three reasons.</p>    <P>
  [22] The first is the clear wording of the Extradition Act. The Minister made 
  his original decision under s. 40 of the Extradition Act. Pursuant to s. 42, 
  the appellant seeks an amendment to the Minister's original decision. This court's 
  jurisdiction is to hear an application for judicial review in respect of the 
  Minister's decision under s. 40. That jurisdiction is not confined only to judicial 
  review of the Minister's s. 40 decision. This application is clearly in respect 
  of the Minister's s. 40 decision. It challenges the Minister's refusal to amend 
  that decision.</p>    <P>
  [23] Second, there is a sound policy reason behind this wording of the Extradition 
  Act. There may often be a time lag between the Minister making a surrender order 
  and its execution. If circumstances arise in that time frame which make a change 
  to that order essential, a refusal to do so by the Minister may appropriately 
  be the subject of judicial review. The same would be true if, after making a 
  surrender order, the Minister made a change to it that was not warranted, for 
  example, by removing a condition that the accused had insisted upon. The breadth 
  of the jurisdiction given by s. 57 simply recognizes that fundamental changes 
  can occur in the circumstances of an extradition prior to a surrender order 
  being executed.</p>    <P>
  [24] Third, this interpretation is consistent with the meaning given to the 
  parallel section, s. 62 by Laskin J.A. in his endorsement of November 12, 2002.</p>    <P>
  [25] I recognize the Minister's concern about an endless series of judicial 
  review applications frustrating the expeditious execution of a surrender order. 
  That, however, is primarily a consequence of the wording of s. 62(1) of the 
  Extradition Act which provides for a stay of execution of the surrender order 
  without the need to demonstrate an arguable case, irreparable harm and a favourable 
  balance of convenience as is required for most stay orders. As Laskin J.A. said, 
  the Minister can always seek to expedite the hearing of a judicial review application. 
  If that is not a sufficient answer to the Minister's concern, a change in the 
  wording of s. 62(1) may be required.</p>    <P>
  [26] This reading of the Extradition Act declines to treat the concern for finality 
  - that is, repeated requests made to the Minister to revisit his surrender decision, 
  followed by judicial review, thereby effectively frustrating expeditious extradition 
  - as a limit on this court's jurisdiction. However, that does not mean that 
  finality is not a relevant consideration for the Minister or subsequently for 
  the court in considering the merits of a judicial review application. Indeed, 
  in some cases, it may be a sufficient basis for the Minister to deny reconsideration 
  and for this court, in its discretion, to deny judicial review.</p>    <P>
  [27] However that issue need not be addressed in this case, because, as the 
  Minister's letter of October 30, 2002 makes clear, he considered the applicant's 
  submission and rejected it. The Minister found no merit to the applicant's contention 
  that it would violate his Charter rights if he were surrendered without assurances 
  that on conviction he would be credited on an enhanced basis for his time in 
  pre-trial custody in Canada. It simply cannot be said, as the applicant argues, 
  that the Minister failed to consider the applicant's submissions that the surrender 
  order must be amended.</p>    <P>
  [28] The applicant's fundamental argument on judicial review is that the Minister's 
  failure to amend the surrender order to assure that he receive enhanced credit 
  for his pre-trial custody constitutes a violation of his Charter rights.</p>    <P>
  [29] While the applicant also raises s. 6 and s. 12 of the Charter, it is s. 
  7 that must govern the outcome of this case, just as it did in United States 
  of America v. Burns, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283.</p>    <P>
  [30] Section 6 cannot be properly stretched to reach this case because there 
  is no showing that the applicant's right to remain in Canada is affected by 
  the presence or absence of the condition sought by the applicant.</p>    <P>
  [31] Section 12 is inappropriate because with or without the condition sought, 
  any punishment to be visited on the applicant is at this point a matter of speculation.</p>    <P>
  [32] As to s. 7, the question is whether the Minister's refusal to seek an assurance 
  of enhanced credit for pre-trial custody means that on surrender, the applicant 
  would face a penalty that is simply unacceptable or shocks the conscience. See 
  Pacificador, supra at para. 44. In this context all we know about American sentencing 
  practices is that the federal sentencing law, Title 18 U.S.C. s. 3585, requires 
  that a defendant shall be given credit for pre-sentencing custody. Hence it 
  appears that if convicted in the United States, the applicant would have a statutory 
  entitlement to some credit for his pre-trial custody, although with no guarantee 
  that the credit would be more than one-for-one. </p>    <P>
  [33] Can it be said to be &quot;simply unacceptable&quot; for the applicant 
  to be sentenced in the United States in the absence of a guarantee of enhanced 
  credit for pre-trial custody fixed at some level greater than one-for-one, for 
  example, at a minimum of two-for-one as Mr. Greenspan suggests?</p>    <P>
  [34] The simple answer must surely be no, where we have no such guarantee in 
  Canada for domestic sentencing. Given that we do not guarantee enhanced credit 
  ourselves, we can hardly say that a sentencing regime that does not do so either, 
  produces unacceptable results. The Supreme Court of Canada made clear in R. 
  v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455 that according credit for pre-trial custody is 
  to be done on a case by case basis, not on the basis of guarantees. At para. 
  45 the Court put it this way:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The credit cannot and need not be determined by a rigid formula 
  and is thus best left to the sentencing judge, who remains in the best position 
  to carefully weigh all the factors which go toward the determination of the 
  appropriate sentence, including the decision to credit the offender for any 
  time spent in pre-sentencing custody.</p>    
<P>
  [35] Thus I conclude that the Minister's refusal to amend the surrender order 
  to attach the condition sought does not violate the applicant's Charter rights.</p>    <P>
  [36] In summary, therefore, I would dismiss both the motion to quash and the 
  application for judicial review.</p>    <P>
