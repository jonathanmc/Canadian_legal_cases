<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] We have not been asked to reconsider our prior authorities on this question 
  of law. Counsel has attempted to distinguish those authorities from this case. 
  </p>    <P>
  [2] We agree with Durno J.'s analysis of those authorities. As we read those 
  authorities, it is not necessary for the officer making the &quot;alert&quot; 
  demand to know or believe the person to whom the demand is made was operating, 
  or was in care and control of the vehicle: see R. v. MacPherson, [2000] O.J. 
  4777, paras. 4-6.</p>    <P>
  [3] We would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.</p>
