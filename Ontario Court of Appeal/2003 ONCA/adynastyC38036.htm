<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are satisfied that the trial judge's reasons do not reflect any palpable 
  or overriding error in his conclusion that the bidding process resulted in a 
  contract which obliged the defendant to award the roofing subcontract to the 
  plaintiff, the lowest bidder. In particular, we refer to the evidence that the 
  defendant considered the plaintiff to be bound to it by its bid to perform the 
  subcontract at the price set forth in it.</p>
<p>[2] Mr. Gignac, for the defendant, testified that in the industry the lowest 
  bidder would normally be awarded the contract. In general, only pre-qualified 
  bidders could participate in the bidding process and there was a closing date 
  and time.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to damages, while the amount appears to be high, there was 
  evidence to support the trial judge's award. The plaintiff has not persuaded 
  us that the trial judge made any error in law in his consideration of this evidence.</p>
<p>[4] On the facts of this case there was no failure on the part of the plaintiff 
  to mitigate its loss. The defendant was not in breach of contract until it had 
  awarded the subcontract to Smith Peat.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
<p>[6] [Costs submissions] The costs are fixed in the amount of $6,900.<br>
