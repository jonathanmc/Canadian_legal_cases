<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Dennis Lane of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 28, 2003.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondents, AEGON Canada Inc. and Transamerica Life Canada, allege 
  that the vendor and appellant, ING, breached warranties arising from a share 
  purchase agreement for the shares of NN Life Insurance Company of Canada (&quot;NN 
  Life&quot;) that all required contributions had been made to the NN Life Pension 
  Plan (&quot;the Plan&quot;), and that the Plan was fully funded on an ongoing 
  and solvency basis. All of the claimed breaches of warranty relate to ING's 
  practice of taking into account an actuarial surplus in assets of a 1969 Trust 
  (&quot;Halifax Trust&quot;) that funded the Halifax Life Pension Plan (&quot;the 
  Halifax Plan&quot;) when determining the assets required to fund the Plan. Lane 
  J. gave detailed reasons for judgment holding that the appellants had breached 
  the warranty. As I agree with the application judge's careful analysis, I shall 
  state my reasons for dismissing the appeal briefly.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Plan is the product of the 1989 amalgamation between the NN Life and 
  the Halifax Life Insurance Company of Canada. At that time, the assets and liabilities 
  of the Halifax Plan were transferred to the NN Life Plan. When the transfer 
  occurred, the assets in the Halifax Plan were subject to the Halifax Trust. 
  The terms of the Halifax Trust provide that: (i) upon termination, the Halifax 
  employees are entitled to any surplus (s.6.02), and (ii) no amendment to the 
  trust &quot;shall authorize or permit any part of the capital or income of the 
  Fund to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit 
  of the Members&#133;except as may be approved by the Minister or otherwise authorized 
  or permitted by law&quot; (s. 6.01(b)).</p>
<p>
  [3] In view of these provisions in the Halifax Trust, and pursuant to undertakings 
  given by NN Life to the Pension Commission of Ontario (P.C.O.) as a condition 
  of approval for the transfer of assets from the Halifax Plan to the NN Life 
  Plan, NN Life maintained and administered the assets of the Halifax Trust separate 
  from the other assets and liabilities of the Plan after the amalgamation. At 
  times relevant to this action, the part of the Plan funded by the Halifax Trust 
  has had assets in surplus to liabilities, while the non-Halifax part of the 
  Plan has had liabilities in excess of assets.</p>
<p>
  [4] Despite maintaining the assets and liabilities relating to the former Halifax 
  employees separate and apart from the rest of the Plan, NN Life decided to treat 
  the Plan as a single entity for purposes of calculating its funding obligations. 
  When the two funds are combined, the Plan is in surplus, and consequently NN 
  Life took contribution holidays from the Plan. As a result, by the time of the 
  share purchase agreement, there was a substantial deficit with respect to the 
  non-Halifax part of the Plan that NN Life accounted for by reference to the 
  substantial surplus in the Halifax Trust. Indeed, it was projected that if the 
  contribution holidays continued, at some point NN Life would actually have to 
  draw upon the Halifax Trust assets to pay the pension benefits of non-Halifax 
  Life employees. In connection with the share purchase agreement, NN Life represented 
  to the respondents that the NN Life Plan was in a surplus position and did not 
  disclose any deficit in relation to the non-Halifax part of the Plan.</p>
<p>
  [5] There was conflicting actuarial evidence as to the propriety in terms of 
  accepted actuarial and accounting practice of the contribution holidays and 
  the representations made in relation to the share purchase agreement. The application 
  judge found that taking into account the Halifax Trust's assets, when calculating 
  obligations owed to non-Halifax employees, did not accord with accepted actuarial 
  practice. I see no reason to interfere with that finding. </p>
<p>
  [6] In the end, any conflict in the evidence falls to be resolved on the basis 
  of the correctness of the legal assumptions made by the experts. If NN Life 
  could never call upon the assets of the Halifax Trust to satisfy the liabilities 
  owed in the non-Halifax portion of the Plan, I agree with the application judge 
  that NN Life was not entitled to take contribution holidays and was not entitled 
  to have reference to the assets of the Halifax Trust when calculating its obligations 
  towards those who are not the beneficiaries of that Trust.</p>
<p>
  [7] In my view, the clear terms of the Halifax Trust precluded any part of the 
  capital or income of the fund from being diverted to any purpose other than 
  the exclusive benefit of the beneficiaries of the Halifax Trust, namely the 
  former Halifax employees. The terms of Halifax Trust were not altered by the 
  transfer of assets to the NN Life Plan in 1989. I do not accept the submission 
  that NN Life's rights and obligations in relation to Halifax Trust assets were 
  somehow affected by what counsel referred to as the &quot;merger&quot; of the 
  two pension plans. NN Life was obliged by the terms of the Halifax Trust and 
  by the terms of the undertakings it gave to the P.C.O. to maintain the assets 
  of the Halifax Trust separate and apart from the other assets and liabilities 
  of the NN Life Plan. There was no amendment to the Halifax Trust. Nor is there 
  anything &quot;authorized or permitted by law&quot; to allow NN Life to use 
  the assets of the Halifax Trust for any purpose other than the benefit of its 
  beneficiaries. As it was put by Newbury J.A. in Bushau v. Rogers Cable Systems 
  (2000), 83 B.C.L.R. (3d) 261 (B.C.C.A.) at para. 66: &quot;These rights cannot 
  be done away with by unilateral action of the employer without crystal-clear 
  authority in the trust terms.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [8] Simply put, as NN Life cannot call upon the assets of the Halifax Trust 
  to satisfy liabilities owed to the non-Halifax employees, it follows that there 
  was no basis for NN Life to refer to the Halifax Trust's surplus in determining 
  its service costs to account for actuarial liabilities in relation to the non-Halifax 
  employees. The Halifax Trust obligation prevents the assets of that trust from 
  ever being used to pay the benefits of non-Halifax employees. There is therefore 
  no actuarial or legal basis for NN Life to have regard to the Halifax surplus 
  in determining its funding obligation for the non-Halifax employees.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant submits that since the former Halifax employees have no present 
  entitlement to any surplus in the Halifax Trust, and as any entitlement to that 
  surplus would arise only upon termination, it was open to NN Life to refer to 
  the surplus in calculating its overall funding obligations. The appellant relies 
  on the following passage from the reasons of Cory J. in Schmidt v. Air Products 
  of Canada Ltd., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611 at para. 86: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The former Catalytic employees successfully argued before the chambers judge 
  that to permit a contribution holiday is to permit an encroachment upon the 
  trust fund of which they are the beneficiaries. I do not agree. As noted earlier, 
  the trust property usually consists of all the monies contributed to the pension 
  fund. To permit a contribution holiday does not reduce the corpus of the fund 
  nor does it amount to applying the monies contained in it to something other 
  than the exclusive benefit of the employees. The entitlement of the trust beneficiaries 
  is not affected by a contribution holiday. That entitlement is to receive the 
  defined benefits provided in the pension plan from the trust and, depending 
  upon the terms of the trust to receive a share of any surplus remaining upon 
  termination of the plan. </p>
<p>
  [10] I do not accept the submission that Schmidt supports the appellant's position. 
  At issue in Schmidt was whether a contribution holiday per se reduced the corpus 
  of the trust. The issue here is whether NN Life is entitled to cross-subsidize 
  its obligations towards the non-Halifax employees by using the assets of the 
  Halifax Trust. I see nothing in Schmidt or in any of the other authorities cited 
  to us that would support the argument that NN Life is entitled to use the assets 
  of the Halifax Trust for any purpose other than those specified in the Halifax 
  Trust. The fact that the former Halifax employees have no present entitlement 
  to the surplus provides no justification for the use of that surplus for a purpose 
  contrary to the terms of the Trust. </p>
<p>
  [11] In addition, Schmidt is distinguishable from the case at bar because both 
  plans in Schmidt were in surplus. The application judge properly distinguished 
  Schmidt in at paragraph 46 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;Cory J. was not dealing with facts such as are before me. In Schmidt, 
  both plans were in actuarial surplus at the time of their merger and at the 
  time of wind-up. Further, he made it clear, at p. 664, that the employer's obligation 
  to fund the plan is to be determined upon accepted actuarial principles. As 
  will appear later, such principles do not permit the inclusion as relevant assets, 
  of assets which are not in fact available to meet the relevant liabilities.</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant also relies on the decision of the Financial Services Tribunal 
  in Baxter v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services), (2003) 33 C.C.P.B. 
  43. Baxter involved an appeal from a decision of the Superintendent made pursuant 
  to the Pensions Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8, s. 81, to consent to the 
  transfer assets from a plan in surplus to a plan in liability. The applicants, 
  members of the plan in surplus, argued that the decision approving the transfer 
  was contrary to s. 81(5) requiring the Superintendent to refuse consent &quot;to 
  a transfer that does not protect the pension benefits and any other benefits 
  of the members&quot;. The appeal was dismissed. There is certainly language 
  in the majority decision that could be taken to support the position taken by 
  the appellants in the case at bar. However, it is not binding here and there 
  are several significant distinguishing features. First, the main ground for 
  dismissing the appeal was that the Financial Services Tribunal had no jurisdiction 
  to entertain it. Second, as it exercises purely statutory jurisdiction, to the 
  extent that it did deal with the merits, the Tribunal's decision turned entirely 
  on the language of s. 81(5) rather than upon general principles of trust law. 
  Third, there was no explicit finding of a trust and the Tribunal proceeded on 
  the assumption that the assets of the surplus plan were impressed with a trust. 
  Fourth, the provisions of the surplus plan at issue were significantly different 
  from the case at bar as they allowed the employer to use divert funds amassed 
  prior to a merger if &quot;all liabilities have been fully met&quot;. In any 
  event, to the extent that the reasoning in Baxter is inconsistent with that 
  of the application judge in the case at bar, I have no hesitation in saying 
  that I prefer that of the application judge.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant also relies on the obiter comments of Grange J.A. in Heilig 
  v. Dominion Securities Ptifield Ltd. (1989), 67 O.R. (2d) 577 at 582 regarding 
  the effect of the merger of two pension plans. That case posed a very different 
  issue and Grange J.A. was not addressing the question we have to answer in the 
  case at bar. His comments are of no assistance here.</p>
<p>
  [14] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. The appellant concedes in its 
  written costs submissions that if the respondent is successful, it is entitled 
  to costs, on a substantial indemnity scale, in the amount claimed of $45,792.25 
  and I would fix the costs in that amount.</p>
