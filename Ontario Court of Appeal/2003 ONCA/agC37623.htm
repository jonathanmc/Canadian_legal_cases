<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Sidney N. Lederman of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 29, 2001.</p>

<p>WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] Gaming Lottery Corporation (&#147;GLC&#148;), appeals from the judgment 
  of Lederman J. in favour of Bank Leu (the &#147;Bank&#148;) in the amount of 
  4.5 million dollars U.S. plus prejudgment interest. The appeal raises issues 
  in company law, and concerns more specifically 1) whether the trial judge erred 
  in finding that Bank Leu was a good faith purchaser of the shares represented 
  by Share Certificate 12093 and in his appreciation of the restriction on their 
  transferability noted on the share certificate 2) whether Bank Leu acquired 
  beneficial title to the shares by common law estoppel 3) whether Share Certificate 
  12093 was a negotiable instrument and 4) whether the oppression remedy under 
  the Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. B.16, (&#147;OBCA&#148;) 
  was available to Bank Leu. In the event the appeal by GLC from the decision 
  of Lederman J. in favour of Bank Leu is unsuccessful, GLC seeks contribution 
  and indemnity from North Shore Credit Union. The detailed reasons of the trial 
  judge are reported at (2001), B.L.R. (3d) 68 (Sup. Ct.). </p>
<p>[2] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal substantially for 
  the reasons given by the trial judge, namely that Bank Leu was a good faith 
  purchaser of the shares represented by Share Certificate 12093 and that GLC 
  was estopped from denying the validity of the share certificate. I would further 
  hold that the restriction on transfer noted on the share certificate in question 
  did not prevent the shares represented by the certificate from being transferred 
  to Bank Leu. With respect to the oppression remedy, I would hold that the trial 
  judge did not err in granting this relief. I would also dismiss the appeal respecting 
  the third party, North Shore Credit Union. </p>
<p>I. Facts</p>
<p>[3] Bank Leu is a Swiss private bank, based in Zurich, and a member of the 
  Credit Suisse group. It is the oldest bank in Switzerland. It has been conducting 
  business in Switzerland and internationally for over 250 years. Bank Leu loaned 
  $5 million to one Guido Bensberg who transferred Share Certificate No.12093 
  (&#147;Share Certificate 12093&#148;), issued by Laser Friendly Inc., to the 
  Bank as security for the loans. Laser Friendly Inc. later changed its name to 
  GLC and for ease of reference will be referred to throughout as GLC. When the 
  loans were not repaid, Bank Leu sought to realize on the shares. GLC refused 
  to acknowledge Bank Leu as the valid owner of the shares because the shares 
  were not fully paid for or validly issued. GLC stated that the certificate was 
  part of a &#147;stock roll program&#148; (described below) and should not have 
  been released from safekeeping. The Bank sued GLC on the basis this was oppressive 
  conduct. There is money in court with respect to part of the amount in issue.</p>
<p>A. The Stock Roll Program</p>
<p>[4] Jack Banks (&#147;Banks&#148;) was the President, Chief Executive Officer 
  and Chairman of the Board of Directors of GLC. Larry Weltman, a chartered accountant, 
  was Executive Vice-President and a Director of the company. Weltman&#146;s primary 
  responsibility at GLC was to develop and implement corporate strategy and oversee 
  and manage the financial affairs of the company. </p>
<p>[5] In or about October 1994, GLC became interested in implementing a &#147;stock 
  roll program&#148;. GLC had heard that such programs allowed major foreign banks 
  to subscribe for blocks of shares at a discount to the market price and to pay 
  for such shares by way of a debenture to enhance their balance sheets with the 
  company holding the debenture earning interest on it. GLC was told that if it 
  chose to participate in the program no shares needed to be issued by it until 
  fully paid for and that if it wished to do so it could refuse to issue the shares. 
  In addition, GLC would have the right to reject payment for the shares preventing 
  any dilution of GLC&#146;s existing shares. </p>
<p>[6] With this background information, GLC entered into a stock roll program 
  with Helix Capital Corporation (&#147;Helix&#148;). Weltman discussed the stock 
  roll program with Banks who gave him the authority to proceed with the transaction.</p>
<p>[7] As described by the trial judge, the stock roll program between GLC and 
  Helix had the following characteristics: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Helix entered into a Subscription Agreement for 15 million common shares 
    of GLC at U.S. $4.00 per share;</li>
  <li>the Subscription Agreement provided for a closing in one-year&#146;s time;</li>
  <li>pending the closing, as of the execution of the Subscription Agreement, 
    share certificates were issued by GLC under the Subscription Agreement;</li>
  <li>pending the closing, the share certificates were to be delivered to Helix 
    or its agent;</li>
  <li>Helix, under the Subscription Agreement, was required to pay GLC interest 
    on the purchase price, based upon a percentage of the market value of the 
    shares subscribed for. In this case $1.8 million USD;</li>
  <li>the purchase price and interest payable under the Subscription Agreement 
    were secured by a debenture;</li>
  <li>at the end of one year, the subscriber under the Subscription Agreement 
    was entitled to tender for the shares at the base value of the subscription 
    price;</li>
  <li>GLC was not required under the Subscription Agreement or Debenture to accept 
    the tender of the subscriber; and</li>
  <li>GLC could, in effect, cancel the transaction, never accept the full payment 
    for the shares, and retain the $1.8 million paid under the Subscription Agreement 
    and Debenture.</li>
</ul>
<p>[8] The share certificates for the stock roll program with Helix were prepared 
  by Equity Transfer Services Inc., (Equity Transfer&#148;) on instructions from 
  GLC. In total, eight GLC certificates (three certificates of 2.5 million shares 
  each and five certificates of 1.5 million shares each) were created. Share Certificate 
  12093 came into existence as part of the Subscription Agreement between Helix 
  and GLC. The share certificates, including Share Certificate 12093, show the 
  registered holder as Helix and state very clearly on their face that they are: </p>
<p class="indent">FULLY PAID AND NON-ASSESSABLE COMMON SHARES WITHOUT PAR VALUE IN THE CAPITAL 
  OF LASER FRIENDLY INC. </p>
<p>They also state that the shares represented by the certificates are transferable 
  at Equity Transfer in Toronto. Despite this statement and despite the fact that 
  GLC executed a form of stock proxy for voting the shares represented by, inter 
  alia, Share Certificate 12093, it provided instructions to Equity Transfer to 
  confiscate any certificates, including Share Certificate 12093, if submitted 
  for transfer.</p>
<p>[9] Paul Stein, a lawyer acting for GLC, recommended against the representation 
  on the face of the certificates that they were &#147;fully paid&#148;. He suggested 
  a legend indicating that they were not paid for and were subject to another 
  agreement or otherwise not be freely traded. This advice was rejected by Weltman. 
</p>
<p>[10] Laser Friendly&#146;s (GLC&#146;s) shares were publicly traded on the 
  Toronto Stock Exchange (&#147;TSE&#148;) as well as on NASDAQ, a stock exchange 
  in the United States. Printed on the back of the share certificates was a so-called 
  &#147;Regulation S&#148; legend. Regulation S under the United States Securities 
  Act of 1933 was an exemption, which allowed a company to issues shares without 
  registration in the United States with respect to transactions outside of the 
  United States that did not involve &#147;United States persons&#148;. The legend 
  provided for a time limit before the shares could be transferred (in the case 
  of Share Certificate 12093, that time limit was November 15, 1995). Weltman 
  testified that he was aware that the purpose of such a legend under Regulation 
  s (and Rule 144) was to restrict transfers involving &#147;United States persons&#148; 
  or within the United States.</p>
<p>[11] GLC understood at all times that the shares would be provided by Helix 
  to a third party to be placed in a &#147;program&#148; that would generate the 
  income to pay the &#147;interest&#148;. </p>
<p>B. The Securities Lease Agreement</p>
<p>[12] The GLC share certificates issued in connection with the stock roll program 
  were utilized by Helix in connection with a &#147;securities lease&#148; arrangement 
  with Red Oak Ltd. (&#147;Red Oak&#148;), the principal of which was Bensberg. 
</p>
<p>[13] Under the securities lease, the shares of several public companies, including 
  shares of GLC were &#147;leased&#148; to Red Oak. Among other things, Helix 
  represented in the agreement that it was the owner of the leased shares. The 
  agreement also indicated that Red Oak wished to lease the shares for the purposes 
  of enabling it to enhance its bank credit lines for its business needs. </p>
<p>[14] By virtue of the securities lease, Bensberg was able to gain control over 
  the share certificates. The securities lease called for the delivery of the 
  share certificates representing the leased assets, including Share Certificate 
  12093, to an escrow agent, in this case, Sandy Anderson (&#147;Anderson&#148;), 
  manager of the North Shore Credit Union, Bensberg&#146;s Bank in Vancouver. 
</p>
<p>C. The Loan by Bank Leu to Bensberg</p>
<p>[15] In early November 1994, Bensberg was introduced to Claus Koerner (&#147;Koerner&#148;), 
  an employee in the private banking department of Bank Leu. He was introduced 
  by Max Josef Strauss, a lawyer and the son of a well-known former foreign minister 
  of West Germany, Franz Joseph Strauss. Bensberg was introduced as a substantial 
  businessman looking for a bank to do business with and to manage his portfolio. 
  Bensberg indicated that he required a line of credit and that he would be able 
  to provide stock certificates as collateral.</p>
<p>[16] At a meeting on November 11, 1994, Bensberg physically delivered to Koerner 
  share certificates for five over the counter (OTC) issuers. Koerner had the 
  certificates delivered to his office in Zurich by mail, after which he had them 
  delivered within Bank Leu to the securities administration Department to be 
  deposited into Bensberg&#146;s account. At the same time, Koerner was advised 
  by Bensberg that he would be delivering a number of additional shares through 
  his bank in Vancouver (&#147;North Shore&#148;) to Bank Leu in care of its depository, 
  the Bank of Montreal (&#147;BMO&#148;). Included in the shares, which Bensberg 
  promised to deliver were shares of GLC, evidenced by Share Certificate 12093. 
</p>
<p>[17] Anderson wrote to Bank Leu by letter dated November 17, 1994 and confirmed 
  that the GLC shares had been forwarded to BMO. </p>
<p>[18] On November 23, 1994, the share certificates for the outstanding securities, 
  including Share Certificate 12093, were received by BMO. At the request of Anderson, 
  a copy of his covering letter to BMO, dated November 17, enclosed with the share 
  certificates, was forwarded to Bank Leu. There is no mention of any loan transaction 
  with Bensberg in the covering letter. Nor is there any mention of any restriction 
  on the shares. </p>
<p>[19] Enclosed with Share Certificate 12093 was an executed irrevocable stock 
  power, endorsed in blank for a transfer. The stock power was properly executed 
  on behalf of Helix by James Ericksteen, its principal, and his signature was 
  guaranteed by the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>D. Execution of the Pledge and Other Documents - November 15, 1994</p>
<p>[20] On November 15, 1994, Bensberg executed a pledge agreement with Bank Leu 
  in which he pledged all of the assets at any time deposited at Bank Leu as security 
  for any indebtedness to the bank. He also signed a signature card, incorporating 
  Bank Leu&#146;s general conditions, and a declaration in which he declared that 
  he was the beneficial owner of the shares he was depositing. He also signed 
  a more comprehensive credit agreement on December 7, 1994.</p>
<p>[21] After North Shore indicated that it was forwarding to Bank Leu (through 
  BMO) certain shares, including the GLC shares, and after Bensberg signed the 
  pledge, signature card and declaration that he was the beneficial owner of the 
  shares, he was approved for a limited overdraft and funds were initially released 
  to him on November 15, 1994. The amount released as of November 23,1994 was 
  $860,000 USD. </p>
<p>E. Calling the Loan</p>
<p>[22] When the BMO accepted the securities on behalf of Bank Leu on November 
  23, 1994 the Legend S restriction on transfer was noticed and duly noted by 
  BMO&#146;s employees. On November 30, 1994, Bank Leu advanced Bensberg a further 
  $1.8 million USD by way of overdraft which Keller, a senior credit officer with 
  Bank Leu, approved. </p>
<p>[23] By memo dated December 1, 1994 Keller recommended that Bensberg&#146;s 
  application for credit in the amount of $5 million US be approved by way of 
  a loan against &#147;Marketable Cover&#148;. Keller testified that he felt the 
  risk was acceptable, so long as the Bank closely monitored the loan and kept 
  the amount loaned at 10% of the value of the portfolio. He relied primarily 
  on the value of the GLC shares represented by Share Certificate 12093. The trial 
  judge found at paragraph 31 of his reasons that, &#147;[w]hen the certificates 
  were received, Bank Leu satisfied itself that all the share certificates were 
  genuine (not forged) and none was on a list of stolen or lost securities. The 
  total market value of securities held by Bank Leu was thought to be in excess 
  of U.S. $45 million&#148;. Subsequently the Bank concluded that the only shares 
  that had any value were the Laser Friendly shares. That being so, the trial 
  judge concluded at paragraph 84 of his reasons that Keller did not adhere to 
  his 10% rule.</p>
<p>[24] The loan application for 5 million U.S. was approved sometime between 
  December 1 and December 7, 1994. The Legend S restriction was mentioned in a 
  report on December 7, 1994 by BMO to Bank Leu. In about mid-December, 1994, 
  after substantial funds had been loaned to Bensberg, Keller learned of the restriction 
  on the shares that were being held as collateral and took steps to inquire as 
  to their nature. Bank Leu also sought further information about Bensberg and 
  his businesses. Nevertheless, Bank Leu advanced Bensberg a further $495,000 
  US after December 15, 1994. Bank Leu advanced approximately U.S. 4.3 million 
  to Bensberg from the beginning of November 1994 to early January 1995.</p>
<p>[25] In or about January 20, 1995, because no concrete positive information 
  on Bensberg was forthcoming, and because of increasing concern that there was 
  a significant problem with the collateral, Bank Leu decided to call the loan. 
  This caused Bensberg&#146;s solicitor, Mr. Hladun Q.C., to write a letter dated 
  January 20, 1995, in which he expressed serious concern and threatened Bank 
  Leu with legal action. On January 23, 1995, Bank Leu sent Bensberg a letter 
  calling the loan and requiring repayment by February 6, 1995. The letter was 
  signed by both Koerner and Keller.</p>
<p>[26] When satisfactory arrangements for repayment had not been made by Bensberg, 
  Bank Leu contacted GLC with respect to Share Certificate 12093 that it held 
  as collateral. Bank Leu was told at that time that the shares had not been paid 
  for and GLC asked Bank Leu to acknowledge that it held the shares only as a 
  depository. Until being so notified by GLC on March 27, 1995, Bank Leu was not 
  aware that the shares had not been paid for. Indeed, Bank Leu was always under 
  the impression that the shares had been validly issued and had been paid for, 
  as appeared on the face of Share Certificate 12093. </p>
<p>[27] Bank Leu obtained default judgment against Bensberg in Switzerland on 
  January 31, 1996 for the full amount of the loan. That judgment remains outstanding. 
</p>
<p>[28] In the result, the trial judge granted judgment in favour of Bank Leu. 
  His Honour concluded, at para. 114, that: </p>
<p class="indent">GLC is estopped by its conduct from asserting a defence against Bank Leu as 
  a good faith purchaser. The risk that the share certificates could be misused 
  should be borne entirely by GLC and not by the good faith holder of the share 
  certificate. The risk should not be with the unsuspecting holder of the certificates, 
  but on those who entered into the transaction for the issuance of the certificates 
  in the first place. GLC was motivated to create the certificates in order to 
  make millions of dollars for which it thought there would be no consequences, 
  and had little or no regard that the certificates could be used as instruments 
  of fraud. </p>
<p>[29] In reaching his decision, the trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence 
  at trial, including the evidence surrounding the circumstances of the loan to 
  Bensberg and receipt of Share Certificate 12093. He also specifically found 
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>GLC was aware of the relevant risks and concerns arising out of the Stock 
    Roll Transactions and knew of the potential for the certificates to be misused 
    and indeed knew that they could be used in some fashion as &#147;collateral&#148;;</li>
  <li>Weltman knew that there was no legitimate use for the share certificates;</li>
  <li>Stein expressed to GLC a concern that the shares could be used for an improper 
    purpose and attempted to maintain control over the GLC Shares. His advice 
    was ignored;</li>
  <li>GLC was aware almost immediately that the sole practitioners it had sent 
    millions of shares to were not complying with their obligations regarding 
    holding the shares;</li>
  <li>GLC was aware as early as November 18, 1994 that shares from the Helix transaction 
    were to be sent to the BMO. GLC took no steps whatsoever, at anytime, to contact 
    the BMO;</li>
  <li>In early December 1994, the stock roll programs that GLC was involved in 
    came to the attention of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission 
    (SEC). An SEC enforcement inquiry was instituted and came to the attention 
    of GLC early in December 1994;<a href="#1">[1] </a><a name="r1"></a></li>
  <li>In connection with the SEC inquiry, GLC retained the firm of Jones &amp; 
    Day in Cleveland. That firm advised GLC to withdraw from the programs and 
    to get its certificates. Jones &amp; Day specifically alluded to &#147;badges 
    of fraud&#148; in its communications. Within approximately two weeks of its 
    retainer, the firm resigned because GLC refused to follow its advice; </li>
  <li>Stein then arranged for the Washington and New York-based law firm of White 
    &amp; Case to assist GLC. White &amp; Case repeated the advice that Stein 
    and Jones &amp; Day had given, and told GLC that they were aiding and abetting 
    in the perpetration of a fraud.</li>
  <li>On December 14, 1994, GLC learned that certificates in a second stock roll 
    program with Delta West had been endorsed and someone had attempted to use 
    them as collateral with Merrill Lynch;</li>
  <li>Notwithstanding this knowledge, GLC continued to participate in the stock 
    roll programs. It took no steps to alert Merrill Lynch or to prevent the misuse 
    of its other certificates, including Share Certificate 12093. It also continued 
    to receive payments from Helix in respect of that certificate; </li>
  <li>By letter dated February 1, 1995, White &amp; Case outlined in the most 
    explicit terms many of the concerns that had been repeatedly expressed since 
    early November to GLC in connection with the stock roll programs. White &amp; 
    Case advised GLC that as a matter of urgency it should terminate the agreements 
    with Helix and Delta West and seek the return of its share certificates. White 
    &amp; Case wrote: </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Given the foregoing, we believe that there is a substantial 
  risk that if Helix&#146;s customer were to be unable to repay the loan from 
  its lending bank, the bank could assert a claim against Laser Friendly for any 
  resulting loss, and probably would be able to raise serious questions as to 
  whether it was aware of the fact that the Laser Friendly certificates did not 
  represent fully paid and issued shares, and whether Laser Friendly was not knowingly 
  participating in fraudulent misrepresentations by the borrower as to the value 
  of the security the borrower had provided.</p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">On the basis of the foregoing, we believe that you should, as 
  a matter of urgency, (a) terminate the agreements with Helix (and Delta West 
  if the two certificates issued it have not been returned to you) on the ground 
  that they did not fully disclose to you to the uses to which the certificates 
  would be put and inducing you to enter into those agreements, and (b) take all 
  available actions to recover the certificates you have delivered.</p>
<ul>
  <li>As before, GLC did not follow the advice. In fact, it not only continued, 
    but expanded, its participation in the Helix Stock Roll Program by trying 
    to place through the use of another certificate, No. 12095, in a &#147;program&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to GLC, the trial judge then concluded at paras. 111-112, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">Given his [Weltman&#146;s] education and experience, he must have known that 
  the use of the certificates to enhance balance sheets made no commercial sense 
  and could only be used in some improper nefarious scheme. By allowing GLC certificates 
  into the stream of international commerce he must have known that they were 
  likely to be misused, including being used as collateral, as in this case. Even 
  in the face of warnings throughout the relevant period that there was a substantial 
  risk of liability if the shares were so misused, Weltman persisted in the program.</p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">Weltman and Banks were the decision makers in respect of the 
  stock roll program on behalf of GLC. Banks attended the trial from time to time, 
  but was not called as a witness. In the circumstances it is appropriate to infer 
  that both he and Weltman knew full well of the possibility of GLC stock certificates 
  being used in the perpetration of a fraud or at the least, they did not care 
  what use was made of them so long as GLC received its &#147;interest payments&#148; 
  and there was no possibility of the transfer of shares being registered. </p>
<p>[30] Conversely, in relation to Bank Leu&#146;s knowledge, the trial judge 
  concluded at para. 86: </p>
<p class="indent">&#147;[T]here is no evidence that there was any obvious indication or suspicion 
  that the shares were invalid or that Bensberg was a dishonest man. The evidence 
  demonstrates that Fischer [Keller&#146;s subordinate] was concerned, but his 
  concerns did not relate to the validity of the shares. Even Fischer&#146;s comment 
  about Bensberg&#146;s motives being unclear is more consistent with his concern 
  that Bensberg was a credit risk rather than any concern about possible fraud...</p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">It makes no sense whatsoever that Keller ... deliberately shut 
  his eyes to a fact that was obvious to him but he was afraid to inquire into, 
  namely, that Bensberg was perpetrating fraud on Bank Leu by using share certificates 
  of no value that he had obtained in various stock programs.</p>
<p>[31] GLC brought a third party claim against Koerner alleging that he conspired 
  with Bensberg to defraud Bank Leu. Koerner did not defend this claim and by 
  virtue of rule 19.02(1)(a) he was deemed to admit the allegations against him. 
  Counsel for GLC argued that Keller&#146;s deemed admission of his guilt on the 
  third party claim by virtue of a legal fiction was a legal fact in Bank Leu&#146;s 
  action against GLC with the result that Bank Leu could not be considered a good 
  faith purchaser. The trial judge held at paras. 89-90: </p>
<p class="indent">Koerner was noted in default approximately 6 years after he 
  ceased to be employed at Bank Leu. At the time he was noted in default, he had 
  no authority to bind the bank with either express admissions or deemed admissions. 
  Apart from the &#147;deemed admissions&#148; argument, there is no evidence 
  on which to found any of GLC&#146;s allegations that Koerner had any knowledge 
  that the shares had not been paid for or was otherwise engaged in any conspiracy 
  to defraud. </p>
<p class="indent">Even if it had been established that Koerner was engaged in 
  perpetrating a fraud on Bank Leu, that knowledge cannot be imputed to the bank. 
  As stated in Crawford &amp; Falconbridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange (8th 
  Edition 1986) at page 1465, &#147;There is no reason to suppose that an agent 
  acting in excess of his authority would inform his principal of the details 
  of his activities&#148; so as to affect its status as a good faith purchaser. 
  (Also see Richards v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1896), 26 SCR 381 at 387; The Commercial 
  Bank of Windsor v. Morrison (1902), 32 SCR 98 at 105.)</p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">In ignoring the warnings from Fischer and Jhaveri, in particular, 
  Keller may have been negligent or, indeed, foolish. These individuals, if they 
  were called as witnesses might have provided further evidence of this, but I 
  am not satisfied that their testimony would have added anything to GLC&#146;s 
  position that Bank Leu knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that Bensberg 
  was a fraudster and that the share certificates were invalid. Therefore, I am 
  unable to draw any adverse inference from the failure of Bank Leu to call these 
  individuals as witnesses. </p>
<p>[32] The trial judge&#146;s findings were based not only on the documentary 
  record but on his assessment of the credibility of the various witnesses. He 
  did not find Weltman to be credible. He noted that Weltman had plead guilty 
  to securities fraud in the United States, had lied on his discovery (at a time 
  when he thought the documents necessary to impeach him would not be produced) 
  and had actively deceived GLC&#146;s auditors. (Banks, although present at the 
  trial, did not testify.) </p>
<p>[33] The thrust of the trial judge&#146;s findings in relation to GLC&#146;s 
  participation in the stock roll program was that GLC was a willing participant 
  in what it knew was a fraudulent scheme by which share certificates, including 
  Share Certificate 12093, were physically pledged as collateral for loans. </p>
<p>II. Issues and Analysis</p>
<p>A. The Main Action</p>
<p>1. Whether the trial judge erred in finding that Bank Leu was a good faith 
  purchaser of the shares represented by Share Certificate 12093 and in his appreciation 
  of the restriction on their transferability noted on the share certificate?</p>
<p>[34] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that Bank 
  Leu was a good faith purchaser and further erred in his appreciation of the 
  evidence relating to the restriction on the transferability of the share certificate. 
  The trial judge&#146;s finding that Bank Leu was a good faith purchaser is central 
  to his analysis that GLC is estopped from asserting the defence that its shares 
  have not been paid for. The trial judge&#146;s finding that Bank Leu was a good 
  faith purchaser is also important when considering the issue of whether Share 
  Certificate 12093 was a negotiable instrument. Provided that the security is 
  a negotiable instrument, a good faith purchaser can acquire higher rights than 
  the transferor.</p>
<p>[35] Section 53(1) of the OBCA defines a good faith purchaser as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">&#147;good faith&#148; means honesty in fact in the conduct 
  of the transaction concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;good faith purchaser&#148; means a purchaser for value, 
  in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) who takes delivery of a security certificate in bearer form 
  or order form or of a security certificate in registered form issued to the 
  purchaser or endorsed to the purchaser or endorsed in blank, </p>
<p class="indent">(b) in whose name an uncertificated security is registered or 
  recorded in records maintained by or on behalf of the issuer as a result of 
  the issue or transfer of the security to the purchaser, or </p>
<p class="indent">(c) who is a transferee or pledgee as provided in section 85; 
  (&#147;acheteur de bonne foi&#148;)</p>
<p>[36] Section 63(2) reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">A security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value without notice of 
  any defect going to its validity. </p>
<p>[37] There is no issue that Bank Leu was a purchaser for value. It was a pledgee 
  of a security for value. The issues are whether Bank Leu acted in good faith 
  and whether the Regulation S restriction on the share certificate was notice 
  of an &#147;adverse claim&#148; to Bank Leu. An adverse claim is defined in 
  s. 53(1) as including, &#147;&#133; a claim that a transfer is or would be unauthorized 
  or wrongful or that a particular adverse person is the owner of or has an interest 
  in the security.&#148; GLC submits that Bank Leu was wilfully blind to the fact 
  that Bensberg was not the authorized owner of the shares represented by Share 
  Certificate 12093 because of the circumstances surrounding his application for 
  the loan. The trial judge rejected this submission.</p>
<p>[38] The test to determine whether a holder of a share certificate is a good 
  faith purchaser as expressed by the trial judge and approved by this court in 
  Assad v. The Economical Mutual Insurance Group et al. (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 641 
  (C.A.) at para. 19 is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">[19] Suspicions combined with blindness adds up to an absence of good faith. 
  In Bank Leu Ag v. Gaming Lottery Corp., [2001] O.J. No. 4715 (S.C.J.), Lederman 
  J. relied on the House of Lords in arriving at this conclusion. At para. 75 
  et seq. he states: </p>
<p class="indent10">The term &#147;good faith purchaser&#148; has been recognized in the common 
  law for centuries. While mere negligence, commercial stupidity or unreasonableness 
  will not be sufficient to negative good faith on the part of a plaintiff, wilful 
  blindness amounting to dishonesty and refusal to ask obvious questions will 
  suffice. In Jones v. Gordon (1877), 2 App. Cas. 616 (H.L.), Lord Blackburn stated 
  at pages 628-9: </p>
<p class="indent15">But then I think that such evidence of carelessness or blindness as I have 
  referred to may with other evidence be good evidence upon the question which, 
  I take it, is the real one, whether he did know that there was something wrong 
  in it. If he was (if I may use the phrase) honestly blundering and careless, 
  and so took a bill of exchange or a bank-note when he ought not have taken it, 
  still he would be entitled to recover. But if the facts and circumstances are 
  such that the jury, or whoever has to try the question, came to the conclusion 
  that he was not honestly blundering and careless, but that he must have had 
  a suspicion that there was something wrong and that he refrained from asking 
  questions, not because he was an honest blunderer or a stupid man, but because 
  he thought in his own secret mind &#150; I suspect there is something wrong, 
  and if I ask questions and make further inquiry, it will no longer be my suspecting 
  it, but my knowing it, and then I shall not be able to recover &#150; I think 
  that is dishonesty. I think, my Lords, that that is established, not only by 
  good sense and reason, but by the authority of the cases themselves. </p>
<p class="indent10">In London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons, [1892] AC 201 (H.L.) at page 221, Lord 
  Herschell stated: </p>
<p class="indent15">One word I would say upon the question of notice, and being put upon inquiry. 
  I should be very sorry to see the doctrine of constructive notice introduced 
  into the law of negotiable instruments. But regard to the facts of which the 
  taker of such instruments had notice is most material in considering whether 
  he took in good faith. If there be anything which, excites the suspicion that 
  there is something wrong in the transaction, the taker of the instrument is 
  not acting in good faith if he shuts his eyes to the facts presented to him 
  and puts the suspicions aside without further inquiry [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">GLC acknowledges that mere negligence in the conduct of the 
  transaction concerned on the part of the purchaser of the instrument will not 
  deprive such purchaser of good faith status. But if there is anything which 
  excites the suspicion that there is something wrong (and it is not necessary 
  to have notice of what the particular wrong may be) in the transaction, the 
  taker of the instrument is not acting in good faith if the taker shuts his or 
  her eyes to the facts presented and puts the suspicions aside without further 
  enquiry. </p>
<p>[39] GLC acknowledges that the trial judge stated the test for a good faith 
  purchaser correctly but submits that he applied it incorrectly. GLC submits 
  that the trial judge made findings of fact that are consistent only with a conclusion 
  that Bank Leu was wilfully blind to suspicions it had about the loan to Bensberg 
  and that Bank Leu was not a good faith purchaser of Share Certificate 12093. 
  In particular, GLC relies on the findings of the trial judge in relation to 
  Peter Keller. Keller was responsible for the department dealing with loans made 
  by Bank Leu&#146;s domestic branch network, secured and unsecured lending to 
  private individuals as well as the real estate lending activities of the Bank. 
  At the time of trial, Keller had over 22 years of banking experience, almost 
  all of which was in credit. Keller supported the loan to Bensberg. The specific 
  &#147;findings&#148; on which GLC relies in paragraph 85 of its factum are as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent">(1) Notwithstanding clear warning signals and expressions of 
  concern by people within Bank Leu itself, Keller rejected Fischer&#146;s opinion 
  that the motives of the Bensberg transaction were unclear and that the information 
  on Bensberg was inadequate, and advanced a further $1.8 million USD by way of 
  overdraft on the same day that he received Fischer&#146;s memo to that effect. 
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Keller ignored inconsistencies and contradictory information 
  about Bensberg that had been received by Bank Leu.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Keller &#147;pushed&#148; for the $5 million credit to Bensberg 
  against the concerns of other Bank Leu representatives, in contravention of 
  Swiss banking law, in contravention of internal Bank guidelines and in contravention 
  of his own &#147;10% rule&#148;. In so doing, Keller was, as the learned trial 
  judge found, blinded by the fact that Bensberg offered the possibility of being 
  a very large customer for Bank Leu.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Fischer posed the correct questions, but Keller did not 
  wait for answers before granting loan advances. </p>
<p class="indent">(5) Keller closed his eyes, as the learned trial judge found, 
  to many warning signals about the credit worthiness of Bensberg, and the value 
  and liquidity of the stock portfolio.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) Keller caused a further advance of $515, 000.00 USD after 
  he actually knew of the restrictions on transferability of all the share certificates 
  pledged by Bensberg, including 12093.</p>
<p>[40] Contrary to GLC&#146;s assertion, the first three items on this list are 
  found in paragraph 80 of the trial judge&#146;s reasons as some of the indicia 
  on which GLC relied in support of its submission that the evidence established 
  Bank Leu had ample bases for suspicion about Bensberg and the transaction but 
  made no further inquiry. In a similar vein, the trial judge stated at paragraph 
  81 of his reasons that, &#147;Fischer was posing the correct questions but Keller 
  did not wait for the answers before granting the loan advances. In these circumstances, 
  counsel for GLC argues that Keller suspected something was wrong and yet actively 
  refrained from inquiry, although he had the means of knowledge.&#148; Again, 
  at paragraph 85 of his reasons the trial judge stated, &#147;There were many 
  warning signs about the creditworthiness of Bensberg, the value and liquidity 
  of the stock portfolio. The closing of one&#146;s eyes to these signs and the 
  failure to adhere to the bank&#146;s own internal guidelines might amount to 
  negligence or even gross negligence or recklessness or perhaps even a breach 
  of Swiss banking laws in not seeing that Bensberg was a significant credit risk.&#148; 
  After carefully considering GLC&#146;s submission that Bank Leu had reason to 
  suspect that the share certificate was invalid or that Bensberg was a dishonest 
  person, the trial judge ultimately rejected that submission. He concluded at 
  paras. 86 and 87: </p>
<p class="indent">[86][T]here is no evidence that there was any obvious indication 
  or suspicion that the shares were invalid or that Bensberg was a dishonest man. 
  The evidence demonstrates that Fischer [Keller&#146;s subordinate] was concerned, 
  but his concerns did not relate to the validity of the shares. Even Fischer&#146;s 
  comment about Bensberg&#146;s motives being unclear is more consistent with 
  his concern that Bensberg was a credit risk rather than any concern about possible 
  fraud... It makes no sense whatsoever that Keller ... deliberately shut his 
  eyes to a fact that was obvious to him but he was afraid to inquire into, namely, 
  that Bensberg was perpetrating fraud on Bank Leu by using share certificates 
  of no value that he had obtained in various stock programs. </p>
<p class="indent">[87]&#133;The fact that Keller or others in the bank may have 
  had a broad suspicion that Bensberg was a credit risk, cannot be interpreted 
  so widely as to constitute suspicion about the validity of the share certificates. 
  In these circumstances, Bank Leu was a good faith purchaser in taking the pledge 
  of certificate 12093.</p>

<p>[41] In addition, as I have mentioned, the trial judge found that Bank Leu 
  was not bound by the deemed admissions of Koerner in GLC&#146;s third party 
  action against him and he refused to draw an adverse inference against Bank 
  Leu because Koerner was not called. </p>
<p>[42] In considering the appellant&#146;s submissions, I bear in mind that, 
  as recently reiterated in Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 
  (S.C.C.), appellate courts should not reverse findings of fact unless the trial 
  judge has made a &#147;palpable and overriding error&#148; and that the same 
  degree of deference should be paid to a trial judge&#146;s inferences of fact. 
  Questions of law are subject to a standard of correctness. Questions of mixed 
  law and fact involve the application of a legal standard to a set of facts. 
  When the question of mixed fact and law at issue involves a finding of negligence, 
  the standard of &#147;palpable and overriding error&#148; still applies unless 
  the finding of negligence rests on an incorrect statement of the legal standard. 
  The latter can amount to an error of law. The majority summarized the deference 
  required when questions of mixed fact and law are involved at para. 36 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">To summarize, a finding of negligence by a trial judge involves applying a 
  legal standard to a set of facts, and thus is a question of mixed fact and law. 
  Matters of mixed fact and law lie along a spectrum. Where, for instance, an 
  error with respect to a finding of negligence can be attributed to the application 
  of an incorrect standard, a failure to consider a required element of a legal 
  test, or a similar error in principle, such an error can be characterized as 
  an error of law, subject to a standard of correctness&#133; where the issue 
  on appeal involves the trial judge&#146;s interpretation of the evidence as 
  a whole, it should not be overturned absent palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p>[43] GLC submits that the trial judge applied the test for a good faith purchaser 
  too narrowly. He erred in focussing on whether Bank Leu suspected a particular 
  wrong, namely, that Share Certificate 12093 represented shares that had not 
  been fully paid for and were invalid. GLC submits that as a result of narrowing 
  the test, the trial judge in effect required that Bank Leu have actual knowledge 
  of a particular wrong.</p>
<p>[44] I disagree that in applying the test for a good faith purchaser the trial 
  judge narrowed it so as to require actual knowledge of a particular wrong. Although 
  the representation on the share certificate that the shares were fully paid 
  for, was rightly an important factor in the trial judge&#146;s analysis, the 
  trial judge did not just consider the share certificate. He considered the unusual 
  nature of the loan. He also considered whether there was any basis for suspecting 
  that Bensberg was dishonest and found there was not. The trial judge&#146;s 
  &#147;findings&#148; on which GLC relies are indicative that Bank Leu had concerns 
  over the volatility of the security package and Bensberg&#146;s creditworthiness. 
  The trial judge found that when Keller ignored these concerns, Keller may have 
  been negligent. Negligence is, however, not sufficient. The trial judge specifically 
  rejected the submission that the Bank was suspicious that a fraud was being 
  committed. In relation to its submission that the Bank was wilfully blind, GLC 
  has not met the onus as articulated in Housen, supra, with respect to the trial 
  judge&#146;s characterization of the facts. I would also reject GLC&#146;s submission 
  that the trial judge misapplied the test for a good faith purchaser. </p>
<p>[45] GLC&#146;s second major submission also cuts across both the issue of 
  whether the Bank is a good faith purchaser and the issue of whether Share Certificate 
  12093 is a negotiable instrument. GLC&#146;s submission is that the effect of 
  the restriction on the certificate was that Bank Leu knew the shares could not 
  serve as security for the loan transaction to Bensberg because the certificate 
  was in Helix&#146;s name and any transfer to Bensberg or by him to Bank Leu 
  was prohibited by the restriction noted on the share certificate until November 
  15, 1995. In order for this submission to succeed GLC must establish: 1) BMO&#146;s 
  knowledge of the restriction on the share certificate as of November 23rd should 
  be imputed to Bank Leu; and 2) the effect of the restriction is that the shares 
  are incapable of being transferred at all until November 15, 1995 and are worthless 
  as collateral. The trial judge found, at para. 87 of his reasons, that Bank 
  Leu did not appreciate that the shares pledged to it by Bensberg had on them 
  the Regulation S restriction &#147;until most of the loan was advanced.&#148; 
  While the trial judge did not expressly deal with the two components of GLC&#146;s 
  submission he implicitly rejected the submission. In effect GLC submits that 
  the trial judge did not properly appreciate the evidence relating to Share Certificate 
  12093 concerning Regulation S. </p>
<p>[46] As I have indicated, BMO received Share Certificate 12093 on November 
  23, 1994 on behalf of Bank Leu. No issue of imputed knowledge arises in relation 
  to the $860,000 USD Bank Leu advanced prior to November 23, 1994, because this 
  money was advanced on the basis that the share certificates for the securities 
  being pledged were being delivered to BMO. BMO had not yet received them and 
  so had no knowledge of the restrictions. Thus it had no knowledge to impute 
  to Bank Leu until after November 23, 1994.</p>
<p>[47] Bank Leu submits that the knowledge of an agent, in this case BMO, should 
  only be imputed to the principle, Bank Leu, where the circumstances warrant 
  and the agent is involved in the transaction. BMO was acting as the custodian 
  of the share certificates for safe keeping and was not involved in Bank Leu&#146;s 
  decision to lend to Bensberg so Bank Leu argues that it should not have knowledge 
  of the Regulation S restriction imputed to it.</p>
<p>[48] Bank Leu relies on the decision in Rocco v. Northwestern National Insurance 
  Co., [1929] 64 O.L.R. 559 (C.A.) at 562-63 in support of its submission. In 
  that case Middleton J.A. first emphasized at para. 12 that the knowledge of 
  an agent is not knowledge by the principal unless &#147;the circumstances are 
  such as to justify the opinion that the agent would be likely to communicate 
  the information to those in charge of the affairs of the company&#148; [emphasis 
  added]. Here, BMO was not only likely to communicate the information to Bank 
  Leu, it did communicate the information both in a report dated December 7, 1994, 
  which was received about mid-December and in the earlier custody account statement 
  of November 30, 1994. It would appear that BMO&#146;s knowledge should be imputed 
  to Bank Leu because BMO was expected to communicate (and did communicate the 
  information) respecting the restriction on Share Certificate 12093 to Bank Leu.</p>
<p>[49] The custody account statement was typically received a week after it was 
  sent or around December 7, 1994, which would have been about the time Bank Leu 
  approved the loan to Bensberg. Because the custody account statement is not 
  considered important for credit purposes, Bank Leu submits it should not have 
  BMO&#146;s knowledge of the Regulation S restriction imputed to it. Bank Leu 
  relies on that portion of Middleton J.A.&#146;s decision in Rocco, supra, in 
  which he quotes with approval the decision of Viscount Sumner in the case of 
  J.C. Houghton &amp; Co. v. Northard Lowe and Wells Ltd., [1928] A.C. 1 at 18-19 
  to the effect that a company is not deemed to know all the information possessed 
  by its clerks or that is on the books of the company. It is the knowledge of 
  the directors or those who lead the actions of the company that results in knowledge 
  being imputed to the company because it is on the strength of their knowledge 
  that a company would proceed. The company is not affected by what it could not 
  have been expected to know under the system of domestic management established 
  by the company. Bank Leu&#146;s submission, however, ignores an exception to 
  this principle that is mentioned in Houghton, supra. It appears that when a 
  company finally does learn the information those directing the company must 
  have taken &#147;prompt and proper action&#148; in order to avoid having the 
  earlier knowledge of the agent imputed to the corporate principal. In this case, 
  once Bank Leu became aware of the Regulation S restriction on the share certificate 
  it did not take &#147;prompt and proper action&#148;. Instead, it lent more 
  money to Bensberg. Thus, the decision in Rocco, supra, does not assist Bank 
  Leu. </p>
<p>[50] To deal with GLC&#146;s argument it is therefore necessary to squarely 
  address the effect of the Regulation S restriction on Bank Leu. For ease of 
  reference I reproduce the wording of the restriction: </p>
<p class="indent">The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the 
  United States Securities Act of 1933 (The &#147;Act&#148;), have no voting rights 
  and are being transferred pursuant to an exemption under regulation S. Until 
  November 15, 1995 no shares of the stock may be offered, sold or transferred. 
  Offers, sales or transfers in the United States or to a United States person 
  (as defined in regulation S promulgated under the Act) or for the account and 
  benefit of a United States person are not permitted, except as provided in said 
  regulation S unless the shares are registered under the Act or with the prior 
  consent of Laser Friendly Inc. pursuant to an application exemption from such 
  registration under the Act.</p>
<p>[51] The legend begins by stating that the shares represented by the certificate 
  have not been registered under the United States Securities Act. The legend 
  then goes on to say that they are being transferred pursuant to an exemption 
  to the Act, Regulation S. The next sentence states that, &#147;Until November 
  15,1995, no shares of the stock may be offered sold or transferred.&#148; If 
  this sentence is interpreted as meaning that the shares cannot be transferred 
  at all, the sentence directly contradicts the preceding one, which states that 
  the shares have been transferred under Regulation S. The sentence that follows 
  makes it clear that Regulation S only applies to offers, sales or transfers 
  in the United States or to a &#147;United States person&#148;. Transfers to 
  such persons or within the United States are only permitted pursuant to a regulation 
  S exemption or with the prior consent of Laser Friendly Inc. </p>
<p>[52] Imputing BMO&#146;s knowledge of the Regulation S restriction to Bank 
  Leu is of no import since, as I read the restriction, it did not affect the 
  right to transfer the shares outside the United States to persons who were not 
  &#147;United States persons&#148;. None of the transactions involving Share 
  Certificate 12093 took place in the United States or involved &#147;United States 
  persons&#148;. Helix, a Canadian company, was identified as the registered owner 
  of the shares on the face of the share certificate. Helix transferred the shares 
  to Bensberg and there was no evidence that he was a &#147;United States person&#148;. 
  He in turn transferred them to Bank Leu, a Swiss bank. The Regulation S restriction 
  did not govern the transfer of GLC&#146;s shares in this situation.</p>
<p>[53] I must also consider s. 56(3) of the OBCA, the relevant the relevant portions 
  of which are: </p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where a share certificate issued by a corporation &#133;.is, 
  or becomes, subject to, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) a restriction on transfer&#133; </p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">the restriction&#133;is ineffective against a transferee of the share who has 
  no actual knowledge of it, unless it or a reference to it is noted conspicuously 
  on the share certificate.</p>
<p>Because the Regulation S restriction is noted conspicuously on the back of 
  the certificate and Bank Leu had actual knowledge of it through BMO, its agent, 
  GLC submits that the restriction is effective. This submission takes the words 
  of the subsection out of context. Sections 56 (1) and (2) must also be considered. 
  They state: </p>
<p class="indent">56 (1) A corporation shall state upon the face of each share 
  certificate issued by it,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the name of the corporation and the words &#147;Incorporated 
  under the law of the Province of Ontario&#148; or words of like effect: </p>
<p class="indent">(b) the name of the person to whom it was issued; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the number and class of shares and the designation of any 
  series that the certificate represents</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where a corporation is authorized to issue shares of more 
  than one class or series, the corporation shall legibly state on each share 
  certificate issued by it,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached 
  to the shares of each class and series that exists when the share certificate 
  is issued; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) that the class or series of shares that it represents has 
  rights, privileges or restrictions or conditions attached thereto, and that 
  the corporation will furnish to a shareholder, on demand and without charge, 
  a full copy of the text of,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the rights, privileges, restrictions and condition attached 
  to that share and to each class authorized to be issued and to each series in 
  so far as the same have been fixed by the directors; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the authority of the directors to fix the rights, privileges, 
  restrictions and conditions of subsequent series, if applicable. </p>
<p>[54] The effect of sections 56 (1) and (2) is that a corporation authorized 
  to issue more than one class or series of shares must indicate the class or 
  series of shares on the front of the certificate and state the restrictions 
  attaching to that class or series on the certificate or state that a copy of 
  the restrictions on the class or series is available upon request. Considered 
  in the context of the previous subsections, the restrictions referred to in 
  s. 56(3) are the restrictions referred to in s. 56(1) and (2), namely restrictions 
  arising because a corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one 
  class or series, not a restriction arising by operation of U.S. law. </p>
<p>[55] This interpretation of s. 56(3) is reinforced by s. 63 of the OBCA, the 
  relevant portion of which provides that, &#147;a security is valid in the hands 
  of a purchaser for value (including by way of pledge) without notice of any 
  defect going to its validity.&#148; The defect going to the validity of the 
  shares represented by Share Certificate 12093 was the fact they had not been 
  paid for, a defect of which Bank Leu had no notice. The Regulation S restriction 
  did not purport to affect the validity of the shares.</p>
<p>[56] Even where there is a restriction on the transfer of shares of a company 
  and the shares are transferred without complying with that restriction, the 
  transfer can be effective as between the transferor and the transferee. See 
  Re M.C. United Masonry Ltd. (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 330 (C.A.) citing Harrold v. 
  Plenty, [1901] 2 Ch.D. 314; Hawks v. McArthur et al., [1951] 1 All E.R. 22. 
  The principle in Hawks, supra, was recently endorsed by the English Court of 
  Appeal in Pennington v. Waine, [2002] E.W.J. No. 892 at para. 51 (C.A.). In 
  that case, the court held that a transfer of the beneficial or equitable interest 
  in shares in breach of company articles was nonetheless effective. The fact 
  that the transferee had to do a further act in the form of applying for and 
  obtaining registration in order to perfect legal title did not prevent the transfer 
  from operating. In Pennington, supra, nothing in the articles stated that a 
  transfer in violation of the restrictions made the transfer void. Here, nothing 
  in the Legend S restriction on the back of the share certificate states that 
  a transfer in violation of the restriction makes the transfer void as between 
  the transferor and transferee.</p>
<p>[57] I would reject GLC&#146;s submission that the effect of the restriction 
  on the certificate was that the shares could not serve as security for the loan 
  transaction to Bensberg because the certificate was in Helix&#146;s name and 
  any transfer to Bensberg or by him to Bank Leu was prohibited by the restriction 
  noted on the share certificate until November 15, 1995.</p>
<p>[58] GLC further submits that BMO placed a value on the shares of zero in its 
  end of November custody account statement to Bank Leu because of the Regulation 
  S restriction and, imputing that knowledge to Bank Leu, this is evidence Bank 
  Leu knew the shares were worthless as collateral with the result it was not 
  a good faith purchaser. On the custody account statement there is provision 
  for the share price, the exchange rate as at the end of the month if the price 
  is shown in USD and a valuation in Canadian dollars. Both the share price and 
  value for the 2.2 million shares of Laser Friendly (GLC) represented by Share 
  Certificate 12093 are shown as zero. The uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Barnes, 
  on behalf of BMO, was that the share price number and the valuation number had 
  nothing to do with the market price of the shares. It had to do with the fact 
  that he could not pull up the price feed due to the fact &#147;an in-house CUSIP 
  number&#148; had been assigned to the shares. Thus, the appellant&#146;s submission 
  that Bank Leu knew the shares were worthless because BMO affixed a zero value 
  to the shares on account of the Regulation S restriction must fail. I would 
  also reject GLC&#146;s submission that the shares were worth nothing as collateral.</p>
<p>[59] There is no basis for interfering with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion 
  that Bank Leu was a good faith purchaser by way of pledge of certificate 12093. 
  I turn now to the issue of whether the trial judge correctly held that GLC was 
  estopped from asserting a defence against Bank Leu by common law estoppel.</p>


<p>2. Did Bank Leu acquire beneficial title to the shares by common law estoppel?<br>
</p>
<p>[60] There is no issue that a good faith purchaser for value of a share certificate 
  may acquire good title to it even from someone with no title if the issuer has 
  acted in such a way so as to have made a representation which gives rise to 
  an estoppel. The essential elements of such an estoppel are: a) a representation 
  by one party to be acted upon by another party; b) action by the other party 
  on the faith of the representation; and c) resulting detriment to the other 
  party. See Colonial Bank v. Cay and Williams, (1890), 15 A.C. 267 (H.L.) at 
  286; Bloomenthal v. Ford (1897), A.C. 156 at 166-167 (H.L.); Burkinshaw v. Nicholls 
  (1978), 3 A.C. 1004 at 1026-1027 (H.L.).</p>
<p>[61] The share certificate represented that the shares were fully-paid. GLC 
  submits that the only representation GLC could be said to have made to Bank 
  Leu was Share Certificate 12093 taken as a whole. GLC submits that the share 
  certificate represented Helix as the registered owner of the shares and it was 
  clear that Helix did not have the right to dispose of the shares because of 
  the Regulation S restriction noted on Share Certificate 12093. For the reasons 
  given above, I have already rejected the submission that the Regulation S restriction 
  prevented the shares from being transferred at all. I would reject GLC&#146;s 
  argument that it made no misrepresentation or that any representation was immaterial 
  because it was clear the shares could not be transferred on account of the Regulation 
  S restriction.</p>
<p>[62] GLC also submits that the second element of estoppel, reliance by Bank 
  Leu on Certificate 12093 in advancing the funds to Bensberg, is not present. 
  In support of its position GLC makes the following points: 1) BMO did not receive 
  Share Certificate 12093 until November 23,1994, by which time it had already 
  advanced $620,000 USD to Bensberg. 2) When BMO received the certificate it noted 
  the restrictions on it and ascribed a zero valuation to the shares. 3) By the 
  time Bank Leu had Certificate 12093 in its physical possession it did not review 
  the contents of the certificate until December 15, 1994, by which time it had 
  advanced $3.3 million US to Bensberg. Bank Leu advanced further funds with notice 
  of the restriction. 4) The trial judge was not entitled to consider the conduct 
  of GLC in his analysis of the estoppel issue and could only look to the wording 
  of the Certificate itself because Bank Leu was not aware of any of GLC&#146;s 
  acts when it advanced funds to Bensberg. </p>
<p>[63] I will deal with GLC&#146;s submissions in order as follows: 1) In considering 
  whether estoppel should apply, the trial judge was entitled to go beyond the 
  share certificate and to consider that but for GLC&#146;s conduct Bensberg could 
  not have made the representation he did: see Colonial Bank v. Cady and William, 
  supra, at 285 and McLeod v. Brazilian Traction and Light and Power Co., [1927] 
  60 O.L.R. 253 at 261-263 (Ont. S.C.) See also Sylvan Lake Golf and Tennis Club 
  v. Performance Industries (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 318 at 340 (S.C.C.). This 
  applies to the first advance of $860,000, US as well as the other advances. 
  2) As I have held, the evidence indicates that the zero valuation ascribed to 
  the certificate by BMO has nothing to do with its value as a security; 3) Although 
  Bank Leu had advanced 3.3 million US by the time it had certificate 12093 in 
  its physical custody BMO&#146;s possession of the certificate and knowledge 
  of its contents as agent can be imputed to Bank Leu. Thus, Bank Leu relied on 
  the certificate from and after November 23, 1994; 4) GLC created and delivered 
  the share certificates and deliberately placed them in the international stream 
  of commerce knowing, or not caring, that they were likely to be used in a fraud. 
  The Regulation S restriction does not assist GLC in this regard.</p>
<p>[64] The trial judge did not err in holding that Bank Leu acquired beneficial 
  title to the shares by common law estoppel. </p>
<p>3. Was Share Certificate 12093 a Negotiable Instrument? <br>
</p>
<p>[65] Certificate 12093 was in &#147;street form&#148;, that is the share certificate 
  in the name of Helix had attached to it an irrevocable signed stock power so 
  that it could be freely transferred. GLC submits, however, that the Regulation 
  S restriction noted on the shares means that it is not a negotiable instrument. 
</p>
<p>[66] The trial judge did not definitively decide whether the shares were a 
  negotiable instrument or not because he found in favour of Bank Leu on the basis 
  of common law estoppel. The trial judge did, however, say in his reasons at 
  paragraph 65: </p>
<p class="indent">Drawing on the close analogy to the negotiability of bills of exchange, there 
  may be support for the proposition that any restriction on transfer noted conspicuously 
  on the certificate will render it non-negotiable. Professor Benjamin Geva, in 
  Negotiable Instruments and Banking, Vol II. (Toronto, Edmond Montgomery, 1995) 
  at p. 38 states that a bill, cheque or note must be unconditional at its inception 
  and subsequent fulfilment of the condition does not make it unconditional. That 
  being so, it could be said that because of the restrictions, certificate 12093 
  was not a negotiable instrument and even after November 15, 1995 certificate 
  12093 did not become a negotiable instrument.</p>


<p>[67] I would disagree with the trial judge&#146;s interpretation that the time 
  restriction on transferring the shares was a condition. A negotiable instrument 
  is an unconditional promise to pay on demand or at a particular time: see B.A. 
  Garner, ed., Black&#146;s Law Dictionary, 7th ed. (St. Paul, Minn.: West Group, 
  1999). In the worse case scenario, that particular time was after November 15, 
  1995. </p>
<p>[68] More importantly, subsection 53(3) of the OBCA states: </p>
<p class="indent">Except where its transfer is restricted and noted on a security in accordance 
  with subsection 56(3), a security is a negotiable instrument.</p>

<p>[69] I have already held that the regulation S restriction was not a restriction 
  &#147;in accordance with subsection 56(3)&#148; in paragraphs 50 &#150;55 of 
  these reasons. </p>
<p>4. Did the trial judge err in holding that the oppression remedy was available 
  to Bank Leu?<br>
</p>
<p>[70] The oppression remedy is contained in s. 248 of the OBCA. It states: </p>
<p class="indent">248. (1) A complainant and, in the case of an offering corporation, 
  the Commission may apply to the court for an order under this section. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where, upon an application under subsection (1), the court 
  is satisfied that in respect of a corporation or any of its affiliates, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) any act or omission of the corporation or any of its affiliates 
  effects or threatens to effect a result;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the business or affairs of the corporation or any of its 
  affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be carried on or conducted in 
  a manner; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the powers of the directors of the corporation or any of 
  its affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be exercised in a manner,</p>
<p class="indent">that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly 
  disregards the interests of any security holder, creditor, director or officer 
  of the corporation, the court may make an order to rectify the matters complained 
  of. </p>
<p class="indent">(3) In connection with an application under this section, the 
  court may make any interim of final order it thinks fit including, without limiting 
  the generality of the foregoing,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) an order restraining the conduct complained of; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) an order appointing a receiver or receiver-manager;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) an order to regulate a corporation&#146;s affairs by amending 
  the articles or by-laws or creating or amending a unanimous shareholder agreement; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) an order directing an issue or exchange of securities;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) an order appointing directors in place of or in addition 
  to all or any of the directors then in office;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) an order directing a corporation, subject to subsection 
  (6), or any other person, to purchase securities of a security holder;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) an order directing a corporation, subject to subsection 
  (6), or any other person, to pay to a security holder any part of the money 
  paid by the security holder for securities;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) an order varying or setting aside a transaction or contract 
  to which a corporation is a party and compensating the corporation or any other 
  party to the transaction or contract;</p>
<p class="indent">(i) an order requiring a corporation, within a time specified 
  by the court, to produce to the court or an interested person financial statements 
  in the form required by section 154 or an accounting in such other form as the 
  court may determine;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) an order compensating an aggrieved person;</p>
<p class="indent">(k) an order directing rectification of the registers or other 
  records of a corporation under section 250;</p>
<p class="indent">(l) an order winding up the corporation under section 207;</p>
<p class="indent">(m) an order directing an investigation under Part XIII be made; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(n) an order requiring the trial of any issue. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) Where an order made under this section directs amendment 
  of the articles or by-laws of a corporation,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the directors shall forthwith comply with subsection 186 
  (4); and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) no other amendment to the articles or by-laws shall be made 
  without the consent of the court, until the court otherwise orders. </p>
<p class="indent">(5) A shareholder is not entitled to dissent under section 185 
  if an amendment to the articles is effected under this section. </p>
<p class="indent">(6) A corporation shall not make a payment to a shareholder 
  under clause (3) (f) or (g) if there are reasonable grounds for believing that,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the corporation is or, after the payment, would be unable 
  to pay its liabilities as they become due; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the realizable value of the corporation&#146;s assets would 
  thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities. </p>
<p>[71] The oppression remedy is designed to afford a remedy when 
  a corporation acts in an oppressive, unfair or prejudicial manner towards a 
  minority shareholder or creditor or in a manner that unfairly disregards their 
  interests. Important underpinnings of the oppression remedy are the expectations, 
  intentions and understandings of the minority shareholder and creditor. Against 
  these are to be balanced the extent to which the acts complained of were unforeseeable 
  or the extent to which the creditor and minority shareholder could reasonably 
  have protected itself from the acts about which complaint is now made: Sidaplex-Plastic 
  Supplier Inc., v. Elta Group Inc. (1995), 131 D.L.R. (4th) 399 (Ont. Gen. Div.) 
  aff&#146;d (1998), 162 D.L.R. (4th) 367 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>[72] The expectations of the creditor or minority shareholder are determined 
  on an objective basis. At a minimum the expectations of Bank Leu would include 
  the expectation that a corporation would comply with the fundamental principles 
  of corporate law in issuing shares and share certificates. </p>
<p>[73] GLC submits that in granting Bank Leu&#146;s request for relief, the trial 
  judge failed to take into consideration Bank Leu&#146;s flawed behaviour in 
  the transaction, which he characterized as &#147;approaching recklessness&#148; 
  and in violation of Swiss Banking Law. GLC submits that the direct cause of 
  Bank Leu&#146;s situation was its own conduct and that the trial judge granted 
  Bank Leu an inappropriate remedy.</p>
<p>[74] Section 248(3) empowers a court upon a finding of oppression to make &#147;any 
  order it thinks fit.&#148; As held by this court in Naneff v. Con-Crete Holdings 
  Ltd. (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 481 at 486-487 (C.A.), and as stated in Sidaplex-Plastic 
  Suppliers, supra, at para. 4: &#147;This gives the court at first instance a 
  broad discretion and the appellate court a limited power of review. The appellate 
  court is entitled to interfere only where it is established that the court at 
  first instance has erred in principle or its decision is otherwise unjust.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[75] The trial judge found that GLC prevented Bank Leu from exercising its 
  rights as a shareholder on the grounds that the shares had not been paid for. 
  GLC created this situation by issuing Share Certificate 12093 which stated that 
  the shares were fully paid for without requiring payment and allowing the certificate 
  into the stream of international commerce. If the shares had been paid for it 
  would not have mattered that the shares were restricted because at the very 
  latest the Bank could have sold them as of November 15, 1995. Moreover, as I 
  have held, the restriction did not prevent the shares from being transferred 
  in these circumstances.</p>
<p>[76] GLC has not demonstrated any error in principle on the part of the trial 
  judge. He considered all the relevant circumstances. His decision was not unjust. 
</p>
<p>B. The Third Party Claim <br>
</p>
<p>1. Was North Shore Vicariously liable for the fraudulent acts of its employee 
  Anderson?<br>
</p>
<p>[77] In determining whether an employer is vicariously liable for an employee&#146;s 
  intentional tort, the analysis proceeds in two steps. The first step is to determine 
  if existing authorities are decisive. If so, the analysis stops there. If not, 
  the Court then proceeds to determine whether vicarious liability should be imposed 
  in light of a broader based policy analysis based on whether the employer&#146;s 
  enterprise created or significantly enhanced the risk of the harm that occurred: 
  see Bazley v. Curry (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 45 at paras. 22, 41(S.C.C.); Jacobi 
  v. Griffiths (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 71 (S.C.C.) at paras. 67, 79. There must 
  be a strong connection between the employer&#146;s enterprise and the risk of 
  the harm that occurred, sufficient to justify imposing employer liability (Bazley, 
  supra, at para. 42; Jacobi, supra, at para. 29). </p>
<p>[78] GLC submits that North Shore is vicariously liable for Anderson&#146;s 
  alleged dishonest conversion of Laser Friendly (GLC&#146;s) Share Certificate 
  12093, in breach of an escrow agreement, in furtherance of a fraudulent conspiracy. 
  The trial judge found that any misconduct on the part of Anderson arose in the 
  course of his private dealings in his personal capacity for which North Shore 
  cannot be vicariously liable. GLC submits that that distinction was not properly 
  determinative of the issue of vicarious liability. </p>
<p>[79] Traditionally, an employer is liable for employees&#146; unauthorized 
  acts only if they are so connected with authorized acts that they might be regarded 
  as modes, although improper modes, of doing them. The employer is not responsible 
  if the wrongful act of an employee is not so connected with that authorized 
  by or within the scope of employment as to be a mode of carrying out the employment. 
  If the act can be viewed as an independent act of the employee, the employer 
  will not be responsible: C.P.R. v. Lockhart, [1942] 3 W.W.R. 149 (P.C.) at 157. 
</p>
<p>[80] Where the plaintiff deals with the employee in a personal capacity or 
  enters into contracts with the employee in a personal capacity the employer 
  is not vicariously liable: Bagoo v. Tasker, [1993] O.J. No. 1734 (Gen. Div.) 
  at paras. 41-43; Cambell v. Sherman, [1993] O.J. No. 2815 (Gen.Div.) at paras. 
  168, 170; Bourgeault v. McDermid (1982), 140 D.L.R. (3d) 174 (B.C.S.C.) at 176, 
  177; Rowe v. Investors Syndicate Ltd., [1984] O.J. No. 346 (H.C.J.) at paras. 
  150-162. </p>
<p>[81] I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in holding that any misconduct 
  of Anderson in wrongfully releasing the shares from escrow was carried out in 
  his personal capacity and that North Shore was therefore not liable for his 
  acts. The trial judge&#146;s findings of fact, which are not attacked and which 
  are amply supported by the evidence are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">[121] It is plain from the very face of the escrow agreement 
  that the contracting parties were Helix, Red Oak and Anderson, in his personal 
  capacity. No one reading the escrow agreement would know that North Shore is 
  involved in any way. </p>
<p class="indent">[122] The business decision to select Anderson and use him as 
  escrow agent was Ericksteen&#146;s and Ericksteen dealt with Anderson solely 
  in his personal capacity. Moore, the lawyer for Helix and Ericksteen, confirmed 
  in his evidence that North Shore was not a party to the escrow agreement and 
  that at all times the intention was to deal with Anderson solely in his personal 
  capacity. Moore was responsible to draft legal documentation for Ericksteen 
  and his companies and in that regard he was familiar with the basic legal concepts 
  of separate legal identity of corporations. He was likewise familiar with the 
  need for companies to act through authorized signing officers. Moore was himself 
  an authorized signatory for Helix and signed as such when intending to bind 
  the company. It was Moore who drafted the escrow agreement and was fully aware 
  that the agreement was to be with Anderson in his personal capacity. Moore&#146;s 
  communications with Anderson were to him directly without any mention of North 
  Shore, he made demand under the escrow agreement directly on Anderson for the 
  return of certificate 12093. Moore never put anyone at North Shore on notice 
  of this demand. </p>
<p class="indent">[123] In these circumstances, where a party deals with an employee 
  in a personal capacity or enters into contracts with the employee in a personal 
  capacity, the employer cannot be vicariously liable: (see Bagoo v. Tasker, [1993]).J. 
  No. 1734 (Gen. Div.); Campbell v. Sherman, [1993] O.J. No. 2815 at paras. 168, 
  170 (Gen. Div.)). Any misconduct by Anderson arose in the course of his private 
  dealings and not as the authorized representative of North Shore. </p>
<p>[82] In addition, I note that the evidence indicates that North Shore never 
  acted as an escrow agent for shares or securities. This was not a service that 
  North Shore offered its members and Anderson was not authorized to act as an 
  escrow agent on behalf of North Shore. North Shore never held out that he was 
  so authorized. </p>
<p>[83] In the event this analysis is not determinative, however, I would hold 
  that there should be no vicarious liability under the second stage of the analysis 
  set out in Bazley, supra, and Jacobi, supra. </p>
<p>[84] The questions a court must ask itself in assessing the evidence at this 
  stage and North Shore&#146;s position, which I would adopt, are ably set out 
  in its factum at para. 38 as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What opportunity did North Shore&#146;s enterprise offer the employee to 
    abuse his power or position? None. Helix and Red Oak were obviously prepared 
    to deal with Anderson in a personal capacity.</li>
  <li>To what extent did Anderson&#146;s alleged wrongful act further North Shore&#146;s 
    aims? Not at all. This is in contrast to the dreams of financial gain that 
    motivated all other parties involved in the Gaming/Helix/Red Oak/Bank Leu 
    transactions. </li>
  <li>To what extent was Anderson&#146;s alleged wrongful act related to friction, 
    confrontation or intimacy inherent in the employer&#146;s enterprise? Not 
    at all.</li>
  <li>What extent of power did North Shore confer on Anderson in relation to the 
    victim? None. Unlike, for example, a credit union member whose assets the 
    credit union entrusts to its employees, North Shore conferred no power on 
    Anderson in relation to Gaming (or Helix or Bank Leu, or any other person 
    involved for that matter).</li>
  <li>How vulnerable are potential victims? Not at all. Gaming was a public company, 
    for which one should expect ready access to expert advisors, and high standards 
    of management skill and integrity. Gaming in fact consulted skilled legal 
    advisers, whose advice it consistently ignored. It is hard to imagine a less 
    vulnerable class of &#147;victim&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<p>[85] I would hold that the trial judge did not err in holding that North Shore 
  is not liable for the conduct of Anderson.</p>
<p>III. Disposition and Costs<br>
</p>
<p>[86] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal in the main action and 
  in the third party action.</p>
<p>[87] At the conclusion of the hearing this Court reserved its decision and 
  asked that the parties file submissions with respect to costs. Those submissions 
  have now been received and, while submissions were made that costs of the appeal 
  on a substantial indemnity basis were appropriate, I would award costs on a 
  partial indemnity basis. On a partial indemnity basis Bank Leu seeks $38,945.86 
  and North Shore seeks $29,003.69 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. GLC does 
  not challenge the quantum of costs sought by Bank Leu and North Shore on a partial 
  indemnity basis. Accordingly, I would order that GLC pay the costs of this appeal 
  and fix costs in favour of Bank Leu at $38,945.86 all inclusive and those of 
  North Shore at $29,003.69 all inclusive. </p>
