<p>On appeal from the order of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated May 7, 2003 dismissing a motion to vary an initial stay order 
  dated April 1, 2003.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal involves the interpretation of s. 11.3 of the Companies' Creditors 
  Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 as amended (&quot;CCAA&quot;) and its 
  application to arrangements for processing of credit card payments. Farley J.'s 
  initial stay order in Air Canada's CCAA application required Global Payments 
  Direct, Inc. and Global Payments Canada Inc. (&quot;Global&quot;) to continue 
  to provide credit card processing services to Air Canada. Global submits that 
  the order requires it to advance money or credit to Air Canada contrary to s. 
  11.3(b). </p>
<p> LEGISLATION</p>
<p> [2] Section 11.3 of the CCAA provides that no s. 11 stay order 
  to protect a company that has filed for CCAA relief shall have the effect of 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) prohibiting a person from requiring immediate payment for 
  goods, services, use of leased or licensed property or other valuable consideration 
  provided after the order is made; or </p>
<p class="indent"> (b) requiring the further advance of money or credit. </p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] The initial stay order required Global to continue to process Air Canada's 
  VISA and MasterCard transactions under Global's pre-filing arrangements with 
  Air Canada. </p>
<p>
  [4] Approximately 80% of Air Canada's customers pay for their tickets using 
  a credit card. There are four participants and four distinct but related contractual 
  arrangements involved in a credit card purchase of an Air Canada ticket. The 
  four participants are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the cardholder or customer;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the merchant (Air Canada);</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the credit card issuer (a financial institution that issues 
  credit cards to its customers); and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) the merchant acquirer or fund processor (Global). </p>
<p>
  [5] The four contracts are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the cardholder - merchant agreement (between the cardholder 
  and Air Canada for the purchase of a ticket);</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the cardholder - credit card issuer agreement (the &quot;cardholder 
  agreement&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the credit card issuer - merchant acquirer agreement; and 
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) the merchant acquirer - merchant agreement (between Global 
  and Air Canada). With respect to VISA processing services, the agreement was 
  initially between Air Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) 
  (&quot;VISA agreement&quot;). Global subsequently assumed CIBC's rights and 
  obligations under that agreement. Although the MasterCard agreement expired 
  in 1997, on the evidence before the motions judge, Global has continued to process 
  MasterCard transactions on similar terms. </p>
<p>
  [6] Pursuant to these agreements, credit card purchases are processed as follows. 
  The cardholder initiates the transaction by contracting with Air Canada for 
  future air travel and agreeing to pay for that service immediately by using 
  a credit card. The credit card issuer extends credit to the cardholder by debiting 
  the cardholder's credit card account. Upon being notified of the transaction, 
  Global makes an immediate payment to Air Canada and subsequently (at most two 
  to three days later) receives payment from the credit card issuer. Global receives 
  a fee or &quot;discount rate&quot; from Air Canada for providing this processing 
  service. </p>
<p>
  [7] Global's claim for relief under s. 11.3(b) arises from its exposure to liability 
  for &quot;chargebacks&quot;. A chargeback may arise where the cardholder has 
  a claim against Air Canada. Such a claim would clearly arise if Air Canada were 
  to fail to provide the cardholder with the travel service it had promised. In 
  that situation, the cardholder may request a refund or credit from the credit 
  card issuer. Under the terms of typical cardholder agreements, the credit card 
  issuer has the right to refuse the cardholder's request in which case the cardholder's 
  only recourse would be to seek a refund from Air Canada directly. However, under 
  the terms of the VISA agreement, if the credit card issuer agrees to the cardholder's 
  request for a refund, it can chargeback to Global the amount it refunds to the 
  cardholder. Global is contractually bound to pay the credit card issuer the 
  amount of the chargeback and is left to claim the same amount back from Air 
  Canada. </p>
<p>
  [8] Global submits that it faces a substantial risk of exposure for chargebacks 
  should Air Canada cease operations. As of the date of Air Canada's CCAA filing, 
  Global estimated that its exposure risk for chargebacks for VISA and MasterCard 
  ticket purchases was $432,513,123. </p>
<p>
  [9] Global's exposure to chargeback claims is, however, mitigated by two factors. 
  First, in most cases, the credit card issuer is not obligated to refund the 
  cost of the purchased flight to the customer. The typical VISA cardholder agreement 
  does not grant the cardholder any entitlement either to refuse to pay or to 
  seek recovery from the card issuer; instead, it provides that the cardholder 
  &quot;must still pay the amount owing and settle the problem directly with the 
  store or merchant.&quot; Second, under the terms of the agreement whereby Global 
  assumed the CIBC's rights and obligations under the VISA agreement, CIBC agreed 
  to indemnify Global on certain terms in respect of its chargeback exposure to 
  Air Canada. It would appear, however, that Global has no such guarantee or indemnity 
  for its MasterCard chargeback exposure.</p>
<p>
  [10] Global took the position that the initial stay order requiring it to continue 
  to process Air Canada credit card transactions was contrary to s. 11.3. Global 
  moved for an order declaring that it &quot;has no obligation to continue to 
  provide credit to Air Canada via the credit card processing services currently 
  provided by Global to Air Canada except upon terms satisfactory to Global&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] The motions judge ruled that pursuant to s. 11.3(a), Global was entitled 
  to reasonable protection with respect to its post-filing fees. However, he rejected 
  Global's claim for relief under s. 11.3(b), ruling that ordering Global to continue 
  its credit card processing services did not have the effect of requiring Global 
  to provide a &quot;further advance of money or credit&quot; to Air Canada. The 
  motions judge ruled that credit was extended to the cardholder by the card issuer 
  and that no credit was extended to Air Canada. He ruled as follows with respect 
  to Global's chargeback exposure: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [8] What of the chargeback situation? It seems to me that functionally and legally 
  if AC is charged back for failure to provide the flight, then credit is not 
  being extended in the sense of s. 11.3 but rather that AC becomes obligated 
  to pay back to the card issuer (through Global) the price of the ticket for 
  credit (mechanical accounting) to the account of the credit cardholder. Prior 
  to any actual chargeback, there is no credit extended as to the chargeback but 
  rather, the potential for a chargeback is an inchoate contingent liability.</p>
<p>
  [12] Global was granted leave to appeal that decision to this Court and the 
  appeal was heard on an expedited basis.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] Global submits that the motions judge erred and that because Air Canada, 
  through Global's services, receives payment for a service yet to be provided, 
  Air Canada is receiving &quot;the further advance of money or credit&quot; within 
  the meaning of s. 11.3(b). Global contends that because it may be liable to 
  repay cardholders through the card issuer if Air Canada fails to provide the 
  promised service, the net result is that Global is being required to advance 
  money or credit to Air Canada contrary to s. 11.3(b).</p>
<p>
  [14] In his oral submissions before us, counsel for Global abandoned the argument 
  that Global was advancing money or credit to Air Canada on account of the delay 
  between Global's payments to Air Canada and the credit card issuers' payments 
  to Global. He made it clear that Global's argument that it is extending credit 
  to Air Canada rests solely on the contractual arrangements relating to &quot;chargebacks&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] CIBC supports Global's position and submits that its agreement to indemnify 
  Global is not relevant for the purpose of s. 11.3(b) of the CCAA. CIBC argues 
  that the existence of the indemnity cannot change the appropriate legal characterization 
  of the relationship between Air Canada and Global and that, if the effect of 
  the stay order is to advance credit to Air Canada through the credit card system, 
  the precise location of the ultimate liability for the risk of Air Canada's 
  default is irrelevant. </p>
<p>
  [16] In my view, the motions judge correctly concluded that the initial stay 
  order did not have &quot;the effect of &#133;requiring the further advance of 
  money or credit&quot; to Air Canada within the meaning of s. 11.3(b). I agree 
  with the motions judge's characterization of Global's risk of chargeback exposure 
  as a contingent liability rather than the extension of credit. </p>
<p>
  [17] Extension of credit to a debtor generally arises in one of two ways. The 
  first, contemplated by s. 11.3(a), is where goods, services or the like are 
  provided on the promise of future payment. The second, contemplated by s. 11.3(b), 
  is where a creditor advances funds on the debtor's promise of future repayment. 
  In both situations, the extension of credit arises from the debtor's present 
  promise to pay money in the future. A debt is created in favour of the creditor. 
  There is almost invariably an obligation on the part of the debtor to pay interest 
  to reflect the cost of borrowing, either immediately or after a specified period.</p>
<p>
  [18] While I would not wish to exclude the possibility that credit might be 
  extended in other ways for the purpose of s. 11.3(b), I cannot accept Global's 
  submission that by receiving immediate payment for a service to be provided 
  in the future, Air Canada is receiving &quot;the further advance of money or 
  credit&quot; within the meaning of s. 11(3)(b). Air Canada does obtain money 
  and the benefit of its immediate use, but no debt is created, Air Canada's promise 
  is for future performance not future payment, and there is no obligation to 
  pay interest. Air Canada is contractually bound to supply the promised service 
  and may be liable to return the purchase price or pay damages if it fails to 
  do so. While Air Canada does receive money, the phrase &quot;further advance 
  of money or credit&quot; [emphasis added] in s. 11.3(b) does not embrace payments 
  of any kind. The word &quot;advance&quot; is typically used in connection with 
  payments made by a lender to a borrower. Moreover, Global is two steps removed 
  from liability for chargebacks as it only becomes liable if Air Canada fails 
  to perform and if the credit card issuer decides to refund the cardholder. As 
  the motions judge explained, Global's exposure is more aptly characterized as 
  an &quot;inchoate contingent liability&quot; rather than the advance of money 
  or credit.</p>
<p>
  [19] I also agree with the motions judge that Global's own characterisation 
  of its role as merchant acquirer is telling. In its public filings with the 
  United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Global Payments Inc. Form 
  10-Q for the quarterly period ending November 30, 2002), Global presents its 
  chargeback exposure as a &quot;contingent liability&quot; rather than as an 
  advance of money or credit: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Company processes credit card transactions for direct merchants. The Company's 
  merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the 
  cardholder. In the event, however, that the Company is not able to collect such 
  amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or 
  another reason, the Company may be liable for any such reversed charges. The 
  Company requires cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types 
  of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability. 
  The Company also utilizes a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant 
  risk. [emphasis added].</p>
<p>Global did not bargain for any deposit or other form of security from Air Canada 
  to cover its chargeback exposure, and when Global asked for such protection 
  when Air Canada started to falter after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, 
  Air Canada refused, and Global continued to provide Air Canada with its processing 
  services. Moreover, in a press release issued by Global after the initial stay 
  order, Global informed investors: &quot;a material loss from the relationship 
  [with Air Canada] is unlikely&#133;&quot;</p>
<p>
  [20] Global submits that the credit card system has similarities with other 
  multiparty or related bilateral agreements and arrangements such as letters 
  of credit. I agree, but in my view, this argument undermines rather than advances 
  Global's case. In 1997, Parliament chose to deal with some of these relationships 
  and to exempt certain financial service providers under s. 11. Section 11.2 
  specifically provides that no s. 11 order shall stay the obligation arising 
  under a letter of credit. Similarly, s. 11.1 exempts certain specified &quot;eligible 
  financial contracts&quot; from stay orders. Although credit card processing 
  arrangements were widespread and well-known in 1997, Parliament did not exempt 
  them. </p>
<p>
  [21] The motions judge cited a number of American cases dealing with credit 
  card processing arrangements. While these cases are not directly applicable 
  because they deal with the intricacies of the United States Bankruptcy Code 
  (the &quot;Code&quot;), 11 U.S.C. &sect; 365, they do, in the result they reach, 
  support the motions judge's conclusion. Section 365(c)(2) of the Code, loosely 
  analogous to section 11.3(b) of the CCAA, denies the debtor the right to assume 
  an executory contract where &quot;such contract is a contract to make a loan, 
  or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations, to or for the benefit 
  of the debtor&quot;. In several reported decisions, credit card processing agreements 
  have been found to be assumable as they are not &quot;financial accommodations&quot; 
  within the meaning of s.365: In re Thomas B. Hamilton Co., 969 F.2d 1013 at 
  1018-20 (11th Cir. 1992) (&quot;Hamilton&quot;); In re National Hydro-Vac Indus. 
  Services, L.L.C., 262 B.R. 781, 784 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2001); In re Best Products 
  Co., 210 B.R. 714 at 717-18 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997); In re Health Science Products, 
  181 B.R. 121 at 124 n.2 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. 1994). Global points out that under 
  the Code, where a contract is assumed post-filing and then breached, the creditor 
  may gain some priority over other unsecured creditors (see s. 365(g) and In 
  re Klein Sleep Products, 78 F. 3d 18 (2nd Cir. 1996); however, that arises from 
  the specific provisions of the Code applicable to all assumed executory contracts, 
  not from the legal nature of credit card processing arrangements.</p>
<p>
  [22] The leading case, Hamilton, at 1020, held that the purpose of the credit 
  card processing agreement at issue was to establish a relationship that would 
  permit the merchant to accept credit cards instead of cash in the course of 
  its business; the purpose was not to provide financing. Examining the relationship 
  between the merchant, the merchant bank, the credit card company, the card-issuing 
  bank, and the cardholder, the Hamilton court noted that it was the card-issuing 
  bank, not the merchant bank, that carried the primary contractual obligation 
  to extend credit: Id. at 1021. As noted by the motions judge, Hamilton was applied 
  by Wedoff J., in the United Airlines bankruptcy proceedings: In re UAL Corporation, 
  393 B.R. 183 at 188 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2003): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Eleventh Circuit's 1992 decision in Hamilton is the leading case, and no 
  published opinions disagree with its analysis of the question: (1) the purpose 
  of a credit card processing agreement is &quot;to establish a relationship that 
  will permit [the debtor] to accept the use by customers of credit cards instead 
  of cash in the course of its business&quot;; (2) &quot;the specific terms of 
  the Agreement do not evidence any intent on the part of [the processing bank] 
  to extend credit to [the debtor]&quot;; (3) the fact that the debtor is liable 
  to the processing bank for chargebacks &quot;can only be viewed as incidental 
  to the overall relationship&quot;; and (4) &quot;[t]he Agreement is not, therefore, 
  a contract to extend financial accommodations within the meaning of &sect;365(c)(2).&quot; 
  [quoting Hamilton, supra at 1020].</p>
<p>[23] In holding that Global is not advancing money or credit to Air Canada 
  within the meaning of s. 11.3(b), the motions judge appropriately weighed in 
  the balance the general policy of promoting reorganization identified in Hamilton 
  at 1020: </p>
<p class="indent">The Agreement at issue here is typical of credit card merchant agreements between 
  all kinds of merchants and merchant banks. If these agreements may not be assumed 
  by the trustee following a bankruptcy filing, rehabilitation will be virtually 
  impossible for any merchant who relies heavily on credit card sales.</p>
<p>[24] In both written and oral submissions before this Court, counsel for Air 
  Canada argued that even if we concluded that Global was advancing money or credit 
  to Air Canada, we should dismiss the appeal as there is no evidence that Global's 
  chargeback exposure has increased post-filing. Air Canada submits that even 
  if Global is advancing money or credit, it is not advancing &quot;further&#133;credit&quot; 
  as contemplated by s. 11.3(b). As my conclusion with respect to the reach of 
  s. 11.3(b) in relation to Global provides a sufficient basis to dispose of this 
  appeal, it is unnecessary for me to express any opinion with respect to that 
  alternative submission. </p>
<p>
  [25] I would add, however, that quite apart from s. 11.3(b), the nature and 
  extent of the risk faced by a credit card processor could be relevant to the 
  appropriate terms for a s. 11 order. In some cases, it might well be appropriate 
  to impose terms to protect a party such as Global from unreasonable risk: cf. 
  Hamilton at 1021. The motions judge's reasons demonstrate that he carefully 
  considered the nature and extent of Global's chargeback exposure. As the order 
  against Global is not barred by s. 11.3(b), the relief sought by Global falls 
  squarely within the discretion of the CCAA supervising judge that is to be afforded 
  substantial deference on appeal: Algoma Steel Inc. (Re) (2001), 25 C.B.R. (4th) 
  194 (Ont. C.A.)); Consumers Packaging Inc. (Re) (2001), 27 C.B.R. (4th) 197 
  (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [26] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [27] If the parties cannot agree as to the costs of the appeal, the court will 
  entertain brief written submissions dealing with all aspects of the award of 
  costs. Counsel for any party claiming costs shall deliver submissions and a 
  bill of costs no later than ten days from the date of this judgment. Responding 
  submissions may be delivered within seven days thereafter.</p>
