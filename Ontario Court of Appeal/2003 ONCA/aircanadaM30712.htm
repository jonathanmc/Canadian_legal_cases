<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mizuho International plc (&quot;Mizuho&quot;) seeks leave to appeal from 
  the order of Farley J. dated December 8, 2003. In that order, Farley J. (a) 
  declined Mizuho's request for an adjournment of the hearing pending what is 
  said to be a final proposal from Cerberus; and (b) approved what is know as 
  the &quot;Trinity Agreement&quot; concerning Trinity's proposed equity investment 
  in the insolvent Air Canada. If leave be granted, Mizuho will argue the appeal 
  as well. </p>
<p>[2] We are all of the view that the motion for leave to appeal should be dismissed. 
  It is well-settled that this court will only sparingly grant leave to appeal 
  in the context of a Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (&quot;CCAA&quot;) 
  proceeding. The court must be satisfied there are &quot;serious and arguable 
  grounds that are of real and significant interest to the parties&quot;: see 
  Re Country Style Food Services Inc., [2002] O.J. No. 1377 (C.A.). In our view, 
  the test has not been met in the circumstances of this case. </p>
<p>[3] In this particularly complex restructuring involving Air Canada, the company 
  some time ago embarked upon an equity solicitation process that was ultimately 
  narrowed down to two potential investors, namely Trinity and Cerberus. </p>
<p>[4] On November 8, 2003, Air Canada selected Trinity as the equity investor 
  and entered into an agreement with Trinity to that effect. The agreement contains 
  confidentiality provisions and a &quot;fiduciary out&quot; clause that allows 
  the Air Canada Board to consider a &quot;superior proposal&quot; as therein 
  defined. This process has been supervised by the Monitor and all the stakeholders, 
  including Mizuho, have bought into it as the most effective way of moving the 
  restructuring along.</p>
<p>[5] Indeed, until a few days before the approval hearing before Farley J., 
  Mizuho was urging all concerned to accept the Trinity Agreement. In late November, 
  however, Cerberus made a series of unsolicited proposals to the Air Canada Board 
  seeking to best the Trinity proposal. During a chambers meeting with Farley 
  J. on December 4th, Cerberus indicated that it would be putting forward its 
  final proposal the following week and that it was content to do so under the 
  rubric of the fiduciary out clause in the Trinity Agreement.</p>
<p>[6] On December 8th, Farley J. refused Mizuho's request for an adjournment 
  and for an order requiring that the forthcoming Cerberus proposal be disclosed 
  to the court and to the creditors. On the urging of virtually all of the parties, 
  and on the recommendation of the Monitor and in the interests of facilitating 
  the urgent need for the Air Canada restructuring to proceed, Farley J. approved 
  the Trinity Agreement.</p>
<p>[7] Mr. Sasso argues that he erred in doing so and that the court had a duty 
  to consider and review competing offers before deciding whether to approve the 
  Trinity Agreement as the one in the best interests of the creditors. He relies 
  on the decision of this court in Royal Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp. (1991), 
  4 O.R. (3d) 1.</p>
<p>[8] What Farley J. did, however, was to conclude in effect that the equity 
  solicitation process and the Trinity agreement which resulted from it were fair 
  and reasonable in the circumstances and advanced the interests of the stakeholders 
  and Air Canada in the restructuring. All parties had accepted this process, 
  which has, as a significant feature, the fiduciary out clause. This clause calls 
  for other investor proposals to be put forward in the framework of the Trinity 
  Agreement. It also places in the Air Canada Board, in the exercise of its business 
  acumen as a board, the duty to determine whether such a proposal is a &quot;superior 
  proposal&quot;. The Board is, of course, bound to consider any such proposal 
  in good faith and in the context of its fiduciary duties as directors. If it 
  considers the proposal to be a &quot;superior&quot; one, it must bring it to 
  the court for consideration. We note as well that the court-appointed Monitor 
  remains inextricably involved in this exercise.</p>
<p>[9] Given these circumstances, accepted by all, it was well within the appropriate 
  exercise of Farley J.'s discretion to refuse the adjournment, approve the Trinity 
  Agreement and hold the parties to the process to which they had agreed. We see 
  no error in principle on his part in doing so.</p>
<p>[10] We observe that the approval of the equity investor is but one of many 
  steps along the route towards an ultimate plan of compromise and arrangement 
  which will require the approval of creditors and the sanction of the court.</p>
<p>[11] Accordingly, the motion for leave to appeal is dismissed. The costs of 
  this motion, and of the chambers motion before Blair J.A. on December 5, 2003, 
  are fixed as follows, and payable by Mizuho:</p>
