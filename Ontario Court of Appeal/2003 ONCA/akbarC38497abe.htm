<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown appeals against an 18 month conditional sentence imposed following 
  a conviction for sexual assault. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The offence involved attempt at intercourse on a developmentally handicapped 
  woman. The trial judge concluded that a conditional sentence was appropriate 
  based on a finding that the accused did not represent a danger to the public. 
  However, he gave no reasons for this conclusion. Given the circumstances of 
  the offence and lengthy criminal record of the respondent we find this conclusion 
  unreasonable. Accordingly, it was not open to the trial judge to impose a conditional 
  sentence in the circumstances. Given that there was no delay by the Crown in 
  proceeding with this appeal and that the respondent has not taken steps to pursue 
  his rehabilitation while on conditional sentence, it is not contrary to the 
  interests of justice to impose a sentence of incarceration at this time. We 
  would not interfere with the original starting point of the trial judge in the 
  circumstances. Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted and the sentence is varied 
  to 3 1/2 months incarceration from the date of surrender. A section 109 Criminal 
  Code weapons prohibition for ten years is imposed as the trial judge failed 
  to address his mind to the fact that this was an offence involving violence.</p>
