<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Edward F. Ormston of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated February 1, 2001 and by the sentence imposed by Justice Edward 
  F. Ormston dated February 1, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant argues that there has been a miscarriage of justice because 
  he pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud on the basis of an assurance from his 
  counsel that he would receive a non-custodial sentence. In fact, he was sentenced 
  to six months in custody on one charge, followed by a twelve-month conditional 
  sentence on the other charges.</p>
<p>
  [2] There was a discussion about sentencing at a pre-trial meeting with the 
  trial judge. Both counsel have testified, as part of fresh evidence provided 
  to this court, that the trial judge made a statement to the effect that he could 
  see fit to impose a conditional sentence if there was a guilty plea. The trial 
  judge explained that, in his view, the Court of Appeal called for more than 
  a $650,000 fraud to impose a custodial sentence. The Crown was then, and thereafter, 
  seeking a minimum of an eighteen-month custodial sentence, plus a restitution 
  order.</p>
<p>
  [3] Trial counsel for the appellant was cross-examined as to his advice to his 
  client. The following exchanges are explicit:</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Well, let's be a bit more specific than messages. Did you 
  tell Mr. Al-Diasty that if he entered a plea of guilty before Judge Ormston, 
  he would not go to jail?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. So you did present it as a sure thing?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And this is despite the fact that it wasn't a sure thing?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Well, when a judge at a judicial pretrial says he could 
  see fit to imposing a conditional sentence, that tells me that the judge is 
  not going to incarcerate the person.</p>
<p>
  and then further:</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Mr. Al-Diasty says that you promised him that if he pled 
  guilty, the judge would sentence him to no jail?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Is that fair?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's what Judge Ormston told me. I think that's-that's 
  what he actually said-well, I don't know about promised, but that's what the 
  judge said he was going to do; no jail.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. So, there was no doubt in your mind that, on a plea, he 
  would be receiving a conditional sentence; is that fair?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No doubt. That's fair.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And that's what you conveyed to Mr. Al- Diasty?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant was persistent in claiming his innocence. He now testifies 
  that his personal circumstances made it so important that he avoid incarceration 
  that he pleaded guilty on the assurance of avoiding jail.</p>
<p>
  [5] At the time of the guilty plea, the trial judge questioned the appellant 
  closely as to his understanding of its implications and, specifically, that 
  although there had been discussions with his counsel, the trial judge could 
  sentence as he saw fit. In cross-examination on his fresh evidence affidavit, 
  the appellant said that it was his understanding that, despite the deal, each 
  party had &quot;to do their job giving submissions and reasons and facts&quot;. 
  He, and his trial counsel, were taken aback when a custodial sentence was imposed.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant's belief in his innocence of the intent to defraud may be 
  wistful, but, nonetheless, it reflected a clear determination to defend the 
  charges. That determination was interrupted by the clear promise from his lawyer 
  of a non-custodial sentence. Thus, he pleaded guilty on the basis of a mistaken 
  belief in the consequence.</p>
<p>
  [7] This is not a case where someone dissatisfied with a sentence is creating 
  a story to avoid the outcome. The factual basis for the entire episode is documented 
  or revealed by cross-examinations of the concerned individuals with little dispute 
  as to what occurred. In our view, it would be a miscarriage of justice to deny 
  the appellant a trial on the merits. His guilty plea was entered with an honest 
  belief that the consequences were settled. Words to the contrary in court can 
  be discounted as being, from the appellant's point of view, part of the ritual.</p>
<p>
  [8] We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the verdicts and sentences, and 
  direct a new trial.</p>
