<p>On appeal from the order of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 10, 2001.</p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This appeal from an Order of Farley J. concerns the application of legal 
  and equitable set-off in the context of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended. On April 23, 2001, the respondent Algoma 
  Steel Inc. obtained an initial order under the CCAA. At that time, Algoma was 
  indebted to the appellant Union Gas Limited under two contracts (the 2000 contracts) 
  for gas services in March and April of 2001 amounting to just under $2 million. 
  At the same time, Algoma was entitled to a rebate from Union of approximately 
  $2.2 million plus interest as a result of an overpayment for gas services in 
  1999. Union sought to set off amounts owed to it by Algoma against the 1999 
  rebate. The motions judge held that Union had not established a claim for legal 
  set-off. He held that Union had made out a claim for an equitable set-off but 
  only in relation to one of the contracts in the amount of $461,244. Because 
  of various orders made in the CCAA proceedings this means that Union must pay 
  the entire amount of the 1999 rebate less the $461,244 and is not entitled to 
  payment of $1,265,934 owed to it under the 2000 contract. Union submits that 
  the motions judge erred in refusing to allow legal set-off and, in the alternative, 
  erred in limiting the scope of equitable set-off.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] In my view, the motions judge did not err with respect to legal set-off 
  but did err with respect to equitable set-off. Accordingly, I would allow the 
  appeal with costs.<br>
</p>
<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p>The relationship between Algoma and Union<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The facts are based entirely upon affidavits filed by two employees of 
  Union. Algoma filed no affidavits and did not cross-examine the Union employees. 
  I begin with a summary of the facts that lead to Algoma's entitlement to the 
  $2.2 million rebate. In 1999, Algoma obtained gas on a buy/sell arrangement 
  under which Algoma bought natural gas from a resource supplier (presumably in 
  Western Canada) and sold the gas to Union. Union arranged for the transportation 
  of the gas on its own account and then sold the gas back to Algoma in Ontario 
  when it was needed. In 1999, the relationship between Union and Algoma was governed 
  by a contract commencing November 1, 1998 and terminating on October 31, 1999. 
  This contract was subject to automatic renewal for successive one-year periods. 
  <a href="#1">1</a><a name="r1"></a><br>
</p>
<p>[4] Under the 1998 contract, Algoma was required to pay for the gas services 
  in accordance with Union's rate schedule as approved by the Ontario Energy Board. 
  These rates are based on many factors including projected costs of gas. If those 
  projections are found to be either too high or too low following the end of 
  a calendar year, Algoma may have either overpaid or underpaid Union. To track 
  actual costs with projected costs, Union established deferral accounts for the 
  various classes of customers. Algoma is in a Rate 100 class. As it happened, 
  in 1999, Algoma and the other Rate 100 customers overpaid and were entitled 
  to a rebate. However, Union could not repay its customers without approval from 
  the Board. Union therefore made an application to the Board in which it proposed 
  to pay the rebates to the customers. The total rebate for the Rate 100 class 
  is just under $4 million. According to the affidavit of the Union employee, 
  Algoma's share of the rebate &quot;approximates $2.2 million&quot;. Algoma is 
  also entitled to interest on the rebate accruing from January 1, 2000 at a rate 
  set by the Board.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In its July 21, 2001 decision, the Board approved Union's proposal. But 
  instead of authorizing immediate payment, the Board directed Union to bring 
  forward the balances in all of the year 2000 deferral accounts for review. In 
  a further decision dated October 16, 2001, the Board directed Union to continue 
  to hold the balances in the deferral accounts until the 2001 and 2002 rates 
  are implemented and 2000 and 2001 deferral balances are disposed of. According 
  to the Union employee's affidavit, this will not affect Algoma's rebate because 
  it is not entitled to share in the 2000 and 2001 deferral accounts. By the time 
  of the hearing before the motions judge, the Board had not yet indicated when 
  Union could pay the rebate to its customers, including Algoma.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] I will now deal with the contracts that governed the Union/Algoma relationship 
  when the CCAA orders were made. In 2000, Algoma changed its relationship with 
  Union so that it no longer had a buy-sell arrangement. In October 2000, the 
  parties entered into two new contracts. These contracts may conveniently be 
  referred to as the 2000 gas services contract and the assignment agreement. 
  Both contracts covered almost the same period; from November 1, 2000 to October 
  31, 2001 for the 2000 gas services contract and November 1, 2000 to November 
  1, 2001 for the assignment agreement. As a result of the new arrangement, Algoma 
  no longer sold the gas to Union and repurchased it from Union in Ontario. Rather, 
  Union assigned its right to access gas transportation capacity directly from 
  TransCanada Pipelines Limited (&quot;TCPL&quot;) through Union's contract with 
  TCPL. Algoma thus paid TCPL directly. Importantly, however, if Algoma failed 
  to pay TCPL for use of gas transportation capacity being accessed by it, Union 
  was required to pay TCPL. Algoma was then required to indemnify Union.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Under the 2000 gas services contract, Union continued to transport the 
  gas from Union's metering station at the TCPL pipeline to the Algoma plant. 
  That contract included this term:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This agreement is contingent upon the TCPL Assignment 
  Agreement which is attached as Schedule D and forms an integral part of this 
  arrangement. In the event either of these agreements terminate, the other agreement 
  shall also terminate, unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] As of the April 23, 2001 CCAA order, Algoma owed Union $461,244 under the 
  2000 gas services contract. Further, because Algoma failed to pay TCPL for gas 
  transportation services obtained by Algoma under the assignment agreement, Union 
  was obliged to indemnify TCPL in the amount of $1,265,934. It is these two amounts 
  that Union seeks to set off against the 1999 rebate. As indicated, the motions 
  judge only allowed Union to set off the former amount.<br>
</p>
<p>The CCAA Proceedings<br>
</p>
<p>[9] On April 23, 2001, Algoma obtained an initial order under the CCAA. As 
  part of that order, the right of any claimant to assert, enforce or exercise 
  any right of set-off or consolidation of accounts was stayed during the stay 
  period. On November 9, 2001, while the stay period was still in force, Algoma 
  obtained an order to authorize meetings of its creditors to consider its Plan 
  of Arrangement, to establish a process for proving claims and for the subsequent 
  barring of those claims in return for participating in the Plan. Under this 
  order, an unsecured creditor that had not filed a proof of claim was deemed 
  to have filed one in the amount as valued by Algoma. The creditor was then barred 
  from making or enforcing any such deemed claim after December 12, 2001. Union 
  did not file a proof of claim since it took the view that there was no net balance 
  due from Algoma to Union once the 1999 rebate was factored in. Algoma denied 
  that Union was entitled to a set-off and deemed Union's claim to be in the amounts 
  of $461,244 and $1,265,934.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] As a result, on November 27, 2001, Union moved before Farley J. for a 
  declaration that its rights of set-off referable to its dealings with Algoma 
  up to April 23, 2001 were not affected by the CCAA proceedings. In this way, 
  it sought to prevent its claims from being deemed to have been the subject of 
  a proof of claim and then deemed to have been barred after December 12, 2001. 
  Union relied upon s. 18.1 of the CCAA, which preserves rights of set-off. I 
  will set out that section in full below.<br>
</p>
<p>THE REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The motions judge noted that a condition for application of legal set-off 
  is that the obligations must be debts, in the sense that they are liquidated 
  amounts. After reviewing the Board rulings and various letters by Union to Algoma, 
  the motions judge concluded that the 1999 rebate was not a liquidated amount. 
  He noted that in the Union employee's affidavit the rebate &quot;approximates 
  $2.2 million&quot;. Further communications between Union and its Rate 100 customers 
  suggested that there might not even be a rebate, depending on the decision of 
  the Board. He therefore held that legal set-off had not been made out.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] As to equitable set-off, the motions judge held that the 2000 gas services 
  contract was in substance a continuation of the 1998 contract. He concluded 
  that there was a &quot;close connection sufficient to ground equitable set-off 
  as to the gas supply portion of the October 15, 2000 Agreement vis-&agrave;-vis 
  any rebate which is authorized by the Board, but not any monies owing by Algoma 
  to Union as a result of the November 1, 2000 Transportation Agreement.&quot; 
  He therefore limited the equitable set-off as indicated above.<br>
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>General Principles<br>
</p>
<p>[13] Algoma does not dispute that the law of set-off applies notwithstanding 
  the CCAA proceedings. Section 18.1 of the Act makes this clear:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The law of set-off applies to all claims made against 
  a debtor company and to all actions instituted by it for the recovery of debts 
  due to the company in the same manner and to the same extent as if the company 
  were plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Algoma does, however, submit that set-off claims should be carefully scrutinized 
  where CCAA proceedings are underway because the effect is to give preference 
  to certain creditors. As Rowles J.A. said in Cam-Net Communications v. Vancouver 
  Telephone Co. (1999), 71 B.C.L.R. (3d) 226 (C.A.) at 235:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Using, or rather misusing, the law of set-off is one 
  example of how persons with a claim against the company in reorganization might 
  attempt to escape the CCAA compromise. A party claiming set-off &#133; realizes 
  its claim on a dollar-for-dollar basis while other creditors, who participated 
  in the CCAA proceedings, have their claims reduced substantially. For this reason, 
  the legislative intent animating the CCAA reorganization regime requires that 
  courts remain vigilant to claims of set-off in the reorganization context.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] I accept this principle, but I do not see it as a concern in this case. 
  Union operates within a highly regulated regime and the disposition of the rebate 
  is subject to scrutiny by a specialized tribunal. The amounts owing by Algoma 
  to Union are not in doubt.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] There was some dispute between the parties about the standard of review 
  by this court of the decision of the motions judge. Counsel for Union seemed 
  to suggest that because there is no right of appeal in CCAA proceedings and 
  appeals are relatively rare, it was open to this court to review the decision 
  of the motions judge on a standard of correctness even where that decision turned 
  on findings of fact and inferences to be drawn from those facts. In my view, 
  the usual standard of review in appeal proceedings applies and this court is 
  required to give deference to the findings of the motions judge even where, 
  as here, the decision is based on a paper record. The fact that there is no 
  right of appeal and the appeal is only with leave under s. 13 of the Act only 
  reinforces that conclusion. Decisions in the CCAA context must often be made 
  quickly. They are, as in this case, usually made by a judge with considerable 
  expertise in the area who has been managing the CCAA proceedings and is intimately 
  familiar with the context and the issues at stake. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] This court and the Supreme Court of Canada have variously described the 
  standard of appellate review. In Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton 
  Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at 336, Laskin J.A. wrote as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, although the entire record before a trial 
  judge or a motion judge consists of documentary or written evidence, as it does 
  in this case, the judge's factual findings are entitled to deference on appeal. 
  What standard of deference applies in such a case? It is not easy to articulate 
  a standard less deferential than &quot;manifest error&quot; but falling short 
  of &quot;correctness&quot;. I suggest that it may simply be a matter of weight 
  or emphasis, or that, plausibly, a uniform standard of appellate review should 
  be applied to a trial judge's findings of fact, whether the evidence is entirely 
  oral, entirely documentary or, more typically, a combination of the two.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">What is important for this appeal is the kind of error 
  that justifies intervention by an appellate court. An error of law obviously 
  justifies intervention. An appellate court may interfere with a finding of fact 
  if the trial judge or motion judge disregarded, misapprehended, or failed to 
  appreciate relevant evidence, made a finding not reasonably supported by the 
  evidence, or drew an unreasonable inference from the evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] More recently the Supreme Court in Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 577, discussed at some length the standard of appellate review where the 
  appellate court is called upon to review inferences from facts. The court concluded 
  that the standard is one of considerable deference. Iacobucci and Major JJ. 
  described the standard at para. 23 as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We reiterate that it is not the role of appellate 
  courts to second-guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence. 
  If there is no palpable and overriding error with respect to the underlying 
  facts that the trial judge relies on to draw the inference, then it is only 
  where the inference-drawing process itself is palpably in error that an appellate 
  court can interfere with the factual conclusion. The appellate court is not 
  free to interfere with a factual conclusion that it disagrees with where such 
  disagreement stems from a difference of opinion over the weight to be assigned 
  to the underlying facts [emphasis added].<br>
  </p> 
  
<p>[19] On the other hand, where the issue concerns application of a legal standard 
  to a set of facts the question is one of mixed fact and law and a somewhat less 
  deferential standard may be appropriate, although not the standard of correctness 
  required for questions of law. This was described as follows at para. 28:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">However, where the error does not amount to an error of law, a higher standard 
  is mandated. Where the trier of fact has considered all the evidence that the 
  law requires him or her to consider and still comes to the wrong conclusion, 
  then this amounts to an error of mixed law and fact and is subject to a more 
  stringent standard of review: Southam, supra, at paras. 41 and 45. While easy 
  to state, this distinction can be difficult in practice because matters of mixed 
  law and fact fall along a spectrum of particularity. This difficulty was pointed 
  out in Southam, supra, at para. 37:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent20">... the matrices of facts at issue in some cases are so particular, 
  indeed so unique, that decisions about whether they satisfy legal tests do not 
  have any great precedential value. If a court were to decide that driving at 
  a certain speed on a certain road under certain conditions was negligent, its 
  decision would not have any great value as a precedent. In short, as the level 
  of generality of the challenged proposition approaches utter particularity, 
  the matter approaches pure application, and hence draws nigh to being an unqualified 
  question of mixed law and fact. See R. P. Kerans, Standards of Review Employed 
  by Appellate Courts (1994), at pp. 103-108. Of course, it is not easy to say 
  precisely where the line should be drawn; though in most cases it should be 
  sufficiently clear whether the dispute is over a general proposition that might 
  qualify as a principle of law or over a very particular set of circumstances 
  that is not apt to be of much interest to judges and lawyers in the future [emphasis 
  added].<br>
</p>
<p>[20] It seems to me that this appeal concerns both inferences from facts and 
  a question of mixed fact and law. The motions judge's decision about the application 
  of legal set-off turned exclusively on the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed 
  facts in the affidavits. His decision that Union had not shown the rebate as 
  a debt was fact specific. Although Union argues that the motions judge overlooked 
  important facts and misapprehended certain facts, I am not persuaded that the 
  motions judge made any palpable or overriding error. To the contrary, I am satisfied 
  that his decision is supported by the evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] The decision about equitable set-off is somewhat different since it involves 
  application of a legal standard to a set of facts. As such, it is a question 
  of mixed law and fact. While the assessment by the motions judge is entitled 
  to deference, I am nevertheless of the view that the motions judge erred in 
  his application of the test for equitable set-off to these particular facts.<br>
</p>
<p>Legal Set-Off<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Section 111 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 provides 
  the statutory framework for legal set-off. Subsections (1) and (2) provide:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In an action for payment of a debt, the defendant 
  may, by way of defence, claim the right to set off against the plaintiff's claim 
  a debt owed by the plaintiff to the defendant.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Mutual debts may be set off against each other even 
  if they are of a different nature.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The only question on the application of legal set-off in this case was 
  whether the rebate was a debt for the purpose of s. 111. Union accepts that 
  debt means a liquidated sum and argues that the rebate is a liquidated sum because 
  the amount is ascertainable and, save for interest, can neither increase nor 
  decrease. Union submits that the amount is ascertainable and fixed because the 
  Board has accepted its proposal for calculating the amount of the rebate. It 
  also relies on the affidavit evidence that Algoma's share of the rebate for 
  Rate 100 customers will be unaffected by the adjustments for the years 2000 
  and 2001 deferral accounts.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] The motions judge, however, was not prepared to draw that inference from 
  the affidavit evidence. He relied upon the fact that Union only provided an 
  estimate of the rebate and his reading of the Board decisions that did not explicitly 
  state that Algoma or any of the other customers would receive a rebate. He also 
  relied upon Union's own communications to its Rate 100 customers that suggested 
  the amount of the rebate was not fixed. In his submissions, counsel for Algoma 
  pointed out a number of facts upon which the decision by the motions judge could 
  rest and that could support the inferences drawn. Counsel pointed out that to 
  overturn the decision of the motions judge, this court would have to be satisfied 
  of the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) That it was appropriate to sever off the interest 
  part of the rebate, since the rate had not yet been set by the Board.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) That no significance should be attached to the use 
  of the term &quot;approximate&quot; in the Union employee's description of the 
  amount of the rebate.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) That no significance should be attached to the fact 
  that Union had not provided an exact figure for the amount of the rebate.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) That the communications by Union to Algoma and its 
  other customers concerning the uncertainty of the amount of the rebate had no 
  significance.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) That there is no significance to the fact that the 
  Board continues to prevent Union from releasing the rebate to Algoma; put another 
  way, that the Board has no good reason for holding up disposition of the rebate.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(6) That the amounts of the rebates cannot change as 
  a result of events in 2002.</p>
  
<p>[25] I am not prepared to say that the motions judge's decision disclosed a 
  palpable and overriding error. Since his decision is supported by the evidence, 
  the evidence supplied by Union itself, this aspect of the appeal must be dismissed.<br>
</p>
<p>Equitable Set-Off<br>
</p>
<p>[26] Equitable set-off is available where there is a claim for a sum whether 
  liquidated or unliquidated. In Telford v. Holt (1987), 41 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.) 
  at 398-99, Wilson J., speaking for the court, approved a statement of the applicable 
  principles for equitable set-off found in Coba Industries Ltd. v. Millie's Holdings 
  (Canada) Ltd. (1985), 20 D.L.R. (4th) 689 (B.C.C.A.) at 696-97. Those principles 
  can be summarized as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. The party relying on a set-off must show some equitable ground for being 
  protected against the adversary's demands.<br>
  2. The equitable ground must go to the very root of the plaintiff's claim.<br>
  3. A cross-claim must be so clearly connected with the demand of the plaintiff 
  that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment 
  without taking into consideration the cross-claim.<br>
  4. The plaintiff's claim and the cross-claim need not arise out of the same 
  contract.<br>
  5. Unliquidated claims are on the same footing as liquidated claims.<br>

<p>[27] In one way or another the first three principles, but particularly the 
  third, are in issue in this case. Put shortly, is the 1999 rebate from the 1998 
  gas services contract so clearly connected with the amounts owing under the 
  2000 assignment agreement that it would be manifestly unjust to enforce payment 
  of the rebate without taking into account the amounts owing under the assignment 
  agreement? The motions judge recognized that the assignment agreement was integral 
  to the 2000 gas services agreement, but he refused equitable set-off for the 
  amounts owing under the assignment agreement because it was not the same type 
  of contract as the supply of gas by Union. In my view, this was not a sufficient 
  reason to refuse equitable set-off given the interrelationship between the two 
  2000 agreements.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] Kelly R. Palmer in The Law of Set-Off in Canada (1993) traces the evolution 
  of the doctrine of equitable set-off from a very strict test in which the &quot;claim 
  raised in set-off had to impeach the title of the plaintiff's claim&quot; [at 
  p. 89] to a somewhat more flexible approach based upon fairness. The leading 
  cases describing, in some fashion, the more modern test are Coba Industries; 
  Telford and Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Molena Alpha Inc., 
  [1978] 3 All E.R. 1066 (C.A.) [affirmed on other grounds at [1979] A.C. 757 
  (H.L.)].<br>
</p>
<p>[29] It seems to me that a very helpful test is set out in a passage from the 
  reasons of Lord Denning in Federal Commerce at p. 1078 and which was quoted 
  with apparent approval by Wilson J. in Telford at p. 400:<br>
  We have to ask ourselves: what should we do now so as to ensure fair dealing 
  between the parties? &#133; This question must be asked in each case as it arises 
  for decision; and then, from case to case, we shall build up a series of precedents 
  to guide those who come after us. But one thing is quite clear: it is not every 
  cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only cross-claims that arise out of 
  the same transaction or are closely connected with it. And it is only cross-claims 
  which go directly to impeach the plaintiff's demands, that is, so closely connected 
  with his demands that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce 
  payment without taking into account the cross-claim [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[30] In my view, there is such a close connection between the 2000 gas services 
  contract and the 2000 assignment agreement, that the amounts owing on them cannot 
  be severed for the purposes of equitable set-off. The assignment agreement is 
  attached as a schedule to the 2000 gas services contract and in the event either 
  of the agreements terminates, the other terminates, unless otherwise agreed 
  to by the parties. The parties agreed in the 2000 gas services contract that 
  it was &quot;contingent upon&quot; the assignment agreement and that the latter 
  formed an integral part of the latter. Accepting the correctness of the motion 
  judge's determination that the 1998 and 2000 gas services contracts exhibit 
  a sufficient degree of connection to justify equitable set-off, it seems to 
  me that it would be manifestly unjust to allow Algoma to insist on payment of 
  the rebate arising under the former without allowing Union to set-off all the 
  amounts owing under the 2000 arrangement. <br>
</p>
  <p>[31] The relationship between the parties under the 2000 contracts is different 
  than the relationship under the 1998 contract but they are in a sense nothing 
  more than a successor arrangement to accomplish what had been done under the 
  1998 contract. Admittedly, under the 2000 assignment agreement, the underlying 
  relationship was between TCPL and Union. Union only became entitled to collect 
  from Algoma because Algoma failed to pay the charges that TCPL was entitled 
  to collect from Union. Under the agreement, Algoma agreed to indemnify Union 
  in those circumstances. However, there is a close connection between the 1998 
  contract and both of the 2000 contracts because they all, in one way or another, 
  facilitate the supply of gas to Algoma. <br>
</p>
<p>[32] A helpful example is Coba Industries, which was approved by Wilson J. 
  in Telford. Palmer describes the facts of Coba Industries at p. 133 of his text:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Hp entered a sale and leaseback of property with the 
  defendant, in the course of which Hp obtained a second mortgage over the property 
  and granted a lease to the defendant. The lease payments were calculated to 
  be sufficient to cover the mortgage payments. Hp assigned the mortgage to the 
  plaintiff who notified the assignment to the defendant. When Hp fell into arrears 
  on the lease, the defendant ceased making mortgage payments. The plaintiff sued 
  for foreclosure, and was met with a claim for set-off.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Macfarlane J.A., writing for the court in Coba Industries, found several 
  facts that established the close connection necessary for equitable set-off. 
  He wrote at p. 700:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I think this evidence demonstrates that, from the outset, 
  it was at the heart of any liability on the part of [the defendant] that [Hp] 
  provide and assure payments under the leases sufficient to satisfy payments 
  from time to time under both mortgages.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] The 1998 contract and 2000 agreements exhibit this kind of connection. 
  Given that the motions judge found that it would be manifestly unjust not to 
  permit Union to set off the amounts owing on the 2000 gas services contract, 
  I conclude that it would be manifestly unjust to allow Algoma to enforce payment 
  of the 2000 rebate without taking into account its liability to Union under 
  the assignment agreement, which formed an integral part of the arrangement between 
  the parties.<br>
</p>
<p>DISPOSITION<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with costs on a partial indemnity 
  basis. In accordance with the written submissions of the parties, costs are 
  fixed at $33,111.29.</p>
