<p>On appeal from the judgment of Backhouse J. dated December 21, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal is about the propriety of an indeterminate order for spousal 
  support in circumstances where the spouse receiving the support, while suffering 
  economic disadvantage arising from the marriage, is nonetheless alleged to be 
  &quot;self-sufficient&quot; within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c. 3.</P>   <P>
  [2] The appellant, Normand Allaire, and the respondent, Suzanne Allaire, married 
  in Cornwall in July 1972. There are three children of the marriage: Justin, 
  aged 20, Stephanie, aged 18, and Christiane, aged 15. The parties separated 
  in 1996 but both continued to reside in the matrimonial home until it was sold 
  in October 1997. The petition for divorce was served by Suzanne Allaire on August 
  21, 1999.</P>   <P>
  [3] On the eve of trial, the parties were able to resolve the amount of the 
  equalization payment and custody of the youngest of their three children, Christiane, 
  who lives with her mother. The two older children live with their father. </P>   <P>
  [4] When the parties were married, Mr. Allaire was employed as a funeral home 
  director and his wife was employed as a lab technologist. Neither had a university 
  degree. In 1974, the parties moved from Cornwall to Toronto so that Mr. Allaire 
  could pursue a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Toronto. He received 
  his Bachelor of Science degree in 1978 and a Masters degree in Health Administration 
  in 1980. </P>   <P>
  [5] Upon completing his Masters degree, the appellant commenced a career as 
  a hospital administrator. At the time of trial, he was employed as the President 
  and Chief Executive Officer of the Runnymede Chronic Care Hospital. His income 
  in this position between 1999 and 2001 varied from $207,721 in 1999 to $176,689 
  in 2001.</P>   <P>
  [6] Ms. Allaire testified that she too had hoped to pursue a Bachelor of Science 
  degree at the beginning of the marriage, but instead agreed to work full time 
  when concern arose about the reduced standard of living that would result from 
  neither spouse earning a full time income. Her evidence was that she was unhappy 
  with this arrangement, but accepted it nevertheless. </P>   <P>
  [7] As a result of this arrangement, Ms. Allaire was the primary source of income 
  during her husband's six years of full time university studies. She was first 
  employed at Scarborough General Hospital and, in 1975, started working with 
  the Michener Institute, where she has been employed ever since. She has also 
  taught evening and correspondence courses during this period. </P>   <P>
  [8] By the time Mr. Allaire concluded his Masters degree and began earning a 
  full time income, Ms. Allaire had already given birth to their first child, 
  and the parties decided to continue to build a family. As a result, Ms. Allaire 
  never did commence full time university studies during the marriage, although 
  she completed four university courses while the children were young and continued 
  to work full time. She also completed a diploma program as a requirement of 
  her employment at the Michener Institute. </P>   <P>
  [9] In 1999, Ms. Allaire commenced studies toward a Masters in a health science 
  management program, which she expects to complete in June 2003. Her employer 
  has provided her with a combination of unpaid leave and sabbatical throughout 
  this program. Prior to commencing these studies, she had attained the position 
  of coordinator of her programme at the Michener Institute. Her employer testified 
  that Ms. Allaire risked demotion from the position of coordinator if she did 
  not obtain a university degree. Her income as coordinator has ranged from $52,544 
  to $61,687 during the years between 1998 and 2002, and there is an expectation 
  that her income will increase to $68,793 when she completes her Masters degree.</P>   <P>
  [10] Ms. Allaire received an equalization payment plus one half of the sale 
  proceeds from the matrimonial home, approximating $243,000. She used some of 
  her proceeds to purchase a car, for legal expenses and for living expenses. 
  With the balance of the proceeds, she purchased a new home. Her mortgage was 
  $32,000 at the time of trial. </P>   <P>
  [11] Mr. Allaire received approximately $95,000 from the sale of the matrimonial 
  home as well as two bank accounts, two cars, a boat, his pension and RRSP assets. 
  He purchased a home prior to the sale of the matrimonial home which he financed 
  with a mortgage that had been reduced to $36,000 at the time of trial. By the 
  time of trial, while the parties' mortgages were approximately the same amount, 
  Ms. Allaire had eroded her savings and had a debt of $33,000 on a line of credit. 
  There is no evidence that Mr. Allaire had any debt aside from his mortgage.</P>   <P>
  [12] The wife's application for spousal support was commenced in August 1999. 
  No spousal support was paid since separation. No child support was paid prior 
  to March of 2000 when Mr. Allaire was ordered to make interim payments in the 
  monthly amount of $377 for the support of the youngest daughter.</P>   <P>
  The Trial </P>   <P>
  [13] For the purposes of determining child support, the trial judge fixed the 
  income of Mr. Allaire at $189,353 after averaging his last three years of income 
  in accordance with s. 17(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175. 
  The trial judge fixed Ms. Allaire's income at $54,674. On the basis of these 
  figures, the trial judge ordered Ms. Allaire to pay her husband $750 monthly 
  for the support of Justin and Stephanie, and ordered Mr. Allaire to pay $1,357 
  to his wife for the support of Christiane, resulting in a net child support 
  payment to Ms. Allaire of $607.</P>   <P>
  [14] Ms. Allaire concedes that the trial judge erred in failing to include in 
  her income a stipend of $2,019 and bonus of $1,000 for the purpose of calculating 
  child support. As a result, her child support obligation for the two older children 
  should be adjusted to $795 per month, resulting in a monthly payment to her 
  of $572.</P>   <P>
  [15] The trial judge ordered Mr. Allaire to pay his wife $2,500 monthly in compensatory 
  spousal support, based on her projected income of $68,000. The trial judge based 
  this award on the economic hardship faced by the respondent as a result of the 
  breakdown of the marriage, as well as the adverse impact of the marriage on 
  her career and earning capacity. On the latter point, the trial judge found 
  that &quot;[t]he disparity in the economic advantages received by the spouses 
  in the marriage is reflected in the differences in their education and respective 
  incomes&quot; and that Ms. Allaire &quot;&#133;did not have the same opportunities 
  to enhance her qualifications as her husband did.&quot; The trial judge declined 
  to place a time limit on the spousal support award.</P>   <P>
  [16] The trial judge also ordered Mr. Allaire to pay $35,000 for retroactive 
  spousal and child support. </P>   <P>
  Issues</P>   <P>
  [17] The appellant raised three grounds of appeal. Firstly, Mr. Allaire quarrels 
  with the quantum of the spousal support order, as well as the fact that no termination 
  date was fixed by the trial judge. Secondly, while he concedes that the trial 
  judge had jurisdiction to order lump sum retroactive child and spousal support, 
  Mr. Allaire takes issue with the quantum of the award. Thirdly, he argued that 
  the trial judge erred in averaging his income over the last three years, attributing 
  vacation pay he says he did not receive.</P>   <P>
  Spousal Support</P>   <P>
  [18] Mr. Allaire submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the breakdown 
  of the marriage resulted in economic disadvantage to the wife, arguing that 
  Ms. Allaire is economically self-sufficient and that the domestic arrangements 
  in place during the marriage enhanced her career and economic prospects, citing 
  Ms. Allaire's thirty years of tenure with her employer and her promotion to 
  coordinator of her programme. He also points to the fact that both parties were 
  able to advance their careers because their combined full time income of $250,000 
  permitted them to afford childcare. This, he states, means that theirs was not 
  a traditional marriage.</P>   <P>
  [19] These submissions do not accord with the findings of fact made by the trial 
  judge, and rest on a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes a traditional 
  marriage. The trial judge found that Ms. Allaire suffered economic disadvantage 
  as a result of the marriage. The record amply supports these findings of fact. 
  She postponed her ambitions early in the marriage in order to finance the appellant's 
  six years of university studies. The parties' desire to continue to build a 
  family after the appellant had concluded his university studies further delayed 
  her ability to earn a university degree. As a result of these arrangements, 
  she was unable to pursue career options that required a university degree. The 
  fact that she worked outside the home does not make her reduced economic choices 
  any less &quot;traditional&quot;. Mr. Allaire, on the other hand, has enjoyed 
  significant economic advantages as a result of his ability to earn university 
  degrees early in the marriage.</P>   <P>
  [20] We see no error in the trial judge's award of compensatory spousal support 
  in the amount of $2,500 monthly. It is unproductive to analyze the facts based 
  on a concept of &quot;traditionalism&quot;. It is more appropriate to look at 
  what choices the spouses made and what the economic consequences of those choices 
  were. It is clear from the trial judge's reasons that the award is designed 
  not only to redress the economic consequences of the breakdown of the marriage, 
  but also to compensate Ms. Allaire for the likely permanent economic results 
  of having to postpone her post-secondary education. It is an amount that properly 
  seeks to adjust the economic disparity between the two households based on the 
  former joint standard of living. </P>   <P>
  [21] Mr. Allaire's submits that any disadvantages flowing from the marriage 
  must defer to the fact that Ms. Allaire now earns a reasonable income that makes 
  her &quot;self-sufficient&quot;. This ignores the reality that self-sufficiency 
  is not a free-standing concept. It must be seen in the context of the standard 
  of living previously enjoyed by the parties. Where, as here, the economic consequences 
  of the marital relationship were to permanently reduce Ms. Allaire's income, 
  it is inappropriate to consider Ms. Allaire's annual income of $68,000 as &quot;sufficient&quot; 
  without considering whether Mr. Allaire can financially assist her to live a 
  lifestyle closer to what they shared as a couple.</P>   <P>
  [22] For the same reason, the trial judge did not err in failing to apply a 
  time limit to the spousal support award. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated 
  in Bracklow v. Bracklow, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420 at para. 57, a result of the need 
  to balance the objectives set out in the Divorce Act is that there is no obvious 
  or inevitable cut-off date for a spousal support order. It is recognized that 
  in situations such as this, &quot;where a former spouse will continue to suffer 
  the economic disadvantages of the marriage and its dissolution while the other 
  spouse reaps its economic advantages&quot;, long-term compensatory support is 
  appropriate regardless of the self-sufficiency of the disadvantaged spouse: 
  Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L. 345 (S.C.C.), at 383. Where, as here, the award 
  is crafted to compensate Ms. Allaire for the long-term impact of the marriage 
  on her career advancement and earning capacity, the trial judge was within her 
  discretion in declining to limit her support to a defined period.</P>   <P>
  [23] Mr. Allaire also submits that the trial judge erred in averaging his income 
  for the years 1999 to 2001 (inclusive), arriving at a figure of $189,353 for 
  the purpose of calculating his child support obligation. He submits that the 
  trial judge erroneously included his non-recurring pay in lieu of vacation that 
  appeared in his 1999 income and that the more appropriate figure is $176,689. 
  We did not call on the respondent's counsel to respond to this submission. We 
  saw no error in this calculation and little merit in the husband's submission 
  that the amount of support should be based only on the last year, when he did 
  not take the usual vacation pay. The trial judge was entitled, on the evidence, 
  to conclude that as Chief Executive Officer, the husband was in a position to 
  determine whether he would take vacation pay in lieu of holidays, his usual 
  practice prior to his wife's filing her petition for divorce.</P>   <P>
  [24] Mr. Allaire concedes that the trial judge had jurisdiction to order a lump 
  sum payment for retroactive spousal and child support, but takes issue with 
  the lump sum amount of $35, 000. The parties had ceased living under the same 
  roof in October 1997 and the petition for divorce, which included an application 
  for interim spousal support, was served in August 1999. The appellant paid no 
  spousal support to the respondent from the date he left the matrimonial home 
  until the date of trial, and as a result, as previously noted, the respondent 
  has incurred a debt of $33,000 on a line of credit since the parties' separated 
  in order to cover legal costs and living expenses. </P>   <P>
  [25] Based on an award of $2,500 monthly in spousal support, Ms. Allaire was 
  theoretically entitled to $127,500 in retroactive support from the date her 
  husband left the matrimonial home to the time of trial. Rather than award this 
  amount, the trial judge ordered the more modest sum of $35,000, which compensates 
  the appellant for the debt she incurred for her expenses up to the trial. There 
  is no basis for interfering with this amount of retroactive support. </P>   <P>
  [26] Except for the adjustment to child support, we would dismiss the appeal. 
  In accordance with their request, the parties will have the opportunity to exchange 
  and file written submissions on costs by April 15, 2003.</P>
