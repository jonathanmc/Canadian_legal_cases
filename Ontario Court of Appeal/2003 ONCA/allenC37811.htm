<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Robert F. Scott of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated February 28, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals that portion of his sentence obliging him to make 
  monthly payments of $150 per month towards restitution as a condition of his 
  conditional sentence and probation. In addition, an order for restitution of 
  the principal amount of $5,400 was signed under s. 738 of the Code. </p>    <P>
  [2] Mr. Hicks argues that none of the other persons involved in this offence 
  had a restitution order made against them, that the restitution order, in addition 
  to the appellant's imprisonment, is unduly harsh, and that his client cannot 
  afford to make the payments. </p>    <P>
  [3] In our opinion the sentence was fit at the time it was imposed. The restitution 
  order of $5,400 is modest in comparison with the loss. On the issue of parity 
  of sentence, the appellant appears to have received substantially more money 
  from the fraud than the other persons involved with him and his breach was akin 
  to a breach of trust. The evidence on sentencing as to the appellant's income 
  was not supported by any independent evidence of his earnings. Moreover, the 
  trial judge did not accept that the appellant, a Class A mechanic, was earning 
  on commission an amount equivalent to less than $10 an hour. </p>    <P>
  [4] It is now almost two years since the sentencing. If the appellant is currently 
  unable to make the payments of $150 a month, as his counsel submits, he should 
  make an application to have the terms of his conditional sentence and probation 
  varied. Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
