<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John J. Cavarzan of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 5, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CATZMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  The appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] On the busiest retail shopping day of the year, a jewellery store in Ancaster 
  was robbed by two masked men, who made off with close to $170,000 in merchandise. 
  The stolen jewellery was never recovered. The store claimed against its insurer 
  for the amount of its loss. An endorsement to the insurance policy required 
  there to be surveillance cameras in the store, connected to a concealed videocassette 
  recorder. On the day of the robbery, the store's employee had inserted a videocassette 
  into the VCR but either failed to press the record button or, having pressed 
  it, failed to ensure that the machine had engaged and begun to record, with 
  the result that there was no video record of the robbery. Relying on the terms 
  of the endorsement, the insurance company denied coverage. </p>
<p>
  [2] The store sued. At trial, Cavarzan J. held that the store was precluded 
  from recovering because of the terms of the endorsement, and that it could not 
  rely on statutory provisions for relief from forfeiture of its right to indemnity 
  under the policy. His decision is now reported: (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 112. This 
  is an appeal from that decision.</p>
<p> The facts<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [3] Since 1996, Ancaster Jewellers Limited (Ancaster) had carried jewellers' 
  block insurance with Pafco Insurance Company (Pafco). The Declarations page 
  of the policy in force at the time of the robbery identified the Named Insured 
  as &quot;Ancaster Jewellers Limited (Herein called the Insured or the Named 
  Insured)&quot;. Like its predecessors, the policy contained a &quot;Warranties 
  Endorsement&quot;, to which reference appears below. </p>
<p>
  [4] Ancaster had in place four video cameras which provided total coverage of 
  the retail space in the jewellery store. The cameras were connected to a VCR 
  located in the basement of the store. Images seen by the cameras were recorded 
  on videotape when a videocassette was inserted into the VCR and the record button 
  was depressed. When that was done properly, two things confirmed that the VCR 
  was recording: first, the mechanism that advanced the videotape was heard to 
  engage and run; and second, a dimly lit blue circle appeared on the VCR display 
  panel.</p>
<p>
  [5] Ancaster employed two goldsmiths who had workshops both in the basement 
  and on the main floor. Both were instructed in the proper operation of the VCR 
  and both were told to check the VCR from time to time during the day when they 
  went to the basement work area to ensure that it was operating. Ancaster maintained 
  six videocassettes, one for each day of the week on which the store was open. 
  It was the responsibility of the goldsmith on duty at the time to go to the 
  VCR room, remove the previous day's videocassette, place it in a separate rewinding 
  machine, select the videocassette for the current day, insert it into the VCR 
  and press the &quot;record&quot; button to record that day's activities in the 
  retail sales area of the store.</p>
<p>
  [6] On Thursday, December 24th, 1998, the goldsmith on duty was Harvey Brown. 
  He arrived for work at 9:00 a.m. He went first to the ground floor workshop, 
  then to the basement to attend to the VCR. He removed the Wednesday tape and 
  replaced it with the Thursday tape. He testified that he heard the clicking 
  sound made by the VCR when the recording head moved into place. Believing that 
  the VCR was operating, he did not wait to observe the illumination of the blue 
  circle on the VCR display screen. </p>
<p>
  [7] About an hour after the store opened for business that day, two men, their 
  faces masked by balaclavas, entered the store and committed the robbery. The 
  robbery lasted three or four minutes, and the police arrived within one or two 
  minutes after it ended. Brown accompanied one of the investigating officers 
  to the VCR room, where they discovered that the VCR had not recorded the event. 
  The blue circle on the VCR display was not lit, there was no sound emanating 
  from the VCR to indicate that it was engaged and the tape in the machine, when 
  played, contained images from the previous Thursday and none from the day of 
  the robbery.</p>
<p>
  [8] Ancaster's claim for indemnity for its loss was rejected by Pafco, whose 
  president and chief executive officer wrote, in a letter to Ancaster's insurance 
  broker, that &quot;[t]he insured failed to implement a reasonably fail-safe 
  procedure to assure compliance with the policy conditions, upon which we provided 
  the coverage&quot;. No such position was asserted in Pafco's statement of defence 
  or relied upon by Pafco at trial or on the appeal to this court.</p>
<p>
  The findings of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge made the following findings: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) December 24th is Ancaster's busiest sales day of the year;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the store was properly equipped with the alarms, protective 
  devices, safes and vaults required by the warranties endorsement;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the store was equipped with surveillance cameras connected 
  to a concealed VCR, as required by the warranties endorsement;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the VCR was not recording at the time of the robbery;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) because the two robbers were wearing balaclavas, it would 
  not have been possible to identify their faces even if the VCR had been recording; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the reason the VCR was not &quot;switched on and in operation&quot; 
  (the words are taken from the warranties endorsement) was that Brown either 
  failed to press the record button or, having pressed it, failed to ensure that 
  the machine had engaged and had begun to record.</p>
<p>
  [10] Neither party to this appeal took issue with any of these findings.</p>
<p>
  The warranties endorsement</p>
<p>
  [11] I set out below the provisions of the warranties endorsement that are relevant 
  to the disposition of the appeal. For convenience, the full warranties endorsement 
  appears as an appendix at the end of these reasons.</p>
<p class="indent">NAME OF INSURED: ANCASTER JEWELLERS LIMITED</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> It is warranted and the Named Insured acknowledges and agrees 
  that it is a condition precedent to any right to recovery under this policy 
  that: </p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent">
  (C) PROTECTIVE DEVICES. The following described protective devices have been 
  installed at the location(s) insured as stated in section 2 and will be in proper 
  working order and will be operational at all times, insofar as is within the 
  Named Insured's control, when there are authorized personnel in the insured's 
  premises; and will be switched on and in operation: Two hold-up buttons, surveillance 
  cameras connected to concealed VCR recording on film. </p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent">
  The Named Insured warrants with [sic] each of the above conditions, and acknowledges 
  that any failure to comply with any or all of the foregoing conditions shall 
  cause the insured's right to recover indemnity to be forfeited and he shall 
  not be entitled to be paid any monies whatsoever pursuant to this policy.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge accepted as &quot;correct and unassailable&quot; Pafco's 
  submission that the words in the warranties endorsement that the VCR would &quot;be 
  switched on and in operation&quot; constituted a clear condition precedent to 
  any right of recovery under the policy. In his view, the installation of the 
  protective devices by the insured and the guarantee that they would be switched 
  on and in operation were material to the insurer's assessment of the risk. He 
  found no ambiguity in the wording of the policy and held that the phrase &quot;insofar 
  as is within the insured's [sic] control&quot; modified the words &quot;will 
  be in proper working order and will be operational at all times&quot;. He then 
  went on to say, at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If the protective devices are not &quot;switched on and in operation&quot;, 
  as I have found to be the case, then the risk has been altered by the insured 
  in breach of a condition precedent. Furthermore, it matters naught that the 
  failure was that of an employee of the named insured. The named insured as employer 
  is responsible in law for the failure or neglect of its employee [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  and, at para. 30: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is not open to the insured to assert that it has complied with its undertaking 
  by instituting a procedure which is usually effective, i.e. that it exerted 
  its best efforts to comply when it is within its control to ensure that the 
  equipment is in fact switched on and in operation [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [13] The words highlighted in these quotations from the trial judge's reasons 
  formed the basis of the principal argument on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [14] Ancaster's position was that the endorsement applied only to the Named 
  Insured, that Mr. Brown was not the Named Insured, and that the endorsement 
  did not apply to the circumstances of the robbery. In its submission, the Named 
  Insured - Ancaster - had instituted, insofar as was within its control, a reasonably 
  fail-safe procedure to ensure that the VCR and the recording system were switched 
  on and in operation, and the VCR's failure to operate on the day in question 
  was a matter of human error by Mr. Brown to which the Protective Devices clause 
  did not apply. </p>
<p>
  [15] Pafco acknowledged that the endorsement referred to the &quot;Named Insured&quot; 
  but, in its submission (and as the trial judge held), that phrase included employees 
  like Mr. Brown and the endorsement therefore applied to exclude Pafco's liability 
  to indemnify Ancaster for its loss. </p>
<p>
  [16] I respectfully agree with the position advanced by Ancaster.</p>
<p>
  [17] For purposes of analysis, the language of the Protective Devices clause 
  can be broken down into these components: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) &quot;The following described protective devices have been installed at 
  the location(s) insured as stated in section 2 &#133; &quot;</p>
<p>
  [18] There is no suggestion that the devices listed in the Protective Devices 
  clause were not installed at the location insured.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (2) &quot;&#133; and will be in proper working order and will be operational 
  at all times, insofar as is within the Named Insured's control, when there are 
  authorized personnel in the insured's premises &#133;&quot;</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge found that the phrase &quot;insofar as is within the Named 
  Insured's control&quot; modifies the words &quot;will be in proper working order 
  and will be operational at all times&quot;. However, immediately following the 
  words &quot;insofar as is within the Named Insured's control&quot;, there appear 
  the words &quot;when there are authorized personnel in the insured's premises&quot;. 
</p>
<p>
  [20] The reference to both &quot;Named Insured&quot; and &quot;authorized personnel&quot; 
  is significant. The juxtaposition of those expressions in the Protective Devices 
  clause recognizes the legal distinction between Ancaster as the Named Insured 
  and persons such as the goldsmith whose function it was to engage and monitor 
  the VCR. </p>
<p>
  [21] Pafco cannot rely upon every failure of the VCR to be &quot;in proper working 
  order and &#133; operational at all times&quot; to deny liability under the 
  policy. It can rely only on such failures as are within the Named Insured's 
  control. </p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge gave as examples of events not within Ancaster's control: 
  a sudden electrical power interruption, an unexpected mechanical breakdown or 
  the jamming of the videotape in the VCR. While I agree with these examples, 
  they do not exhaust the events that are not within the Named Insured's control. 
  Once Ancaster installs a reasonably fail-safe protective system and properly 
  instructs its employees in the operation and use of that system, it has met 
  its obligation as &quot;Named Insured&quot; under the &quot;Protective Devices&quot; 
  provision of the warranties endorsement. To hold Ancaster to a standard of perfection 
  that excludes the possibility of human error turns it into a guarantor and effectively 
  renders meaningless the qualifying phrase &quot;insofar as is within the Named 
  Insured's control&quot;. </p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) &quot;&#133; and will be switched on and in operation: Two hold-up buttons, 
  surveillance cameras connected to concealed VCR recording on film &#133;&quot;</p>
<p>
  [23] These added words, that follow the phrase &quot;when there are authorized 
  personnel in the insured's premises&quot;, are repetitive of the Named Insured's 
  obligation to install and maintain the required protective devices &quot;in 
  proper working order and &#133; operational at all times&quot;. They do not 
  impose on Ancaster any greater responsibility than the words that precede them. 
  So long as Ancaster discharges its obligation to install the required protective 
  devices and takes all reasonable steps to instruct its authorized personnel 
  in their use and operation, it has satisfied its obligation under the Protective 
  Devices clause and is not foreclosed by the terms of that clause from indemnity 
  for loss sustained in an armed robbery.</p>
<p>
  [24] It will be recalled that the trial judge found that it did not matter that 
  the VCR's failure to record on the day of the robbery was caused by the failure 
  of an employee of the named insured, because the named insured as employer was 
  responsible in law for the failure or neglect of its employees. The proposition 
  that an employer is responsible in law for acts of its employees is well known. 
  However, it does not apply where the parties to a policy of insurance have defined 
  their mutual rights and responsibilities in language which suggests a distinction 
  between employer and employee. </p>
<p>
  [25] The expressions &quot;Named Insured&quot; and &quot;authorized personnel&quot; 
  appear specifically and separately in a number of places in the warranties endorsement. 
  The expression &quot;Named Insured&quot; appears in the introductory words of 
  the endorsement, in each and every one of the four subjects to which the endorsement 
  applies (Inventory; Alarms; Protective Devices; and Safes and Vaults) and in 
  the closing words of the endorsement, by which the Named Insured &quot;warrants 
  with [sic] each of the above conditions, and acknowledges that any failure to 
  comply with any or all of the foregoing conditions shall cause the insured's 
  right to receive indemnity to be forfeited &#133;&quot;. The expression &quot;Authorized 
  personnel&quot; is found in three of the subjects to which the warranties endorsement 
  refers: Alarms; Protective Devices; and Safes and Vaults; indeed, in the references 
  to Alarms and Protective Devices, the two terms are found together in the same 
  sentence. </p>
<p>
  [26] I am fortified in my conclusion that the expression &quot;Named Insured&quot; 
  in the warranties endorsement did not extend to Mr. Brown's error by reference 
  to the policy of insurance itself. The policy took care, where Pafco thought 
  it significant, to differentiate between the Named Insured and its employees 
  and agents. The &quot;Perils Excluded&quot; section provides that the policy 
  does not insure loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by misappropriation, 
  secretion, conversion, infidelity or any dishonest act on the part of &quot;the 
  Named Insured or any other party of interest, employees, or agents of the Named 
  Insured or any person(s) to whom the property insured may be entrusted&quot;. 
  Similarly, the policy does not insure loss or damage caused by voluntary parting 
  with title &quot;by the Named Insured or its employees or agents&quot;. If the 
  expression &quot;Named Insured&quot; extended to agents and employees of Ancaster, 
  there would be no need to identify them separately in these provisions. The 
  inference is that, when Pafco referred in the policy to the &quot;Named Insured&quot;, 
  it meant Ancaster alone, not Ancaster's agents and employees. Conversely, the 
  failure of an employee to cause the VCR to engage as he had been instructed 
  to do and as he had done on many prior occasions did not constitute a violation 
  of the Named Insured's obligation under the warranties endorsement. </p>
<p>
  [27] I therefore conclude that the circumstances attendant upon the theft of 
  Ancaster's merchandise did not constitute a failure to comply with the Protective 
  Devices clause in the warranties endorsement. </p>
<p>
  [28] Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to deal with Ancaster's 
  further submissions in support of its appeal.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p> [29] I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judgment and in its place 
  grant judgment in favour of Ancaster for $169,900, prejudgment interest and 
  costs. Ancaster is entitled to its costs of this appeal, which I would fix in 
  the amount of $15,000, plus disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
