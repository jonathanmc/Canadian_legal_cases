<p>On appeal from the convictions entered on April 6, 2000 and sentences imposed 
  on May 12, 2000 by Justice Arthur Whealy of the Superior Court of Justice sitting 
  with a jury.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals his convictions on three counts of robbery, four counts 
  of wearing a disguise, one count of attempted robbery and one count of possession 
  of a weapon dangerous. He was tried by Justice Arthur Whealy of the Superior 
  Court of Justice sitting with a jury. He was found guilty on all charges on 
  April 6, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [2] On May 12, 2000, Justice Whealy sentenced the appellant to a total of four 
  years imprisonment. The appellant sought leave to appeal his sentences when 
  he filed his notice of appeal. However, at the time of argument of the appeal, 
  his counsel advised that the appellant was on parole and the sentence appeal 
  would not be pursued.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the appeal from the convictions, the appellant alleged that the trial 
  judge erred in his charge to the jury on similar fact evidence and in respect 
  to reasonable doubt and the burden of proof. He also alleged that the trial 
  judge failed to put the theory of the defence fairly to the jury.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [4] The circumstances giving rise to the robbery and wearing a disguise charges 
  involve three robberies of fast food deliverymen at an apartment building located 
  at 65 Dynevor Road in Toronto. The three robberies occurred on November 7, 9 
  and 16, 1998. The attempted robbery and weapon dangerous charges are alleged 
  to have occurred in the same apartment building on November 19, 1998. </p>
<p>
  [5] There was no direct evidence identifying the appellant as a participant 
  in the three robberies. In respect to the attempted robbery, the appellant was 
  arrested in the stairwell of the apartment building on Dynevor Road in circumstances 
  which the police suggested established that he was about to rob a fast food 
  deliveryman. </p>
<p>
  [6] At trial, evidence related to the three robberies and attempted robbery 
  was presented to the jury as similar fact evidence on the issue of identity 
  related to the robberies and on the issue of intent related to the attempted 
  robbery. The appellant accepted that the three robberies took place but maintained 
  that he had nothing to do with any of them. In connection with the attempted 
  robbery, the appellant denied that he was in the apartment building for the 
  purpose of carrying out the alleged crime. </p>
<p>
  The First Robbery, November 7, 1998</p>
<p>
  [7] On November 7, 1998, sometime after 6:00 p.m., Iouri Krivochei, a deliveryman 
  for Double Double Pizza, attended at 65 Dynevor Road to deliver a pizza to apartment 
  301. He was let into the building by a woman who appeared to be exiting the 
  building. Upon arrival at the third floor, as he left the elevator, he was met 
  by two men who were wearing handkerchiefs over their faces. One of the men was 
  taller than the other and was carrying a knife. Each of the two men was brown-skinned. 
  The taller man spoke with a Jamaican accent. </p>
<p>
  [8] The two men proceeded to jostle Mr. Krivochei and usher him towards the 
  stairwell. The taller man threatened Mr. Krivochei with the knife. They demanded 
  money and, upon searching his pockets and wallet, they stole $20.00. The two 
  men disappeared in the stairwell.</p>
<p>
  The Second Robbery, November 9, 1998</p>
<p>
  [9] On November 9, 1998, Erdal Yildiz, who was a deliveryman for 2-4-1 Pizza, 
  was directed to attend 65 Dynevor Road to deliver a pizza to apartment 401. 
  Sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. he rang the buzzer for the superintendent 
  as he had been advised to do. The superintendent let him into the building. 
  When he left the elevator on the fourth floor, he walked towards apartment 401 
  when he was met by a man with a handkerchief covering his face. The man was 
  carrying a knife. </p>
<p>
  [10] The man held the knife at the throat of Mr. Yildiz and took him to the 
  stairwell where a second man, also wearing a handkerchief over his face, emptied 
  his pockets and stole $400.00. The man with the knife was the taller of the 
  two men. Mr. Yildiz was able to discern from the areas of exposed skin of the 
  two men that they were black.</p>
<p>
  The Third Robbery, November 16, 1998</p>
<p>
  [11] On November 16, 1998, Abdulrozak Ebdulla, a deliveryman for Mr. Submarine, 
  received an order for apartment 301 at 65 Dynevor Road. He arrived at the building 
  at about 9:15 p.m. He was let into the building by a female who was in the lobby. 
  He took the elevator to the third floor. On exiting the elevator, he was met 
  by two men - each wearing a handkerchief mask over his face and each holding 
  a knife. They spoke with Jamaican accents and appeared to be black. One man 
  was taller than the other.</p>
<p>
  [12] The taller man held Mr. Ebdulla's hands behind his back and placed the 
  knife at his throat. The other man held his knife at Mr. Ebdulla's side. The 
  men took Mr. Ebdulla into the stairwell where they robbed him of $70.00. The 
  two men left and Mr. Ebdulla went to apartment 301 and was advised by the occupants 
  that they had not ordered any food. The police were then called.</p>
<p>
  The Attempted Robbery, November 19, 1998</p>
<p>
  [13] The police responded to the three robberies by conducting a surveillance 
  of 65 Dynevor Road on the evening of November 19, 1998. The surveillance operation 
  included five police officers.</p>
<p>
  [14] At about 8:00 p.m., Mr. Ahmed, a deliveryman for Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
  arrived at 65 Dynevor Road to make a delivery to apartment 301. He was let into 
  the building by a female who was standing at the entrance. As he attempted to 
  push the elevator button for the third floor, Mr. Ahmed was intercepted by a 
  police officer who took him to a vacant apartment on the eighth floor where 
  they met a second officer. He told the police officers that he was intending 
  to deliver Kentucky Fried Chicken to apartment 301. The other three officers, 
  who were conducting surveillance around the building, were advised of the situation 
  by radio.</p>
<p>
  [15] Two of the police officers then took the elevator to the third floor of 
  the apartment building. The other officers covered off the two stairwells of 
  the building. When the two police officers exited the elevator on the third 
  floor, they walked towards the west stairwell which was next to apartment 301. 
  One of the officers observed that the stairwell door was open about six to eight 
  inches. He observed a black man wearing a bandana over his face, looking out 
  of the door. The second police officer also observed the man, wearing a bandana 
  over his face, peering out of the stairwell door. He concluded from his exposed 
  skin that he was black. He also observed a larger man standing behind the man 
  looking out of the door.</p>
<p>
  [16] As the two officers approached the stairwell door, footsteps were heard 
  in the stairwell and someone was heard to say, &quot;Police, don't move.&quot; 
  When the door was opened they saw a third policeman, standing in the stairwell 
  between the third and fourth floors, pointing his gun at the appellant who was 
  at that time standing against the wall. The appellant was wearing a bandana 
  over his face and was holding a knife in his right hand. The appellant was approximately 
  6'3&quot; or 6'4&quot; in height. The appellant was forced to the ground and 
  placed under arrest for attempted robbery and, subsequently, the other charges. 
  The second suspect apparently fled the building before he could be arrested. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant testified at trial. Just days before November 19th, the appellant 
  had visited his mother in Brampton. While in Brampton, a friend, who lived at 
  65 Dynevor Road, invited him to visit with him and two females. His mother drove 
  him from Brampton and dropped him off at 65 Dynevor Road on November 19th. While 
  visiting his friend, he decided to go to a local store to purchase cigarettes 
  at about 7:45 p.m. He exited the building through the east stairwell door. When 
  he got outside, it was cold and he decided to return to the building to get 
  his jacket which also had his money in it. He began to walk towards the lobby 
  doors to gain access to the building when he passed the west stairwell door 
  which was open a crack. He therefore entered the west stairwell door and proceeded 
  to walk up the stairs when he was confronted by the police and arrested.</p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant testified that he was wearing a hat and a bandana around 
  his forehead. The bandana was not covering his face but came down over his face 
  when he fell to the ground during the encounter with the police. </p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant also testified that he had a knife with him. He explained 
  that when he went to Brampton to visit his mother, he took the knife with him 
  as protection in case he got into a confrontation with a certain group in the 
  Malton area who had harassed him in the past. The bus which he took to Brampton 
  stopped at a mall in Malton where &quot;all those guys hang out.&quot; He kept 
  the knife in his sock. It was not in his hand when he was arrested but may have 
  fallen out of his sock during the scuffle with the police.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES IN THE APPEAL FROM THE CONVICTIONS</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant raised the following issues in the appeal from the convictions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on the similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury on reasonable doubt 
  in accordance with the direction in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury by reversing the burden 
  of proof in respect to the defence.</p>
<p>(iv) The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury by taking away the theory 
  of the defence to the effect that there may have been multiple parties involved 
  in the three robberies.</p>
<p>
  (i) The Jury Charge on the Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant made two related submissions concerning the charge to the 
  jury on similar fact evidence. First, the appellant submitted that the general 
  principle developed by Cory, J. in R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339 at para. 70 
  &quot;that the jury should determine, on a balance of probabilities, whether 
  the similarities between the acts establishes that the [various] counts were 
  committed by the same person&quot; did not apply to the case at bar. Rather, 
  he submitted that the exception to the general principle articulated by Cory 
  J. applied in this case: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t is, of course, conceivable for a single item of circumstantial evidence 
  to be the only evidence of an essential element of the offence in a given case. 
  The criminal standard of proof would have to be applied in those circumstances 
  in order to ensure compliance with the requirement that every essential element 
  in a criminal prosecution must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus where 
  the Crown's case on the issue of identity is based entirely on the underlying 
  unity between the similar acts, it follows that the standard of proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt will govern the jury's determination of whether one person 
  must have committed both acts.</p>
<p>
  R. v. Arp, para. 73.</p>
<p>
  [22] The appellant submitted that the case at bar clearly falls within the exception 
  in Arp. The trial judge should have instructed the jury that on the threshold 
  question of whether the same person committed the similar acts, they should 
  apply the reasonable doubt standard. The appellant asserted that the exception 
  in Arp applied because proof of an essential element (the identity of the appellant 
  in the robberies) rested entirely on the underlying unity of the similar acts.</p>
<p>
  [23] Second, the appellant submitted that the charge diverted the jury from 
  the critical issue of the appellant's intent on the attempted robbery charge 
  and in effect took that issue away from the jury. The appellant's position was 
  that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that they had to first 
  decide whether the appellant was engaged in an attempted robbery at the time 
  of the arrest before such evidence could be employed as similar fact evidence 
  on the issue of identity related to the three robberies.</p>
<p>
  [24] It is apparent from the record that, at trial, the Crown relied upon the 
  similar fact evidence for two purposes. First and foremost, it relied on the 
  similar fact evidence to prove identity on the first three robberies. It submitted 
  that there were striking similarities between all four incidents sufficient 
  for the jury to find that the same two persons carried out the robberies. Since 
  there was evidence that the appellant was involved in the last incident, the 
  attempted robbery, the Crown argued that he was also one of the two persons 
  involved in the other three robberies.</p>
<p>
  [25] Second, the Crown relied upon the evidence of the first three robberies 
  to show that the appellant's presence on the final occasion was not innocent 
  but rather showed that he and his confederate had the intent to commit a robbery 
  on the last occasion and would have done so but for the intervention of the 
  police.</p>
<p>
  [26] The critical portions of the charge to the jury are the following. The 
  first relates to the question of identity. The second relates to the issue of 
  intent.</p>
<p>
  (i) So this is how you should approach the analysis. The first step is you look 
  at the manner and method - the methodology - what the movies call the modus 
  operandi - by which the offence in each case was carried out. You compare the 
  circumstances so that you can answer this question, is it likely, and I emphasize 
  that word likely, is it likely that the same persons carried out more than one 
  of the robberies, two of them, three of them, all four of them? Where you have 
  concluded that it is more likely than not, again, likely/ probable, that the 
  same persons carried out two or more of the robberies, you are entitled to use 
  all the evidence of those similar robberies to assist you in determining your 
  verdicts on each of them. And because your verdict on counts 4 to 9 turn on 
  the issue of identity, that is what you are looking for.</p>
<p>
  So if you reach this preliminary conclusion that it is likely or probable that 
  all robberies were committed by the same pair of persons, you go the second 
  step and ask yourself, well, is this accused person connected to any of them? 
  And the answer is, yes, he was arrested on the fourth occasion.</p>
<p>
  &#133;</p>
<p>
  (ii) Now Mr. Anderson testifies he had no intention on November 19, when he 
  was arrested, of committing a criminal offence. The burden is upon the Crown 
  of proving he did, beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering this pivotal issue 
  on Counts 1 to 3, that is his intention, you are permitted, depending on how 
  you have decided the identity issue concerning counts 4 to 9, to employ your 
  reasoning; further to the extent that if Anderson was probably a participant 
  in the earlier offences, then what could have been his purpose on the stairwell 
  at the time of his arrest? Does his explanation accord with what you already 
  decided? [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [27] I agree in part with the appellant's submissions. I will deal first with 
  the second issue of the similar fact evidence to prove the appellant's intent 
  on the charge of attempted robbery. In my view, this was a threshold issue before 
  any use could be made of similar fact evidence to prove identity. If the jury 
  was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the appellant's purpose in 
  being in the stairwell was to commit a robbery, that evidence was available 
  for use as similar fact evidence on the issue of identity in relation to the 
  first three robberies. On the other hand, if his intention was innocent, the 
  evidence was not available to use as similar fact evidence on the issue of identity 
  in relation to the first three robberies. Contrary to the trial judge's instructions 
  in the second passage set out above, the evidence of the other earlier robberies 
  was not available to prove the appellant's intent on the attempted robbery &quot;depending 
  on how you have decided the identity issue&quot;. That, with respect, reverses 
  the proper reasoning process. Similar fact evidence is only admissible to prove 
  intent where there is some nexus or connection between the similar acts and 
  the accused. See Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949 at 954: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Before evidence may be admitted as evidence of similar facts, there must be 
  a link between the allegedly similar facts and the accused. In other words there 
  must be some evidence upon which the trier of fact can make a proper finding 
  that the similar facts to be relied upon were in fact the acts of the accused 
  for it is clear that if they were not his own but those of another they have 
  no relevance to the matters at issue under the indictment.</p>
<p>
  [28] Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was some evidence connecting 
  the appellant to the three earlier robberies. He relies on the fact that the 
  appellant, like the perpetrators, was wearing a bandana and was in possession 
  of a knife, is similar in height to the taller robber, and was present at the 
  same location as the other robberies. As the passage from Sweitzer indicates, 
  there need only be some evidence upon which the trier of fact can make a proper 
  finding that the similar facts were in fact the acts of the accused. This is 
  a relatively low threshold. While, individually, the four factors relied upon 
  by the Crown would not be sufficient to meet the test in Sweitzer, cumulatively, 
  those items, in my view, are sufficient to constitute some evidence from which 
  the jury could find that the similar facts to be relied upon were in fact the 
  acts of the accused. However, that is an issue for the trier of fact. The trial 
  judge never properly directed the jury as to the reasoning process it would 
  have to follow to use that evidence. To the contrary, the jury could easily 
  have taken from the charge that the bare fact that the appellant was arrested 
  at the scene was sufficient to connect him with the earlier robberies.</p>
<p>
  [29] If the jury found that there was some evidence to connect the appellant 
  to the earlier robberies, that evidence was available to determine the appellant's 
  intent on the attempted robbery. However, the jury would have to be very carefully 
  instructed on the limited use of that evidence and the frailties of the evidence 
  connecting the appellant to the earlier robberies, including the lack of distinctiveness 
  of the knife, the bandana and the height of the perpetrator. If the appellant's 
  presence in the stairwell was innocent and unrelated to any robbery attempt, 
  the evidence had no probative value as proof of identity on the earlier three 
  robberies. </p>
<p>
  [30] If the jury did find that the appellant intended to commit robbery on the 
  last occasion, that evidence would be relevant to the question of identity on 
  the earlier three robberies. The jury would then have to be instructed in accordance 
  with the suggested instructions in R. v. Arp at para. 80: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) The trial judge should instruct the jury that they may find from the evidence, 
  though they are not required to do so, that the manner of the commission of 
  the offences is so similar that it is likely they were committed by the same 
  person.</p>
<p>
  (2) The judge should then review the similarities between the offences.</p>
<p>
  (3) The jury should then be instructed that if they conclude it is likely the 
  same person committed more than one of the offences, then the evidence on each 
  of those counts may assist them in deciding whether the accused committed the 
  other similar count or counts.</p>
<p>
  (4) The trial judge must instruct the jury that if it accepts the evidence of 
  the similar acts, it is relevant for the limited purpose for which it was admitted.</p>
<p>
  (5) The jury must be warned that they are not to use the evidence on one count 
  to infer that the accused is a person whose character or disposition is such 
  that he or she is likely to have committed the offence or offences charged in 
  the other count or counts.</p>
<p>
  (6) If they do not conclude that it is likely the same person committed the 
  similar offences, they must reach their verdict by considering the evidence 
  related to each count separately, and put out of their minds the evidence on 
  any other count or counts.</p>
<p>
  (7) Finally, the trial judge must of course make it clear that the accused must 
  not be convicted on any count unless the jury are satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that he or she is guilty of that offence.</p>
<p>
  [31] With respect to the appellant's first submission concerning the failure 
  to apply the exception in Arp, in my view there was no error. This was not a 
  case where the Crown's case on the issue of identity was based entirely on the 
  underlying unity between the similar acts. There was, as I have indicated above, 
  some other evidence to connect the appellant to the earlier robberies. </p>
<p>
  [32] The respondent argued that the curative proviso in s. 686(b)(iii) of the 
  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 should be applied if the court were to conclude 
  that the trial judge misdirected the jury with respect to the similar fact evidence. 
  I need not decide that issue since this misdirection does not stand alone. The 
  trial judge also misdirected the jury with respect to the definition of proof 
  beyond a reasonable doubt and on one other issue.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The Jury Charge on Reasonable Doubt</p>
<p>
  [33] The trial judge charged the jury in respect of the meaning of the presumption 
  of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I tell you as a matter of fundamental law that an accused person commences his 
  trial presumed to be innocent. And that presumption remains unless and until 
  the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the 
  charges. Now this is not some charity handed to this particular accused person. 
  This is a very basic principle of law that applies in all criminal cases in 
  Canada.</p>
<p>
  A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense which is derived 
  from the evidence that you have heard in this trial. A reasonable doubt is not 
  some imaginary or frivolous doubt conjured up in the mind of the timid juror 
  to avoid doing an unpleasant duty.</p>
<p>
  The standard of proof does not reach absolute certainty. Human beings are not 
  capable of that kind of precision. If your reasoning leads you to a logical 
  doubt that is, by definition, a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  If you are sure of the guilt of the accused on a particular count, then you 
  do not have a reasonable doubt about that count.</p>
<p>
  You should not test each bit or morsel of evidence against that standard. You 
  should consider all of the evidence, the totality of the evidence that you accept 
  and on that basis decide if the charge or charges have been proven.</p>
<p>
  In a criminal trial, there is no obligation on an accused person to prove anything. 
  In order for you to decide upon a verdict of guilt to any count, the prosecution 
  must persuade you beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  As in the case of Lifchus, there are other references to reasonable doubt in 
  the charge but the above excerpt is where the trial judge provides his basic 
  explanation of its meaning.</p>
<p>
  [34] The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear in R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 
  S.C.R. 144 at para. 237 that strict compliance with the direction in Lifchus 
  is not required. This is particularly so concerning pre Lifchus jury charges, 
  where an appellate court should be satisfied that there is substantial compliance 
  with the principles articulated by Cory J. in Lifchus. The case at bar is nearly 
  three years post Lifchus. It is my view that the charge to the jury on the meaning 
  of reasonable doubt was deficient. </p>
<p>
  [35] In respect to the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial 
  judge explained that such standard of proof does not reach absolute certainty. 
  However, he failed to tell the jury that the standard is higher than the balance 
  of probabilities which governs everyday decision making. As Iacoboucci J. recommended 
  in Starr at para. 242, &quot;an effective way to define the reasonable doubt 
  standard for a jury is to explain that it falls much closer to absolute certainty 
  than to proof on a balance of probabilities.&quot; Although the trial judge 
  made some reference, later in his charge, to beyond a reasonable doubt distinguished 
  from mere likelihood, I am not satisfied it cured the original defect.</p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge also directed the jury that, &quot;A reasonable doubt is 
  a doubt based upon reason and common sense which is derived from the evidence 
  that you have heard in this trial.&quot; He failed to instruct the jury that 
  a reasonable doubt may also be derived from a lack of evidence. This, in my 
  view, is a particularly serious omission when all of the evidence in relation 
  to the three robberies and related charges was circumstantial. </p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge further told the jury that if they were &quot;sure of the 
  guilt of the accused on a particular count, then you do not have a reasonable 
  doubt about that count&quot;. Justice Cory in Lifchus at para. 33 said that 
  such an &quot;instruction standing alone is both insufficient and potentially 
  misleading&quot;. A judge can only instruct a jury that they may convict if 
  they are sure of the accused's guilt after they have received proper instructions 
  on the meaning of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. Although it cannot 
  be said that the particular instruction in this case stood alone, it was not 
  preceded by a proper charge on the meaning of reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [38] Finally, the trial judge told the jury that, &quot;A reasonable doubt is 
  not some imaginary or frivolous doubt conjured up in the mind of the timid juror 
  to avoid doing an unpleasant duty.&quot; This court in R. v. Karthiresu (K) 
  (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291 at para. 8 commented adversely on a charge which contained 
  &quot;the timid juror&quot; reference: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While we leave for a future case the question whether, standing on its own, 
  reference to the timid juror would constitute reversible error, there is no 
  doubt that this practice is fraught with risk and ought to be avoided. It appears 
  nowhere in the model language set out in R. v. Lifchus, supra. Moreover, it 
  can be argued that it may carry the implication that jurors who acquit are timid 
  and may be avoiding their responsibilities, while courageous jurors convict. 
  </p>
<p>
  [39] In my view, the combined effect of these errors in the charge to the jury 
  on the meaning of reasonable doubt gives rise to the reasonable likelihood that 
  the jury was misled as to the content of the criminal standard of proof. Accordingly, 
  on this ground, the convictions against the appellant cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The Reversal in the Jury Charge of the Burden of Proof in Respect to the 
  Defence</p>
<p>
  [40] After the trial judge charged the jury as to the approach they should take 
  in assessing the similar fact evidence, he discussed the case for the defence 
  and the case for the Crown. Although there is more than one reference to the 
  burden of proof resting upon the Crown, the trial judge, in reference to the 
  contrasting positions of the Crown and defence, said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether that [the Crown's case] is, in fact, the case or whether Anderson's 
  evidence is true and explains his presence, is why you are here. Approach the 
  case this way: consider the whole, the totality of the evidence that you find 
  credible having gone through all the processes that I have just outlined and 
  then ask yourself if the defence might reasonably be true? If the answer is 
  yes, or if you have a reasonable doubt about it, you will acquit the accused 
  by the process I have outlined. Even if you are unsure whether to believe the 
  accused or the defence submissions it may still leave you in a state of reasonable 
  doubt. If so, the accused is entitled to be acquitted. </p>
<p>
  If, however, you reject the defence testimony that is not an end of the matter. 
  You must still scrutinize the remaining evidence that you accept to determine 
  whether the prosecution has proven its case in each count beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. </p>
<p>
  [41] Although the above excerpt incorporates, in part, the test in R. v. W.(D.), 
  [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 at 757, it leaves the jury with the impression that there 
  is some burden resting on the appellant to establish a defence. This court expressly 
  disavowed the &quot;might reasonably be true test&quot; in R. v. Phillips and 
  Baker (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (C.A.) in paras. 34 and 35: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On appeal, both appellants submit that the trial judge erred in instructing 
  the jury to apply the &quot;might reasonably be true test&quot; to Ms. Alam's 
  evidence. They maintain that the instruction was prejudicial because it tended 
  to shift the onus to the appellants to persuade the jury that Ms. Alam's evidence 
  might reasonably be true, or risk conviction. As they point out correctly in 
  my view, the law recognizes no such onus. (See R. v. K. (V.) (1991), 68 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 18 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Tyhurst (1992), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 238 (B.C.C.A.); R. 
  v. Mathieu (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Que. C.A.), affirmed at (1995), 101 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 575 (S.C.C.).)</p>
<p>
  The foregoing authorities make it clear that the &quot;might reasonably be true 
  test&quot; should be avoided when dealing with contradictory evidence in cases 
  where the presumption of innocence, and no other, applies. In this respect, 
  I agree with the views expressed by Fish J.A. at p. 429 of R. v. Mathieu, supra: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In short, the &quot;might reasonably be true&quot; test should not be transplanted 
  from its natural habitat of adverse presumptions on to the entirely difference 
  terrain [sic] of contradictory evidence in cases where the presumption of innocence, 
  and no other, avails.</p>
<p>
  (iv) The Jury Charge Concerning the Defence Theory of Multiple Parties to the 
  Three Robberies</p>
<p>
  [42] In his charge, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  So don't put too much emphasis upon the notion that there was one or two or 
  six people, as has been suggested to you in argument. The only person on trial 
  here is Jermaine Anderson and that is the only person you are deciding the question, 
  is he guilty and has the Crown proven it. </p>
<p>
  [43] Counsel for the appellant at trial objected to the above instruction. The 
  trial judge refused to give effect to the objection and stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I have to say that the defence argument struck me as being a red herring on 
  the possibility of some ringleader roping in rotating heavies to do the actual 
  robberies. There is no sug-gestion, not a scintilla of evidence, that would 
  support such a suggestion. I was not going to originally charge on the issue 
  of parties but on hearing the defence argument, I felt that was a necessary 
  piece of law to tell them about. For those reasons, then, I don't propose to 
  revisit it. I am certainly not going to visit it on the basis of giving any 
  sense of reality to the arguments offered, and I think that [the] Section 21 
  correction is neutral enough in and of itself that it disposes of that issue.</p>
<p>
  [44] In my view, the trial judge is entitled to the deference of this court 
  in determining whether the particular defence had any air of reality to it. 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [45] In the result, I would allow the appeal from the convictions, set aside 
  the convictions and order a new trial. I would dismiss the application for leave 
  to appeal the sentences as abandoned. </p>
