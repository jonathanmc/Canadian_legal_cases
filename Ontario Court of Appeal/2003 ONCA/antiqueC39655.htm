<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We do not think that MacKenzie J. erred in dismissing the defendant's motion. 
  The ground of the motion was that, in light of Dunn J.'s order of May 16, 2002, 
  the plaintiff followed the wrong procedure in obtaining the default judgment. 
  MacKenzie J. was right not to accede to this ground. Dunn J.'s order as signed 
  and entered did not impose the obligation on the plaintiff to move for judgment 
  and neither, on the facts of this case, do the Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, 
  the default judgment was properly granted.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal is dismissed. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal 
  with the motion to quash.</p>
<p>[3] [Following submissions on costs] We award the costs of the appeal to the 
  respondent fixed in the amount of $10,500, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
