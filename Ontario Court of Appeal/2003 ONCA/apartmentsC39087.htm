<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sidney N. Lederman dated October 4, 
  2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the analysis and conclusions of the motion judge. The validity 
  of rules 7.01 and 7.07 was not in question. The evidence that units in the condominium 
  rented by the appellant were regularly being used for &quot;transient or hotel 
  purposes&quot; was quite simply overwhelming. That evidence included a series 
  of admissions made on behalf of the appellant.</p>    <P>
  [2] The Directors of the respondent were statutorily obliged to enforce the 
  rules. The evidence leaves no doubt that the steps taken on behalf of the respondent 
  were consistent with that obligation and did not constitute an illegal or unlawful 
  means. The appellant's claim for intentional interference with contractual relations 
  could not succeed absent proof of an unlawful means. We are satisfied that there 
  was no triable issue on that question. </p>    <P>
  [3] We also agree with the motion judge that the appellant failed to clear the 
  triable issue hurdle on the question of economic loss. The appellant alleged 
  that the respondent had improperly interfered with the contractual relations 
  between it and certain unit owners in the condominium. The appellant tried to 
  demonstrate that interference and consequential economic loss through second 
  and third hand evidence. The motion judge was entitled to consider the nature 
  of the evidence in deciding whether or not it was capable of raising a triable 
  issue. We see no error in his conclusion in that regard. </p>    <P>
  [4] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
