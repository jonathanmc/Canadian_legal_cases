<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice J.E. Sheppard of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 12, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The parties entered into an agreement whereby the respondent agreed to 
  work as a commissioned salesperson for the appellant. That agreement included 
  the following:</p>
<P class="indent"> It is agreed that either party may terminate this agreement 
  at any time without notice or penalty. &#133;</p>
<P>
  [2] Despite this term, the trial judge held that the respondent was entitled 
  to reasonable notice upon termination by the appellant without cause. He held 
  that because of the unequal bargaining positions of the appellant and the respondent 
  at the time the agreement was made, and the lack of what the trial judge described 
  as &quot;mutuality&quot; in the effect of the termination provision in the agreement, 
  the court should refuse to enforce the agreement the parties had made, and should 
  read a term into the agreement requiring reasonable notice upon termination. 
  </p><P>
  [3] We accept that it will be appropriate for a court to decline to enforce 
  a contract or a provision in a contract where it would be unconscionable to 
  enforce that term or that contract. We see no basis in the evidence, however, 
  for a finding of unconscionability. </p><P>
  [4] The trial judge found as a fact that the respondent understood the provisions 
  of the contract in their entirety. The most that can be said is that the respondent 
  was presented with a standard form agreement which he could accept or reject 
  as he saw fit. There was no evidence of pressure or duress or the other usual 
  indicia of unconscionability. Nor was the respondent in a vulnerable position 
  when presented with the agreement. He had been employed in the field for a number 
  of years and saw employment with the appellant as an opportunity to improve 
  his financial situation. Finally, when the terms of the contract are viewed 
  in their entirety, we see nothing unfair in those terms. Several terms operated 
  to the benefit of the respondent. For example, he could pursue other work as 
  long as it did not conflict directly with the products sold by the appellant, 
  he could work at his own pace and on his own hours, and he could sever his connection 
  with the appellant at any time he saw fit without penalty.</p><P>
  [5] In summary, we see no justification for rewriting the agreement entered 
  into by the parties.</p><P>
  [6] The appeal is allowed and the trial judgment is set aside. It is agreed 
  that even if the respondent was not entitled to notice, that he was owed $6,846.50 
  by the appellant. The respondent should have judgment in that amount with prejudgment 
  interest at 5 per cent.</p><P>
  [7] The costs of the trial should be assessed. The parties agree that the respondent 
  should have his costs on a partial indemnity basis up to November 7, 2000, the 
  date of the offer made by the appellant, and that the appellant should have 
  its costs on a partial indemnity basis after that date. </p><P>
  [8] The appellant is entitled to its costs on the appeal. Those costs should 
  also be assessed. </p>
