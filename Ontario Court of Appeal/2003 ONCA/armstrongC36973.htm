<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Lawrence W. Whalen of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, and sentence imposed on June 28, 2001. 
</p>

<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The central issue in this appeal concerns the failure of the trial judge 
  to give a full and complete warning in accordance with R. v. Vetrovec (1982), 
  67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.). The appellant submits that the principal witness 
  against him on his trial on charges of first and second degree murder was an 
  unsavoury witness and that the trial judge, Whalen J., was required as a matter 
  of law to give a clear, sharp warning as to the danger of acting upon the evidence 
  of this witness without confirmation. </p>
<p>
  [2] I agree with the appellant's submission that the trial judge was required 
  as a matter of law to provide such a warning. However, I am also persuaded that 
  the instructions that were given were sufficient to alert the jury to the dangers 
  associated with this witness and that accordingly no substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice was occasioned. While the appellant raises a number of other grounds 
  of appeal, I am satisfied that there was no reversible error and the appeal 
  should be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] By the end of the trial, there was little dispute about many of the facts. 
  On August 4, 1999, the appellant, who was travelling with his young son, and 
  was en route to a family cottage on St. Joseph's Island near Sault Ste. 
  Marie picked up three young hitchhikers. They were Melody Lopez, who became 
  the victim of the first degree murder charge, Shawn Barrett, who became the 
  victim of the second degree murder charge, and Chris Rogers. Ms. Lopez and Mr. 
  Barrett were a couple and Ms. Lopez was five months pregnant with the couple's 
  child. There were two other persons at the cottage: the appellant's 19 
  year old brother, Richard Armstrong, who sometime before the trial attempted 
  to commit suicide and was left with permanent brain damage and therefore unable 
  to testify, and Dale McRae, the appellant's 18 year old cousin who became 
  the principal witness against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [4] On August 5, 1999, the group, except for the appellant's son and Ms. 
  Lopez, consumed large quantities of alcohol. In the course of the day, the group 
  practiced target shooting with one of several guns kept at the cottage. Around 
  this time the appellant became involved in a dispute with Mr. McRae and Mr. 
  Barrett over some remark that the appellant made to or about Ms. Lopez. The 
  appellant felt threatened and pointed a loaded revolver at Mr. Barrett. This 
  ended the altercation. The parties agreed that Ms. Lopez should take possession 
  of the revolver. The gun was unloaded and Ms. Lopez threw it under the cottage. 
  On this same day, the appellant became involved in a physical altercation with 
  Mr. McRae after McRae began picking on the appellant's brother. In the 
  course of this fight the appellant knocked Mr. McRae to the ground several times.</p>
<p>
  [5] Around 9:00 p.m., the appellant, Barrett and Rogers drove into town to get 
  more liquor. As the stores were closed, they decided to go the United States 
  to make their purchases. Barrett did not enter the United States because he 
  did not have proper identification. On the way back Rogers, a United States 
  citizen, was refused entry to Canada because of his criminal record. He and 
  Barrett spoke for a few minutes and arranged to meet some time later in Ms. 
  Lopez's home town in the United States. The appellant's truck was 
  impounded by customs officials and so he and Barrett made their way back to 
  the cottage by taxi. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant and Mr. Barrett arrived back at the cottage at about 2:00 
  a.m. It had been at least five hours since they last consumed any alcohol. They 
  unloaded their purchases and went out to the back of the cottage. Within a few 
  minutes, Mr. Barrett and Ms. Lopez were dead.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant and Mr. Barrett must have become involved in some kind of 
  argument. According to the appellant, the argument was over the fact that Rogers 
  had been refused entry into Canada. He claimed that Barrett blamed him for this 
  and then attacked him with a shovel. He testified that Barrett hit him several 
  times with the shovel including a blow to the face that resulted in a gash over 
  his eye, a split lip, and a swollen eyebrow. The appellant testified that he 
  then picked up the revolver, which someone had retrieved from under the cottage 
  and reloaded. The appellant said that he shot Barrett in self-defence.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant testified that he went into the cottage and woke up Mr. McRae 
  to drive him to the police station. He told McRae that Barrett had come at him 
  with a shovel. He could not explain why he did not use his cell phone to contact 
  the police. According to the appellant, McRae convinced him to tell Ms. Lopez 
  what had happened before they made any decisions. Ms. Lopez came out and saw 
  her friend's body. She started to scream and, according to the appellant, 
  McRae picked up the gun and shot her in the head and told the appellant that, 
  "I just fixed your fuckin' problem". The appellant conceded 
  that he and his cousin were not very close.</p>
<p>
  [9] McRae's version of the killings was different. He was awakened by 
  the appellant and asked to come outside. The appellant told him that Mr. Barrett 
  had picked up a shovel and that he had shot him. The appellant then went into 
  the cabin and woke up Ms. Lopez and asked her to come outside. As she walked 
  towards the fire pit she saw Barrett's body. The appellant then shot her. 
  The appellant then shot Rogers' dog.</p>
<p>
  [10] It was undisputed that the appellant and McRae put the bodies on the fire 
  and cremated the remains by building a very hot fire. In the morning, they disposed 
  of the ashes. The appellant claimed that he was largely acting at the direction 
  of his younger cousin, McRae. Mr. McRae testified that he was acting under the 
  direction of the appellant and that he did so out of fear.</p>
<p>
  [11] Later that day, the appellant and his brother returned to the border to 
  try and retrieve the truck. In the course of that attempt, the appellant was 
  in the presence of a Canadian customs officer for many hours. She testified 
  in reply that the appellant had no injuries to his face.</p>
<p>
  [12] The parents of the two victims became concerned about the whereabouts of 
  their children and contacted the police. Eventually, the police were able to 
  determine that the deceased had last been at the appellant's cottage. 
  The appellant was arrested and charged with the murders. On December 15, 1999, 
  Mr. McRae was also arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder. 
  He gave several statements to the police and as a result the murder charges 
  were dropped and he was charged with being an accessory after the fact. He made 
  the statements so that he might be released from jail and not be charged with 
  murder. When his charges were reduced, he asked the police for assistance in 
  getting bail. He was awaiting trial when he testified at the appellant's 
  murder trial.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant alleges the following errors by the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) the failure to give a Vetrovec warning with respect to Mr. McRae;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) permitting the Crown to adduce certain evidence of bad 
  character and failing to direct the jury as to the limited use of that evidence;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) misdirecting the jury with respect to the use to be made 
  of Mr. McRae's criminal record;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) failing to edit the appellant's own record to remove reference 
  to two assault convictions;</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) permitting the Crown to adduce certain evidence in reply;</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) misdirection on the appellant's post offence conduct;</p>
<p class="indent"> (vii) misdirection on reasonable doubt; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (viii) misdirection on self-defence.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>(i) The failure to give a Vetrovec warning with respect to Mr. McRae</p>
<p>
  [14] A Vetrovec warning is not required for all witnesses who technically fall 
  within the category of accomplices and for many witnesses falling within that 
  category a trial judge has a discretion whether or not to give a warning. In 
  some cases, however, the circumstances are such that the judge has no discretion, 
  the warning must be given and failure to do so is an error of law: R. v. Bevan 
  (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Brooks (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [15] In Brooks at para. 80, Major J. speaking for a majority of the court on 
  this issue, described the factors that the court will take into account in deciding 
  whether a warning was mandatory: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In summary, two main factors are relevant when deciding whether a Vetrovec warning 
  is necessary: the witness's credibility, and the importance of the witness's 
  testimony to the Crown's case. No specific threshold need be met on either factor 
  before a warning becomes necessary. Instead, where the witness is absolutely 
  essential to the Crown's case, more moderate credibility problems will warrant 
  a warning. Where the witness has overwhelming credibility problems, a warning 
  may be necessary even if the Crown's case is a strong one without the witness's 
  evidence. In short, the factors should not be looked to independently of one 
  another but in combination [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [16] By the end of the evidence in this case, it was mandatory that the trial 
  judge give the jury a Vetrovec warning. While the appellant had confirmed McRae's 
  evidence that he had killed Barrett, McRae's evidence played a central 
  role in the proof of the circumstances of the killing of Ms. Lopez. Further, 
  as counsel for the appellant observed, if the jury accepted McRae's evidence 
  that the appellant executed Ms. Lopez, it was highly unlikely that they would 
  accept the appellant's self-defence claim. So, even though McRae had no 
  direct evidence concerning the Barrett killing, the jury would have looked at 
  his evidence to decide whether the appellant's self-defence claim had 
  any merit.</p>
<p>
  [17] There were sufficient problems with McRae's credibility that, combined 
  with his role in the case, the Vetrovec warning was mandatory. McRae had originally 
  been charged with the murders, he had not yet been tried on his own charges 
  of accessory after the fact, he had a criminal record including convictions 
  for dishonesty, and he had made some prior statements that were inconsistent 
  with his testimony at trial.</p>
<p>
  [18] Defence counsel at trial objected to the trial judge's failure to 
  give the Vetrovec warning. The trial judge indicated that he had decided not 
  to give a warning because he concluded that McRae had not "reached the 
  unsavoury level. Most of it was as a youthful offender and I had a different 
  impression." In my view, the trial judge erred. He took too narrow and 
  subjective an approach. While the trial judge recognized that McRae had a motive 
  to lie because he was facing trial as an accessory after the fact he did not 
  factor this into whether the warning was required. He also failed to factor 
  in the fact that the witness had originally been charged with the same offences 
  and had received a substantial benefit from the authorities after providing 
  his statement. McRae had the strongest of motives for falsely implicating the 
  appellant in the killings.</p>
<p>
  [19] While the trial judge erred in law, I am of the view that this is a proper 
  case for applying the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. In 
  my view, there is no reasonable possibility that it would have made any difference 
  to the verdict if McRae's evidence had been accompanied by a proper Vetrovec 
  warning. </p>
<p>
  [20] Appellate courts have applied the proviso in cases where the trial judge 
  erred in law in failing to give a Vetrovec warning. In R. v. Brooks, Binnie 
  J. applied the proviso in a case where two unsavoury witnesses who were jailhouse 
  informers testified for the Crown and yet no Vetrovec warning was given. In 
  that case, the trial judge did nothing to single these witnesses out for special 
  attention other than alerting the jury to their respective criminal records. 
  At para. 137, Binnie J. noted that the proviso can rarely be applied where the 
  trial judge has failed to give a Vetrovec warning for a witness who is central 
  to the case: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether or not a new trial is necessary will largely depend on the degree of 
  centrality of the evidence of the unsavoury witness to the conviction. In most 
  cases, a witness whose testimony is sufficiently important to require the Vetrovec 
  warning in the first place will likely be sufficiently central to preclude application 
  of s. 686(1)(b)(iii), as in R. v. Sanderson (1999), 134 Man. R. (2d) 191 (C.A.) 
  at p. 193 (where the unsavoury witness gave &quot;the only evidence presented 
  by the Crown which implicated&quot; the accused), and R. v. Siu (1998), 124 
  C.C.C. (3d) 301 (B.C.C.A.) (&quot;the Crown would have had virtually no case 
  without&quot; the unsavoury witness's evidence). In such cases, application 
  of the curative proviso would clearly be wrong.</p>
<p>
  [21] In Brooks, Binnie J. concluded that there was no reasonable possibility 
  that it would have made any difference to the ultimate verdict if the evidence 
  of the unsavoury witnesses had been accompanied by a warning and therefore the 
  provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) could be applied. In reaching that conclusion, 
  he noted that there was a formidable case against the appellant that did not 
  depend upon the unsavoury witnesses. That case included substantial circumstantial 
  evidence and admissions that the appellant had made to persons other than the 
  jailhouse informers. Binnie J. also held, at para. 144, that "[c]onsideration 
  of the likely impact of the failure to give a Vetrovec warning must also be 
  qualified by the trial judge's undoubted discretion to bring to the jury's attention 
  other evidence capable of corroborating the testimony of [the jailhouse informers]". 
  The accused was not entitled to a trial without those witnesses, "only 
  to a Vetrovec warning, which in this case would have been a mixed blessing, 
  as defence counsel perhaps acknowledged by his lack of objection to the trial 
  judge's failure to deliver a Vetrovec warning".</p>
<p>
  [22] In R. v. Baltrusaitis (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 539 (Ont. C.A.), Moldaver 
  J.A., speaking for the court, held that the proviso could not be applied where 
  the trial judge had failed to give a Vetrovec warning with respect to a jailhouse 
  informer. He approached the case on the basis that the proviso could be applied 
  only if either the independent evidence capable of confirming the jailhouse 
  informer was so compelling that the jury would inevitably have accepted his 
  evidence, or the circumstantial case against the accused was so overwhelming 
  that even without the informer's evidence, the verdict would inevitably 
  have been the same.</p>
<p>
  [23] In R. v. Bevan at pp. 326-27, Major J. speaking for a majority of the court 
  held that the proviso could not be applied where the trial judge had failed 
  to give a Vetrovec warning in relation to two unsavoury witnesses who were crucial 
  to the Crown's case. Major J. held at p. 329 that the jury might have 
  treated the evidence of the two witnesses "less cautiously during their 
  deliberations than they would have had the trial judge given a proper Vetrovec 
  warning".</p>
<p>
  [24] It seems to me that the approach to application of the proviso in this 
  case must be different from these other cases and that it is necessary to return 
  to first principles. In R. v. Arradi, 2003 SCC 23 at para. 42, Arbour J. held 
  that there are two classes of errors of law that lead to the application of 
  s. 686(1)(b)(iii). The first consists of "harmless or minor errors having 
  no impact on the verdict". The second class encompasses serious errors 
  that would require a new trial except that the evidence is so overwhelming that 
  no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred. Brooks would seem to 
  be an example of a case falling within the latter class. This case does not 
  fit within that class of cases. While the case against the appellant was formidable 
  and the appellant's story improbable, I cannot say that the evidence was 
  so overwhelming that if the failure to give a proper Vetrovec warning was a 
  serious error, no substantial wrong was occasioned.</p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, there are at least two types of error within the first class 
  of errors of law identified by Arbour J.A. in Arradi. She reviewed this issue 
  at somewhat greater length in the earlier decision in R. v. Khan (2001), 160 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 30 noting that the case law was "replete 
  with examples of situations where either the triviality of the error itself, 
  or the lack of prejudice caused by a more serious error of law, justified the 
  application of the curative proviso". She summarized the approach that 
  an appellate court should take in considering whether such errors can be cured 
  by the proviso: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all those cases, the appellate courts were convinced that the error could 
  have had no effect on the verdict. Because of the nature of the errors and of 
  the issues with respect to which they were made, it was possible to trace their 
  effect on the verdict and ensure that they made no difference. Generally, the 
  errors concerned evidence that was insignificant to the determination of guilt 
  or innocence &#8230; or benefited the accused by imposing a more onerous standard 
  on the Crown &#8230;. Errors in the charge to the jury respecting a very minor 
  aspect of the case that could not have had any effect on the outcome or concerning 
  issues that the jury was otherwise necessarily aware of were also cured by the 
  application of the proviso &#8230;. Similarly, in some cases the errors concerned 
  preliminary findings that would nevertheless, as a matter of law, inevitably 
  have resulted in the same finding made by the trial judge &#8230;. [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [26] I would not categorize the trial judge's error in this case as trivial 
  and thus the proviso can only be applied because of the lack of prejudice. It 
  thus becomes necessary to look at the nature of the error and to trace its effect 
  on the verdict. To understand the effect of the trial judge's error it 
  is necessary to set out both what a proper Vetrovec warning would have looked 
  like and what the trial judge said about McRae. This exercise must be undertaken 
  bearing in mind, as Binnie J. said in Brooks, that the appellant was not entitled 
  to a trial without McRae's evidence. Thus, the purpose of the Vetrovec 
  warning was not to have the jury ignore his evidence but to approach it with 
  an appropriate degree of caution. </p>
<p>
  [27] In Vetrovec at pp. 17-8, Dickson J. set out the components of the warning: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Because of the infinite range of circumstance which will arise in the criminal 
  trial process it is not sensible to attempt to compress into a rule, a formula 
  or a direction the concept of the need for prudent scrutiny of the testimony 
  of any witness. What may be appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is 
  a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks 
  of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness. There is no magic in 
  the word corroboration, or indeed in any other comparable expression such as 
  confirmation and support. The idea implied in those words may, however, in an 
  appropriate case, be effectively and efficiently transmitted to the mind of 
  the trier of fact. This may entail some illustration from the evidence of the 
  particular case of the type of evidence, documentary or testimonial, which might 
  be drawn upon by the juror in confirmation of the witness's testimony or some 
  important part thereof. I do not wish to be taken as saying that such illustration 
  must be carried to exhaustion. However, there is, in some circumstances, particularly 
  in lengthy trials, the need for helpful direction on the question of sifting 
  the evidence where guilt or innocence might, and probably will, turn on the 
  acceptance or rejection, belief or disbelief, of the evidence of one or more 
  witnesses. All of this applies equally in the case of an accomplice, or a disreputable 
  witness of demonstrated moral lack, as, for example, a witness with a record 
  of perjury. [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [28] Thus, in this case the trial judge should have cautioned the jury that 
  it was dangerous to act upon the evidence of McRae alone because he was an accessory 
  after the fact and had not yet been tried for those charges, had been involved 
  in concealing the crimes, had a motive to falsely implicate the appellant when 
  he gave his statements to the police, had a criminal record for crimes of dishonesty, 
  and had made some prior inconsistent statements. The trial judge should have 
  told the jury that while McRae was now no longer facing the murder charges he 
  continued to have a motive to stick to his original story to avoid prosecution 
  for murder. The jurors' everyday experience would not necessarily equip 
  them with the knowledge of the dangers of relying, without more, on witnesses 
  like McRae. See R. v. Brooks at para. 130.</p>
<p>
  [29] The judge would then have been required to pick out some of the evidence 
  that was capable of restoring confidence in McRae's credibility. The most 
  important piece of evidence was in the appellant's own testimony admitting 
  that he had killed Mr. Barrett with the same gun that was used to kill Ms. Lopez. 
  There were other pieces of evidence to which the trial judge might have referred 
  such as the appellant's admission that he and McRae were not close and 
  had quarrelled earlier in the day making it improbable that McRae would commit 
  a first degree murder for him. There was also the appellant's admission 
  that he had earlier threatened Barrett with the loaded revolver.</p>
<p>
  [30] I now turn to what the trial judge did tell the jury about Mr. McRae. The 
  trial judge reviewed McRae's criminal and young offender record and gave 
  a standard direction that the record was one of the factors to be used in assessing 
  his credibility. He then gave this instruction: </p>
<p class="indent"> Dale McRae is charged with being an accessory after the fact 
  in the murders of Shawn Barrett and Melody Lopez. You heard that testimony here. 
  You heard evidence that he was once charged with their murders, but the charges 
  were reduced. Dale McRae's trial has not yet been held.</p>
<p class="indent">A Crown witness who is awaiting trial himself on charges may 
  have an interest in testifying favourably for the Crown in this trial. Favourable 
  testimony here may help the witness out in his own case later, or the witness 
  may believe that it will be so.</p>
<p class="indent">You should approach the evidence of Dale McRae with care and 
  caution. When you consider how much or little you will believe of and rely on 
  this evidence to decide this case, take in, take into account the fact that 
  he is himself awaiting trial on charges arising from the matters here before 
  you. It's a factor for you to consider. How much or little it influences you 
  is up to you [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [31] Finally, the trial judge exhaustively reviewed McRae's testimony 
  including the cross-examination in which various inconsistencies from prior 
  statements were set out.</p>
<p>
  [32] The excerpt from the charge that I have set out was not a proper Vetrovec 
  warning. But it did go a long way to alerting the jury to the fact that McRae 
  occupied a special place in the trial and why his evidence had to be approached 
  with caution. The trial judge said that explicitly: "You should approach 
  the evidence of Dale McRae with care and caution." In Brooks at para. 
  132, Binnie J. adopted the following passage from the reasons of Osborne J.A. 
  in R. v. Bevan (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 333 (Ont. C.A.) at 361?62: </p>
<p class="indent">
  However, in those cases where a clear sharp warning is required, it seems to 
  me that it is of fundamental importance that the form of the warning take into 
  account that its underlying purpose is to direct the jury's special attention 
  to the risk of convicting an accused on the basis of the evidence of a witness 
  who may be viewed, for reasons such as self-interest, as untrustworthy. Thus, 
  the witness should be singled out, that is, separated from the pack. The jury 
  should be told to scrutinize the evidence for evidence which would confirm or 
  support the testimony of the witness who is said to have a motive to lie, or 
  who is of unsavoury character . . . In my view, it is preferable in most cases 
  that the trial judge tell the jury why the evidence of a given witness requires 
  special scrutiny, that is, why the light of the credibility microscope should 
  be turned up [emphasis added by Binnie J.].</p>
<p>
  [33] This part of the trial judge's charge did single out McRae for special 
  treatment and separated him from the pack. Given this warning and the full review 
  of McRae's testimony by the trial judge, the jury could not help but realize 
  the need to approach his evidence with care and of the reasons to do so. I am 
  satisfied that a more complete Vetrovec warning, which would have been accompanied 
  by reference to the parts of the evidence that supported McRae's story, 
  would not have affected the result in this case. I would not give effect to 
  this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Permitting the Crown to adduce certain evidence of bad character and failing 
  to direct the jury as to the limited use of that evidence</p>
<p>
  [34] Over objection by the defence, the trial judge permitted the Crown to lead 
  evidence from Mr. McRae that several days after the killings the appellant became 
  involved in a quarrel with his brother and during the fight fired a gun into 
  the air. The appellant then left the property with his son. The appellant's 
  father, who had now come to the cottage, grabbed the gun and followed the appellant. 
  Mr. McRae heard two gunshots a short time later. The trial judge admitted the 
  evidence because it showed McRae's state of mind shortly after the killing 
  and explained why he was afraid to go to the police.</p>
<p>
  [35] The appellant submits that this evidence was inadmissible and in the alternative 
  that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to its use. I would not interfere 
  with the trial judge's decision to admit the evidence. It had probative 
  value in explaining McRae's state of mind. He testified that he was terrified 
  after this event and it helped to explain why he did not go to the authorities. 
  The prejudicial effect of the evidence was relatively minimal bearing in mind 
  the other evidence that was properly admitted of violence and use of guns by 
  the appellant preceding the killings.</p>
<p>
  [36] I agree with the appellant that the trial judge should have explicitly 
  told the jury that this evidence could only be used as evidence of McRae's 
  state of mind and not as evidence that the appellant was the type of person 
  likely to have committed murder. That said, this evidence played such a minor 
  part in this trial no prejudice was occasioned by the failure to give a complete 
  direction. There was, in my view, no possibility that the jury would engage 
  in prohibited propensity reasoning from this incident. Crown counsel did not 
  suggest any such use of the evidence in his closing address and experienced 
  defence counsel did not object to this portion of the charge.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Misdirecting the jury with respect to the use to be made of Mr. McRae's 
  criminal record</p>
<p>
  [37] The appellant submits that the trial judge should have instructed the jury 
  that Mr. McRae's prior criminal record was not only relevant to credibility 
  but could be used as circumstantial evidence to support the defence position 
  that he rather than the appellant killed Ms. Lopez. The appellant suggests that 
  the record shows that McRae has a propensity for violence. McRae's record 
  mostly consists of crimes committed when he was a young offender. The only crime 
  of violence is a conviction for robbery in September 2000 for which he received 
  an eight-month sentence. He also had many convictions for break and enter. Only 
  one of these convictions was when McRae was an adult. In cross-examining Mr. 
  McRae, defence counsel made no attempt to elicit the details of the facts underlying 
  any of these convictions.</p>
<p>
  [38] At trial, defence counsel did not seek the instruction now asked for and 
  made no objection to the charge to the jury about the instructions concerning 
  the use of McRae's criminal record. In his jury address, defence counsel 
  did not argue that McRae had a disposition towards violence as a result of his 
  criminal record. In my view, the trial judge was not required to give the instruction 
  now sought. As the defence presented the case to the jury, this was not a live 
  issue. It was not incumbent on the trial judge to try to devise instructions 
  for uses for evidence that experienced defence counsel at trial did not seek. 
  Further, in the absence of any evidence about the facts leading to those convictions, 
  and whether any of the convictions involved violence to the person, the jury 
  would have had little basis for attributing any weight to an instruction that 
  these convictions showed a propensity for violence on the part of McRae and 
  thus made it more likely that he rather than the appellant killed Ms. Lopez. 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (iv) Failing to edit the appellant's own record to remove reference to 
  two assault convictions</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant has a criminal record for dangerous driving, possession of 
  stolen goods, breach of recognizance, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, 
  impaired driving, possession of a prohibited weapon, acquisition of a firearm 
  without a firearms acquisition certificate and two counts of assault, one in 
  1994 and one in 1999. The appellant brought an application pursuant to Corbett 
  v. The Queen (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), seeking an order that the 
  Crown not be permitted to cross-examine him on the weapons and assault convictions. 
  The trial judge agreed with the appellant as regards the weapons offences. However, 
  he refused to excise the assault convictions.</p>
<p>
  [40] The decision whether to edit a criminal record in accordance with Corbett 
  is an exercise of discretion and is entitled to deference, absent an error in 
  principle. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle by 
  adopting "the inclusionary approach suggested in Corbett". He also 
  submits that the trial judge was bound by this court's decision in R. 
  v. Brooks (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (reversed on other grounds (2000), 141 
  C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.)). </p>
<p>
  [41] I have not been persuaded that the trial judge erred in principle. He gave 
  very full reasons for why he was excising the weapons convictions but not the 
  assault convictions. The "inclusionary approach" referred to is 
  obviously a reference to the reasons of the majority in Corbett, where Dickson 
  C.J.C. said at pp. 399-400: </p>
<p class="indent"> There is perhaps a risk that if told of the fact that the accused 
  has a criminal record, the jury will make more than it should of that fact. 
  But concealing the prior criminal record of an accused who testifies deprives 
  the jury of information relevant to credibility, and creates a serious risk 
  that the jury will be presented with a misleading picture. </p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the best way to balance and alleviate these risks 
  is to give the jury all the information, but at the same time give a clear direction 
  as to the limited use they are to make of such information. Rules which put 
  blinders over the eyes of the trier of fact should be avoided except as a last 
  resort. It is preferable to trust the good sense of the jury and to give the 
  jury all relevant information, so long as it is accompanied by a clear instruction 
  in law from the trial judge regarding the extent of its probative value.</p>
<p>
  [42] It is not inaccurate to describe this approach as an inclusionary one, 
  even though Dickson C.J.C. did endorse that part of La Forest J.'s reasons 
  in which he set out the factors that a court should take into account in editing 
  a criminal record.</p>
<p>
  [43] In Brooks, in circumstances very similar to this case, Laskin J.A. held 
  that the trial judge ought to have excised an assault conviction from the accused's 
  record. He pointed out at para. 72 that assault convictions have less bearing 
  on a person's credibility than crimes of dishonesty and that a court should 
  be "wary of admitting evidence of an accused's conviction for a similar 
  crime in order to avoid the possibility that the jury might convict because 
  of the accused's disposition to commit such crimes". He also pointed out 
  that there was little danger of the jury getting a distorted picture that the 
  accused, unlike the Crown witnesses, was a person of reputable character because 
  the accused had a recent record for other offences bearing more directly on 
  credibility.</p>
<p>
  [44] The same considerations apply here and it would have been appropriate for 
  the trial judge to excise the assault convictions. However, I am not persuaded 
  that the trial judge erred in principle in refusing to do so. He provided reasons 
  for his decision based on the "facts and dynamics" of the case. 
  He was convinced that allowing the assault convictions to be placed before the 
  jury would "provide balance in the context of the credibility issues in 
  this case and the attack by the defence on the credibility of Dale McRae whose 
  record is also before the jury". Finally, I note that while Laskin J.A. 
  held in Brooks at para. 73 that the trial judge should have excised the accused's 
  assault conviction he would not have interfered with the ruling, since he was 
  not persuaded that the trial judge in that case exercised his discretion unreasonably. 
  I am of the same view in this case.</p>
<p>
  (v) Permitting the Crown to adduce certain evidence in reply</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown 
  to adduce two pieces of evidence in reply. The first piece of evidence comes 
  from Glenda LeMarquand, a Canada Customs officer. About 16 hours after the killings 
  the appellant and his brother returned to the border in an attempt to retrieve 
  the vehicle that had been impounded the night before. Officer LeMarquand dealt 
  with the appellant over a period of about six hours and she testified in reply 
  that the appellant had no injuries to his face. The defence argued at trial 
  that the Crown was improperly splitting its case by calling the officer in reply.</p>
<p>
  [46] Officer LeMarquand had been questioned by the police back in December 1999 
  and had provided a statement to the police giving a general description of the 
  appellant's appearance and the events surrounding his attendance at Canada 
  Customs in the afternoon of August 6, 1999. The Crown had disclosed that statement 
  to the police. After the appellant testified and described the alleged assault 
  by Mr. Barrett, the police reinterviewed Officer LeMarquand and specifically 
  asked about any injuries to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [47] In R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.) at 26, Martin J.A. 
  set out the principles applicable to this issue. Reply or rebuttal evidence 
  by the prosecution is limited to evidence to meet new facts introduced by the 
  defence. The trial judge does, however, have "a discretion to admit evidence 
  in reply which has become relevant to the prosecution's case as a result 
  of defence evidence which the Crown could not reasonably be expected to anticipate". 
  This includes a discretion to admit evidence in reply to a matter raised in 
  cross-examination of Crown witnesses, providing it was not a live issue at the 
  end of the prosecution case and admission of the evidence would not work an 
  unfairness to the accused. See R. v. P. (G.) (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 263 (Ont. 
  C.A.) at 274. </p>
<p>
  [48] The appellant submits that by reason of the cross-examination of McRae 
  the Crown could reasonably have anticipated that the defence to the killing 
  of Mr. Barrett would be self-defence and that the appellant would allege that 
  he had been attacked and injured by Mr. Barrett. In examination in chief, McRae 
  testified that the appellant told him that Mr. Barrett picked up a shovel and 
  the appellant then shot him. In cross-examination, defence counsel suggested 
  to McRae that the appellant was bleeding when he spoke about the shovel incident. 
  McRae denied that the appellant was bleeding. That was the extent of any cross-examination 
  suggesting either self-defence or that the appellant had been injured. On that 
  record, the trial judge concluded that the Crown could not reasonably anticipate 
  that the appellant in his testimony would allege he had been struck with a shovel 
  and been injured. I agree with that conclusion. At most, as in R. v. Campbell 
  at p. 29, the question of self-defence may have been foreshadowed by the cross-examination 
  of McRae, although even that is doubtful, but the issue to which officer LeMarquand 
  testified did not arise until the appellant testified.</p>
<p>
  [49] This case is quite different from this court's decision in R. v. 
  Wood (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 65, upon which the appellant placed particular reliance. 
  In Wood, the Crown lead evidence in reply that the accused owned the knife that 
  had been used in the killing. The reply witness had also testified for the Crown 
  in its case in chief and made no mention of the ownership of the knife. During 
  the defence case, several witnesses testified that the knife was not the accused's. 
  This court held that the reply evidence should not have been admitted. However, 
  in that case the question of the possession and ownership of the knife was always 
  important. In fact, in a statement to the police the appellant had claimed that 
  the deceased had the knife, was flicking it at him and it was only after he 
  and the deceased fought that he was able to get the knife away from the deceased 
  and stab him in self-defence. In my view, the decision in Wood does not assist 
  the appellant. The question of self-defence and injuries to the appellant was 
  not a live issue in this case until the appellant testified. The trial judge 
  properly exercised his discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [50] The other piece of reply evidence came from the appellant's former 
  common law wife, Chantel Murray. After the appellant testified, the police interviewed 
  her and she provided information about the type of underwear that the appellant 
  usually wore. She told the police that the appellant sometimes wore Speedo type 
  briefs in the summer. The relevance of this evidence arose in this manner: In 
  examination in chief, McRae testified that when he saw the appellant after the 
  killing of Mr. Barrett he was only wearing black Speedo type underwear. In cross-examination, 
  defence counsel suggested to McRae that the story of the underwear was to "masquerade 
  the fact that you don't want that gun anywhere near you and so you say 
  that he has the gun in his shorts". McRae agreed with this suggestion. 
  The appellant testified that at the time of the killings he was wearing boxer 
  shorts and jeans. In cross-examination, he volunteered that his whole life he 
  has only worn boxers. This testimony did not come in response to any question 
  from Crown counsel about underwear.</p>
<p>
  [51] The trial judge permitted the witness to testify. Her testimony was extremely 
  brief. She testified that the appellant wore flannel boxers in the winter and 
  in the summer wore cotton boxers or Speedo or bikini type underwear. Defence 
  counsel did not cross-examine her.</p>
<p>
  [52] The appellant submits that either the Crown improperly split its case by 
  calling this evidence or its admission offended the collateral fact rule. The 
  trial judge ruled that the evidence went to McRae's credibility and was 
  not collateral and even if it was the "the exception" in R. v. Shewfelt 
  (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 304 (B.C.C.A.) applied.</p>
<p>
  [53] The admission of this evidence does not engage the rule against improperly 
  splitting the case. The question of whether the appellant ever wore Speedo or 
  bikini type underwear did not arise until the appellant volunteered the information 
  in cross-examination. The Crown could not possibly have anticipated that the 
  appellant would take this position. The only real issue was whether the admission 
  of this evidence offended the collateral fact rule.</p>
<p>
  [54] Evidence is not admissible in reply merely because it is relevant to the 
  credibility of an important Crown witness. As held in R. v. Aalders (1993), 
  82 C.C.C. (3d) 215 (S.C.C.) at p. 230, the reply evidence must relate to an 
  integral and essential issue of the case. In my view, Shewfelt does not create 
  any broad exception to that rule. Shewfelt was a drug case. The thrust of the 
  defence was that the principal Crown witness, the accused's alleged accomplice, 
  was herself a drug trafficker and her story about merely being a courier for 
  the accused was a fabrication. The defence called evidence to show that the 
  witness had trafficked in drugs on other occasions. The Crown was then permitted 
  to call brief reply evidence to show that the witness was not in the province 
  at the time these other events were said to have taken place. That evidence 
  fell squarely within the Aalders statement of the rule. It went to an essential 
  issue in the case, whether the accomplice was a drug trafficker as alleged by 
  the defence or merely a courier as alleged by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [55] That said, I am not satisfied that the trial judge erred in admitting Ms. 
  Murray's evidence. The evidence did not merely contradict the appellant 
  nor relate to McRae's credibility. In view of the cross-examination of 
  McRae, the evidence was relevant to the possession of the gun, an issue that 
  was central to the case. In those circumstances, I would not interfere with 
  the trial judge's decision to admit the evidence. It was open to the trial 
  judge to conclude that the evidence did not offend the collateral fact rule.</p>
<p>
  (vi) Misdirection on the appellant's post offence conduct</p>
<p>
  [56] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in directing the jury 
  that the evidence that the appellant disposed of the bodies was relevant to 
  his claim of self-defence. The appellant submits that because the appellant 
  admitted shooting Mr. Barrett with a handgun and thus his liability for possession 
  of a prohibited weapon, the direction should not have been given, in accordance 
  with R. v. Arcangioli (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). The appellant also 
  submits that the directions to the jury were inadequate in that the trial judge 
  did not instruct the jury about possible innocent explanations for the conduct 
  such as panic or fear of a false accusation.</p>
<p>
  [57] I cannot accept these submissions. In Arcangioli at p. 301, the Supreme 
  Court held that where an accused's post-offence conduct "may be 
  equally explained by reference to consciousness of guilt of two or more offences, 
  and where an accused has admitted culpability in respect of one or more of these 
  offences, a trial judge should instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative 
  value with respect to any particular offence." However, the appellant's 
  elaborate attempts to dispose of and conceal the bodies of the deceased in this 
  case may not be equally explained by reference to consciousness of guilt over 
  the relatively trivial offence of possession of a prohibited weapon. The trial 
  judge was right not to give a no-probative-value instruction.</p>
<p>
  [58] I am also of the view that the trial judge's instructions concerning 
  the use of the post-offence conduct were adequate. The trial judge fully reviewed 
  the appellant's own testimony of his reasons for participating in the 
  disposal of the bodies, including his evidence that he was in shock, that he 
  had no way to explain to the authorities what had happened and did not know 
  what else to do. Defence counsel did not object to the charge to the jury with 
  respect to the use of post-offence conduct. Counsel for the appellant, who argued 
  this ground of appeal and was not counsel at trial, properly conceded that in 
  one respect at least the charge was unduly favourable to the appellant. The 
  trial judge told the jury that they could only use the evidence about disposal 
  of the bodies if they were satisfied "beyond a reasonable doubt" 
  that the appellant disposed of the bodies for the purpose of negating his claim 
  of self-defence and for no other reason. The application of the reasonable doubt 
  standard to this piece of circumstantial evidence was an error in favour of 
  the appellant. See R. v. White (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at para. 
  53 &#8211; 58.</p>
<p>
  (vii) Misdirection on reasonable doubt</p>
<p>
  [59] The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury with respect 
  to the definition of reasonable doubt by failing to instruct the jury that a 
  reasonable doubt may be based on the absence of evidence. The appellant submits 
  that this error was important in this case because it was the defence position 
  that without McRae's evidence, which the jury should reject as being unreliable, 
  there was no evidence upon which the appellant could be convicted beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. </p>
<p>
  [60] The charge to the jury in this case substantially complied with the dictates 
  of R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). The omission of the absence 
  of evidence direction was not significant in this case. This case was not about 
  gaps in the prosecution case where the failure to give this direction might 
  be important. The case turned on whether the large body of circumstantial evidence 
  together with McRae's evidence showed that the appellant did not act in 
  self-defence in killing Mr. Barrett and then executed Ms. Lopez. The most important 
  issues for the jury were whether to believe McRae and whether the appellant's 
  testimony raised a reasonable doubt. The trial judge gave a complete direction 
  concerning the application of reasonable doubt to credibility in accordance 
  with R. v. W. (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). It is simply unrealistic 
  to believe that if the jury decided to reject McRae's evidence they would 
  nevertheless have convicted the appellant because they did not realize the impact 
  of that decision on the Crown's case.</p>
<p>
  (viii) Misdirection on self-defence</p>
<p>
  [61] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct 
  the jury that the appellant's mental disorder was relevant to his claim 
  of self-defence. The appellant testified that he suffered from bipolar disorder 
  and had been taking medication for that condition. He lead no medical evidence 
  about this condition and did not testify that he was under the influence of 
  this condition at the time of the alleged attack by Mr. Barrett. No objection 
  was taken to this direction at trial. There is no air of reality to the claim 
  that the appellant's mental illness was relevant to his self-defence claim.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [62] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
