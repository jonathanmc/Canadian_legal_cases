<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant argues that, based on the expert evidence in this case, it 
  was not open to the trial judge to conclude that the boot print found at the 
  scene, which was the critical physical evidence relied upon by the Crown, was 
  the same as the appellant's boot print. We disagree.</p>
<p>[2] The Crown called two expert witnesses at trial, concerning footwear analysis. 
  Both acknowledged that some of the challenged characteristics of the boot print 
  could have been caused by manufacturing defects rather than by the natural wear 
  and tear on the appellant's boots. Both also testified, however, that they were 
  satisfied that the characteristics in issue were not manufacturing defects and 
  both explained the basis for their opinions in that regard. The trial judge 
  was entitled to accept that evidence.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
