<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an application by the Municipality of Grey Highlands ("the 
  Municipality") to intervene as an added party in this appeal. The respondent 
  Grey Association for Better Planning (GABP) supports the application while the 
  appellants oppose the application. </p>
<p> [2] Artemesia Waters Ltd. ("Artemesia") obtained a permit to take 
  water, pursuant to the Ontario Water Resources Act, from property it owned within 
  the Municipality. Artemesia subsequently applied for amendments to the official 
  plan and zoning by-law of the Municipality in order to permit this activity. 
  The matter proceeded to a hearing before the Ontario Municipal Board ("OMB"). 
  Both the respondent GABP and the Municipality were parties to the proceedings 
  before the OMB. Ultimately, the OMB ruled in favour of Artemesia. </p>
<p> [3] Subsequently, GABP obtained leave and successfully appealed the decision 
  of the OMB in Divisional Court. The Municipality did not participate in that 
  appeal. As a result of this decision, Artemesia sought and obtained leave to 
  appeal and now appeals the decision of Divisional Court. It is against this 
  background that the Municipality now seeks to be restored as a party to these 
  proceedings. </p>
<p> [4] Typically, the applicant in a motion for intervention seeks to be added 
  as a "friend of the court" on the basis that, while not actually 
  involved in the matter in dispute, it does have an interest and expertise in 
  the subject area so that it can "make a useful contribution to the resolution 
  of the appeal without causing injustice to the immediate parties": Peel 
  (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada Ltd. (1990), 
  74 O.R. (2d) 164 CA at page 167. </p>
<p> [5] In my view, however, the Municipality stands in a position different from 
  those who intervene as a friend of the court. The Municipality was a party to 
  the proceedings before the OMB. The subject matter of the appeal deals, inter 
  alia, with the Municipality's official plan, zoning by-law and its right, 
  if any, to control the proposed activity of the appellant. It has an "immediate" 
  interest in the subject matter of the proceeding and was one of the "immediate 
  parties" at an earlier stage of the proceedings. Not only may it be adversely 
  affected by the decision of this court but it may well be explicitly bound by 
  the order of the court.</p>
<p> [6] The addition of the Municipality will not delay or prejudice the appellant. 
  The Municipality and the respondent GABP propose to be represented by the same 
  counsel, file a joint factum and make a single argument on the appeal. Additionally, 
  the Municipality agrees that it will be subject to such order for costs as made 
  by the court on the appeal. As a party, the Municipality unquestionably will 
  be bound by the decision of the court.</p>
<p> [7] In these circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to add the 
  Municipality of Grey Highlands as a party/respondent to this appeal and I so 
  order. While I have received submissions as to costs, there will be no costs 
  of this motion. </p>
