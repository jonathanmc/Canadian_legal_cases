<p>On appeal from the finding of a breach of a conditional sentence by Justice 
  Gordon Thomson of the Superior Court of Justice on March 4, 2002.</p>
<P>
  ROSENBERG J.A.:</p> <P>
  [1] The appellant appeals in writing from a finding by Thomson J. that the appellant 
  breached his conditional sentence. The hearing judge found that the appellant 
  had breached the house arrest term of the sentence and revoked the conditional 
  sentence. The appellant was therefore required to serve the time of 13 days 
  remaining on the sentence in custody, subject to any earned remission. </p> <P>
  [2] The appellant submits that his conditional sentence had expired at the time 
  of the alleged breach. He does not dispute that he breached a condition of the 
  sentence, if it was still running at the time. The appeal turns on the interpretation 
  of s. 742.6 of the Criminal Code. The appellant submits that because he was 
  in custody for certain periods the conditional sentence had expired prior to 
  the date of the alleged breach. Since I agree with the appellant's interpretation 
  of that section I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the hearing 
  judge.</p> <P>
  Mootness</p> <P>
  [3] The respondent raises a preliminary matter. As counsel points out, the issue 
  is now moot, the appellant long ago having served the remaining 13 days of his 
  sentence. Nevertheless, I would deal with the case on its merits. The court 
  has had the benefit of very complete and helpful written argument from counsel 
  for the appellant and for the Crown. The appeal raises an important question 
  concerning the interpretation of s. 742.6 of the Criminal Code. Because of the 
  time involved in bringing an appeal, the issue might never come to this court 
  as a live issue. As in this case, the times involved will often be very short. 
  For these reasons, this an appropriate case to exercise our discretion to hear 
  the appeal on its merits. See Fraser v. Kent Institution (1998), 130 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 393 (B.C.C.A.).</p> <P>
  The Facts</p> <P>
  [4] On April 14, 2000, following a guilty plea to a charge of sexual assault, 
  the appellant was sentenced to a conditional sentence of two years less a day 
  to be served in the community. According to Ministry of Correctional Services 
  records, the appellant's sentence would have otherwise ended on April 12, 2002. 
  The appellant breached his conditional sentence three times prior to the most 
  recent hearing. In each case, he was arrested, appeared before a justice of 
  the peace within 24 hours of his arrest and was detained. In each case, a bail 
  determination was not made at his first appearance before a justice of the peace. 
  The appeal turns on whether the appellant should have been credited with the 
  periods the appellant spent in custody before the bail determinations. </p> <P>
  [5] As a result of the three prior breach dispositions the appellant was ordered 
  to serve seven days, sixty days, and four months respectively of the conditional 
  sentence in custody. </p> <P>
  [6] On February 19, 2002, Windsor police arrested the appellant for an alleged 
  breach of his conditional sentence. Thomson J. conducted a fourth breach determination 
  hearing on March 4, 2002. He found that the house arrest condition of the sentence 
  had been breached. As indicated, the appellant does not dispute this finding.</p> <P>
  The Statutory Conditions</p> <P>
  [7] Section 742.6 of the Criminal Code sets out the procedure to be followed 
  where it is alleged that an offender has breached the conditional sentence. 
  The relevant parts of that section are the following:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 742.6 (1) For the purpose of proceedings under this section,</p>
<P class="indent">(a) the provisions of Parts XVI and XVIII with respect to compelling 
  the appearance of an accused before a justice apply, with any modifications 
  that the circumstances require, and any reference in those Parts to committing 
  an offence shall be read as a reference to breaching a condition of a conditional 
  sentence order; </p>
<P class="center">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">(2) For the purpose of the application of section 515, the release 
  from custody of an offender who is detained on the basis of an alleged breach 
  of a condition of a conditional sentence order shall be governed by subsection 
  515(6).</p>
<P class="indent">(3) The hearing of an allegation of a breach of condition shall 
  be commenced within thirty days, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, after</p>
<P class="indent">(a) the offender's arrest; or</p>
<P class="indent">(b) the compelling of the offender's appearance in accordance 
  with paragraph (1)(d).</p>
<P class="center">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">(10) The running of a conditional sentence imposed on an offender 
  is suspended during the period that ends with the determination of whether a 
  breach of condition had occurred and begins with the earliest of</p>
<P class="indent">(a) the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the offender 
  for the alleged breach,</p>
<P class="indent">(b) the arrest without warrant of the offender for the alleged 
  breach, and</p>
<P class="indent">(c) the compelling of the offender's appearance in accordance 
  with paragraph (1)(d).</p>
<P class="center">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">(12) A conditional sentence referred to in subsection (10) starts 
  running again on the making of an order to detain the offender in custody under 
  subsection 515(6) and, unless section 742.7 applies, continues running while 
  the offender is detained under the order.</p>
<P class="indent"> (13) Section 6 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act does not 
  apply to the period of detention in custody under subsection 515(6).</p>
<P class="indent"> (14) Despite subsection (10), if there was unreasonable delay 
  in the execution of a warrant, the court may, at any time, order that any period 
  between the issuance and execution of the warrant that it considers appropriate 
  in the interests of justice is deemed to be time served under the conditional 
  sentence unless the period has been so deemed under subsection (15).</p>
<P class="center"> <span class="indent">&#133;</span></p>
<P class="indent"> (16) If a court is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, 
  that the offender has without reasonable excuse, the proof of which lies on 
  the offender, breached a condition of the conditional sentence order, the court 
  may, in exceptional cases and in the interests of justice, order that some or 
  all of the period of suspension referred to in subsection (10) is deemed to 
  be time served under the conditional sentence.</p>
<P class="indent"> (17) In exercising its discretion under subsection (16), a 
  court shall consider</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) the circumstances and seriousness of the breach; </p>
<P class="indent"> (b) whether not making the order would cause the offender undue 
  hardship based on the offender's individual circumstances; and</p>
<P class="indent"> (c) the period for which the offender was subject to conditions 
  while the running of the conditional sentence was suspended and whether the 
  offender complied with those conditions during that period.</p>
<P class="indent"> [Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [8] For completeness, reference should also be made to a portion of s. 742.7:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 742.7 (1) If an offender who is subject to a conditional sentence 
  is imprisoned as a result of a sentence imposed for another offence, whenever 
  committed, the running of the conditional sentence is suspended during the period 
  of imprisonment for that other offence.</p> 
<P>
  [9] The other important provisions for dealing with this appeal are found in 
  s. 515 as follows:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 515. (1) Subject to this section, where an accused who is charged 
  with an offence other than an offence listed in section 469 is taken before 
  a justice, the justice shall, unless a plea of guilty by the accused is accepted, 
  order, in respect of that offence, that the accused be released on his giving 
  an undertaking without conditions, unless the prosecutor, having been given 
  a reasonable opportunity to do so, shows cause, in respect of that offence, 
  why the detention of the accused in custody is justified or why an order under 
  any other provision of this section should be made and where the justice makes 
  an order under any other provision of this section, the order shall refer only 
  to the particular offence for which the accused was taken before the justice.</p> 
<P class="center"> &#133;</p> 
<P class="indent"> (5) Where the prosecutor shows cause why the detention of the 
  accused in custody is justified, the justice shall order that the accused be 
  detained in custody until he is dealt with according to law and shall include 
  in the record a statement of his reasons for making the order.</p> 
<P class="indent">(6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, where an 
  accused is charged</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed 
  in section 469,</p>
<P class="indent"> (i) that is alleged to have been committed while at large after 
  being released in respect of another indictable offence pursuant to the provisions 
  of this Part or section 69 or 680,</p>
<P class="center"> &#133;</p> 
<P class="indent"> the justice shall order that the accused be detained in custody 
  until he is dealt with according to law, unless the accused, having been given 
  a reasonable opportunity to do so, shows cause why his detention in custody 
  is not justified, but where the justice orders that the accused be released, 
  he shall include in the record a statement of his reasons for making the order.</p>
<P class="indent">[Emphasis added.] </p>
<P>
  The Hearing Judge's Decision</p> 
<P> [10] Ms. Bosveld, the appellant's probation and parole officer, gave evidence 
  at the hearing that using the date of determination of bail as the date upon 
  which a detention order is made within the meaning of s. 742.6(12), the sentence 
  for the appellant terminates on March 17, 2002.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> The hearing 
  judge agreed with this analysis:</p>
<P class="indent"> I am satisfied that the reading of the whole of subsection 
  (12) of section [742.6] allows of only one construction, and that is that the 
  making of the order as a result of the show cause, either by a contested show 
  cause or a consent to it, does not mean an order by a justice of the peace remanding 
  an accused person in custody, for a period of time, until the hearing or the 
  consent is registered. That being said, I am satisfied that the sentence was 
  still outstanding as at February 19, 2002.</p> 
<P>
  [11] The hearing judge therefore revoked the conditional sentence and ordered 
  the appellant to serve the remaining 13 days of his sentence in custody.</p> <P>
  Analysis</p> <P>
  [12] The scheme of the legislation as I understand it is this. Where an offender 
  has been detained under s. 742.6 because he or she is alleged to have breached 
  a term of the conditional sentence the offender's right to release is governed 
  by s. 515(6). I have reproduced a portion of that subsection above. In short, 
  s. 515(6) enacts a reverse onus. Ordinarily, a person charged with an indictable 
  offence is entitled to be released unless the prosecution shows cause why the 
  accused should not be released. Section 515(6), however, provides that the accused 
  will be detained until he or she shows cause why he or she should be released. 
  I have reproduced paragraph (6)(a) of s. 515, which sets out one of the most 
  common reasons why there is a reverse onus, namely where the accused is alleged 
  to have committed an indictable offence while at large after being released 
  in respect of another indictable offence. </p> <P>
  [13] Section 742.6(2) deems the reverse onus provision in s. 515(6) to also 
  apply in circumstances of an alleged breach of a conditional sentence. In other 
  words, in accordance with s. 515(6), where the offender is arrested, whether 
  with or without warrant, he or she must be detained in custody. The offender 
  can only be released if he or she shows cause for the release.</p> <P>
  [14] The dispute in this case turns on the meaning of s. 742.6(10) and (12), 
  which provide for the suspension of the conditional sentence but also provide 
  that in some circumstances the sentence can begin to run again pending the determination 
  of the breach allegation.</p> <P>
  [15] The effect of s. 742.6(10) is that the conditional sentence stops running 
  between the time when a warrant is issued, the offender is arrested without 
  a warrant, or the offender is given certain process requiring his or her attendance 
  in court, and the time when the determination is made of whether a breach of 
  condition occurred. Thus, s. 742.6 contemplates that the conditional sentence 
  would stop running even though the offender is in custody. </p> <P>
  [16] As I understand it, the paramount purpose of s. 742.6(10) was to meet the 
  problem that, where a person is alleged to have breached the conditional sentence, 
  the sentence may very well have expired before the person was brought before 
  the courts and the breach allegation determined. For example, a warrant might 
  be issued but the person never arrested until after the sentence had expired. 
  Alternatively, the person might have been released on a promise to appear but 
  not actually dealt with for the breach allegation until after the sentence had 
  expired. In both those cases, there would be no effective sanction remaining 
  despite the breach of the conditional sentence. Section 742.6(10) stops the 
  sentence running to avoid these consequences. However, the subsection also catches 
  within its terms persons who are in custody because they have been arrested 
  without a warrant or the warrant has been executed.</p> <P>
  [17] Section 742.6(12) relieves against the harshness of the result of the offender 
  being in custody by providing that the conditional sentence begins to run again 
  &quot;on the making of an order to detain the offender in custody under subsection 
  515(6)&quot;. The sentence continues to run while the offender is detained under 
  that order. However, pursuant to s. 742.6(13), which refers to the Prisons and 
  Reformatories Act, the offender does not receive any remission for any time 
  spent in custody on the detention order. Once the judge makes the breach determination 
  and decides that the offender should serve some or the balance of the sentence 
  in custody, the Prisons and Reformatories Act would apply and the offender would 
  get remission on that part of the sentence remaining to be served in custody.</p> <P>
  [18] The narrow issue in this case is the meaning of the phrase &quot;on the 
  making of an order to detain the offender in custody under subsection 515(6)&quot;. 
  The appellant contends that as soon as the offender is brought before a justice, 
  a detention order is made and therefore, unless the offender shows cause, he 
  or she is in custody under s. 515(6) and the sentence begins to run again. The 
  appellant's position is that it should not matter whether there has been a formal 
  show cause hearing, as long as the offender remains in custody and is not serving 
  any other sentence.</p> <P>
  [19] The Crown's position is that a detention order within the meaning of s. 
  515(6) and 742.6(12) means the formal order detaining the offender after a show 
  cause hearing. In the appellant's case he requested adjournments of the show 
  cause hearings when he was arrested on the three previous breaches and the conditional 
  sentence did not run during those periods. The Crown counsel particularly relies 
  upon s. 742.6(16), which allows a court to order that some or all of the period 
  of suspension be deemed to be time served under the conditional sentence. She 
  submits that Parliament turned its mind to the possibility of unfairness and 
  thus gave the judge the discretion to relieve against it in special circumstances.</p> <P>
  [20] In my view, for the purpose of s. 742.6 it does not matter whether there 
  has been a formal show cause hearing. I do not find it helpful to distinguish 
  between the order made detaining the offender pending his attempt, if any, to 
  show cause why he should be released and the &quot;formal&quot; detention order 
  made after the show cause hearing. In either case, the justice makes an order 
  detaining the offender in custody. The main purpose of the reference to s. 515(6), 
  in my view, is a procedural one, to place the burden on the offender to show 
  cause for his release. Whether he is detained in custody while he is given an 
  opportunity to do so or whether the is detained after he has been given the 
  opportunity, he can fairly be said to be detained under s. 515(6).</p> <P>
  [21] In my view, this interpretation is consistent with the purpose of s. 742.6(10) 
  and the companion provisions. Parliament was concerned that persons would be 
  at large and their sentence expire before the conditional sentence breach allegation 
  was dealt with. As the appellant observes the purpose of these provisions, which 
  were enacted in 1999, &quot;was to ensure that an offender receives his or her 
  original punishment when a condition of release failed and justified detention, 
  not to create an artificial gap through which an offender would be further punished&quot;. 
  Parliament's purpose does not require that an offender who is already in custody 
  as a result of the breach allegation get no credit for that time in custody. 
  I simply cannot see any legitimate reason why Parliament would distinguish between 
  an offender in custody before or after the bail hearing. In either situation, 
  the offender is no longer in the community.</p> <P>
  [22] I am not persuaded that s. 742.6(16) should lead to a different result. 
  First, s. 742.6(16) applies only &quot;in exceptional cases&quot;. It seems 
  to me that Parliament must have had in mind an unusual case where the offender 
  was not in custody but should nevertheless be given some credit for that time, 
  even though he or she was found to have breached the condition. It seems to 
  me that this interpretation is borne out by the terms of s. 742.6(17) which 
  set out the factors the court must consider in the exercise of the discretion 
  under s. 742.6(16). For convenience I will set out that subsection and subsection 
  (16):</p> 
<P class="indent"> (16) If a court is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, 
  that the offender has without reasonable excuse, the proof of which lies on 
  the offender, breached a condition of the conditional sentence order, the court 
  may, in exceptional cases and in the interests of justice, order that some or 
  all of the period of suspension referred to in subsection (10) is deemed to 
  be time served under the conditional sentence.</p>
<P class="indent"> (17) In exercising its discretion under subsection (16), a 
  court shall consider</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) the circumstances and seriousness of the breach; </p>
<P class="indent"> (b) whether not making the order would cause the offender undue 
  hardship based on the offender's individual circumstances; and</p>
<P class="indent"> (c) the period for which the offender was subject to conditions 
  while the running of the conditional sentence was suspended and whether the 
  offender complied with those conditions during that period. </p>
<P class="indent"> [Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [23] I particularly rely on paragraph (c) of that subsection. The reference 
  to &quot;conditions while the running of the conditional sentence was suspended&quot; 
  would seem to refer to a time when the offender is on a release order of some 
  kind. Thus understood, s. 742.6(16) is not to relieve against hardship for an 
  offender who was in custody for a period before the show cause hearing but an 
  offender who was not in custody for some reason, possibly on bail conditions 
  of some kind.</p> <P>
  [24] It also seems odd that an offender who was actually in jail would have 
  to meet the stringent &quot;exceptional cases&quot; test under s. 742.6(16) 
  to obtain some credit for that period of time whereas an offender who was not 
  in custody has a much easier threshold to meet simply because there was delay 
  in executing the warrant. Yet that would be the result because of the terms 
  of s. 742.6(14). Under that subsection, which for convenience I set out below, 
  the offender merely has to show an unreasonable delay in the execution of the 
  warrant.</p> 
<P class="indent"> (14) Despite subsection (10), if there was unreasonable delay 
  in the execution of a warrant, the court may, at any time, order that any period 
  between the issuance and execution of the warrant that it considers appropriate 
  in the interests of justice is deemed to be time served under the conditional 
  sentence unless the period has been so deemed under subsection (15).</p> 
<P>
  [25] Even if the provisions were ambiguous, the appeal would still have to succeed. 
  As Dickson J. said in Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney-General of Canada (1974), 
  19 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (S.C.C.) at 262, &quot;No authority is needed for the proposition 
  that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise, in the construction 
  and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a subject, then that statute 
  should be applied in such a manner as to favour the person against whom it is 
  sought to be enforced.&quot; The interpretation that favours the liberty of 
  the subject in this case is the interpretation that requires the sentence to 
  start running again immediately upon the offender being brought before a justice 
  and detained in custody either to await the show cause hearing under s. 515(6) 
  or to be dealt with in according to law in accordance with s. 515(6).</p> <P>
  [26] I acknowledge that this decision would appear to be at variance with the 
  decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Currie, [2001] M.J. No. 40. 
  It does not appear, however, that this argument was made to the court. It seems 
  that the parties simply assumed that the conditional sentence did not run until 
  the offender applied for and was refused bail.</p> <P>
  Disposition</p> <P>
  [27] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the decision of Thomson 
  J.</p>
<p> Signed: &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree M.A. Catzman J.A.&quot;<br>
