<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] For convenience, we deal with these appeals in the order in which they 
  were argued.</p>
<p>
  THE OHIP APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [2] OHIP appeals from the motions judge's order striking its claim. The motions 
  judge did so on the basis that the Dow Settlement Agreement (the &quot;Dow Agreement&quot;) 
  fully compromised and settled OHIP's subrogated claim in respect of all insurable 
  medical expenses, past, present and future, incurred by members of the plaintiffs' 
  class. We agree. </p>
<p>
  [3] Although we accept the submission that clauses 6.5 and 11.5 of the Dow Agreement 
  reserve the rights of the plaintiffs' class against other wrongdoers, the motions 
  judge found that the OHIP claim was fully satisfied. The plaintiffs' claim, 
  as it is asserted in this action, is broader than that of OHIP. There is nothing 
  left to the OHIP claim for expenses associated with health care provided to 
  the plaintiffs as a result of the breast implants, whereas the plaintiffs in 
  the present action are asserting new claims including, for example, several 
  damages for regulatory negligence. </p>
<p>
  THE MOTION AND CROSS-MOTION RELATING TO ADMISSION OF FURTHER EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [4] The motion (by Dow Corning) and the cross-motion (by OHIP) were directed 
  to an issue raised by OHIP for the first time on appeal. There is no suggestion 
  that the plaintffs' counsel did not have the authority to execute the Dow Agreement, 
  which included the settlement of OHIP's subrogated claims. In light of our conclusion, 
  above, we do not need to decide the motion and cross-motion. </p>
<p>
  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [5] The Attorney General appeals the motions judge's order dismissing its motion 
  to dismiss the plaintiffs' action in its entirety.</p>
<p>
  [6] We agree with the motions judge's determination of this issue and with the 
  reasons he gave. He dismissed the Attorney General's motion because he did not 
  accept that the Settlement Agreements were &quot;subject matter releases&quot; 
  that barred any proceeding of any nature or kind against any person or entity 
  based on the breast implants. He concluded that the Settlement Agreements barred 
  any proceeding against any released party but did not bar any proceeding asserting 
  a several liability claim against another party who might then seek to add a 
  released party as a third party. He ordered the plaintiffs to amend their statement 
  of claim to limit their claim to the several liability of the Attorney General, 
  failing which their claim would be struck. As he noted, if there are no several 
  damages, that matter may be dealt with after a trial or on a motion differently 
  constituted on a full record.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Attorney General submitted that it was a third party beneficiary to 
  the Dow Agreement and ought to be able to rely on its provisions. We agree with 
  the motions judge that there is no basis to support an inference that the Dow 
  Agreement was intended to protect the Attorney General. </p>
<p>
  [8] The Attorney General argued that it was an abuse of process for the plaintiffs 
  to settle all claims relating to the breast implants and thereafter elect to 
  sue the government regulator for the same damages. In our view, the answer is 
  that the cause of action asserted in the present case is different in nature 
  and kind from the claim that the plaintiffs settled in the previous proceedings. 
  For the same reason, we reject the submission that it was an abuse of process 
  for the plaintiffs to have failed to sue the Attorney General in the prior proceedings 
  and that it was an abuse of process for the plaintiff Attis, who made a claim 
  against Dow in the Chapter 11 proceeding in the United States, to make the claim 
  asserted in the present action against the government regulator in Canada.</p>
<p>
  THE DOW APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [9] Dow's main argument is very similar to the first argument of the Attorney 
  General for Canada: that the advancement of the claims in the present action 
  is a violation of the Dow Agreement in which the plaintiffs waived all of their 
  claims relating to breast implants.</p>
<p>
  [10] For the reasons given above, we disagree. The causes of action advanced 
  in the present action differ in nature and kind from those asserted in the prior 
  proceedings, and the plaintiffs' agreement to indemnify Dow with respect to 
  any award relating to defective breast implants is not tantamount to an agreement 
  not to sue anyone, including a claim for several liability against the government 
  regulator. </p>
<p>
  [11] Dow argues that Attis attorned to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court 
  in the United States by filing her claim there and that she is bound by the 
  terms of the waiver and release of Dow implant claims in that proceeding. We 
  have not been referred to any such waiver and release but, in any event, the 
  causes of action in the two proceedings are different and Attis is not disentitled 
  from bringing the present action by reason of the claim she has filed in the 
  American proceeding.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION </p>
<p>
  [12] All of the appeals against the motions judge's order are dismissed. The 
  plaintiffs are entitled to their costs against the Attorney General, in the 
  amount of $10,000, and against Dow, in the amount of $5,000. The Attorney General 
  is entitled to costs of $2,500 against OHIP. Dow is entitled to costs of $1,500 
  against OHIP. All figures are inclusive of fees, disbursements and G.S.T. and 
  include costs reserved to this panel of the motion and cross-motion for leave 
  to admit further evidence. </p>
