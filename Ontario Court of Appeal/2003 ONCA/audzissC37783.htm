<p>On appeal from the order of Justice G. Patrick Smith of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 29, 2002 and from the order of Justice Helen Pierce 
  dated May 28, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] These two appeals raise issues related to an elector's right to challenge 
  an elected municipal official in respect of his election campaign finances. 
  In the first proceeding, Ken Audziss and four other electors brought an application 
  in the Superior Court under the Municipal Elections Act 1996, S.O. 1996, c. 
  32 (the &quot;MEA&quot;) for an order, among other relief, that Orville Santa, 
  a municipal councillor for the City of Thunder Bay, forfeit his seat on the 
  ground that he had contravened certain provisions of the MEA governing election 
  campaign finances. That application was stayed by Smith J. on the basis that 
  the court had no jurisdiction to grant the requested remedy. Ken Audziss then 
  swore an information against Santa in the Ontario Court of Justice based on 
  the same alleged contraventions of the MEA. In the second proceeding, on application 
  by Santa for certiorari and prohibition, the process issued by the justice of 
  the peace compelling Santa to appear in the Ontario Court of Justice in answer 
  to the charges, was quashed by order of Pierce J. </p>
<p>
  [2] The electors appeal from the stay of their application under the MEA. Audziss 
  appeals from the order quashing the summons issued by the justice of the peace 
  and seeks leave to appeal from the costs order in that proceeding. Santa seeks 
  leave to cross-appeal on the issue of costs in both proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [3] The question central to both appeals is whether the election campaign finance 
  provisions of the MEA constitute a complete code of procedure pursuant to which 
  the right to commence proceedings is reserved to the municipal council, and 
  an elector's remedy is limited to judicial review of a council's refusal to 
  take action. In my view, the MEA does so constitute a complete code of procedure. 
  Consequently, I see no reason to interfere with the result in both proceedings 
  under appeal. I am also of the view that there is no basis to interfere with 
  the costs awards in either proceeding. I would therefore dismiss the two appeals 
  and the cross-appeal. I will deal with each proceeding in turn and then deal 
  with the issue of costs.</p>
<p>
  I. The Application for relief under the MEA and the Municipal Act</p>
<p>
  [4] Orville Santa was elected councillor for the Red River Ward in the City 
  of Thunder Bay at the election held on November 13, 2000. Ken Audziss and the 
  other appellants were electors in that election. On April 2, 2001, Santa filed 
  a financial statement with the clerk of the municipality with respect to his 
  election campaign finances, as he is required to do under s.78 of the MEA. A 
  candidate who fails to file a financial statement in accordance with the requirements 
  of the Act is subject to a number of penalties under s.80: </p>
<p class="indent"> 80. (1) A candidate is subject to the penalties listed in subsection 
  (2), in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed under this Act, if,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) he or she fails to file a document as required under section 
  78 by the relevant date;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a document filed under section 78 shows a surplus, as described 
  in section 79, and the candidate fails to pay the amount required by section 
  79 to the clerk by the relevant date; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a document filed under section 78 shows on its face that 
  the candidate has incurred expenses exceeding what is permitted under section 
  76. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 80 (1).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The following penalties apply: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The candidate forfeits any office to which he or she was 
  elected and the office shall be deemed to be vacant.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Until the next regular election has taken place, the candidate 
  is ineligible to be elected or appointed to any office to which this Act applies. 
  1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 80 (2).</p>
<p>
  [5] Audziss examined the financial statement filed by Santa and formed the opinion 
  that Santa had exceeded the statutory limit on his election campaign expenses 
  and was therefore subject to these penalties. On April 20, 2001, Audziss therefore 
  filed a request with the clerk requesting a compliance audit under s.81 of the 
  MEA. As s. 81 is central to this appeal, I set out the full text for ease of 
  reference.</p>
<p> <span class="indent">81. (1) An elector who is entitled to vote in an election 
  and believes on reasonable grounds that a candidate has contravened a provision 
  of this Act relating to election campaign finances may apply for a compliance 
  audit of the candidate's election campaign finances. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 
  81 (1).</span></p>
<p class="indent">(2) The application shall be made to the clerk of the municipality 
  or the secretary of the local board for which the candidate was nominated for 
  office, within 90 days after the filing date or the candidate's supplementary 
  filing date, if any; it shall be in writing and shall set out the reasons for 
  the elector's belief. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (2).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Within 30 days after receiving the application, the council 
  or local board, as the case may be, shall consider the application and decide 
  whether it should be granted or rejected. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (3).</p>
<p class="indent">(4) If the council or local board decides to grant the application 
  it shall, by resolution, appoint an auditor to conduct a compliance audit of 
  the candidate's election campaign finances. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (4).</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Only an auditor who is licensed under the Public Accountancy 
  Act may be appointed under subsection (4). 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (5).</p>
<p class="indent">(6) An auditor appointed under subsection (4) shall promptly 
  conduct an audit of the candidate's election campaign finances to determine 
  whether he or she has complied with the provisions of this Act relating to election 
  campaign finances and prepare a report outlining any apparent contravention 
  by the candidate. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (6).</p>
<p class="indent">(7) The auditor shall submit the report to,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the candidate;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the council or local board;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the clerk with whom the candidate filed his or her nomination; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) the applicant. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (7).</p>
<p class="indent">(8) For the purpose of the audit, the auditor,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) is entitled to have access, at all reasonable hours, to 
  all relevant books, papers, documents or things of the candidate and of the 
  municipality or local board; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) has the powers of a commission under Part II of the Public 
  Inquiries Act, which Part applies to the audit as if it were an inquiry under 
  that Act. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (8).</p>
<p class="indent">(9) The municipality or local board shall pay the auditor's 
  costs of performing the audit. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (9).</p>
<p class="indent">(10) The council or local board shall consider the report within 
  30 days after receiving it and may commence a legal proceeding against the candidate 
  for any apparent contravention of a provision of this Act relating to election 
  campaign finances. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (10).</p>
<p class="indent">(11) If the report indicates that there was no apparent contravention 
  and the council or local board finds that there were no reasonable grounds for 
  the application, the council or local board is entitled to recover the auditor's 
  costs from the applicant. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (11).</p>
<p class="indent">(12) No action or other proceeding for damages shall be instituted 
  against an auditor appointed under this section for any act done in good faith 
  in the execution or intended execution of the audit or for any alleged neglect 
  or default in its execution in good faith. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 81 (12).</p>
<p>
  [6] The city council voted on the matter on May 7, 2001 and rejected Audziss' 
  application for a compliance audit. Audziss, together with the other appellants, 
  then brought this application before the Superior Court of Justice seeking various 
  relief under both the MEA and the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. M.50. The application under the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act 
  is not the subject-matter of this appeal and no further reference will be made 
  to that part of the application.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellants purported to bring their application under s. 83 of the MEA 
  which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 83. (1) A person who is entitled to vote in an election may 
  make an application to the Ontario Court (General Division) requesting that 
  it determine,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) whether the election is valid;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) whether a person's election to an office in the election 
  is valid;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) if a person's election to an office is not valid, whether 
  another person was validly elected or is entitled to the office;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) if an election is not valid or a person's election to an 
  office is not valid, whether a by-election should be held. 1996, c. 32, Sched., 
  s. 83 (1).</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellants sought the following relief before the Superior Court: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) An order pursuant to s. 80(2) of the Municipal Elections 
  Act that the councillor forfeit the office of councillor to which he was elected;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A declaration that the seat held by the councillor be declared 
  vacant;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) An order that councillor Santa is ineligible to be elected 
  or appointed to any office to which the Municipal Elections Act applies, until 
  after the next regular election has taken place;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) A declaration that the councillor has contravened ss. 76(4) 
  of the Municipal Elections Act;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) A declaration that the councillor has contravened ss. 78(1) 
  of the Municipal Elections Act;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) An order requiring the councillor to file with the clerk 
  of the Corporation of the City of Thunder Bay an Auditor's Report, in the prescribed 
  form, reflecting the candidate's election campaign finances;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) An order requiring the respondent to deliver a sworn affidavit 
  of documents in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) An order granting leave to conduct examination for discovery 
  of the respondent; and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) An order requiring the respondent to submit to an audit 
  by the applicants' auditor, who shall have the power and authority as set forth 
  at ss. 81(8) of the Municipal Elections Act.</p>
<p>
  [9] In an amended application, the appellants also sought a declaration that 
  the respondent's seat as a councillor be declared vacant pursuant to the following 
  general provision contained in the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45: </p>
<p class="indent">
  44. (1) Any elector entitled to vote at the election of members of a council 
  may commence an application in the Ontario Court (General Division) for a declaration 
  that the office of a member of such council has become vacant in accordance 
  with this Act. </p>
<p>
  [10] It is important to note that the Municipal Act does not contain any provisions 
  relating to election campaign finances and the appellants did not rely on any 
  specific provisions of that Act. </p>
<p>
  [11] Santa brought a motion under s.106 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43 for a stay of the application under the MEA and the Municipal 
  Act on the ground that the clerk and the municipal council have the exclusive 
  authority to determine whether a candidate is in violation of the campaign expenditure 
  provisions of the MEA. Based on the reasoning of the Divisional Court in Rayside 
  v. Ontario (Commission on Election Finances) (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 287 and a 
  review of the MEA, the applications judge concluded that the court had no jurisdiction 
  under that statute to entertain the appellants' application. The Divisional 
  Court in Rayside had considered an elector's right to bring an action to contest 
  the campaign expenditures of a candidate under the predecessor legislation and 
  had concluded that there was no such right. The applications judge held that 
  the reasoning in Rayside was equally applicable to the current legislative scheme. 
  He held further that the specific provisions of the MEA relating to election 
  campaign finances prevailed over the more general provisions under the Municipal 
  Act. Consequently, Santa's motion was granted by Smith J. on January 24, 2002 
  and the application under both those statutes was stayed.</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellants do not contest the correctness of the Divisional Court's 
  decision in Rayside. They submit, rather, that the analysis in that case no 
  longer applies to the current version of the MEA. In order to better understand 
  their position, it is necessary to review the decision of the Divisional Court 
  in some detail. </p>
<p>
  [13] In Rayside, a similar issue arose under the immediate predecessor to the 
  MEA, the 1990 version of the Municipal Elections Act (the &quot;1990 MEA&quot;). 
  In that case, an elector brought an action under s. 122 of the 1990 MEA for 
  a declaration that the election of a municipal councillor was null and void, 
  and for an order removing her from office on the ground that she had incurred 
  campaign expenses in excess of the amount permitted by the Act. The trial judge 
  held that the councillor had contravened the election campaign finance provisions 
  of the statute and consequently declared the election void, removed the official 
  from office and ordered that a by-election be held to fill the vacancy. This 
  decision was overturned on appeal to the Divisional Court. Among other things, 
  the Divisional Court held that there was no evidence to support the finding 
  that the councillor had exceeded the permissible limit on her expenses. This 
  finding, however, had no bearing on the court's reasoning on the jurisdictional 
  issue. </p>
<p>
  [14] On the jurisdictional issue, the Divisional Court held firstly that an 
  elector has no inherent right to apply to the court to have a seat of a municipal 
  councillor declared vacant and held that the right of an elector to make such 
  an application must be expressly provided by statute: see R. v. Skelton (1911), 
  23 O.L.R. 182 (H.C.J.), per Middleton J. at p. 185; R. v. Curry (1919), 46 O.L.R. 
  297 (Ont.Sup.Ct. H.C.Div.), per Masten J. at p. 304. The elector took the position 
  that the necessary statutory authorization could be found in s. 122 of the 1990 
  MEA which gave an elector the right to commence an action to contest the validity 
  of an election or to determine whether any person is guilty of a corrupt practice 
  respecting an election. Section 122 read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 122.(1) The validity of an election or of the election of any 
  person to any office at such an election or whether or not any person is guilty 
  of a corrupt practice respecting an election shall be tried and determined by 
  an action commenced in the Ontario Court (General Division). </p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the court determines that a person has committed a 
  corrupt practice, it may, in addition to any other penalty, impose the penalties 
  provided therefor under sections 112 to 118.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Any elector entitled to vote at an election referred to 
  in subsection (1) may commence an action under this section in relation to such 
  election.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) No action shall be commenced after the expiration of ninety 
  days following the date of the poll at the election referred to in subsection 
  (1).</p>
<p>
  [15] The Divisional Court reviewed the history of the legislative regulation 
  of campaign expenditures. That history is helpful in understanding the background 
  to the legislative scheme under the current MEA. I therefore set out that part 
  of the analysis in Rayside at pp. 291-93: </p>
<p class="indent"> The earliest predecessor to the MEA received royal assent on 
  June 30, 1972 [Municipal Elections Act, 1972, S.O. 1972, c. 95] &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The 1977 amendments [Municipal Elections Act, 1977, S.O. 1977, 
  c. 62] first introduced the regulation of election finances. That Act conferred 
  upon the municipalities the power to pass a by-law limiting election expenditures 
  and requiring the disclosure of election contributions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Municipal Elections Amendment Act, 1982 (No. 2) S.O. 1982, 
  c. 37 (the &quot;1982 Act&quot;), set out the specific terms that a municipality's 
  election finances by-law could contain but reserved to the municipality the 
  decision of whether to pass a by-law.</p>
<p class="indent">The election finances by-law under the 1982 Act required, inter 
  alia, that each candidate file a report containing disclosure of contributions, 
  contributors and expenses with the clerk of the municipality within 90 days 
  of the date of the election.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1982 Act, a contravention of the election finances by-law 
  passed by a municipality was deemed to be a corrupt practice. The 1982 Act further 
  provided that an action by an elector as to whether or not a person was guilty 
  of the corrupt practice of contravening the by-law could be commenced up to 
  180 days (rather than 90 days in the case of other corrupt practices) following 
  the date of the election, thus allowing an elector time to bring an action after 
  the filing by a candidate of the report with the clerk. In other words, the 
  1982 Act provided a mechanism whereby an elector could challenge an election 
  on the basis of campaign expenses.</p>
<p class="indent">The provisions providing for the passing by a municipality of 
  the election finance by-law, the deeming of a contravention of the by-law to 
  be a corrupt practice and the right of an elector to bring an action in respect 
  of such contravention up to 180 days after the election were repealed coincident 
  with the coming into force of Parts II and III of the current MEA. The reduction 
  of the time limit in which an elector could commence an action from 180 to 90 
  days, coincident with an extension of the time limits respecting candidate filings 
  of financial statements can only be viewed as a conscious effort on the part 
  of the Legislature to exclude electors from challenging the propriety of elections 
  on the basis of the information contained in the financial statements. The disharmony 
  created by the changes to the legislation makes it all but impossible for an 
  elector to mount a challenge on the basis of election finances.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, with the coming into force of Parts II and III 
  of the MEA, an elector's right to bring an action in respect of campaign contributions 
  and expenditures was terminated.</p>
<p>
  [16] The Divisional Court then considered Parts II and III of the 1990 MEA which 
  both contained provisions with respect to election campaign finances. Under 
  that legislative scheme, unless a municipality passed a by-law opting into Part 
  III, only Part II applied to its elections. If a municipality opted into Part 
  III, the Commission on Election Finances (&quot;the Commission&quot;) became 
  involved. The Commission was a statutory body created to ensure adherence to 
  campaign contribution and expenditure limits and disclosure procedures in respect 
  of provincial elections. Under Part III of the 1990 MEA, the Commission was 
  incorporated by reference as having the same powers and duties in respect of 
  municipal elections. The municipality in question in Rayside had chosen to have 
  Part III apply to its elections.</p>
<p>
  [17] Provision was made in Part II of the 1990 MEA for an elector to request 
  a compliance audit, in much the same terms as found under the current MEA. Unlike 
  the current statute, however, the 1990 MEA provided for a right of appeal to 
  the Commission from a rejection by council of an elector's application for a 
  compliance audit. Further, under the 1990 MEA no prosecution could be instituted 
  in respect of alleged contraventions of the election campaign finance provisions 
  without the consent of the Commission. The Divisional Court concluded that the 
  Legislature, in enacting Parts II and III of the 1990 MEA, intended to give 
  exclusive jurisdiction to the Commission in the regulation of campaign expenditures. 
  Consequently, an elector's private action under s. 122 could not be brought 
  in respect of an official's election campaign finances. The only remedy available 
  to an elector who was refused an audit by the Commission was to apply for judicial 
  review of that decision. Rayside's action was therefore dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [18] The appellants argued in this case that, because the Commission was abolished 
  when the current version of the MEA was passed in 1996, the legislative scheme 
  essentially reverted back to the pre-Commission days when, as stated in Rayside, 
  &quot;the 1982 Act provided a mechanism whereby an elector could challenge an 
  election on the basis of campaign expenses.&quot; The applications judge in 
  this case rejected this argument and stated as follows at paras. 14-17: </p>
<p class="indent"> [14] A comparison of the Municipal Elections Act, R.S.O. 1990 
  and the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 indicates that the legislation is similar 
  in nature. The Commission on Election Finances is abolished but the 1996 amendments 
  carry forth the substance of the 1990 statute.</p>
<p class="indent">[15] In my opinion, the legislature of the province of Ontario 
  has delegated authority for making the decision as to whether to require a compliance 
  audit of a candidate's election campaign finances exclusively to the council 
  of a municipality pursuant to Section 81(3) of the Municipal Elections Act, 
  1996.</p>
<p class="indent">[16] Section 81(10) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 delegates 
  the authority to a city council to commence legal proceedings against a candidate 
  for any apparent contravention of a provision of this Act relating to election 
  campaign finances.</p>
<p class="indent">[17] Therefore, based on the reasoning of the Rayside case and 
  a review of the Municipal Elections Act 1996, I find that this court has no 
  jurisdiction to entertain the application before it only so far as it pertains 
  to the Municipal Elections Act 1996. Without jurisdiction a court cannot grant 
  a remedy. Without the ability to grant a remedy proceedings before the court 
  are without foundation.</p>
<p>
  [19] I agree with the analysis in Rayside. I also agree with the applications 
  judge's conclusion in this case that the 1990 legislative scheme considered 
  by the Divisional Court was substantially carried forth in the current MEA. 
  The general right of an elector to contest the validity of an election set out 
  in s. 122 of the 1990 MEA, which was found by the Divisional Court in Rayside 
  not to provide statutory authority for an elector to challenge a candidate's 
  campaign finances, has been carried over in s. 83 of the MEA. The provisions 
  relating to the compliance audit remain essentially the same. An elector who 
  is entitled to vote in an election and believes on reasonable grounds that a 
  candidate has contravened a provision of the MEA relating to election campaign 
  finances may apply to the clerk of a municipality for a compliance audit of 
  the candidate's election campaign finances. The council or local board of a 
  municipality may accept or reject the application. If the application is accepted 
  and a compliance audit is conducted, the authority to commence legal proceedings 
  against a candidate or official for any apparent contravention of the MEA relating 
  to election campaign finances rests with council of the municipality under s. 
  81(10). The only material distinction between the 1990 MEA and the current legislative 
  scheme is that the 1990 MEA provided a right of appeal to the Commission from 
  council's rejection of the elector's application. The Commission's decision 
  was then subject to judicial review. In the current legislative scheme, there 
  is no Commission or right of appeal but the availability of judicial review 
  in respect of council's decision is nonetheless available. See MacPump Developments 
  Ltd. v. Sarnia (City) (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 755 (C.A.) on the right to judicial 
  review of a decision of a municipal council made in the exercise of a statutory 
  power. Hence, from the elector's point of view, the right to challenge a municipal 
  official in respect of election campaign finances remains effectively the same. 
  The elector can apply to the clerk of the municipality for a compliance audit 
  and the rejection of his or her application is subject to judicial review. </p>
<p>
  [20] In my view, the legislative scheme with respect to election campaign finances 
  would be redundant, if not defeated, if a parallel private right to bring an 
  application based on the same alleged contraventions were to be maintained under 
  the general right to contest the validity of an election under s. 83. The relief 
  sought by the appellants on their application was no different than that available 
  under the MEA had council chosen to conduct a compliance audit. Further, it 
  is my view that s. 44 of the Municipal Act does not provide a basis for bringing 
  this application. It gives an elector the right to &quot;commence an application 
  &#133; for a declaration that the office of a member of &#133; council has become 
  vacant in accordance with this Act.&quot; None of the grounds relied on by the 
  appellants for seeking such a declaration is contained in the Municipal Act. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] For these reasons, I would conclude that the appellants had no standing 
  to bring this application. I see no merit to their further argument that the 
  applications judge should nonetheless have granted them declaratory relief. 
  I would therefore dismiss their appeal from the stay entered by Smith J. </p>
<p>
  II. The Application for Certiorari and Prohibition</p>
<p>
  [22] The stay in the above-noted application was entered on January 24, 2002. 
  Several weeks later, on March 4, 2002, Audziss swore a private information before 
  a justice of the peace stating that he had reasonable and probable grounds to 
  believe that Santa contravened sections 69(1)(c), 69(1)(d), 69(1)(k), 76(4), 
  78(1) and 89(h) of the MEA. The justice of the peace issued a summons under 
  s. 24 of the Provincial Offences Act R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (the &quot;POA&quot;). 
  The offence provisions in question and other relevant provisions of the MEA 
  and the POA read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Relevant offence provisions under the MEA</p>
<p class="indent">69. (1) A candidate shall ensure that,</p>

<p class="indent"> 78. (1) On or before the filing date, a candidate shall file 
  with the clerk with whom the nomination was filed a financial statement and 
  auditor's report, each in the prescribed form, reflecting the candidate's election 
  campaign finances,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) in the case of a regular election, as of December 31 in 
  the year of the election; and</p>

  six months. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 90 (1).</p>
<p class="indent"> 91. (1) If a candidate is convicted of a corrupt practice under

  and becomes vacant; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) he or she is ineligible to be nominated for or elected 
  or appointed to any office until the sixth anniversary of voting day. 1996, 
  c. 32, Sched., s. 91 (1).</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) However, if the presiding judge finds that the candidate 
  committed the corrupt practice without any intent of causing or contributing 
  to a false outcome of the election, clause (1) (b) does not apply. 1996, c. 
  32, Sched., s. 91 (2).</p>
<p class="indent"> 92. (1) A corporation or trade union that contravenes any of

<p class="indent"> (3) If the expenses incurred by or on behalf of a candidate 
  exceed the amount determined for the office under section 76, the candidate

<p class="indent"> (4) No prosecution for a contravention of any of sections 69 
  to 79 shall be commenced more than one year after the facts on which it is based

<p class="indent"> (5) A candidate is guilty of an offence and, on conviction, 
  in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed under this Act, is subject 
  to the penalties described in subsection 80 (2), if he or she,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) files a document under section 78 that is incorrect or 
  otherwise does not comply with that section; or</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) incurs expenses that exceed what is permitted under section 
  76. 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 92 (5).</p>
<p class="indent"> (6) However, if the presiding judge finds that the candidate, 
  acting in good faith, committed the offence inadvertently or because of an error

<p class="indent">Relevant provisions of the POA </p>

  by order grant any relief in respect of matters arising under this Act that 
  the applicant would be entitled to in an application for an order in the nature 
  of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari.</p>
<p>
  [23] On April 2, 2002, Santa made an application under s. 140 of the POA for 
  an order quashing the summons issued by the justice of the peace. His application 
  was granted by Pierce J. on May 28, 2002. The applications judge was of the 
  view that an order in the nature of certiorari and prohibition should be issued 
  for three reasons: (a) the justice of the peace did not have jurisdiction to 
  issue process because he did not have the jurisdiction to try the offences in 
  question; (b) under s. 81(10) of the MEA, the council or local board of a municipality 
  had the sole authority to allege a contravention of the election campaign finance 
  provisions of the statute; and (c) the laying of the information by Audziss 
  constituted a collateral attack on the decision of Smith J. Consequently, the 
  applications judge quashed the summons issued by the justice of the peace and 
  issued an order prohibiting any justice of the peace from hearing allegations 
  concerning the matter. </p>
<p>
  [24] In my view, there was no basis for making an order in the nature of prohibition. 
  If I understand the reasons of the applications judge correctly, that part of 
  the order appears to have been based on the belief that the justice of the peace, 
  in issuing process, was in effect taking a first step in exercising jurisdiction 
  to try the offences. The applications judge held that the justice of the peace 
  did not have the jurisdiction to issue process in this matter because only a 
  judge could try offences under the MEA. In my respectful view, the applications 
  judge failed to appreciate that the POA clearly gives a justice of the peace 
  authority to issue process in relation to any provincial offence, whether or 
  not the justice of the peace has the jurisdiction to try that offence. Hence, 
  that part of the order prohibiting any justice of the peace from, in effect, 
  trying the matter that was the subject-matter of the information was neither 
  requested by Santa nor required.</p>
<p>
  [25] It is my view, however, that the process issued by the justice of the peace 
  was properly quashed. It should be noted that it is the summons issued by the 
  justice of the peace that is quashed and not the information itself. The information 
  appears regular on its face and no grounds have been advanced to show that it 
  was not properly received by the justice of the peace. However, I agree with 
  the applications judge that, in light of the legislative scheme under the MEA, 
  the justice of the peace erred in issuing process compelling Santa to appear 
  in answer to charges laid by a private elector. </p>
<p>
  [26] In support of her conclusions, the applications judge reiterated the finding 
  made by Smith J. in the earlier proceeding that the MEA constituted a complete 
  code of procedure that vested exclusive authority in the council to commence 
  proceedings in respect of any alleged contravention of the provisions concerning 
  election campaign finances. She stated that the purpose for vesting discretion 
  in the council was to limit attacks on elected officials. She concluded that, 
  while the wording of the MEA is &quot;far from clear&quot;, its provisions with 
  respect to the compliance audit would be rendered meaningless if an individual 
  elector was permitted to lay an information in respect of the same alleged contraventions. 
  She noted that the general provisions of the POA are procedural, not substantive, 
  in nature and that, as such, they did not provide an alternative source of redress 
  for an aggrieved elector. She also rejected Audziss' submission that the laying 
  of the information constituted a distinct and separate procedure. She stated 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect, I do not accept this submission. Mr. Audziss elected to commence 
  a proceeding in the Superior Court to challenge the applicant's election spending. 
  The allegations made are the same as those in the private information laid. 
  When the decision in the Superior Court is adverse, he cannot choose another 
  forum to litigate the same issues in hope of a better result. It is telling 
  that he did not reveal the fact of Mr. Justice Smith's decision to the justice 
  of the peace. The ex parte proceeding was conducted in the absence of Mr. Santa. 
  Even if the justice of the peace had jurisdiction to hear the matter, he would 
  have be[en] entitled to consider whether the decision of Mr. Justice Smith was 
  binding on him. Mr. Audziss had a duty to bring the decision to the attention 
  of the justice of the peace.</p>
<p>
  [27] The general right of a private person to lay an information in respect 
  of an offence created by a provincial statute is found in s.23(1) of the POA 
  reproduced earlier. The MEA is a provincial statute and it creates a number 
  of offences. There is no express restriction or limitation in the MEA on an 
  individual's right to lay an information in respect of any offences contained 
  in that statute. The question that arises is whether it is implicit that the 
  Legislature intended to reserve that right to the council or local board of 
  a municipality in respect of election campaign finances when it enacted s. 81(10). 
  As set out above, that section authorizes the council or local board, following 
  the conduct of a compliance audit, to &quot;commence a legal proceeding against 
  the candidate for any apparent contravention of a provision of this Act relating 
  to election campaign finances.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [28] I certainly agree with the applications judge's comment that the statute 
  is far from clear on whether an elector, or only council, can lay an information 
  in respect of an alleged contravention of the MEA with respect to election campaign 
  finances. Nonetheless, when the provisions relating to election campaign finances 
  are considered in their entirety, it is my view that the conclusion reached 
  by the applications judge is the only one that can provide coherence to the 
  legislative scheme. Having regard to: a candidate's obligations under the MEA 
  in relation to election campaign finances; the automatic sanctions that apply 
  upon the clerk serving notice of default; the elector's right to apply for a 
  compliance audit to ensure compliance with these provisions; the council's obligation 
  to consider that application and its power to appoint an auditor; the council's 
  obligation to consider any report resulting from a compliance audit and its 
  power to commence a legal proceeding against the candidate for any apparent 
  contravention of a provision relating to election campaign finances; and finally 
  an elector's right to seek judicial review in respect of the council's decision; 
  it is my view that the Legislature did not intend that an elector could simply 
  by-pass the whole process and lay a private information. This interpretation 
  is also one which, in my view, achieves a proper balance between an elector's 
  right to challenge an elected official in regard to his or her statutory obligations 
  and the need to limit, and to ensure the legitimacy of, attacks on elected officials. 
  </p>
<p>
  [29] Hence, I would conclude that an elector's general right to lay an information 
  in respect of provincial offences has effectively been superseded by the legislative 
  scheme contained in the MEA in relation to election campaign finances. In light 
  of my conclusion on this point, it is not necessary to decide whether the laying 
  of an information by Audziss constituted a collateral attack on the decision 
  of Smith J. </p>
<p>
  [30] Consequently, I would conclude that the process issued by the justice of 
  the peace was properly quashed and I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  III. The Appeal and the Cross-Appeal on Costs </p>
<p>
  [31] Smith J. ordered costs against the appellants on a partial indemnity basis 
  fixed at $7,155. Santa seeks leave to cross-appeal from that order. He argued 
  that costs should have been awarded on a substantial indemnity basis and for 
  the full amount that he was requesting. He notes, in particular, that there 
  were outstanding offers to settle to which Justice Smith made no reference. 
  The offers to settle, if accepted, would have resulted in the abandonment of 
  the appellants' application in respect of the MEA without costs. </p>
<p>
  [32] I would dismiss Santa's leave to appeal Smith J.'s order. Although the 
  applications judge made no express reference to the offers to settle relied 
  upon by Santa in support of his claim for costs on the higher scale, he specifically 
  adverted to the question whether costs should be awarded on a partial or substantial 
  indemnity basis. In my view, the applications judge made no error in awarding 
  costs on a partial indemnity basis. The jurisdictional question raised by the 
  application was a novel one with respect to the current legislative scheme and 
  it was entirely within the applications judge's discretion to award costs on 
  the lower scale. Further, I see no basis to interfere with the quantum of the 
  order of Pierce J. </p>
<p>
  [33] Pierce J. ordered costs against Audziss on a substantial indemnity basis 
  fixed at $15,099.19. Both parties seek leave to appeal from her order. Audziss 
  submits that the applications judge erred in fixing the costs instead of ordering 
  that they be assessed and Santa submits that she erred in failing to award him 
  the full amount that he was requesting. I see no merit to either submission. 
  I would not grant leave to appeal the costs order.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION </p>
<p>
  [34] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal in respect 
  of Smith J.'s order. I would delete paragraph 1(b) of Pierce J.'s order (the 
  prohibition order) and otherwise confirm her order and dismiss the appeal and 
  cross-appeal. The respondent may make written submissions in respect of the 
  costs of the two appeals within 14 days. The appellants may respond within 10 
  days thereafter. The respondent may reply, if so advised, within a further 5 
  days. </p>
