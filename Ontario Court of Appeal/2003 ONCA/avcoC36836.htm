<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice J. Stephen O'Neill of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 9, 2001, reported at (2001), 19 B.L.R. (3d) 174.</p>    <P>
  CHARRON J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The central issue in this appeal is whether the question of contributory 
  negligence is legally relevant in a case of negligent misrepresentation. The 
  appellant Barry Raymond Norman appeals from the trial judge's finding of contributory 
  negligence against him. Mr. Norman submits that, as a matter of law, a finding 
  of negligent misrepresentation, which necessarily includes a finding of reasonable 
  reliance on the part of a plaintiff, precludes a finding of contributory negligence 
  against that same party. Alternatively, he submits that, even if the two findings 
  can coexist at law, it was inappropriate for the trial judge, on the facts of 
  this case, to make a finding of contributory negligence once he had made a finding 
  of reasonable reliance. </p>    <P>
  [2] The respondent Avco Financial Services Realty Limited (&quot;Avco&quot;) 
  has chosen not to cross-appeal from the finding of liability for negligent misrepresentation 
  made against it. In responding to Mr. Norman's appeal, however, Avco challenges 
  the trial judge's holding that it was liable for negligent misrepresentation. 
  Avco argues that Mr. Norman was not only 50% responsible for his loss, but wholly 
  responsible, by reason of his failure to act reasonably in his own interest. 
  Alternatively, Avco submits that the trial judge's finding of contributory negligence 
  is not only sustainable at law, but entirely supported on the evidence. In either 
  case, Avco submits that the trial judge's assignment of liability to Mr. Norman 
  should not be disturbed.</p>    <P>
  1. The Findings at Trial </p>
<p>[3] Avco commenced this action to recover monies owed pursuant to a covenant 
  to pay under a second mortgage granted by Mr. Norman and his wife Yvonne Norman. 
  The mortgage loan was first obtained in 1988 for a one-year term. It was subsequently 
  renewed in 1989, and again in 1990, for successive one-year terms. At the time 
  the mortgage loan was obtained in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Norman also applied for, 
  and obtained from Avco<a href="#1">[1]</a>,<a name="r1"></a> creditor's life, 
  accident and sickness insurance. The term of the insurance policy was the same 
  as the term of the mortgage, namely one year. At the time Mr. and Mrs. Norman 
  renewed their mortgage in 1989, they reapplied for and obtained a further one-year 
  policy of insurance. However, by the time of the second renewal in 1990, Mrs. 
  Norman had been diagnosed with cancer and no longer qualified for the insurance 
  coverage. Mrs. Norman died during the course of the subsequent year, and Mr. 
  Norman was left with the full responsibility of paying the mortgage debt without 
  the benefit of insurance on the life of his wife. He subsequently fell into 
  arrears, and the property was sold under power of sale, leaving a deficiency 
  in the amount of $144,202.21. Avco sued for payment of this sum and related 
  expenses.</p>
<P>
  [4] In his statement of defence and counterclaim, Mr. Norman alleged, among 
  other things, that Avco had misrepresented the nature of the insurance policy 
  by failing to inform him and Mrs. Norman about the limited term of the policy 
  and the need to reapply for insurance upon each loan renewal. There was evidence 
  at trial that Mr. Norman relied on his wife to look after the family finances 
  and that Mrs. Norman had had experience with insurance and money-lending issues 
  while working as a bank employee. There was also evidence that the great majority 
  of insurance applications from other financial institutions did not provide 
  for a termination of insurance upon the renewing of the mortgage or loan transaction. 
  Mr. Norman alleged at trial that, were it not for Avco's negligent misrepresentation, 
  he and his wife would have obtained appropriate coverage with another insurer, 
  and his wife's policy of life insurance would have paid his debt to Avco. </p>    <P>
  [5] The trial judge rejected all other defences to the claim (they are not in 
  issue on this appeal), and found Mr. Norman liable under his covenant for the 
  deficiency. However, the trial judge also found Avco liable to Mr. Norman for 
  negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge held that, by reason of the relationship 
  between the parties, Avco had a duty to provide to Mr. Norman and his wife, 
  in a reasonably intelligible fashion, information about the salient and important 
  provisions of the loan insurance policy. He held that Avco breached its duty 
  of care by failing to clearly inform Mr. and Mrs. Norman, either orally or in 
  writing, that: the term of life insurance was limited to that of the mortgage, 
  namely one year; upon any renewal of the mortgage at the expiration of the term, 
  they would have to reapply and re-qualify for insurance coverage; and any intervening 
  illness or disability during the one year of coverage could disqualify either 
  one of them from obtaining subsequent insurance coverage. Although the insurance 
  form provided to, and signed by, Mr. and Mrs. Norman did stipulate the term 
  of the insurance coverage, the trial judge found that the form was ambiguous 
  and was insufficient to convey the necessary information to allow Mr. and Mrs. 
  Norman to make an informed decision as to whether or not they should purchase 
  the insurance in question. </p>    <P>
  [6] The trial judge held further that the insurance was important to Mr. and 
  Mrs. Norman. He was satisfied that, if they had known that the coverage was 
  limited to the term of the mortgage and that they would have to reapply and 
  re-qualify for insurance upon each mortgage renewal, they would have either 
  extended the term of the mortgage or would have attempted to make alternative 
  mortgage or insurance arrangements. He therefore found that, in all the circumstances, 
  Mr. and Mrs. Norman relied on Avco's representations to their detriment and 
  that this reliance was a proximate cause of the damages sustained by Mr. Norman 
  when no life insurance proceeds were available to pay out the balance of the 
  mortgage loan. </p>    <P>
  [7] Based on these findings, the trial judge concluded that Avco was liable 
  for negligent misrepresentation. It is noteworthy that the trial judge, in considering 
  Avco's liability for negligent misrepresentation, never expressly addressed 
  the question of whether the reliance by Mr. and Mrs. Norman on the representations 
  made by Avco's representative was reasonable in all the circumstances. More 
  will be said about this later. </p>    <P>
  [8] The trial judge then went on to find that Mr. Norman was contributorily 
  negligent and that his negligence had been just as significant as Avco's negligence 
  in contributing to his loss. Consequently, he apportioned the degree of fault 
  equally between the parties. It is important to consider the trial judge's analysis 
  on the question of contributory negligence. First he considered s. 3 of the 
  Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, which reads as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 3. In any action for damages that is founded upon the fault 
  or negligence of the defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of 
  the plaintiff that contributed to the damages, the court shall apportion the 
  damages in proportion to the degree of fault or negligence found against the 
  parties respectively.</p>
<p>[9] The trial judge next considered the analysis of the court in Grand Restaurants 
  of Canada Ltd. v. Toronto (City) (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 757 (H.C.J.), aff'd (1982), 
  39 O.R. (2d) 752 (C.A.), where Trainor J. considered the apparent inconsistency 
  between concurrent findings of negligent misrepresentation and contributory 
  negligence. Trainor J. stated the following at p. 775:</p>    
<P class="indent"> At first blush, there is perhaps some difficulty in finding 
  that a plaintiff ought to recover damages, for negligent misrepresentation, 
  which presupposes a reasonable reliance on the advice of the defendant, and 
  then to have his damages reduced on account of his reliance - a causa sine qua 
  non of his injury - being to some degree &quot;unreasonable&quot; or excessive. 
  But as the learned authors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts point out, &quot;it 
  needs to be emphasized that the plaintiff's negligence is contributory to the 
  damage he sustains&quot; (supra, at para. 991, citing Craze v. Meyer-Dumore 
  Bottlers' Equipment Co. Ltd., [1936] 2 All E.R. 1150 at p. 1151), and this I 
  interpret to mean that there is a distinction at law between reasonable reliance 
  as a necessary prerequisite to ground liability, to constitute the cause of 
  action under Hedley Byrne, supra, and reliance in the context of contributory 
  negligence as simply a factor going to the extent of the damages suffered. Section 
  4 of the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 296, provides:</p>    
<P class="indent10"> 4. In any action for damages that is founded upon the fault 
  or negligence of the defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of 
  the plaintiff that contributed to the damages, the court shall apportion the 
  damages in proportion to the degree of fault or negligence found against the 
  parties respectively.</p>    
<P class="indent"> In Charlesworth on Negligence, 5th ed. (1971), para. 1028, 
  the author states:</p>    
<P class="indent10"> In considering &quot;fault&quot; what must be ascertained is 
  the fault causing the damage: this may not necessarily be the same as the fault 
  causing the accident which in turn caused the damage.</p>    
<P class="indent"> In the case of fault that contributes to the damage suffered, 
  reliance that is &quot;unreasonable&quot; simply goes to reducing damages otherwise 
  recoverable by the plaintiff: it does not go to cancelling the prima facie liability 
  of the defendant [emphasis in last paragraph added].</p>
<p>[10] I will come back to the last paragraph of this excerpt later in this judgment. 
  </p>    <P>
  [11] Based on these principles, the trial judge considered Mr. Norman's actions 
  during the course of the 1989 renewal process and concluded that he contributed 
  to his own loss by failing to read the insurance form and inquire about the 
  term of the insurance despite the fact that the renewal process itself ought 
  to have raised concerns and questions in his mind. The trial judge stated as 
  follows at paras. 78-81: </p>    
<P class="indent"> Although the defendant indicated that he read the November 
  4th, 1988 insurance application form, he asked no particular question of the 
  plaintiff's representative with respect to the length of the insurance coverage. 
  In 1989, he signed, but he did not read, the insurance application form.</p>
<P class="indent">The important time for Mr. and Mrs. Norman to secure effective 
  life insurance coverage was in 1988 and in 1989, but not in 1990, when it was 
  determined that Mrs. Norman was suffering with cancer. In 1989, the defendant 
  was aware that he (and by implication Mrs. Norman) had to reapply for loan insurance 
  as a new application had to be completed. Had Mr. Norman read the February 24th, 
  1989 insurance form, he might have realized that he and Mrs. Norman were required 
  to again answer questions related to their health, for insurance coverage purposes, 
  such that they were being required to once again re-qualify for insurance.</p>
<P class="indent">In my view, the 1989 loan and insurance application process 
  ought to have raised in the defendant's mind some concerns and questions about 
  the length and nature of life insurance coverages. This is especially so, considering 
  that less than one year earlier, Mr. Norman had applied for loan insurance coverage 
  when he and Mrs. Norman first dealt with the plaintiff. By failing to even read 
  the 1989 insurance application form, before signing it, the defendant (plaintiff 
  by counterclaim) contributed to the damages which he ultimately sustained by 
  securing and insuring a mortgage loan which would ultimately not insure Mrs. 
  Norman's life at the time of her death. The defendant's contributory negligence, 
  in these circumstances, was in my opinion, as significant as the plaintiff's 
  breach of its duty of care. For that reason, and applying the provisions of 
  s. 3 of the Negligence Act, I would apportion the degree of fault at 50 percent 
  against the plaintiff (defendant by counterclaim), and 50 percent against the 
  defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim).</p>
<p>[12] The trial judge therefore granted judgment against Mr. Norman in respect 
  of the mortgage covenant, but reduced the quantum by setting off as against 
  it Avco's share of damages arising out of its breach of duty to Mr. Norman. 
  </p>    <P>
  2. The Appellant's Position on Appeal</p>
<p>[13] As stated earlier, it is the appellant's contention that, as a matter 
  of law, a finding of negligent misrepresentation precludes a finding of contributory 
  negligence. Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that Trainor J.'s decision 
  in Grand Restaurants, supra, upon which the trial judge relied, was confirmed 
  on appeal to this court. In a brief endorsement, this court stated as follows: 
  </p>    
<P class="indent"> We have listened with attention to the lengthy and complete 
  submissions made. Sifting through those submissions it becomes apparent that, 
  in the main, it is findings of fact that are being questioned in both the appeal 
  and cross-appeal. The trial judge noted that there was conflict in the evidence 
  and how he viewed the witnesses and their evidence was important to his ultimate 
  conclusions. We are persuaded that there was admissible evidence from which 
  the trial judge could make his findings of negligence and contributory negligence. 
  Equally we are of the view that his assessment of damages was proper in light 
  of the evidence before him. There is no palpable or demonstrable error in the 
  judgment of the learned trial judge and the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed 
  with costs. </p>
<p>[14] Counsel for the appellant also acknowledges that courts, in a number of 
  decisions, have found contributory negligence in cases of negligent misrepresentation. 
  He notes the following decisions: H. B. Nickerson &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Wooldridge 
  (1980), 40 N.S.R. (2d) 388 (C.A.); Gallant v. Central Credit Union Ltd. (1994), 
  125 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 66 (P.E.I.S.C.); Spiewak v. 251268 Ontario Ltd. (1987), 
  61 O.R. (2d) 655 (H.C.J.); Kripps v. Touche Ross &amp; Co. (1998), 56 B.C.L.R. 
  (3d) 160 (S.C.); Hongkong Bank of Canada v. Royal Bank of Canada, [1992] B.C.J. 
  No. 169 (S.C.); Leon Van Neck v. McGorman, [1998] O.J. No. 4813 (Gen. Div.); 
  and Canada (Federal Business Development Bank) v. Morris, Burk, Luborsky, David 
  &amp; Kale (1988) 38 B.L.R. 1 (Ont. H.C.J.).</p>    <P>
  [15] Counsel submits, however, that those cases are inconsistent with the decision 
  in Perry v. Clintar Ltd. (1996), 41 C.B.R. (3d) 90 (Ont. C.A.), where this court 
  found that it was inappropriate for the trial court to have made a finding of 
  contributory negligence once it had made a finding of reasonable reliance. In 
  a brief endorsement, the court disposed of the liability issues in that case 
  as follows: </p>    
<P class="indent"> Counsel for Clintar argued that the conclusion reached by the 
  trial judge was wrong because there was no finding that, if the plaintiff relied 
  on Clintar's representations, such reliance was reasonable.</p>
<P class="indent">There is no such express finding in the reasons. The trial judge, 
  however, approached the case as if pleaded only on the basis of a claim in negligence. 
  He found that, in the circumstances, Clintar owed Perry a duty to exercise diligence 
  in the preparation of the June financial statement. He went on to find that 
  Clintar breached that duty by what he called &quot;either institutional negligence 
  or a deliberate concealment of material facts.&quot; He said that, &quot;[w]hile 
  Clintar did not itself represent the truth of the financial statement, it prepared 
  the statement either negligently or with the knowledge of its falsehood, knowing 
  that it would be relied on by the plaintiff.&quot;</p>
<P class="indent">It is implicit in these findings that, in the circumstances 
  of this transaction, the plaintiff's reliance on Clintar's representations was 
  reasonable. Accordingly, the appeal cannot succeed.</p>
<P class="indent">[In respect of the cross-appeal] &#133; Clintar pleaded that 
  Perry had been guilty of contributory negligence. The implicit finding of reasonable 
  reliance should have removed that issue from consideration but, because of the 
  trial judge's approach, he did consider it and found the plaintiff one-third 
  at fault. In our view, the case was essentially one of detrimental reliance 
  and the finding of contributory negligence was inappropriate and should be set 
  aside [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[16] Counsel for the appellant contends that Perry stands for the proposition 
  that findings of negligent misrepresentation and contributory negligence cannot 
  logically coexist, and that this court, in effect, overruled its earlier decision 
  in Grand Restaurants. He submits further that the rationale in Grand Restaurants 
  has been superceded by later decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada where 
  the court clarified the requirements of the tort of negligent misrepresentation. 
  He relies on the following three decisions: Fletcher v. Manitoba Public Insurance 
  Co., [1990] 3 S.C.R. 191; Queen v. Cognos Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87; and Hercules 
  Managements Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165. </p>    <P>
  [17] Counsel submits that, in those cases, the &quot;reasonable reliance&quot; 
  requirement gained special prominence. He submits that the effect of this prominence 
  is to require that any defence based on the plaintiff's contributory negligence 
  be considered &quot;up front&quot; or, in other words, &quot;the defence is 
  built into the cause of action&quot;. Counsel submits that, according to the 
  test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada, the court must now consider whether 
  the plaintiff is partly responsible for his own loss at the start of its analysis, 
  immediately after it has determined whether the defendant could have foreseen 
  the plaintiff's reliance. He submits that, since this inquiry is part of the 
  analysis on negligent misrepresentation, &quot;[t]he court should not screen 
  the plaintiff twice on this same question or it second-guesses itself and may 
  arrive at opposite conclusions.&quot;</p>    <P>
  3. Analysis</p>
<p>[18] The concept of foreseeable and reasonable reliance was not new to the 
  law on misrepresentation at the time the Supreme Court of Canada decided Fletcher, 
  Cognos, and Hercules. Hence, I do not agree with the submission that these three 
  cases have effectively superceded all preceding jurisprudence. However, I would 
  agree with the contention that, in reiterating the necessary elements of the 
  tort of negligent misrepresentation, the Supreme Court seems to have placed 
  the concept of reliance at the forefront of the analysis. It did so in Fletcher, 
  the first of the three decisions, and then more particularly in Hercules, by 
  identifying foreseeable and reasonable reliance as the foundation of the duty 
  of care. This approach can be readily discerned from a brief review of the cases 
  in question. I will review them in chronological order. </p>    <P>
  [19] At issue in Fletcher was the question whether a public insurance corporation 
  owed a duty to advise an insured of the availability of underinsured motorist 
  coverage. The Supreme Court concluded that it did. Reliance formed an important 
  part of the court's analysis on duty of care. Wilson J., in writing for the 
  court, concluded her analysis on duty of care by stating at p. 212 that the 
  insurer &quot;will owe a duty of care to its customers if: (i) such customers 
  rely on the information; (ii) their reliance is reasonable; and (iii) [the insurer] 
  knew or ought to have known that they would rely on the information.&quot; After 
  this discussion on the duty of care, the court went on to consider the scope 
  of the duty, whether it was breached, and whether the insurer, in not fulfilling 
  its duty, was liable for the insured's loss. </p>    <P>
  [20] Cognos involved the application of the tort of negligent misrepresentation 
  in respect of a pre employment representation made by an employer to a prospective 
  employee in the course of a hiring interview. Iacobucci J. set out at p. 110 
  the required elements of the tort in the following oft-quoted statement: </p>    
<P class="indent"> The required elements for a successful Hedley Byrne claim have 
  been stated in many authorities, sometimes in varying forms. The decisions of 
  this court cited above suggest five general requirements:</p>
<P class="indent">(1) there must be a duty of care based on a &quot;special relationship&quot; 
  between the representor and the representee;</p>
<P class="indent">(2) the representation in question must be untrue, inaccurate, 
  or misleading;</p>
<P class="indent">(3) the representor must have acted negligently in making said 
  misrepresentation;</p>
<P class="indent">(4) the representee must have relied, in a reasonable manner, 
  on said negligent misrepresentation; and</p>
<P class="indent">(5) the reliance must have been detrimental to the representee 
  in the sense that damages resulted.</p>
<p>[21] The employer in Cognos conceded that a special relationship existed so 
  as to give rise to a duty of care, but contended that this duty was negated 
  by a disclaimer contained in an employment contract signed by the employee some 
  time after the interview. In light of the employer's concession on the existence 
  of a duty of care, it was not necessary for the court to discuss reliance as 
  it relates to the duty of care. Iacobucci J., however, identified the existing 
  debate on this question at p. 116: </p>    
<P class="indent"> There is some debate in academic circles, fuelled by various 
  judicial pronouncements, about the proper test that should be applied to determine 
  when a &quot;special relationship&quot; exists between the representor and the 
  representee which will give rise to a duty of care. Some have suggested that 
  &quot;foreseeable and reasonable reliance&quot; on the representations is the 
  key element to the analysis, while others speak of &quot;voluntary assumption 
  of responsibility&quot; on the part of the representor</p>
<P class="indent">. &#133;</p>
<P class="indent">For my part, I find it unnecessary - and unwise in view of the 
  respondent's concession - to take part in this debate. Regardless of the test 
  applied, the result which the circumstances of this case dictate would be the 
  same. It was foreseeable that the appellant would be relying on the information 
  given during the hiring interview in order to make his career decision. It was 
  reasonable for the appellant to rely on said representations. There is nothing 
  before this court that suggests that the respondent was not, at the time of 
  the interview or shortly thereafter, assuming responsibility for what was being 
  represented to the appellant by Mr. Johnston. </p>
<p>[22] In the next case, Hercules, it became necessary for the Supreme Court 
  to determine the appropriate test to determine when a duty of care arises in 
  a case of alleged negligent misrepresentation. The central issue was whether, 
  and when, accountants who perform an audit of a corporation's financial statements 
  owe a duty of care in tort to shareholders of the corporation who claim to have 
  suffered losses in reliance on the audited statements. The court held that it 
  was well-established that the existence of a duty of care in tort is to be determined 
  through an application of the two-part test in Anns v. Merton London Borough 
  Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.) as restated in Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen, [1984] 
  2 S.C.R. 2 at 10-11:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (1) is there a sufficiently close relationship between the 
  parties (the [defendant] and the person who has suffered the damage) so that, 
  in the reasonable contemplation of the [defendant], carelessness on its part 
  might cause damage to that person? If so,</p>
<P class="indent">(2) are there any considerations which ought to negative or 
  limit (a) the scope of the duty and (b) the class of persons to whom it is owed 
  or (c) the damages to which a breach of it may give rise?</p>
<p>[23] The Supreme Court in Hercules saw no reason why the same approach should 
  not be taken in cases of negligent misrepresentation and stated at para. 21 
  that &quot;[i]ndeed, to create a 'pocket' of negligent misrepresentation cases 
  (to use Professor Stapleton's term) in which the existence of a duty of care 
  is determined differently from other negligence cases would, in my view, be 
  incorrect&quot;. In discussing the first branch of the test, the existence of 
  a relationship of proximity, the court stated the following at para. 24: </p>    
<P class="indent"> In cases of negligent misrepresentation, the relationship between 
  the plaintiff and the defendant arises through reliance by the plaintiff on 
  the defendant's words. Thus, if &quot;proximity&quot; is meant to distinguish 
  the cases where the defendant has a responsibility to take reasonable care of 
  the plaintiff from those where he or she has no such responsibility, then in 
  negligent misrepresentation cases, it must pertain to some aspect of the relationship 
  of reliance. To my mind, proximity can be seen to inhere between a defendant-representor 
  and a plaintiff-representee when two criteria relating to reliance may be said 
  to exist on the facts: (a) the defendant ought reasonably to foresee that the 
  plaintiff will rely on his or her representation; and (b) reliance by the plaintiff 
  would, in the particular circumstances of the case, be reasonable. To use the 
  term employed by my colleague, Iacobucci J., in Cognos, supra, at p. 110, the 
  plaintiff and the defendant can be said to be in a &quot;special relationship&quot; 
  whenever these two factors inhere. </p>
<p>[24] Hence, the concept of foreseeable and reasonable reliance was again, as 
  it had been in Fletcher, brought to the forefront of the analysis as the very 
  foundation for the duty of care. The question remains whether this shift in 
  the analysis has the effect contended by the appellant of incorporating the 
  notion of contributory negligence into the cause of action itself. In my view, 
  it does not. I say this for the following reasons. </p>    <P>
  [25] First, the adoption of such an approach would create an unwarranted inconsistency 
  in the law of negligence. Just as it was held in Hercules with respect to the 
  existence of a duty of care, it would be incorrect in my view &quot;to create 
  a pocket of negligent misrepresentation cases&quot; in which the question of 
  contributory negligence would be determined differently from other negligence 
  cases. It is my view as well that the adoption of a different approach in cases 
  of negligent misrepresentation would be inconsistent with the provisions of 
  the Negligence Act that provide for apportionment in cases where the plaintiff's 
  negligence is found to have contributed to the damages. </p>    <P>
  [26] Second, it is my view that a finding that the tort of negligent misrepresentation 
  has been made out is not inherently inconsistent with a finding of contributory 
  negligence because the test that underlies each finding is different. I have 
  already reviewed the test for negligent misrepresentation. The test for contributory 
  negligence can be found in many cases. It was recently reiterated by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding 
  Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210 at para. 76: </p>    
<P class="indent"> The test for contributory negligence was summarized by Denning 
  L.J. in Jones v. Livox Quarries Ld., [1952] 2 Q.B. 608 (C.A.), at p. 615:</p>
<P class="indent">Although contributory negligence does not depend on a duty of 
  care, it does depend on foreseeability. Just as actionable negligence requires 
  the foreseeability of harm to others, so contributory negligence requires the 
  foreseeability of harm to oneself. A person is guilty of contributory negligence 
  if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, 
  prudent man, he might be hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into 
  account the possibility of others being careless.</p>
<P class="indent">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[27] Admittedly, because the reliance by the injured party on the statement 
  must itself be reasonable, in many cases it will be difficult for a defendant 
  to prove contributory negligence once a finding of negligent misrepresentation 
  has been made against it. Indeed, if the allegation of contributory negligence 
  is based on the contention that the injured party acted unreasonably in relying 
  on the misstatement, the question will already have been determined on the main 
  claim, and the plea of contributory negligence will not succeed. On this point, 
  I wish to comment on the following words of the trial judge in Grand Restaurants, 
  as quoted earlier: </p>    
<P class="indent"> In the case of fault that contributes to the damage suffered, 
  reliance that is 'unreasonable' simply goes to reducing damages otherwise recoverable 
  by the plaintiff; it does not go to cancelling the prima facie liability of 
  the defendant.</p>
<p>[28] Obviously, these words, considered in and of themselves, cannot be reconciled 
  with the test set out in Hercules. Of course, Grand Restaurants was decided 
  long before the decision in Hercules. When the trial judge's words are considered 
  in context, however, it is apparent that his finding of contributory negligence 
  was properly based on a consideration of the plaintiff's own negligent conduct 
  and how it contributed to its loss. I will briefly review the facts in Grand 
  Restaurants because they exemplify the application of the principles under review 
  in this case. </p>    <P>
  [29] The plaintiff in Grand Restaurants entered into a contract for the purchase 
  of a restaurant. In deciding to purchase the restaurant, the plaintiff had relied 
  in part on a letter from the defendant city, sent in response to the plaintiff's 
  inquiry, stating that it had no current file on the property in respect of outstanding 
  work orders and building violations. As it turned out, this letter was inaccurate. 
  The trial judge found that the failure of the defendant to respond accurately 
  to the plaintiff was a breach of a duty owed to the plaintiff and that this 
  breach contributed to the plaintiff's loss. However, the trial judge found that 
  the plaintiff did not rely solely on the city. The facts disclosed that the 
  plaintiff had become aware of a prior work order against the property, stemming 
  from a liquor licence application that had then been withdrawn. The trial judge 
  found that this knowledge, combined with the plaintiff's special knowledge of 
  the business to be purchased, should have alerted the plaintiff to the economic 
  risks of closing the transaction. He therefore found the plaintiff 50% contributorily 
  negligent.</p>    <P>
  [30] In my view, the findings of negligent misrepresentation and contributory 
  negligence were not inconsistent on these facts. While the injured party's own 
  conduct must be considered under both tests, the focus is different. With respect 
  to the analysis on negligent misrepresentation, the focus is on the reasonableness 
  of the reliance (and, of course, its foreseeability from the perspective of 
  the representor). In this respect, the circumstances surrounding the misrepresentation 
  in question are of paramount importance. Whether or not it was reasonable to 
  rely on the representation will depend on an array of factors. Professor Philip 
  Osborne, in The Law of Torts (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2000) at 162-165, lists a 
  number of factors that may be relevant on this question including the expertise 
  and knowledge of the representor; the seriousness of the occasion; whether the 
  information was requested; whether the representor received any direct or indirect 
  financial benefit; the nature of the statement; and the presence of any disclaimers. 
  </p>    <P>
  [31] In Grand Restaurants, it was reasonable for the plaintiff in all the circumstances 
  to expect that the response from the city would be accurate and to rely on its 
  representation that it had no current file involving outstanding work orders 
  and building violations. It was also foreseeable to the city that the plaintiff 
  would rely on its representation. The plaintiff's detrimental reliance on the 
  misrepresentation contributed to its loss. </p>    <P>
  [32] On the question of contributory negligence, the focus is on the event that 
  occasioned the loss. The injured party's conduct, in all the circumstances surrounding 
  that event, must be considered in order to determine whether it acted reasonably 
  in its own interest or whether it contributed to the loss by its own fault. 
  The circumstances surrounding the event that occasioned the loss, depending 
  on the particular facts of the case, may be much wider in scope than the circumstances 
  surrounding the negligent misrepresentation. Hence, at this stage of the inquiry, 
  the reasonableness of the injured party's reliance on the misrepresentation 
  must be assessed in the context of the event that occasioned the loss. According 
  to the test for contributory negligence set out earlier at paragraph 26, the 
  injured party will be found guilty of contributory negligence if it ought to 
  have foreseen that it may harm itself by failing to act reasonably and prudently. 
  In this context, the injured party's failure to act as a reasonable and prudent 
  person may include a failure to guard against the foreseeable carelessness of 
  others. </p>    <P>
  [33] For example, in Grand Restaurants, the event that occasioned the loss was 
  not the misstatement by the city, it was the fact that the plaintiff closed 
  the transaction. Hence, in looking at the entire circumstances surrounding the 
  transaction, it remained open for the trial judge to find, on the question of 
  contributory negligence, that the plaintiff's own negligence in failing to act 
  on its own knowledge about the property instead of relying totally on the city's 
  response contributed to its loss. </p>    <P>
  [34] A similar result was reached in Spiewak, supra. A real estate agent was 
  found liable in negligent misrepresentation in respect of incomplete and misleading 
  information provided to prospective purchasers of an apartment building about 
  the building's likely rental income. The plaintiffs relied on this information 
  and entered into an agreement to purchase the building, as a result of which 
  they sustained a loss. The plaintiffs, however, were found contributorily negligent 
  because of their failure to consult a lawyer in respect of the transaction and 
  their damages were accordingly reduced by 20%. </p>    <P>
  [35] It is my view that an approach that allows for the apportionment of fault 
  in cases of negligent misrepresentation is not only consistent with the approach 
  in other negligence cases, it is also consistent with the principle underlying 
  the very concept of contributory negligence. This principle is rooted in a concern 
  to do justice as between the parties; it was reiterated in Bow Valley, supra, 
  where the court quoted with approval at para. 73 the words of Viscount Simon 
  in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co., [1951] A.C. 601 at 611 (P.C.):</p>    
<P class="indent"> But when contributory negligence is set up as a defence, its 
  existence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party 
  sued, and all that is necessary to establish such a defence is to prove to the 
  satisfaction of the jury that the injured party did not in his own interest 
  take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by this want of care, to his 
  own injury. For when contributory negligence is set up as a shield against the 
  obligation to satisfy the whole of the plaintiff's claim, the principle involved 
  is that, where a man is part author of his own injury, he cannot call on the 
  other party to compensate him in full. </p>
<P class="indent">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[36] I now deal with the appellant's submission that this court's decision 
  in Perry, supra, has effectively overruled the decision in Grand Restaurants. 
  I note firstly that Grand Restaurants was not referred to in the brief endorsement 
  in Perry. It is not apparent that the issue raised on this appeal was addressed 
  by the parties on that appeal. It is also difficult to determine the precise 
  basis for this court's decision in Perry, given the brevity of the reasons. 
  Admittedly, I am unable to reconcile the foregoing analysis with the result 
  on the appeal in Perry, given the particular facts of that case and the findings 
  made by the trial judge. Therefore, I must consider the principle of stare decisis 
  and its requirement in the circumstances.</p>    <P>
  [37] The English Court of Appeal provides guidance on the application of the 
  doctrine of stare decisis in Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd, [1944] K.B. 
  718 (C.A.). In Young, the court held that it was bound by its own previous decisions 
  and that only the House of Lords had the power to hold that a decision that 
  was binding on it was not good law. This principle, however, is subject to three 
  exceptions, the first of which is that the court is entitled and bound to decide 
  which of two conflicting decisions of its own it will follow. It is my view, 
  for the reasons that I have already expressed, that this court should follow 
  Grand Restaurants.</p>    <P>
  [38] Hence, for these reasons, it is my view that findings of negligent misrepresentation 
  and contributory negligence can co-exist at law. Both parties, however, submit 
  that the findings of negligent misrepresentation and contributory negligence 
  cannot co-exist on the facts of this case. </p>    <P>
  [39] The appellant takes the position that, given the trial judge's conclusion 
  that the tort of negligent misrepresentation was made out, it must be taken 
  as implicit that he found Mr. Norman's reliance on Avco's misrepresentation 
  both foreseeable and reasonable. He then submits that the trial judge's later 
  finding on the issue of contributory negligence that Mr. Norman acted unreasonably 
  in relying on Avco's misrepresentation is inconsistent with this finding. </p>    <P>
  [40] The appellant takes the further position that the trial judge's conclusion 
  on negligent misrepresentation is not in issue on this appeal and must therefore 
  be taken as correct. Hence, he submits that the finding of contributory negligence 
  must necessarily be set aside. I do not agree with this further contention. 
  Given Avco's decision not to cross-appeal, the appellant is correct in saying 
  that the judgment in his favour is not open to review on this appeal. Nonetheless, 
  it is open to Avco to challenge the trial judge's conclusion on negligent misrepresentation 
  in response to the appeal, as it has done.</p>    <P>
  [41] I agree with the contention, which was in effect advanced by both parties, 
  that, on the particular facts of this case, a finding of foreseeable and reasonable 
  reliance is inconsistent with the trial judge's later finding on the issue of 
  contributory negligence. I say this because the circumstances surrounding the 
  alleged misrepresentation (the inquiry on negligent misrepresentation) are the 
  same as the circumstances surrounding the event that occasioned the loss (the 
  inquiry on contributory negligence). In these circumstances, it is difficult 
  to see how two different conclusions could be arrived at on an assessment of 
  the reasonableness of Mr. Norman's conduct. </p>    <P>
  [42] As noted earlier, the trial judge did not specifically address the question 
  of foreseeable and reasonable reliance in his analysis of Avco's duty of care, 
  or at any other point in his reasons for judgment. In my view, the failure to 
  analyse the evidence on the question of foreseeable and reasonable reliance 
  led him into error in concluding that the negligent misrepresentation by omission 
  made in 1988 continued in 1989. Had the trial judge analysed the reasonableness 
  of Mr. Norman's conduct in considering the elements of negligent misrepresentation, 
  it is my view that he would have arrived at the same conclusion that he did 
  on his analysis in respect of the question of contributory negligence. </p>    <P>
  [43] In my view, the trial judge's conclusion that Mr. Norman acted unreasonably 
  in relying solely on what Avco's representative expressly said in words about 
  the terms of the policy when he purchased a second one-year term of insurance 
  in 1989 is unassailable on this record. The fact that the alleged misrepresentation 
  was in the form of an omission becomes important in this context. Of particular 
  importance is the trial judge's express finding that the 1989 loan and insurance 
  application process in itself ought to have raised in Mr. Norman's mind some 
  concerns and questions about the insurance coverage. Indeed, by its actions 
  in 1989 in requiring that the Normans reapply for insurance, Avco was in effect 
  &quot;making a statement&quot; that the previous policy had expired with the 
  term of the 1988 loan. It can hardly be said that, at the same time, by its 
  silence, Avco was misrepresenting that the insurance did not need to be renewed 
  on each renewal of the mortgage loan. </p>    <P>
  [44] Hence, in my view, the trial judge's finding that Mr. Norman acted unreasonably 
  in 1989 in not inquiring further into the term of the insurance is amply supported 
  on the evidence and ought to have been determinative on the question of foreseeable 
  and reasonable reliance in respect of the tort of negligent misrepresentation. 
  </p>    <P>
  [45] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs, fixed at $7,000 
  in accordance with counsel's agreement. </p>
