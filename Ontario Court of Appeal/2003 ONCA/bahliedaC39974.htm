<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Pierce dated March 31, 2003, reasons on 
  motion reported at (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 599 (Ont. Sup. Crt.).</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from an order granting the respondent's motion for summary 
  judgment and dismissing that part of the appellant's claim for libel arising 
  from allegedly defamatory material posted by the respondent on his internet 
  website.</p>
<p>
  [2] The motions judge found that material placed on a website and made available 
  through the internet is a &quot;broadcast&quot; within the meaning of the Libel 
  and Slander Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L-12. As the appellant did not deliver a notice 
  of claim and statement of claim within the periods required by ss. 5(1) and 
  6 of the Act, the motions judge held that the appellant's claim was statute 
  barred.</p>
<p>
  [3] The motions judge considered the parties' expert reports which defined the 
  nature of the internet and gave their opinions on whether placing material on 
  the internet constitutes a broadcast.</p>
<p>
  [4] At para. 49, she concluded that there was no genuine issue for trial because: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The definition of &quot;broadcasting&quot; contained in the Libel and Slander 
  Act deals with infrastructure, and it deals with the effect of dissemination 
  of information. On this, the experts agree.</p>
<p>
  [5] She held that because the internet uses the same infrastructure as radio 
  and television and because material placed on the internet via a website may 
  be accessed by a large audience, such material constitutes broadcasting within 
  the meaning of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, the motions judge erred in several respects in finding that 
  there was no genuine issue for trial. Section 7 of the Act provides that subsection 
  5(1) and section 6 apply only to &quot;broadcasts from a station in Ontario&quot;. 
  She makes no findings of fact, including no finding as to the essential question 
  of whether the broadcasts were from a station in Ontario. On that basis alone, 
  in our view, the application should have been dismissed. In addition, however, 
  we note that the experts' opinions conflicted on a number of issues, including 
  whether the word &quot;dissemination&quot; can properly apply to information 
  distributed by internet and whether internet publication is immediate and/or 
  transient. Summary judgment applications are not a substitute for trial and 
  thus will seldom prove suitable for resolving conflicts in expert testimony 
  particularly those involving difficult, complex policy issues with broad social 
  ramifications. </p>
<p>
  [7] The conflicting expert opinions raise considerations that are germane not 
  only to deciding whether internet publications are a broadcast within the meaning 
  of the legislation, but also to determining whether subsequent viewing of the 
  internet message by third parties amounts to a republication of the material.</p>
<p>
  [8] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and set aside the order below in 
  which partial summary judgment is granted. Costs of the appeal and below to 
  the appellant fixed in the amounts of $12,000 and $10,000, respectively.</p>
