<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 20, 2002.</p>
<p>
  McMURTRY C.J.O.: </p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from the order of Backhouse J. dated June 20, 2002 striking 
  out the appellants' claim for libel as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. 
  The appellants who are all practitioners of Falun Gong, allege that they were 
  libeled by an article published in the respondent's newspaper, the Sing Tao 
  Daily. The motions judge also struck the appellants claims for &quot;incitement 
  of hatred&quot;, &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and &quot;negligent research&quot; 
  as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.</p>
<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent, Sing Tao Daily, publishes a Chinese language daily newspaper 
  sold in Canada. On September 20, 2001, in the aftermath of the terrorist attack 
  on the World Trade Centre, the respondent published an article under the headline 
  &quot;Radical Religious Groups Advocate Destroying the World (&quot;the Article&quot;). 
  The Article profiles a number of groups, with accompanying photographs, including 
  the Branch Dividians, Solar Temple, the World Trade Centre bombers and Falun 
  Gong. The appellants are all practitioners of Falun Gong. </p>
<p>
  [3] The following segments of the Article as translated contain the references 
  in their entirety to the Falun Gong.</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Under the heading &quot;Falun Gong&quot;, as translated, the Article states: </p>
<p class="indent15">Founded by Li Hongzhi, Falun Dafa is aimed at cultivating the ultimate qualities 
  of the Universe-&quot;Truth-Compassion-Tolerance&quot;. Falun Gong insists that 
  it is intended to cultivate mind nature, thus is beneficial in improving physical 
  health, mental clarity and morality, however, in Li Hongzhi's Dafa (teachings), 
  it has always laid emphasis on anti-science, anti-society and anti-civilization. 
  He also claim to the followers that the earth will inevitably have a big explosion, 
  that is to say the end of the world; yet he has the power to put off the explosion 
  for 30 years. Falun Gong allegedly lead people to superstition, delude people 
  into setting themselves alight, and self-mutilation, in order to achieve the 
  &quot;consummation&quot; to ascend to heaven. As a result, Falun Gong has been 
  defined as an evil cult in China.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Under the heading &quot;Religious incident involving deaths and injuries&quot;, 
  the Article states: </p>
<p class="indent15">Falun Gong: According to reports from mainland China, Falun Gong has caused 
  more than 1700 deaths in Mainland China, either from delay of medical treatments 
  or suicide acts, even self-mutilations, because it is anti-science and anti-society. 
  In January this year on Tienanmen Square, five Falun Gong followers posted a 
  quigong stance, shouted &quot;Falun Dafa is good&quot;, then set fire to themselves 
  in an attempted group suicide, which left one dead, four injured. The four injured 
  lost the outward form of a man as a result of burns. CNN TV at the scene filmed 
  the entire course of the incident.</p>
<p>[4] The appellants do not include three of the plaintiffs in this action who 
  are identifiable in a photograph accompanying the Article which is the subject 
  matter of the action. The libel claims of these three plaintiffs were permitted 
  to proceed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Falun Gong originated in China but has practitioners or adherents throughout 
  the world. In 1999 the Chinese government estimated that there were 100 million 
  Falun Gong practitioners.</p>
<p>
  [6] All of the plaintiffs are resident in Canada except the three plaintiffs 
  shown in the photograph, which was part of the Article, who live in Hong Kong. 
  It will be noted that the words complained of in the Article do not refer specifically 
  to any members of the Falun Gong in Canada. Indeed, the Article makes references 
  only to events that allegedly occurred in China.</p>
<p>ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [7] There are two issues on this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the motions judge err in striking out the libel claims 
  of the appellants?<br>
  (2) Did the motions judge err in striking out the appellants' claims for &quot;incitement 
  of hatred&quot;, &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and &quot;negligent research&quot;?</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Issue 1-The Libel Claims</p>
<p>
  [8] The motions judge found that the appellants could not succeed in their libel 
  action, because the libel was not &quot;of and concerning&quot; the plaintiffs. 
  The appellants argue that while they are not individually named in the article, 
  they are nonetheless each singled out by the statements about Falun Gong. They 
  plead in their statement of claim as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  all Falun Gong (Da Fa) practitioners, due to their unique activities, physical 
  exercises, meditation, and dissemination of literature, are readily and instantly, 
  identifiable as practitioners, particularly within, but not restricted to, the 
  Chinese community in Canada.</p>
<p>[9] The appellants therefore submit that they meet the &quot;of and concerning&quot; 
  requirement for libel, because as identifiable practitioners of Falun Gong, 
  the Article's general statements concerning Falun Gong attach to them as individuals. 
</p>
<p>[10] An action in libel is a personal action based upon injury to one's own 
  reputation. Thus, it is necessary to show that an allegedly libelous publication 
  points to the plaintiff as a particular individual. However, the appellants 
  submit that this does not mean that an individual cannot be defamed as member 
  of a group that is targeted by a publication. </p>
<p>[11] The appellants rely on the decision in Lennon v. Harris (1999), 45 O.R. 
  (3d) 84 (Sup. Ct. Jus.), in which the court refused to strike a claim by several 
  union leaders, who claimed to have been defamed by certain statements about 
  &quot;teachers' unions&quot; and &quot;union bosses&quot;, made by the Premier 
  and the Minister of Education of Ontario, in the context of a dispute over changes 
  to the education system. While the plaintiffs were not named in the statements, 
  the motions judge concluded that in the circumstances he could not conclude 
  that the words complained of were not spoken &quot;of and concerning&quot; them. 
</p>
<p>[12] In my view, this decision does not assist the appellants. The union leaders 
  in Lennon were not claiming to have been libeled merely on the basis of their 
  status as &quot;union bosses&quot;, but rather as the particular union leaders 
  that were engaged in a dispute with the defendants. They were the specific target 
  of the statements. In the present appeal, there is nothing that identifies the 
  appellants in a similar manner.</p>
<p>
  [13] In Seafarers International Union of Canada et al v. Lawrence (1979) 24 
  O.R. (2d) 257, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. at 263 underlines the personal nature of a 
  libel action as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The words to be actionable must be understood as being published of and concerning 
  the plaintiff. It is pointed out in Gatley, supra, p. 139, para 283: </p>
<p class="indent15">
  Where the words complained of reflect on a body or class of persons generally, 
  such as lawyers, clergymen, publicans or the like, no particular member of the 
  body or class can maintain an action. &quot;If&quot; said Willes J. in Eastwood 
  v. Holmes, [(1858) 1F &amp; F347 at 349] &quot;a man wrote that all lawyers 
  were thieves, no particular lawyer could sue him unless there was something 
  to point to the particular individual.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> Viscount Simon, L.C. in Knupffer v. London Express Newspaper 
  Ltd., [1944] AC 116 at p. 118, in opening his speech stated: &quot;My Lords, 
  it is an essential element of the cause of action for defamation that the words 
  complained of should be published 'of the plaintiff'.&quot; Lord Russell of 
  Killowen said, in the same case (p.123): </p>
<p class="indent15">
  The crucial question in these cases in which an individual&#133;sues in respect 
  of defamation of a class or group of individuals is whether on their true construction 
  the defamatory words were published of and concerning the &#133; plaintiff.</p>
<p>[14] There is nothing to distinguish the appellants from the class of all Falun 
  Gong practitioners throughout the world. In this context, I am of the view that, 
  the succinct endorsement of Justice Zuber in Sun Tanner's Image v. White (12 
  September 2000), Windsor 00-GD-4893 (Sup. Ct. Jus.), affirmed at [2001] O.J. 
  No. 1661 (C.A.), provides a helpful approach: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is necessary that the plaintiffs show that they are identified or singled 
  out. The words clearly do not identify the plaintiffs. Further it is not pleaded 
  that the class is so small that the plaintiffs are necessarily identified and 
  would lead one to believe that the plaintiffs are the target of the words. As 
  a result this action must fail and the claim is dismissed.</p>
<p>[15] I agree with the respondent that where a matter is allegedly libelous 
  of a substantially large and indeterminate group of persons, it does not give 
  rise to a cause of action for any specific member of that group or class unless 
  it can be shown that the libel complained of points to a particular member or 
  particular members of the group.</p>
<p>
  [16] I am also of the opinion that a reasonable reader of the respondent's Article 
  would likely interpret the reference to the &quot;Falun Gong&quot; as referring 
  to Falun Gong practitioners living in China.</p>
<p>
  [17] For these reasons, I would therefore dismiss the appeal with respect to 
  the order striking out the appellants' claim for libel.</p>
<p>Issue 2-The Remaining Claims</p>
<p>[18] The motions judge found that the claim for &quot;negligent research&quot; 
  was simply another way of framing the libel action, and could stand on no better 
  ground. She dismissed the claims for &quot;incitement of hatred&quot; and &quot;crimes 
  against humanity&quot; for the same reason, noting also that such conduct may 
  be prosecuted in a criminal court and/or under Human Rights Legislation. The 
  appellants submit that there should be a civil remedy to correspond with the 
  criminal offence of inciting hatred, and that their claims fall outside the 
  ambit of the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H.19, which is not concerned 
  with intentional torts. </p>
<p>[19] I agree with the motions judge's decision that these claims can only be 
  properly addressed under the law of defamation. In pursuing their claim for 
  defamation, the appellants also seek to create new causes of action. In Frame 
  v. Smith (1987), 42 D.L.R. (4th) 81 (S.C.C.) at 114, LaForest J. warns of the 
  danger inherent in this course, noting that novel and ill-defined causes of 
  action, no matter how well intentioned, may cause more harm than the wrong they 
  seek to address.</p>
<p>[20] In my view, the concerns articulated by LaForest J. are applicable in 
  the instant appeal. The appellants argue, for example, that the respondents 
  are liable for the conduct of, among others, the government of the People's 
  Republic of China. The scope of potential liability under the proposed causes 
  of action is unclear at best, and the need for the establishment of new causes 
  of action has not been established. </p>
<p>[21] I am also of the view that the statement of Montgomery J. in Elliott v. 
  Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 677 is relevant to the other 
  causes of action that are advanced on behalf of the appellants when he stated 
  at p. 689: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, the whole claim rests on the publication of the film and the book. 
  Attempts to find another cause of action inexorably lead back to the alleged 
  harm and damage to reputation by the words claimed of. The so-called subsidiary 
  torts are nothing more or less than defamation.</p>
<p>DISPOSITION </p>
<p>
  [22] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs payable to the 
  respondent on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $6,000.</p>
