<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Robert E. Zelinski of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated February 5, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>WEILER J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] Following a five day trial, the appellant was convicted of one count of 
  possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5 (2) of 
  the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c.19. The appellant applies 
  for leave to appeal his sentence, and if leave be granted, appeals against his 
  sentence of eight years imposed on February 5, 2001. </p>
<p>[2] On March 11, 1999, police officers conducted a search at the residence 
  of John Arabia, a known drug trafficker. During the search, the appellant drove 
  his truck onto Arabia&#146;s driveway and was ordered to stop by the police. 
  The appellant did not stop and instead drove past Arabia&#146;s house along 
  the driveway, got stuck in a snow bank, extricated his truck, crashed through 
  two gates and fled on an unploughed &#147;bush road&#148; where he also got 
  stuck. The appellant walked away from his truck using obscenities, and ignoring 
  police demands to surrender. He was arrested at gunpoint only after being forcibly 
  subdued. The police found two sealed tin cans discarded by the appellant containing 
  over one-half kilogram of 74% pure cocaine with an estimated value of $62,500. 
  On a slip of paper in his wallet he had a list of items that he stated should 
  be available to his family to guarantee their needs should Thunder Bay experience 
  an ice storm and also against the predicted catastrophic consequences of the 
  transition into the new millennium. The list included reference to a canning 
  machine, a 2-way radio with base system and a night vision device. There were 
  also innocuous items such as a generator, fuel and fuel tanks. Expert evidence 
  was that traffickers are always looking for new ways to conceal their product. 
  The appellant denied having a canning machine capable of closing tin cans but 
  said that the device he had in mind was to close Mason glass jars. </p>
<p>[3] The appellant and Mr. Arabia met in Stoney Mountain Penitentiary. Both 
  operate hobby farms and live within a drive of five to ten minutes from each 
  other. The appellant&#146;s defence at trial was that he went to Mr. Arabia&#146;s 
  house to pick up calf feed and powdered milk. He fled the scene having mistaken 
  the officers for motorcycle gang members. He was scooping snow away from the 
  front of his truck when he happened across the cans containing cocaine and scooped 
  them away. This account was rejected by the trial judge who found the appellant 
  guilty of transporting the cocaine. </p>
<p>[4] At the time of sentencing Mr. Bajada was 51 years old. At the age of 18 
  he joined the U.S. army and became a member of its special forces. He became 
  a military policeman and was honourably discharged. He became a private security 
  officer and then went to Australia. There, he was convicted of robbery, sentenced 
  to seven years imprisonment, escaped and had an additional term of incarceration 
  imposed. He was deported to Canada in 1980. He settled in Thunder Bay while 
  visiting relatives. </p>
<p>[5] The appellant has a criminal record, with convictions and sentences as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent">1986: Conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic (3 months)</p>
<p class="indent">1987: Assault causing bodily harm ($750 fine)</p>
<p class="indent">1988: Extortion (3 years)</p>
<p class="indent">1988: Trafficking in a narcotic (30 months, consecutive)</p>
<p class="indent">1989: Failure to comply with a recognizance (1 day, 
  concurrent)</p>
<p class="indent">1990: Failure to declare income tax (6 months, concurrent)</p>
<p class="indent">1991: Trafficking in a narcotic (15 months, consecutive)</p>
<p class="indent">1996: Possession of a narcotic ($200 fine)</p>
<p>[6] The conviction for extortion was also related to drug trafficking. The 
  two extortion victims were an employee of the appellant and the employee&#146;s 
  boyfriend, a courier driver. According to the Crown, the boyfriend stole a quantity 
  of cocaine that he was to have delivered for the appellant. The victims were 
  in the course of selling the cocaine when the appellant and two others using 
  self help recovered the value of what had been stolen. The appellant stated 
  that $15,000 cash had been stolen from him and the recovery consisted of $6,500 
  in cash, some sound speakers and the transfer of ownership of one victim&#146;s 
  vehicle as well as cocaine recovered from two places where it had been trafficked. 
  The appellant said he gave the cocaine to his companions &#147;in exchange for 
  backing him up.&#148; </p>
<p>[7] In submissions as to sentence the defence submitted that an appropriate 
  sentence was two and a half to three years. The Crown asked for seven to ten 
  years imprisonment.</p>
<p>[8] The sentencing judge considered the appellant&#146;s age, the fact that 
  he had a young family and the submissions by defence counsel respecting the 
  gap in the appellant&#146;s record. He stated no matter how long the gap was 
  the appellant was not entitled to better treatment than a first offender. At 
  a later point in his reasons the sentencing judge referred to two cases involving 
  importing by couriers who were first offenders: R. .v. Cunningham, [1996] O.J. 
  No. 448 (C.A.) and R. v. Syblis, [2001] O.J. No.115 (C.A.). He stated: </p>
<p class="indent">It has always been the practice of Courts in Ontario 
  to consider that couriers were more dupes than principals. They are not the 
  ones who benefit from commercial gain and the greed of traffickers and the vast 
  profits to be made by traffickers. Thus, in Cunningham, a first offender, a 
  courier, was told six to eight years is a proper sentence. </p>
<p>Importing vs. Trafficking<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in principle and 
  sentenced the appellant as if he had been convicted of importing cocaine. Six 
  to eight years is the appropriate range of sentence for first offenders convicted 
  of importing large amounts of cocaine as couriers following the decisions of 
  this court in the companion cases of Cunningham, supra, and R. v. Madden (1996), 
  27 O.R. (3d) 640 (C.A.); recently reaffirmed by this court in R. v. C.N.H., 
  [2002] O.J. No. 4918 (C.A.) per Rosenberg J.A.</p>
<p>[10] The offence of importing cocaine has generally been treated as a more 
  serious offence than the offence of possession for the purposes of trafficking. 
  The trial judge made no finding as to the appellant&#146;s relative position 
  in the drug hierarchy, nor did he find that the appellant was involved in bringing 
  the cocaine into the country. Moreover in this case the amount of cocaine involved 
  while sizeable was not of the multi kilogram magnitude in Cunningham. The sentencing 
  judge appears to have erred in principle in using these importing cases as a 
  sentencing benchmark. It is therefore incumbent on this court to impose a fit 
  sentence.</p>
<p>[11] The appellant submits that a sentence of eight years is outside the appropriate 
  range of sentence having regard to the circumstances of this offender for this 
  offence. </p>
<p>[12] In his book, Sentencing, 5th ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999), Clayton 
  C. Ruby states under the heading Cocaine at p. 865-866:</p>
<p class="indent">Cocaine used to be regarded by the courts as a drug 
  which is somewhat more serious than marijuana but less serious than heroin. 
  However, due to the existence of crack cocaine and intravenous cocaine users, 
  this attitude seems to be changing. More recent sentences for cocaine seem on 
  par with those imposed for heroin possession or trafficking.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.in the case of Finlay and Grelette, the accused 
  were convicted of what was described as a very serious offence involving 20 
  ounces of high purity cocaine and were concluded to be close to the level of 
  importers. Sentences of four and one&#150;half and six and one-half years were 
  imposed according to the accuseds&#146; relative degrees of involvement. The 
  court noted that although general deterrence was the primary factor to be considered 
  in the imposition of sentence, &#147;the rehabilitation of the offender can 
  never be entirely overlooked and in each case the offender must be dealt with 
  as constructively as the circumstances of the case permit.</p>
<p>[13] It would appear that sentences of five to five and one half years are 
  not uncommon for possession of a substantial amount of cocaine for the purposes 
  of trafficking following an accused&#146;s plea of guilty or where the accused 
  has no prior record. See e.g. R. v. Marton, [1980] O.J. No. 868 (C.A.); R. v. 
  Molino (1987), 2 W.C.B. (2d) 391 (Ont. Dist. Ct.); R. v. Charles, [1997] O.J. 
  No. 2247 (Gen. Div.); R. v. Cummings, [1990] O.J. No. 2747 (Dist. Ct.); R. v. 
  Jones (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.). In R. v. Finlay and Grelette, [1985] 
  O.J. No. 2173 (C.A.), referred to above, this court imposed a sentence of six 
  and a half years on an offender with one minor criminal offence fifteen years 
  earlier, having regard to his position in the drug hierarchy which was close 
  to the level of an importer. Longer sentences were upheld in R. v. Boughner, 
  [1999] O.J. No. 5449 (Sup. Ct.), aff&#146;d [2002] O.J. No. 2181 (C.A.) where, 
  in addition to credit of 14 months for 5 months of pre-trial custody, the appellant 
  was sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment for possession of 66 grams 
  of 74% pure cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of money derived 
  from the commission of an offence. An aggravating factor was evidence that the 
  appellant had been trafficking in cocaine over the preceding one and a half 
  years. He also had three prior convictions for possession of a narcotic and 
  one conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking. In R. v. Gibson 
  (1996), 87 O.A.C. 393 (C.A.), a sentence of eight years was upheld for trafficking 
  in cocaine with respect to a repeat narcotics offender with a serious criminal 
  record apart from drug convictions. More recently, in R. v. Bertucci, [2002] 
  O.J. No. 3870 (C.A.), a sentence of seven years was considered by this court 
  on an appeal from sentence respecting one count of conspiracy to traffic in 
  cocaine following the appellant&#146;s trial and conviction. Concurrent sentences 
  respecting six counts of trafficking in cocaine during an overlapping period 
  were also imposed. The court stated that a sentence of seven years was a fit 
  sentence for the offence of conspiracy to traffic standing alone. However, having 
  regard to the fact that one count of trafficking was set aside the court reduced 
  the sentence to six years.</p>
<p>[14] Having regard to these factors, as well as the appellant&#146;s age, I 
  am of the opinion that a fit sentence in this case would be one of six years 
  imprisonment.</p>
<p>[15] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal 
  as to sentence and reduce the sentence to six years. Appeal allowed.</p>
