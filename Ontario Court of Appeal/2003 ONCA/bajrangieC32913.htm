<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice E.R. Browne of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 29, 1996 and from the sentence imposed by Justice 
  E.R. Browne dated October 29, 1996.</p>
<P>
  GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] On September 26, 1993, the appellant killed his wife by shooting her 13 
  times with a 9mm Beretta pistol. He was charged with first-degree murder.</p>    <P>
  [2] On September 29, 1996 he was convicted of second-degree murder. On October 
  29, 1996 he was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole 
  for a period of 15 years.</p>    <P>
  [3] The appellant appeals his conviction and, if leave is granted, his sentence.</p>    <P>
  [4] The appellant raises a number of arguments on his conviction appeal. I called 
  on the Crown to respond to three of them. </p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant's first argument concerns the role played in the trial by 
  a psychiatrist, Dr. Norris.</p>    <P>
  [6] Dr. Norris was retained by defence counsel in early October 1993. He interviewed 
  the appellant on October 13 and 19, 1993. He prepared a four and one-half page 
  report for defence counsel dated October 28, 1993 in which he reviewed at some 
  length the appellant's history and his account of the day of the killing. Dr. 
  Norris gave his preliminary opinion, which was that the appellant was fit to 
  stand trial, but that there was strong suggestive evidence that made desirable 
  the appellant's admission to St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital for a 60-day assessment 
  of his criminal responsibility. Dr. Norris was a consulting psychiatrist at 
  that hospital.</p>    <P>
  [7] The fresh evidence tendered by the appellant shows that defence counsel 
  explained this proposal to the appellant, making clear that it was Dr. Norris 
  who would do the assessment, that it would be available to the Crown and that 
  it could be used at trial to impeach the appellant's credibility. The appellant 
  approved of this proposal. </p>    <P>
  [8] On December 1, 1993, defence counsel applied for the necessary court order, 
  using in support a short letter from Dr. Norris dated November 30, 1993 which 
  said only that he had met with the appellant on October 13 and 19 and that a 
  60-day period for assessment of the appellant's criminal responsibility for 
  the alleged offence and his fitness to stand trial was warranted.</p>    <P>
  [9] Dr. Norris' assessment report to the court is dated February 10, 1994. While 
  it is not based on his October interviews with the appellant or his prior report 
  to defence counsel of October 28, 1993, it contains much of the same information. 
  It addresses the appellant's history and his account of the day of the killing. 
  It also gives Dr. Norris' opinion, which by that time was that there was no 
  strong evidence to satisfy the criteria for a s. 16 defence and that the appellant 
  was fully fit to stand trial. </p>    <P>
  [10] Like the November 30, 1993 letter, this report was supplied to the Crown. 
  </p>    <P>
  [11] Not surprisingly, the defence then sought the assistance of other experts, 
  Dr. Langevin, a psychologist, and Dr. Gojer, a psychiatrist. Both gave evidence 
  for the defence at trial from which it is clear that both were given Dr. Norris' 
  October 28, 1993 report by defence counsel to assist in preparing their own 
  opinions.</p>    <P>
  [12] The fresh evidence also revealed that very shortly before trial, or early 
  in the trial, the Crown retained Dr. Norris when defence counsel advised that 
  he intended to call psychiatric evidence. The Crown did so because Dr. Norris 
  was the author of the court ordered assessment report.</p>    <P>
  [13] The trial began on September 9, 1996. On September 18, 1996, the Crown 
  and defence counsel consented to an order excepting the experts from the order 
  excluding witnesses. Dr. Norris remained in the courtroom for the Crown as did 
  Dr. Langevin for the defence. Indeed Dr. Langevin's evidence began on that day.</p>    <P>
  [14] On September 20, 1996, the Crown acquired from Dr. Norris his notes of 
  his interviews with the appellant on October 13 and 19, 1993. These notes were 
  immediately disclosed to the defence. While it is clear that at some point after 
  the Crown retained Dr. Norris it acquired a copy of his report of October 28, 
  1993, the precise date of acquisition is unclear.</p>    <P>
  [15] The Crown called no psychiatric evidence in chief. When the appellant gave 
  evidence in his own defence, the Crown initially proposed to cross-examine him 
  on his statements to Dr. Norris, but after defence counsel objected that the 
  statements could not be said to be voluntary, the Crown declined to pursue this 
  line of questioning. </p>    <P>
  [16] Similarly, the Crown sought to call Dr. Norris in reply, but when defence 
  counsel objected that Dr. Norris had a conflict of interest and was thereby 
  not a competent witness, the Crown decided against calling Dr. Norris at all. 
  </p>    <P>
  [17] Against this factual backdrop, the appellant makes two submissions.</p>    <P>
  [18] The first is that the Crown acquired from Dr. Norris the information contained 
  in his report of October 28, 1993 and in his notes of his two interviews with 
  the appellant earlier that month and that this material was protected by privilege 
  which had not been waived. The appellant says that this rendered the trial unfair.</p>    <P>
  [19] I do not agree. In summary, my view is that the privilege was probably 
  waived, at least in substantial measure, but more importantly, no prejudice 
  resulted.</p>    <P>
  [20] On the question of privilege, there is no doubt that Dr. Norris' notes 
  and his October 28 report were created at the request of defence counsel for 
  the purpose of litigation and were therefore protected by privilege. There is 
  also no doubt of the fundamental importance of privilege to our system of justice. 
  See R. v. McClure, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445. </p>    <P>
  [21] It is unfortunate that neither the Crown nor the defence raised the question 
  of privilege (and its possible waiver) at trial so that it could be properly 
  explored at that point when the facts could be fully fleshed out and the range 
  of options for dealing with the issue was greatest. However, when the Crown 
  received a copy of Dr. Norris' notes and his October 28 report that was clearly 
  prepared for defence counsel, the issue of privilege apparently did not register. 
  Equally, after the defence learned that the Crown had retained Dr. Norris as 
  its expert, while objections were made based on voluntariness and conflict of 
  interest, no issue of privilege was raised.</p>    <P>
  [22] Hence I am left to determine the issue at first instance on appeal with 
  some assistance from the fresh evidence, upon which both parties have drawn.</p>    <P>
  [23] Turning first to Dr. Norris' report of October 28, 1993, it is important 
  to underline that the information it contains about the appellant's history 
  and his account of the day of the killing is essentially repeated in his February 
  10, 1994 assessment done for the court. The latter was required to be given 
  to the Crown and was available to be used at trial by the Crown within the constraints 
  provided by s. 672 of the Code. Given that the appellant raised both an automatism 
  defence and a s. 16 defence, those constraints were limited in this trial. Within 
  those constraints, the information in the October 28, 1993 report that was essentially 
  repeated in the February 10, 1994 report would appear to have lost the protection 
  of privilege by the time of trial.</p>    <P>
  [24] As to Dr. Norris' notes of his meetings with the appellant on October 13 
  and 19, 1993, the privilege would appear to have been lost on September 18, 
  1996 when Dr. Langevin began to give evidence. Dr. Langevin had reviewed Dr. 
  Norris' October 28, 1993 report in preparing his own opinion and could be cross-examined 
  on it and the meetings from which it was derived.</p>    <P>
  [25] However, it is unnecessary to finally decide the privilege issue, because 
  in my view it cannot be said that any prejudice resulted to the appellant. The 
  information in the October 28, 1993 report was essentially repeated in the February 
  10, 1994 assessment report for the court. The notes of the two October meetings 
  are best described as cryptic. Indeed in opposing the calling of Dr. Norris 
  by the Crown, defence counsel described them as scanty having &quot;almost nothing 
  to them.&quot; Most importantly, at trial the Crown tendered none of this information. 
  Dr. Norris gave no evidence and the appellant was not cross-examined on what 
  he said to Dr. Norris. Thus it cannot be concluded that the Crown's acquisition 
  of the October 28, 1993 report and the notes of the two October meetings rendered 
  the trial unfair.</p>    <P>
  [26] The appellant's second submission is that Dr. Norris' presence at the trial 
  on behalf of the Crown rendered the trial unfair. The simple answer to this 
  submission is that defence counsel consented to his presence, and in return 
  was permitted to have his own expert present. </p>    <P>
  [27] Thus both submissions in support of this ground of appeal must fail.</p>    <P>
  [28] The second ground of appeal upon which I sought the Crown's response is 
  that the trial judge erred in putting the defence of non-insane automatism to 
  the jury and in doing so failed to conform to the requirements of R. v. Stone, 
  [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290.</p>    <P>
  [29] I do not agree with this submission. In my view the trial judge adequately 
  explained non-insane automatism in his charge. While he did not apply the law 
  as set out in Stone since that case had not yet been decided, that was to the 
  appellant's benefit. Where Stone requires an accused to establish this defence 
  on a balance of probabilities, the trial judge told the jury that the appellant 
  could be acquitted on the basis of this defence if he raised a reasonable doubt 
  in respect of it. That was consistent with the state of the law at that time. 
  Therefore this ground of appeal must also fail.</p>    <P>
  [30] The appellant's third argument is that the trial judge erred in putting 
  the s. 16 defence to the jury because in doing so he took away the possibility 
  that the appellant did not know that his acts were legally wrong. In addition, 
  it is argued that the trial judge misstated the evidence of Dr. Gojer in putting 
  this defence to the jury. </p>    <P>
  [31] While the trial judge did tell the jury that the s. 16 test &quot;is not 
  scaled against 'legally wrong'&quot;, I do not view this as a reversible error. 
  There was no evidence at trial to support a finding that the appellant did not 
  know his actions were legally wrong. Moreover, while the trial judge originally 
  stated the evidence of Dr. Gojer in a way that could have been misleading, he 
  corrected this in his recharge. Thus I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal either.</p>    <P>
  [32] The grounds of appeal from conviction on which I did not hear from the 
  Crown can be dealt with briefly.</p>    <P>
  [33] I do not view any errors in the self-defence charge as fatal because the 
  defence had no air of reality. There was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant 
  felt he had no way to preserve himself except to shoot his wife or that in shooting 
  her he did not intend to kill her.</p>    <P>
  [34] Nor did the trial judge err in his treatment of the hearsay elicited by 
  the Crown from the defence experts. He clearly and correctly warned the jury 
  about the limited use that could be made of that evidence.</p>    <P>
  [35] His charge on reasonable doubt, though predating R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 
  3 S.C.R. 320, was adequate to the task. Through a question it asked, the jury 
  made clear that it knew the distinction between the criminal and civil burdens 
  of proof. Viewing the charge as a whole there is no reasonable likelihood that 
  the jury misunderstood the criminal standard of proof. </p>    <P>
  [36] The trial judge did not err in charging the jury that an adverse inference 
  could not be drawn from the Crown's failure to call reply psychiatric evidence. 
  It was the vehement objection of defence counsel, knowing that Dr. Norris would 
  contradict the defence psychiatric evidence, that resulted in the Crown not 
  doing so.</p>    <P>
  [37] I disagree that the trial judge erred in singling out the accused as having 
  a motive to lie. The trial judge simply did not do this.</p>    <P>
  [38] Finally, the evidence of the deceased's emotional state prior to being 
  killed was properly admitted, given the defence of self-defence. That made relevant 
  the nature of their marital problems including her feelings. The existence of 
  these problems was admitted by the appellant. Hence the hearsay nature of some 
  of this evidence was of no moment.</p>    <P>
  [39] In the result the conviction appeal must be dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [40] The sentence appeal challenges the imposition of a 15 year period of parole 
  ineligibility. In raising that period to this level, the trial judge treated 
  as an aggravating factor that the appellant had attempted to shoot and kill 
  his previous wife in 1975. This was not properly established but was before 
  the trial judge only as hearsay recounted by Dr. Gojer. Indeed the trial judge 
  expressly instructed the jury to disregard that evidence for its truth.</p>    <P>
  [41] In my view the use of this as an aggravating factor represents an error 
  in principle that warrants the setting aside of this sentence.</p>    <P>
  [42] The appropriate range of parole ineligibility for a brutal domestic homicide 
  of an unarmed victim was suggested to be 12 to 15 years by this court in R. 
  v. McKnight (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 263 (C.A.). In that case a period of parole 
  ineligibility of 14 years was imposed by this court.</p>    <P>
  [43] While the appellant committed a murder that can only be described as brutal 
  and horrific, the facts of McKnight bespeak a savagery that sets that case apart 
  from this one. Taking that into account together with the other factors relevant 
  to sentencing that were properly considered by the trial judge I would set aside 
  the sentence imposed by the trial judge and impose a period of parole ineligibility 
  of 13 years.</p>    <P>
  [44] The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted and the period of parole ineligibility varied to 13 years. </p>    <P>
