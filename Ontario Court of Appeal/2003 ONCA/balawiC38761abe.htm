<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There is no basis upon which it could be said that the information retrieved 
  by the U.S. customs officer from information stored in his computer system have 
  been &quot;gathered in Canada&quot; merely because it refers to the theft of 
  automobiles in Canada.</p>
<p>
  [2] There was ample evidence of identification apart from the evidence of what 
  Bell would say at trial. That evidence was, however, admissible in any event.</p>
<p>
  [3] Apart entirely from the Criminal Code provision, the evidence that the appellant 
  covered the VIN numbers by placing a false VIN number over it provided cogent 
  evidence that the vehicles were stolen and the appellant was aware that they 
  were stolen.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
