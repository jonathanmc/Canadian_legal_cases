<p>On appeal from an order of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse dated October 22, 2001 
  and an order of Justice Wailan Low dated October 15, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Richard Ballentine, appeals the orders of two superior court 
  judges.</p>
<p>[2] In an order in October 2001, Justice Nancy Backhouse dismissed the appellant&#146;s 
  application to vary his spousal support obligation and to cancel his arrears 
  of spousal support. Pursuant to s. 140(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43 (&#147;the CJA&#148;), which deals with &#147;vexatious proceedings&#148;, 
  Backhouse J. also ordered that the appellant could institute no further proceedings 
  with respect to spousal support, save with leave of the court.</p>
<p>[3] In July 2002, the appellant applied for leave to bring an application virtually 
  identical to the one he had lost before Backhouse J. In an order in October 
  2002, Justice Wailan Low dismissed the application on two grounds: (1) some 
  of the issues raised by the appellant were res judicata following Backhouse 
  J.&#146;s order, which the appellant had appealed to this court; and (2) on 
  the merits, there had not been a change of circumstances sufficient to justify 
  the granting of leave.</p>
<p>[4] Although the appeals from the orders of Backhouse J. and Low J. raise several 
  issues, the principal issue cutting across both appeals is Backhouse J.&#146;s 
  invocation, accepted by Low J., of s. 140(1) of the CJA to prevent the appellant 
  from initiating further proceedings with respect to spousal support without 
  leave of the court. The appellant contends that this application of a vexatious 
  proceedings provision of an Ontario statute conflicts with s. 17 of the federal 
  Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.), c. 3 (&#147;the DA&#148;), which permits 
  a court to vary a spousal support order if there has been &#147;a change in 
  the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of either former spouse&#133;since 
  the making of the support order&#148;.</p>
<p>B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant and Hilda Ballentine, the respondent, were married in 1956 
  and separated in 1970. Both parties are now 68 years old. When the Ballentines 
  separated, they entered into a separation agreement, the terms of which were 
  incorporated into the divorce decree in 1976. There was a term relating to spousal 
  support that obliged the appellant to pay $1,000 per month to his former wife. 
  This amount increased annually as a result of cost of living adjustments and 
  is now approximately $4,750 per month. The appellant met his support obligations 
  until 1995. Since then, arrears have accumulated.</p>
<p>[6] The parties have been engaged in litigation for more than 15 years. In 
  September 1987, the appellant brought an application to end or reduce spousal 
  support. He abandoned this application.</p>
<p>[7] In August 1999, Cullity J. granted the respondent&#146;s motion for a writ 
  of seizure and sale. He fixed arrears of spousal support at $187,491.26 as of 
  July 25, 1999. An appeal from Cullity J.&#146;s order was dismissed by this 
  court on July 31, 2000.</p>
<p>[8] In October 2000, Greer J. ordered that the appellant be removed as a trustee 
  of the R.B. Ballentine Family Trust. An appeal from Greer J.&#146;s order was 
  dismissed by this court on May 29, 2001.</p>
<p>(2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  [9] On October 9, 2001, Backhouse J. heard an application brought by the appellant 
  in which he sought to vary his spousal support obligation from approximately 
  $4,500 per month to nil and to cancel all arrears, which at that time were about 
  $308,000. Backhouse J. also heard a cross-application brought by the respondent 
  seeking, inter alia, an order pursuant to s. 140 of the CJA preventing the appellant 
  from commencing any further proceedings relating to spousal support without 
  leave of the court.</p>
<p>[10] Backhouse J. dismissed the appellant&#146;s application. She concluded:</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Ballentine has the onus 
  of proving the factual conditions for rescinding or varying an order. 
  He has failed to meet that onus. The order of Justice Cullity, which was confirmed 
  on appeal, crystallizes the arrears as of July 25, 1999 at $187,491.26. This 
  issue has been dealt with finally, and as a result, Mr. Ballentine has no basis 
  on which to request that these arrears be expunged. Justice Cullity found that 
  Mr. Ballentine had not provided evidence to establish that there had been a 
  necessary material change of circumstances pursuant to section 17 of the Divorce 
  Act. Mr. Ballentine has not provided any further or different evidence of a 
  material change in his circumstances since August of 1999.</p>
<p>[11] Backhouse J. granted the respondent&#146;s cross-application. She held:</p>
<p class="indent">The issue of at least part of the arrears has already been finally 
  determined. It is obvious that the application cannot succeed. Mr. Ballentine 
  has failed in every instance to pay cost awards of prior unsuccessful proceedings. 
  His appeals have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="indent">I find that Mr. Ballentine&#146;s conduct as a litigant falls 
  within the principles enunciated by the caselaw. I conclude that he has abused 
  the process of this court. In my view, maintenance of the integrity of the courts 
  and the proper administration of justice requires that judicial restraint be 
  exercised in relation to Mr. Ballentine in accordance with ss. 140(1) of the 
  Courts of Justice Act.</p>
<p>[12] The appellant waited a few months, and then applied for leave to make 
  an application to vary the divorce judgment to delete his obligation to pay 
  spousal support and for an order cancelling all arrears of spousal support.</p>
<p>[13] Low. J. dismissed the appellant&#146;s application. She held that some 
  of the issues raised by the appellant were essentially the same as those that 
  had been determined by Backhouse J. Since the appellant had appealed Backhouse 
  J.&#146;s order, those issues were res judicata. In addition, Low J. held that 
  &#147;[t]here is no new change of circumstance following the motion before Justice 
  Backhouse.&#148;</p>
<p>[14] The appellant appeals the orders of Backhouse J. and Low J.</p>
<p>C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant framed the issues somewhat differently in the two Notices 
  of Appeal, two facta and oral argument at the hearing. As I understand the appellant&#146;s 
  submissions, the issues on the two appeals are:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Did Backhouse J err by failing to hold a proper hearing 
  with respect to the appellant&#146;s variation application?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In light of s. 17 of the Divorce Act, did Backhouse J. err 
  by concluding that she had jurisdiction to make a &#145;vexatious proceedings&#146; 
  order against the appellant pursuant to s. 140 of the Courts of Justice Act?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In any event, did Backhouse J. err by making a &#145;vexatious 
  proceedings&#146; order against the appellant?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did Low J. err by dismissing the appellant&#146;s application 
  for leave to make an application to vary his spousal support obligation and 
  to cancel his arrears of spousal support?</p>
<p>D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Failure to hold a proper hearing with respect to appellant&#146;s variation 
  application </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant&#146;s application and respondent&#146;s cross-application 
  came before Backhouse J. on October 9, 2001. The appellant represented himself; 
  the respondent was represented by counsel. The appellant contends that the hearing 
  focused on the respondent&#146;s cross-application, and that he did not have 
  an opportunity to explain the changes in his circumstances that might have led 
  to granting his variation application.</p>
<p>[17] I disagree. Both parties filed material in support of their applications. 
  The appellant filed a Notice of Application, an affidavit and supporting documentation. 
  A 37-page transcript of the hearing before Backhouse J. was prepared. It is 
  clear from this transcript that although most of the submissions made by the 
  appellant and the respondent&#146;s counsel were directed at the latter&#146;s 
  cross-application, the appellant was given the opportunity to argue, and in 
  fact argued, the merits of his application. Indeed, the appellant began his 
  submissions by referring to the principal ground for his variation application, 
  &#147;inability to pay&#148;.</p>
<p>[18] Moreover, near the end of the hearing after the appellant expressed a 
  concern that the result of the cross-application might mean that his application 
  would not proceed on the merits, Backhouse J. assured him that such was not 
  the case and specifically asked him: &#147;Is there anything else you want to 
  say about your application?&#148; The appellant proceeded to made additional 
  submissions about his personal financial circumstances, illness and past business 
  reverses.</p>
<p>[19] In summary, Backhouse J. conducted a proper hearing of the appellant&#146;s 
  application and was entitled to determine it on the merits.</p>
<p>(2) Section 140 of the Courts of Justice Act and s. 17 of the Divorce Act</p>
<p>
  [20] This is the principal issue on these appeals. Backhouse J. made an order 
  pursuant to s. 140 of the CJA that the appellant not institute further proceedings 
  with respect to spousal support and arrears without leave of the court. The 
  appellant submits that Backhouse J. had no jurisdiction to make this order because, 
  under s. 17 of the DA, the only pre-condition to a variation in spousal support 
  is a material change in circumstances. Accordingly, the appellant asserts, a 
  judge does not have the power to impose additional conditions precedent on an 
  application to vary a support order.</p>
<p>[21] Section 140(1) of the CJA provides:</p>
<p class="indent">140(1) Where a judge of the Superior Court of Justice is satisfied, 
  on application, that a person has persistently and without reasonable grounds,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) instituted vexatious proceedings in any court; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) conducted a proceeding in any court in a vexatious manner,</p>
<p class="indent">the judge may order that,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) no further proceeding be instituted by the person in any 
  court; or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) a proceeding previously instituted by the person in any 
  court not be continued,</p>
<p class="indent">except by leave of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[22] The applicable portions of s. 17 of the DA provide:</p>
<p class="indent">17.(1) A court of competent jurisdiction may make an order varying, 
  rescinding or suspending, prospectively or retroactively,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) a support order or any provision thereof on application 
  by either or both former spouses....</p>
<p class="center">. . . . .</p>
<p class="indent">(4.1) Before the court makes a variation order in respect of 
  a spousal support order, the court shall satisfy itself that a change in the 
  condition, means, needs or other circumstances of either former spouse has occurred 
  since the making of the spousal support order&#133;and, in making the variation 
  order, the court shall take that change into consideration.</p>
<p>[23] The main argument that the appellant makes on this issue is that Backhouse 
  J.&#146;s decision is inconsistent with the decision of the Manitoba Court of 
  Appeal in Hauff v. Hauff (1997), 118 Man. R. (2d) 164, and that Hauff should 
  be followed in Ontario.</p>
<p>[24] Hauff involved a dispute between two former spouses who had separated 
  after 19 years of marriage. In 1993, Mr. Hauff was ordered to pay spousal support. 
  Subsequently, Mr. Hauff brought several variation applications. The variation 
  application that was returnable on August 8, 1995 was adjourned to December 
  7, 1995. In the interim, Mr. Hauff decided that there were further issues he 
  wanted brought to the court&#146;s attention, so he requested that the matter 
  be further adjourned and heard on the basis of a fresh application and affidavit. 
  On December 7, 1995, rather than responding to the adjournment request, Bowman 
  J. dismissed Mr. Hauff&#146;s initial request in the application of August 8. 
  She also ordered a stay that prohibited Mr. Hauff from filing further variation 
  applications without leave of the court until certain cost orders had been paid. 
</p>
<p>[25] The stay order was not appealed. Instead, Mr. Hauff brought an application 
  for leave to apply for variation. Bowman J. denied leave. Mr. Hauff appealed 
  Bowman J.&#146;s order that denied him leave. On appeal, the Manitoba Court 
  of Appeal brought it to the parties&#146; attention that Bowman J. may have 
  exceeded her jurisdiction in ordering the stay. The parties were invited to 
  make submissions on that issue.</p>
<p>[26] The Court of Appeal decided that Bowman J. exceeded her jurisdiction by 
  ordering the stay. Kroft J.A. stated, at para. 11:</p>
<p class="indent">There is no jurisdiction for a motions court judge to make an 
  order staying future variation applications without leave. To do so would fly 
  directly in the face of the Divorce Act, 1985, which specifically permits any 
  party to bring an application for variation in the event of a material change 
  in circumstances and makes no mention of imposing conditions precedent as to 
  obtaining leave.</p>
<p>[27] In my view, this broad statement by the court must be read in context. 
  Immediately after the passage cited above, the court stated, at para. 12: &#147;This 
  sort of situation was addressed in Shaward v. Shaward (1988), 51 Man. R. (2d) 
  222 (sC.A.).&#148; In Shaward, the court decided that, in the absence statutory 
  authority, a judge did not have the jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting 
  a person from initiating legal proceedings without leave of the court. </p>
<p>[28] At the time Shaward was decided, Manitoba did not have legislation similar 
  to s. 140 of the CJA. That was remedied on March 1, 1989, with the passing of 
  The Court of Queen&#146;s Bench Act, L.M. 1988-89, c. 4, s. 73(1) (&#147;the 
  CQBA&#148;), which states:</p>
<p class="indent">73(1) Where a judge is satisfied, on application, that a person, 
  persistently and without reasonable grounds, is</p>
<p class="indent">(a) instituting vexatious proceedings in the court; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) conducting a proceeding in a vexatious manner, </p>
<p class="indent">the judge may order that,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the person shall not institute a further proceeding; or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) a proceeding instituted by the person not be continued,</p>
<p class="indent">except with leave of a judge.</p>
<p>[29] Accordingly, when the court decided Hauff, the relevant statutory authority 
  was available. This was acknowledged by the court in Hauff at para. 13. However, 
  at para. 14 the court states:</p>
<p class="indent">In any event, when the learned motions court judge made her 
  order of December 7, 1995, there was no suggestion that she was acting pursuant 
  to s. 73(1) of the Court of Queen&#146;s Bench Act.</p>
<p>[30] It should be noted that, on the facts of Hauff, the motions judge could 
  not have been exercising her statutory authority. Section 73 of CQBA requires 
  an application for the order, and the Attorney General must consent to the application. 
  Based on the facts of Hauff, it appears that the motions judge made the order 
  without an application or consent of the Attorney General. </p>
<p>[31] The court&#146;s statement in para. 14 that there was no suggestion that 
  the trial judge was acting pursuant to s. 73 of the CQBA, combined with the 
  court&#146;s statement in para. 12 that &#147;[t]his sort of situation was addressed 
  in Shaward&#148;, indicates that the court was confirming that a judge does 
  not have inherent jurisdiction to issue an order prohibiting variation applications 
  from being initiated without leave of the court. The court was not deciding 
  whether a judge could make such an order pursuant to statutory authority. </p>
<p>[32] Hauff has had no judicial consideration. However, there are two other 
  Manitoba cases of interest. In Winkler v. Winkler (1990), 70 Man. R. (2d) 47 
  (Q.B.); aff&#146;d (1991), 70 Man. R. (2d) 45 (C.A.), Mrs. Winkler had brought 
  numerous variation applications relating to access and spousal support under 
  s. 17 of the DA. She was declared a vexatious litigant and prohibited from bringing 
  further proceedings without leave of a judge. Similarly, in Lockwood v. Lockwood 
  (2002), 162 Man. R. (2d) 139 (Q.B.), Ms. Lockwood had brought applications to 
  vary custody and spousal support under s. 17 of the DA. She was declared a vexatious 
  litigant and prohibited from bringing further proceedings without leave. In 
  both Winkler and Lockwood, applications had been brought pursuant to s. 73 of 
  the CQBA, and the judges made orders pursuant to that statutory authority. There 
  was no discussion in either case questioning the jurisdiction of the judge to 
  make the order. </p>
<p>[33] Accordingly, it is my view that Hauff can be distinguished from the present 
  case because it was not dealing with a judge&#146;s statutory authority to prohibit 
  a person from initiating further proceedings without leave of the court. </p>
<p>[34] I turn, then, to a consideration of whether a superior court judge has 
  jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s. 140 of the CJA in relation to 
  variation of spousal support under s. 17 of the DA. The appellant submits that 
  a judge does not have this jurisdiction. He asserts that the only pre-condition 
  to variation under s. 17 of the DA is a material change of circumstances; accordingly, 
  a judge does not have the power to impose additional conditions precedent on 
  an application to vary a support order.</p>
<p>[35] The appellant has not challenged s. 140 of the CJA as being ultra vires 
  the Ontario legislature. However, he appears to be submitting that s. 140 of 
  the CJA conflicts with s. 17 of the DA and, consistent with the doctrine of 
  federal paramountcy, the DA trumps the CJA. Accordingly, it is necessary to 
  determine whether a conflict exists between s. 17 of the DA and s. 140 of the 
  CJA.</p>
<p>[36] The test for finding a conflict between two statutes is stringent. In 
  Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 
  1 S.C.R. 3 at 38-39, La Forest J. summarized the governing legal principles:</p>
<p class="indent">The basic principles of law are not in doubt. Just as subordinate 
  legislation cannot conflict with its parent legislation (Belanger v. The King 
  (1916), 54 S.C.R. 265), so too it cannot conflict with other Acts of Parliament 
  (R. &amp; W. Paul, Ltd. v. Wheat Commission, [1937] A.C. 139 (H.L.)), unless 
  a statute so authorizes (Re Gray (1918), 57 S.C.R. 150). Ordinarily, then, an 
  Act of Parliament must prevail over inconsistent or conflicting subordinate 
  legislation. However, as a matter of construction a court will, where possible, 
  prefer an interpretation that permits reconciliation of the two. &quot;Inconsistency&quot; 
  in this context refers to a situation where two legislative enactments cannot 
  stand together; see Daniels v. White, [1968] S.C.R. 517. The rule in that case 
  was stated in respect of two inconsistent statutes where one was deemed to repeal 
  the other by virtue of the inconsistency. However, the underlying rationale 
  is the same as where subordinate legislation is said to be inconsistent with 
  another Act of Parliament -- there is a presumption that the legislature did 
  not intend to make or empower the making of contradictory enactments. There 
  is also some doctrinal similarity to the principle of paramountcy in constitutional 
  division of powers cases where inconsistency has also been defined in terms 
  of contradiction -- i.e., &quot;compliance with one law involves breach of the 
  other&quot;; see Smith v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 776, at p. 800. [Emphasis 
  added.] </p>
<p>[37] In Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed. (Markham, 
  Ontario: Butterworths, 2002) at 265, Professor Ruth Sullivan states: &#147;Normally, 
  when overlapping provisions have different purposes or are concerned with different 
  aspects of a matter, they are not found to conflict with one another.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[38] In my view, there is no conflict between s. 140 of the CJA and s. 17 of 
  the DA. The statutes have different purposes. Section 17 of the DA provides 
  statutory authority to a judge to vary, rescind or suspend support orders and 
  custody orders. It also provides guidance for when such orders may be made. 
  For example, before a variation order for spousal support can be made, the court 
  must satisfy itself that there has been a change in the condition, means, needs 
  or other circumstances or either former spouse. Similarly, before an order to 
  vary custody can be made, the court must be satisfied that there has been a 
  change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of the child of 
  the marriage. </p>
<p>[39] In contrast, s. 140 of the CJA does not deal in pith and substance with 
  divorce, support or custody. Its purpose is to prevent abuses of the court&#146;s 
  process. It allows the court to make an order prohibiting a person who has persistently 
  and unreasonably instituted vexatious proceedings from instituting further legal 
  proceedings without leave of the court. This is particularly important in family 
  law matters, given the availability of variation orders for support and custody. 
  As noted by Polowin J. in Beattie v. Ladouceur (2001), 23 R.F.L. (5th) 33 at 
  62: &#147;There is a significant body of case law with respect to the issue 
  of vexatious litigation. It is perhaps not surprising that many of the cases 
  involve family litigation where emotions often run very deep.&#148; Without 
  some mechanism to prevent abuse, a party could bring an endless stream of variation 
  applications, with a new one launched as soon as the last one has been denied. 
  Indeed, this was the situation in Winkler, where Davidson J. observed, at p. 
  51:</p>
<p class="indent">The litigation between Mr. and Mrs. Winkler has, unfortunately, 
  fallen into a regular pattern. Mrs. Winkler brings custody, access and support 
  claims (among others) before the court; is unsuccessful, generally; costs are 
  awarded against her, which she can&#146;t pay; she waits a period of time, and 
  then brings the same matters back before the court.</p>
<p>Accordingly, initiating new court proceedings could become a form of harassment 
  of one&#146;s former spouse. Section 140 of the CJA is a mechanism to prevent 
  such abuse. </p>
<p>[40] Additionally, an order requiring leave under s. 140 of the CJA and the 
  requirement for a change of circumstances in s. 17 of the DA occur at different 
  stages of the proceedings. A leave requirement under s. 140 of the CJA is a 
  precondition to bringing the variation application. A change in circumstances 
  under s. 17 of the DA is not a precondition to bringing a variation application; 
  it is a fact that must be proven at the hearing. </p>
<p>[41] Accordingly, it is my view that there is no conflict between s. 140 of 
  the CJA and s. 17 of the DA. The two statutes have different purposes, place 
  requirements at different stages of the proceedings, and can therefore &#147;stand 
  together&#148;. Justice Backhouse did not exceed her jurisdiction in issuing 
  an order under s. 140 of the CJA prohibiting the appellant from initiating further 
  proceedings with respect to spousal support and arrears.</p>
<p>(3) The merits of the vexatious proceedings order</p>
<p>
  [42] The appellant contends that Backhouse J. erred in making an order pursuant 
  to s. 140 of the CJA. He asserts that, with the exception of his variation application 
  in 1987, which he abandoned, all other proceedings have been initiated by the 
  respondent. He has contested those proceedings and appealed their results, as 
  he is entitled to do. Hence a s. 140 order against him was inappropriate.</p>
<p>[43] I disagree. The long history of litigation between the parties, the appellant&#146;s 
  attempt to raise issues in his variation application which had been disposed 
  of in previous proceedings (including two unsuccessful appeals to this court), 
  his non-payment of costs awards, the complete failure to make spousal support 
  payments for six years, and the devastating effects (including financial effects) 
  of the appellant&#146;s conduct on the respondent, entitled Backhouse J. to 
  make a s. 140 order.</p>
<p>(4) Low J.&#146;s refusal to grant leave</p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant contends that Low J. erred by treating Backhouse J.&#146;s 
  s. 140 order as valid. I disagree; that is precisely what Low J. should have 
  done in light of the appellant&#146;s appeal of that order to this court.</p>
<p>[45] The appellant contends that Low J. erred by not granting his application 
  for leave to make an application to vary spousal support and to cancel the arrears. 
  He submits that the imminent payment to the respondent of $166,000 out of the 
  family trust, his cancer and his inability to work established that there had 
  been a material change of circumstances sufficient to justify a reconsideration 
  of the issues of spousal support and arrears.</p>
<p>[46] I disagree. I agree with Low J.&#146;s analysis and conclusions with respect 
  to these submissions. The payment out of the family trust was possible, not 
  completed, when Low J. heard the application. Moreover, even if the payment 
  were made, it would be far short of bringing the spousal support arrears into 
  good standing. The appellant has known of his cancer for several years and could 
  have made this matter known to Backhouse J.; bringing it to the attention of 
  Low J. was not a new circumstance. Finally, there was nothing in the record 
  to establish that the appellant&#146;s illness affected his ability to earn 
  income. Since he sold his business in 1979, he has earned his income from investments, 
  which his illness does not affect.</p>
<p>E. DISPOSITION</p>

<p>[47] I would dismiss both appeals. I would award the respondent her costs of 
  the appeals, on a partial indemnity scale, fixed at $6,200, inclusive of counsel 
  fee at hearing, disbursements and GST.</p>
