<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an application by the Crown to remove Mr. James Lockyer and Ms. 
  Joanne McLean as solicitors of record for the appellant Robert Baltovich. The 
  application is based on the fact that Mr. Lockyer acted for Paul Bernardo following 
  Bernardo's conviction on two counts of first degree murder. In the course of 
  the application, it became apparent that it would be possible to achieve a solution 
  that would reconcile Mr. Baltovich's interest in counsel of choice without compromising 
  Mr. Bernardo's rights as a former client of Mr. Lockyer. However, because I 
  think it important that the public understand the background to the application 
  and because, for reasons that I will explain, Mr. Bernardo was not represented 
  on this application, I intend to set out some of the background to this application 
  and some of the applicable legal principles.</p>
<p>
  [2] In June 1990, Elizabeth Bain disappeared. Her body has never been found. 
  Robert Baltovich was ultimately charged with her murder and on March 31, 1992, 
  he was convicted. At the time Ms. Bain disappeared, the so-called Scarborough 
  rapist was committing his crimes in Scarborough. Ms. Bain was known to frequent 
  the Scarborough area of Toronto. A theory of the defence at the Baltovich trial 
  was that the Scarborough rapist may have abducted and killed Ms. Bain. The identity 
  of the Scarborough rapist was then unknown.</p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Baltovich appealed his conviction and was initially represented by Mr. 
  Brian Greenspan. A ground of appeal raised by Mr. Greenspan concerned the trial 
  judge's charge to the jury concerning the &quot;Scarborough rapist theory&quot; 
  of the defence.</p>
<p>
  [4] After Mr. Baltovich's trial, Mr. Bernardo was arrested and it is now known 
  that he was the Scarborough rapist. As is well known, Mr. Bernardo was also 
  charged and convicted on two counts of first degree murder for the killings 
  of two teenage girls. He was convicted on September 1, 1995. In separate proceedings 
  he was found to be a dangerous offender on November 3, 1995.</p>
<p>
  [5] In 1996, Mr. Anthony Bryant, one of Mr. Bernardo's trial lawyers, approached 
  Mr. Lockyer, an experienced appellate counsel, to prepare an opinion letter 
  for Legal Aid to obtain funding for Bernardo's appeal. Mr. Lockyer agreed. The 
  attempt to obtain legal aid was unsuccessful. Mr. Bryant then made applications 
  to this court under s. 684 of the Criminal Code to have counsel appointed. That 
  application was ultimately successful. The reasons of the Court of Appeal dated 
  December 19, 1997 are now reported at (1997) 121 C.C.C. (3d) 123. An edited 
  copy of Mr. Lockyer's opinion letter was filed on that application. Mr. Lockyer 
  supported the granting of legal aid, submitting that there was merit to the 
  appeal concerning jury selection procedure and admissibility of evidence of 
  battered spouse syndrome. A third potential ground of appeal was edited out 
  of the material filed before the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] Mr. Lockyer's retainer in the Bernardo matter ended sometime in 1997, after 
  Mr. Bernardo was refused legal aid. However, while Mr. Lockyer was retained, 
  a member of his former firm spoke to Mr. Bernardo in person and Mr. Lockyer 
  spoke to Mr. Bernardo on two occasions by telephone. Mr. Lockyer did not appear 
  on the s. 684 motions and did not argue the appeal. This court dismissed Mr. 
  Bernardo's appeal in March 2000.</p>
<p>
  [7] Meanwhile in January 1999, Mr. Baltovich approached Mr. Lockyer to have 
  him act on his appeal. Mr. Lockyer initially refused and instructed Mr. Baltovich 
  to speak to Mr. Greenspan about any concerns he had about the progress of the 
  appeal. After several months, Mr. Lockyer agreed to represent Mr. Baltovich 
  and he formally notified the Crown of the change of counsel in a letter dated 
  May 19, 1999. Ms. McLean is assisting Mr. Lockyer on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [8] Now that the identity of the Scarborough rapist is known and, moreover, 
  now that it is known that he abducted and killed at least two of his victims, 
  Mr. Baltovich now wishes to adduce fresh evidence on his appeal to show that 
  Mr. Bernardo killed Elizabeth Bain. The Crown submits that this places Mr. Lockyer 
  in a position of conflict with his former client, Mr. Bernardo. Crown counsel 
  submits that Mr. Lockyer received confidential information from his former client. 
  By acting on the appeal and seeking to show that the former client is guilty 
  of the killing for which Mr. Baltovich was convicted, the Crown submits that 
  Mr. Lockyer is in a conflict of interest and in breach of his duty of loyalty 
  to the former client. </p>
<p>
  [9] At my direction, Mr. Bryant who continues to act for Mr. Bernardo, was notified 
  of this application. On the instructions of his client, Mr. Bryant supports 
  the Crown's position. However, Mr. Bryant did not attend this application because 
  the Crown would not agree to an order that he should be paid more than the legal 
  aid rates. Mr. Bryant did not attend before me to make such an application. 
  Nevertheless, his and Mr. Bernardo's position are clear.</p>
<p>
  [10] Something should be said about the timing of this application. The fact 
  that Mr. Lockyer had written the Bernardo opinion letter has been known since 
  at least 1997. The fact that he would be arguing a fresh evidence application 
  pointing the finger at Mr. Bernardo has been known to the Crown at least since 
  the fall of 1999. What the Crown only learned recently was that confidential 
  information, of some kind, was provided to Mr. Lockyer by Mr. Bernardo and Mr. 
  Bryant. Mr. Bernardo wrote a letter to Mr. Lockyer in October 1999 complaining 
  about his being in a conflict of interest in taking the Baltovich appeal. For 
  unknown reasons, Mr. Lockyer did not receive that letter and he was unaware 
  of Mr. Bernardo's position until very recently. The letter and the concern came 
  to Mr. Lockyer's attention only in the last month after Mr. Bryant spoke to 
  a police officer who, it seems, then spoke to Crown counsel. At some point, 
  the October 1999 letter was given to the police, the Crown and ultimately to 
  Mr. Lockyer. This application ensued.</p>
<p>
  [11] In considering an application such as this, a court has two particular 
  concerns: (1) the public interest in the administration of justice including 
  confidence in the legal profession; and (2) an individual's right to select 
  counsel of his own choice. An order removing counsel of record should not be 
  made unless there are compelling reasons: Re Regina and Speid (1983), 8 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.) at 20-21 and MacDonald Estate v. Martin, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 
  1235 at 1243. Fortunately, in this case I am satisfied that it is possible to 
  reconcile these concerns. Mr. Baltovich has agreed that Mr. Greenspan will present 
  the ground of appeal concerning the charge to the jury and the Bernardo fresh 
  evidence. After Mr. Lockyer and Ms. McLean turn over that part of the file to 
  Mr. Greenspan, there will be no communication between them concerning those 
  matters. Mr. Greenspan is not affiliated in any way with Mr. Lockyer and Ms. 
  McLean. They do not share office space. Mr. Greenspan has never represented 
  Mr. Bernardo. It may be that Mr. Greenspan will deal with some of the other 
  grounds of appeal for Mr. Baltovich but that is not a matter of any concern. 
  Crown counsel agrees that this is an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>
  [12] The mischief that the conflict of interest and duty of loyalty rules seek 
  to prevent is the spectre of counsel for a client acting against the interests 
  of another client, whether present or former. For members of the public to have 
  confidence in the legal profession and the administration of justice generally, 
  they must know that their confidences will be respected and not used against 
  them in the future for the benefit of another client. That policy is reflected 
  in the Conflict of Interest part of the Canadian Bar Association Code of Professional 
  Conduct referred to in MacDonald Estate at p. 1245:</p>
<p class="indent"> The lawyer must not advise or represent both sides of a dispute 
  and, save after adequate disclosure to and with the consent of the client or 
  prospective client concerned, he should not act or continue to act in a matter 
  when there is or there is likely to be a conflicting interest. A conflicting 
  interest is one which would be likely to affect adversely the judgment of the 
  lawyer on behalf of or his loyalty to a client or prospective client or which 
  the lawyer might be prompted to prefer to the interests of a client or prospective 
  client.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> A lawyer who has acted for a client in a matter should not 
  thereafter act against him (or against persons who are involved in or associated 
  with him in that matter) in the same or any related matter, or place himself 
  in a position where he might be tempted or appear to be tempted to breach the 
  Rule relating to Confidential Information. It is not, however, improper for 
  the lawyer to act against a former client in a fresh and independent matter 
  wholly unrelated to any work he has previously done for that person.</p>
<p>
  [13] The lawyer owes a broader duty of loyalty to a current client as reflected 
  in R. v. Neil (2002), 168 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at para. 17:</p>
<p class="indent"> While the Court is most often preoccupied with uses and abuses 
  of confidential information in cases where it is sought to disqualify a lawyer 
  from further acting in a matter, as in MacDonald Estate, supra, the duty of 
  loyalty to current clients includes a much broader principle of avoidance of 
  conflicts of interest, in which confidential information may or may not play 
  a role&#133;</p>
<p>
  [14] That broader duty is not an issue in this case, since Mr. Bernardo is not 
  a current client of Mr. Lockyer. The courts are nevertheless always concerned 
  to ensure that the interests of former clients are safeguarded and in R. v. 
  Speid at p. 22, this court suggested that the former client has the right to 
  expect that the solicitor &quot;will not subsequently take an adversarial position 
  against the client with respect to the same subject-matter that he was retained 
  on&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [15] Because of the solution that was arrived at in this case, I need not further 
  explore the scope of the duty of loyalty to a former client. Since Mr. Lockyer 
  and Ms. McLean will now have nothing to do with the Scarborough rapist ground 
  of appeal and the Bernardo fresh evidence, Mr. Lockyer will not be acting against 
  his former client. There is no longer any risk of misuse of confidential information 
  nor is Mr. Lockyer taking an adversarial position against a former client.</p>
<p>
  [16] I need to make two further observations. First, Mr. Lockyer denies that 
  he ever received any relevant confidential information from Mr. Bernardo. From 
  the affidavit material filed it is apparent that the consultation with Mr. Bernardo 
  concerned the manner in which the videotapes were disclosed to the prosecution, 
  a matter that has already been aired in the R. v. Murray prosecution. (Reasons 
  for acquittal of Mr. Murray are reported at (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. 
  Sup. Ct.)). Mr. Lockyer asserts that this information is not relevant to the 
  allegations now made against Mr. Bernardo by Mr. Baltovich. Even though I accept 
  Mr. Lockyer's statements, that would not necessarily have been the end of the 
  matter. However, because of the solution that the parties arrived at, I do not 
  have to resolve the difficult question of whether Mr. Lockyer has met the heavy 
  onus upon him as set down by the Supreme Court of Canada in MacDonald Estate 
  at pp. 1260-61. Further, as I hope I have made clear, I accept Mr. Lockyer's 
  statement that he only learned of Mr. Bernardo's assertion that he was in a 
  conflict of interest when the October 1999 letter was brought to his attention 
  by Crown counsel earlier this year.</p>
<p>
  [17] Second, the current client's interests in counsel of choice weigh very 
  heavily in this case. Mr. Baltovich was convicted over 11 years ago. He has 
  been on bail pending appeal for over three years. Mr. Lockyer and Ms. McLean 
  have spent thousands of hours preparing this complex appeal. Mr. Baltovich is 
  entitled, if at all possible, to have this appeal dealt with as expeditiously 
  as possible by counsel in whom he has confidence. The Crown too is anxious that 
  the appeal be dealt with as soon as possible and, of course, it is very much 
  in the public interest that the appeal be heard expeditiously. The solution 
  that allows for Mr. Lockyer and Ms. McLean to retain carriage of the bulk of 
  this appeal is very much in the public interest.</p>
<p>
  [18] Because the parties were able to resolve this matter in the course of the 
  hearing of the Crown's application, no formal order is necessary. For completeness, 
  I have endorsed the Crown's Application Record as &quot;withdrawn&quot;. I have 
  done so on the basis already set forth namely:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) That Mr. Lockyer and Ms. McLean will not participate in 
  the Scarborough rapist ground of appeal or the Bernardo fresh evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) That Mr. Greenspan will take over that part of the appeal 
  and take no instructions or directions from Mr. Lockyer or Ms. McLean concerning 
  those issues; and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) That Mr. Lockyer and Ms. McLean will not pass any confidential 
  information from Mr. Bernardo to Mr. Greenspan and after briefing Mr. Greenspan 
  on that part of the file will have no discussions of any kind concerning that 
  ground of appeal or the Bernardo fresh evidence except for the technical discussions 
  such as timing of the argument.</p>
<p>
  [19] I am grateful to all counsel for their assistance in this matter and for 
  achieving a solution that is consistent with the public interest and the best 
  interests of the administration of justice.</p>
