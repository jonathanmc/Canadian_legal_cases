<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In our view, there was an insufficient basis on this record to support 
  the sentencing judge's finding that this was a &quot;premeditated, planned criminal 
  activity&quot;. It is apparent from his reasons for sentence that this finding 
  formed an important part of the sentencing judge's decision that a short, sharp 
  term of imprisonment was required to meet the principles of sentencing. In the 
  absence of this aggravating circumstance, we are of the view that the sentence 
  was excessive having regard to the circumstances of each offender. </p>
<p>
  [2] Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the sentence is varied to one of time 
  served (9 days, plus the terms of probation).</p>
