<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a dispute between the Bank of Nova Scotia (&#147;BNS&#148;) and 
  the Business Development Bank of Canada (&#147;BDC&#148;), two secured lenders 
  to Norpak Manufacturing Inc. (&#147;Norpak&#148;), as to what proportion of 
  the receiver&#146;s costs each should bear.</p>
<p>[2] The order of Farley J. is closely related to the earlier order of Himel 
  J. which appointed the receiver over all assets of Norpak. BDC originally appealed 
  that order, but subsequently abandoned the appeal.</p>
<p>[3] To some extent, BDC is challenging the orders of Himel J. by questioning 
  the appropriateness of the receivership (which it originally supported). It 
  is inappropriate for BDC to challenge that decision now. Given the disastrous 
  situation found by the monitor, without the receiver&#146;s report, BDC would 
  not have been in a position to properly assess Norpak&#146;s financial status 
  and the prospects for obtaining payment of its debt.</p>
<p>[4] BDC originally agreed with BNS that a receiver should be appointed but 
  changed its position and opposed the appointment of the receiver after it entered 
  into a side deal to sell the security to Web Pack International Inc. (&#147;Web 
  Pack&#148;), a company controlled by Norpak&#146;s principals. As found by both 
  Himel J. and Farley J., this was not a situation where a secured creditor could 
  just pull out its security. That agreement had the effect of preferring BDC 
  over other creditors and creating a situation of unfairness. Himel J. specifically 
  rejected BDC&#146;s position that the agreement was the best way to deal with 
  the security and also that a receiver should not be appointed over all assets 
  of Norpak.</p>
<p>[5] Web Pack&#146;s revised bid was ultimately selected and the receiver believed 
  that the sale was in the best interests of all creditors, including BDC. The 
  process undertaken by the receiver was fair and took into account the interests 
  of all creditors. The receiver always acted on the direction of the court.</p>
<p>[6] There is no valid reason for BDC to avoid paying its fair share of the 
  receivership costs. The receiver was clearly appointed for the benefit of all 
  interested parties to ensure that all creditors were treated fairly and to ensure 
  a fair process to deal with the assets.</p>
<p>[7] Given that the indebtedness of BDC and BNS was approximately equal, it 
  was appropriate for Farley J., in the exercise of his discretion, to equally 
  allocate the receiver&#146;s costs and to make BDC pay a portion of the legal 
  costs associated with the appointment of the receiver.</p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs payable to the respondent 
  and fixed at $10,000.00, all inclusive.</p>
