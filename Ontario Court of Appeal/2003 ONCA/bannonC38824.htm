<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lawrence C. Kozak of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 21, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Section 47 of the Supreme Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, as 
  amended, gives the Supreme Court of Canada express authority to &quot;order 
  the payment of the costs of the court appealed from &#133; and of the appeal&quot;. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada made such an order in its judgment of February 21, 
  2002, in the following words:</p> 
<P class="indent"> Consequently, we would allow the appeal with costs throughout, 
  set aside the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, and restore the judgment 
  of Kozak J. at trial.</p> 
<P>
  [2] Kozak J. did not have the authority to order that the costs of the appellate 
  proceedings be assessed on a &quot;risk plus premium&quot; basis. We reject 
  the submission that the breadth of jurisdiction of the trial judge pursuant 
  to rule 57.01 is such that it can extend to treat appellate proceedings as incidental 
  to the trial. Moreover, having given the power to award costs of appellate proceedings 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada, there is no gap that would justify giving the 
  trial judge some type of residual discretion to order such a premium. </p> <P>
  [3] The basis upon which costs were to be awarded in the appellate proceedings 
  was a matter to be argued before the Supreme Court of Canada. Even if Kozak 
  J. had had the authority to make the order that he did -- which he did not -- 
  the matter of costs having already been decided by the Supreme Court of Canada, 
  he could not adjudicate upon it again.</p> <P>
  [4] The respondent is not precluded from advancing an argument in favour of 
  such a premium in the appropriate forum(s). The costs of the proceedings in 
  this court have yet to be assessed. Should counsel for the respondent choose 
  to pursue a claim for such a premium in the proceedings taken before this court, 
  it would be appropriate that the matter be dealt with by a panel of this court 
  rather than by an assessment officer.</p> <P>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal is granted and paragraph 1 of the order of Kozak 
  J. is set aside. In all of the circumstances, there shall be no order as to 
  costs of the appeal or the motion to quash.</p>
