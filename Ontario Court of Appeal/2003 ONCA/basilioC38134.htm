<p>On appeal from the convictions by Justice Keith A. Hoilett of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 18, 2002 and from the sentence imposed on June 
  6, 2002.</p> <P>
  GILLESE J.A.:</p> <P>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, 
  weapons dangerous and common assault arising out of a bar room brawl. He raises 
  three grounds of appeal in support of his submission that acquittals should 
  be entered or a new trial ordered. He seeks leave to appeal from sentence, as 
  well.</p> <P>
  Background</p> <P>
  [2] The appellant, his girlfriend Adelpha and several friends were at a bar 
  on April 1, 2000. The complainants, David Kerr and Aileen Lee, were also at 
  the bar along with an acquaintance, Tiago Gonsalves. Lee was dancing when an 
  altercation began between Adelpha and her. The appellant and others then attacked 
  Lee. Kerr went to her rescue and the group set upon him. Gonsalves tried to 
  get Kerr to leave but Kerr resisted. He was angry at having been attacked and 
  wanted to fight the people who had punched him. Kerr kicked the front door of 
  the bar, causing its glass to break. At about the same time he felt what he 
  thought was a push from behind. He, in fact, had been stabbed. He collapsed 
  after walking a few steps. After the stabbing, the appellant walked back and 
  forth outside the bar through a group of people milling about. He was waving 
  a knife.</p> <P>
  [3] It took twenty-seven staples to close David Kerr's stomach wound. His chest, 
  diaphragm and liver had been punctured; two litres of blood had flowed into 
  his abdomen from the liver stab wound. Without immediate medical attention, 
  he would have died. </p> <P>
  [4] The appellant testified. He denied stabbing Kerr and that he had a knife 
  in his possession. He testified that Kerr stabbed him at the base of his right 
  thumb, a wound that required three stitches to close. He admitted that he had 
  intervened in the fight between Lee and Adelpha and that he had pushed Lee against 
  a wall. Thereafter, he maintained, he was a bystander.</p> <P>
  The Onus of Proof and W.D. </p> <P>
  [5] Based on R. v. W.D. (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), the appellant submits 
  that the trial judge erred by placing the burden of proof on the appellant. 
  He relies on the following sentence from the trial judge's reasons for this 
  submission:</p> 
<P class="indent"> I do not find credible that evidence tending to support the 
  accused's position; nor does it raise a reasonable doubt in my mind &#133; [emphasis 
  added].</p> 
<P>
  [6] The appellant says that the use of the word &quot;raise&quot;, rather than 
  &quot;left in&quot; as was suggested in W.D., shows that the trial judge placed 
  the burden of proof upon the appellant. </p> <P>
  [7] This was a trial by judge alone. In considering the trial judge's reasons 
  as a whole, it is my view that although he did not use exactly the same words 
  as in W.D., he followed the approach that it recommended. He disbelieved the 
  appellant's evidence on the crucial issues involving the appellant's role in 
  the fight and gave reasons for coming to that conclusion. Thereafter, he referred 
  to the evidence supporting the appellant's position and made the impugned statement 
  that it did not &quot;raise a reasonable doubt in my mind concerning the accused's 
  guilt&quot;.</p> <P>
  [8] In my view, the statement in question reflects the second stage of analysis 
  recommended in W.D. The second stage requires the trier of fact who disbelieves 
  the testimony of the accused to acquit if the testimony leaves him or her in 
  a reasonable doubt. Here, the trial judge found that the evidence did not raise 
  a reasonable doubt in his mind. It was not a shifting of the burden to the appellant 
  to raise a reasonable doubt. Rather, the statement shows that the trial judge 
  disbelieved the appellant's testimony and had determined that the testimony 
  did not leave him with a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this ground of appeal 
  fails. </p> <P>
  The Reasonableness of the Convictions</p> <P>
  [9] The appellant submits that the verdicts were unreasonable and unsupportable 
  on the evidence.</p> <P>
  [10] With respect to the assault on Lee, the appellant admitted shoving Lee 
  and that she fell as a result. This confirms, at least in part, her identification 
  of the appellant as one of her attackers. In the circumstances, there can be 
  nothing unreasonable in determining that the appellant assaulted Lee.</p> <P>
  [11] There was ample circumstantial evidence to support the appellant's conviction 
  for aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. That evidence includes:</p> <P>
  1. the appellant acknowledged that he was within two feet of Kerr moments after 
  the glass in the door was broken and Kerr was stabbed; </p> <P>
  2. Lee saw the appellant push Kerr from behind;</p> <P>
  3. after being pushed, Kerr took several steps and started to collapse;</p> <P>
  4. no one else was seen to have physical contact with Kerr in the moments between 
  breaking the glass and his collapse from the stab wounds;</p> <P>
  5. Lee testified that the appellant was wearing a hat or cap;</p> <P>
  6. Kerr said his assailant was wearing a cap and carrying a thin-bladed knife;</p> <P>
  7. shortly after the stabbing, the appellant was seen by a person whom he knew, 
  walking back and forth in a crowd and openly carrying a thin-bladed knife;</p> <P>
  8. there was no evidence that anyone else was seen with a knife.</p> <P>
  The Rule Against Multiple Convictions </p> <P>
  [12] The appellant argues that the same act grounds each of the first three 
  counts and that the rule against multiple convictions should apply. Application 
  of the Kienapple principle, he submits, would lead to convictions on only counts 
  1 and 4 (aggravated assault upon Kerr and common assault upon Lee). See R. v. 
  Kienapple (1974), 15 C.C.C.(2d) 524 (S.C.C.). The trial judge, he argues, erred 
  in failing to apply the principle. </p> <P>
  [13] In R. v. Prince (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (S.C.C.) at pp. 43-52, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada stated that multiple convictions should be barred where there 
  is a sufficient factual and legal nexus between counts. In my view, there is 
  no sufficient factual nexus between the events surrounding the possession of 
  a weapon for a purpose dangerous and that of the assault upon Kerr. The same 
  act did not ground each of the charges. The actus reus of the weapon offence 
  consisted of waving a knife, shortly after the fight and stabbing, while many 
  of the combatants milled about. Although the stabbing and the waving of the 
  knife were close in time, they were separate wrongful acts. </p> <P>
  [14] Does the Kienapple principle apply to the two counts in which Kerr is the 
  complainant, namely, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon? The Crown 
  properly concedes that the factual nexus is met in respect of those two counts 
  because both are based on the single assault with a knife, by the appellant, 
  upon Kerr. The Crown argues, however, that the conviction for assault with a 
  weapon should not be stayed because the requisite legal nexus does not exist 
  between the two counts. </p> <P>
  [15] The Crown's argument runs as follows. To analyse the legal nexus requirement, 
  one must determine whether the elements of the two charges are sufficiently 
  similar and whether the lesser offence contains distinct or additional elements. 
  Assault with a weapon is the lesser offence as it carries a maximum period of 
  imprisonment of ten years whereas conviction for aggravated assault carries 
  a maximum sentence of fourteen years. The count alleging aggravated assault 
  particularizes that the appellant wounded Kerr. There is no requirement, either 
  in the charge as framed in the indictment or in the section creating the offence 
  (s. 268), that a weapon be used in the commission of the offence. The lesser 
  offence requires the use of a weapon. As such, it contains a distinct or additional 
  element, the legal nexus does not exist and the rule against multiple convictions 
  does not apply. </p> 
<P> [16] I disagree. In my view, there is a sufficient legal similarity such that 
  the Kienapple principle does apply. In coming to this conclusion, I rely upon 
  R. v. French, [1993] O.J. No. 1063 (Ont. C.A.)<a href="#1">[1]</a>,<a name="r1"></a> 
  a decision of this court involving a single act leading to charges of assault 
  with a weapon and aggravated assault. At paragraph 2 of the endorsement, the 
  court agreed that the Kienapple principle applied &quot; &#133; [s]ince the 
  assault with a weapon and the aggravated assault were, in effect, the same transaction&quot;. 
  The court then stayed the count for assault with a weapon.</p>
<P>
  [17] I am mindful that the Alberta Court of Appeal came to a different result 
  in R. v. Strawberry, [1995] A.J. No. 579 (Alta. C.A.). In Strawberry, the appellant 
  was also charged with assault with a weapon and aggravated assault. At paragraph 
  9 of the reasons, Stratton J.A. writing for the court, rejected the argument 
  that the Kienapple principle should apply saying:</p> 
<P class="indent"> The fact of a wound having been inflicted introduces an additional 
  element to the assault with a weapon. In this respect we follow the rationale 
  of this court in R. v. Switzer (1987), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 303. </p> 
<P>
  [18] The Switzer case, however, involved charges of aggravated assault and use 
  of a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence arising from a single 
  act. As the court in Switzer noted, the legislative provisions governing the 
  use of firearms makes it clear that Parliament abrogated the rule against multiple 
  convictions in such cases. The court in Switzer relied upon the decision of 
  this court in R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 138 (Ont. C.A.) and the 
  following passage by Martin J.A. at p. 146 in particular.</p> 
<P class="indent"> It is clear to me that Parliament intended by s. 83 to repress 
  the use of firearms in the commission of crimes by making such use an offence 
  in its own right, and one which attracts a minimum sentence of one year consecutive 
  to that imposed for the offence which such use accompanies. The use of firearms 
  in the commission of crimes is fraught with danger and gravely disturbing to 
  the community, and Parliament has sought to protect the public from the danger 
  and alarm caused by that use by enacting the present legislation. It is not 
  for the Courts to pass upon either the wisdom or the necessity for the legislation, 
  but to give effect to the clear intention of Parliament expressed in the language 
  which reflects that intention.</p>
<P class="indent">Manifestly, the legislation is directed at those crimes in which 
  firearms are likely to be used, such as robbery, and not at offences where they 
  are not likely to be used, for example, forgery. To construe the section as 
  not applicable to the use of a firearm during the commission of the offence 
  of theft while armed with a firearm would largely defeat the clear intention 
  of Parliament.</p>
<P>
  [19] This court followed Langevin in R. v. Osborne (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 435 
  (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dism'd [1995] S.C.C.A. 
  No. 91, and found that an accused could be convicted of both aggravated assault 
  and use of a firearm while committing an indictable offence. Citing Langevin, 
  the court noted that aggravated assault can be committed in a variety of ways 
  and with the use of different weapons, but if the perpetrator elects to use 
  a firearm as a weapon, he can expect to receive an additional and mandatory 
  sentence by virtue of s. 85 of the Criminal Code.</p> <P>
  [20] The clear legislative intent identified in Langevin, Osborne and Switzer, 
  to create a separate firearms offence, does not apply to the present appeal. 
  Section 267 does not create a stand-alone weapons offence but, rather, a type 
  of assault.</p> <P>
  [21] In Prince, the court sets out three ways in which sufficient legal correspondence 
  can be found to exist. First, an element may be a particularization of another 
  element. Second, there may be multiple ways of proving a single delict. The 
  third arises where Parliament, in effect, deems a particular element to be satisfied 
  by proof of a different nature, not because logic dictates the conclusion but 
  because of social policy or inherent difficulties in proof. The court concludes 
  by emphasizing that application of the criteria is not to be done in a fashion 
  that causes us to &quot;lose sight of the overarching question whether the same 
  cause, matter or delict underlies both charges&quot;.</p> <P>
  [22] On the facts of this case, the same delict underlies both charges. The 
  wounding in the charge of aggravated assault was inflicted through the use of 
  the knife to stab Kerr. It is a knife wound. It is this same wrongful use of 
  a knife to stab Kerr that underlies the charge of assault with a weapon. To 
  focus on the distinction between the elements of wounding and use of a knife, 
  without reference to the essential connection between these two elements on 
  the facts of this case, is to lose sight of the overarching consideration that 
  the same wrong underlies both charges. The wrongful use of the knife is addressed 
  through the more serious offence of aggravated assault. Thus, the conviction 
  for the lesser offence of assault with a weapon should be set aside.</p> <P>
  The Sentence Appeal</p> <P>
  [23] At the time of sentencing, the Crown sought a custodial term of between 
  eighteen months and two years less a day and urged the court to impose a sentence 
  at the top of the range. The defence asked for a jail term of between eight 
  and twelve months. The appellant was sentenced to two years less a day followed 
  by two years probation; a ten-year prohibition order pursuant to s. 109 was 
  made, as well. </p> <P>
  [24] At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant conceded that unless 
  he were successful on the conviction appeal, the sentence was fit. Although 
  he was successful in part, the original sentence in my view was a lenient one 
  and ought not to be interfered with despite that success.</p> <P>
  [25] The appellant was convicted of assault upon Aileen Lee and possession of 
  a weapon dangerous to the public in addition to his conviction for aggravated 
  assault of David Kerr. The aggravated assault was a serious, violent offence 
  in which the victim sustained life-threatening injuries. The appellant's actions 
  after the stabbing of walking back and forth displaying a knife in a highly 
  charged atmosphere were dangerous.</p> <P>
  [26] The sentence, after allowing for the result of the convictions appeal, 
  is not manifestly unfit nor is it clearly unreasonable. There is no reason to 
  interfere with it.</p> <P>
  Disposition</p> <P>
  [27] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal against convictions in part: the 
  conviction on counts 1, 3 and 4 will stand but the conviction on count 2 will 
  be set aside and the charge on that count will be stayed. I would grant leave 
  to appeal the sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.</p> 
<p> &quot;E. E. Gillese J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree E.A. Cronk J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree R.P. Armstrong J.A.&quot;</p>
