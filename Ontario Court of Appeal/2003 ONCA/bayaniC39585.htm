<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent was convicted of pointing a firearm, assault with a weapon 
  and possession of a firearm contrary to a prohibition order.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The facts giving rise to the convictions are serious. After firing a handgun 
  twice, the respondent pointed the gun at the victim's head on three occasions. 
  He struck her repeatedly causing bruises, swelling and scratches. The trial 
  judge was not prepared to find that the gun was still loaded at the time the 
  appellant pointed it at the victim. However, the entire episode was undoubtedly 
  very traumatic for the victim. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The respondent has a lengthy criminal record involving offences of violence. 
  At the time he committed these offences he was on probation for harassing the 
  victim and he was subject to a lifetime prohibition from possessing firearms.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The pre-sentence report was very negative. The respondent is described 
  as being at risk for offending with violence and as not being amenable to counselling 
  or community service. He expressed no remorse for the conduct that gave rise 
  to these convictions. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge imposed a custodial sentence of seven months. He gave the 
  respondent 13 months credit for pre-trial custody reflecting a total sentence 
  of 20 months. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] In our view, this sentence is demonstrably unfit. There is nothing in the 
  facts of this case or in the background of the respondent that would justify 
  leniency. An appropriate sentence is three years. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the 
  sentence is varied. Giving the same credit for pre-trial custody as the trial 
  judge did, we impose a sentence of 23 months effective from the date of sentencing 
  in the court below. <br>
