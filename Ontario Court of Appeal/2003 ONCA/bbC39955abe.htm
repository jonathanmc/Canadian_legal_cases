<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1]	In the light of the considerations listed in paragraph 62 of the appellant's
  factum, including his father's responsible and caring commitment to his
  son, we think that 6 months secure custody, on top of 2 months secure custody
  before disposition was demonstrably unfit and not in accord with the court
judgment in Priest and similar cases dealing with young offenders. </p>
<P>  [2] The appellant has now served seven months secure custody. In our view,
  the interests of justice would be served by reducing the custodial disposition
to time served. </p>
<P>  [3] The one-year probation order shall stand but the terms shall be varied
as follows:</p>
<P class="indent">  (a)	the curfew provision shall be changed to substitute for householder "his
  father or any other person designated by the provincial director."<br>
  (b) adding a provision that on release the appellant shall attend school and/or
seek employment.</p>
<P>  [4] The appeal is allowed and the disposition is varied in accordance with
  these reasons.</p>
