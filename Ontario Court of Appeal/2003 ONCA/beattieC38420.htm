<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Richard G. Byers of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 5, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] In writing about gaps and oversights in legislation, in Ruth Sullivan, Sullivan 
  and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 
  2002) at 134, Professor Sullivan states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In a perfect world the legislature would create flawless legislation. Each statute 
  would be drafted so that the effects of interpreting and applying it to an unfolding 
  reality would match the goals sought by the legislature. In an imperfect world 
  there is often a divergence between the purpose of legislation on the one hand 
  and the effects of applying it on the other. The language of particular provisions 
  may turn out to be over or under inclusive: there may be a lacuna in the legislative 
  scheme.</p>
<p>
  That is what has happened in this case in respect to s. 30(4) of O. Reg. 403/96 
  (Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule - Accidents on or after November 1, 1996) 
  made under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, as amended.</p>
<p>
  [2] To assist in the analysis of the main issue presented by this appeal, it 
  is helpful to reproduce s. 30 of the regulation: </p>
<p class="indent"> 30.(1) The insurer is not required to pay an income replacement 
  benefit, a non-earner benefit or a benefit under section 20, 21 or 22 in respect 
  of a person who was the driver of an automobile at the time of the accident,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) if the driver knew or ought reasonably to have known that 
  he or she was operating the automobile while it was not insured under a motor 
  vehicle liability policy;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) if the driver was driving the automobile without a valid 
  driver's licence;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) if the driver is an excluded driver under the contract of 
  automobile insurance; or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) if the driver knew or ought reasonably to have known that 
  he or she was operating the automobile without the owner's consent. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) The insurer is not required to pay an income replacement 
  benefit, a non-earner benefit or a benefit under section 20, 21 or 22,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in respect of any person who has made, or who knows of, 
  a material misrepresentation that induced the insurer to enter into the contract 
  of automobile insurance or who intentionally failed to notify the insurer of 
  a change in the risk material to the contract; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) in respect of an occupant of an automobile at the time of 
  the accident who knew or ought reasonably to have known that the driver was 
  operating the automobile without the owner's consent.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Clause (2) (b) does not prevent an excluded driver or any 
  other occupant of an automobile driven by the excluded driver from recovering 
  accident benefits under a motor vehicle liability policy in respect of which 
  the excluded driver or other occupant is a named insured. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) If a person sustains an impairment as a result of an accident 
  and,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) at the time of the accident, the person was engaged in, 
  or was an occupant of an automobile that was being used in connection with, 
  an act for which the person is charged with a criminal offence; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the person is charged under section 254 of the Criminal 
  Code (Canada) with failing to comply with a lawful demand to provide a breath 
  sample in connection with the accident,</p>
<p class="indent">the insurer shall hold in trust any amounts payable under an 
  income replacement benefit, a non-earner benefit or a benefit under section 
  20, 21 or 22 until the charge is finally disposed of, at which time the amounts 
  and any income on the amounts,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) shall be returned to the insurer, if the person is found 
  guilty of the offence or an included offence; or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) shall be paid to the person entitled to the payment, if 
  the person is not found guilty of the offence or an included offence.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) In clause (4)(a)</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;criminal offence&quot; means,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) operating an automobile while the ability to operate the 
  automobile is impaired by alcohol or a drug,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) operating an automobile while the concentration of alcohol 
  in the operator's blood exceeds the limit permitted by law,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) failing to comply with a lawful demand to provide a breath 
  sample, or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) any other criminal offence, whether or not the offence is 
  related to the operation of an automobile. </p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [3] The relevant facts are brief. On November 21, 1996, Richard Beattie was 
  severely injured in a single vehicle accident. As a result of the accident, 
  he was charged with dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal 
  Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. On January 22, 1998, Beattie was convicted of the 
  offence and was fined $500 and prohibited from driving for 24 months. </p>
<p>
  [4] At the time of the accident Beattie was insured for a one year term commencing 
  in May 1996, pursuant to a standard automobile insurance policy issued by National 
  Frontier Insurance Company. Under the policy, Beattie was entitled to be paid 
  Statutory Accident Benefits (SABS) which included an income replacement benefit. 
  At the time Beattie purchased his insurance policy, payment of SABS was governed 
  by O. Reg. 776/93 (Statutory Accidents Benefits Schedule - Accidents on or after 
  January 1, 1994). At the time of Beattie's accident, payment of SABS was governed 
  by O. Reg. 403/96, made under the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act, 1996, 
  S.O. 1996, c. 21 that came into force on November 1, 1996, and substantially 
  amended the Insurance Act. Under O. Reg. 776/93, Beattie would have been entitled 
  to more generous SABS than under O. Reg. 403/96. </p>
<p>
  [5] By virtue of s. 30(4) of O. Reg. 403/96, while Beattie stood charged with 
  dangerous driving, Frontier was precluded from paying him weekly benefits. Subsequent 
  to his conviction, Beattie's application for SABS was denied by Frontier on 
  the ground that his conviction for dangerous driving was a complete bar to his 
  entitlement to SABS.</p>
<p>
  [6] On a special case under Rule 22 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the court 
  was asked to decide: (1) whether Beattie's entitlement to SABS was governed 
  entirely, or in part, by O. Reg. 776/93 or O. Reg. 403/96; (2) if his entitlement 
  was governed by O. Reg. 403/96, whether s. 30(4) excluded him from recovering 
  SABS for the period after the date of his conviction.</p>
<p>
  [7] The motion judge held that (1) Beattie's entitlement to SABS was governed 
  by O. Reg. 403/96 and (2) Beattie was not excluded from receiving income replacement 
  benefits under s. 30(4), except for the period from November 21, 1996, when 
  he was charged with dangerous driving, to January 23, 1998, when he was convicted 
  of the offence.</p>
<p>
  [8] Frontier appealed from the second part of the motion judge's order and seeks 
  leave to appeal from a subsequent order awarding Beattie costs in the amount 
  of $30,000. Beattie has cross-appealed from the first part of the order, contending 
  that his entitlement to SABS is governed by O. Reg. 776/93 because it was the 
  regulation that was in force when he entered into the insurance contract. However, 
  if he is unsuccessful in his cross-appeal, Beattie's position is that the second 
  part of the motion judge's order is correct. For the reasons that follow, I 
  would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  Section 30(4) of O. Reg. 403/96</p>
<p>
  [9] The parties do not disagree with the apparent legislative purpose of s. 
  30 when read as a whole. That purpose is to exclude an insured person injured 
  in an automobile accident from his or her statutory entitlement to SABS where 
  the circumstances stipulated in s. 30(1), (2) and (4) apply to the injured person. 
  As that person would be entitled to recover SABS from an insurer under the provisions 
  of a standard automobile insurance policy, s. 30(1), (2) and (4) provide a number 
  of exclusions in favour of an insurer that operate to remove its obligation 
  to pay SABS. The language of both s. 30(1) and (2) is clear. The insurer is 
  not required to pay SABS upon the occurrence of any of the factors stipulated 
  in the two provisions, none of which is concerned with the commission of a criminal 
  offence.</p>
<p>
  [10] Section 30(4) addresses the commission of a criminal offence by the injured 
  person. Where the injured person is charged with a criminal offence, he or she 
  is not entitled to be paid SABS while the trial of the charge is pending. Rather, 
  the insurer must hold in trust SABS otherwise payable until the outcome of the 
  charge is known. If the injured person is found guilty of the offence, the SABS 
  that were held in trust are to be returned to the insurer. If he or she is found 
  not guilty, the SABS held in trust are to be paid to the injured person. However, 
  unlike s. 30(1) and (2) which excludes the insurer from any statutory obligation 
  to pay SABS, s. 30(4) excludes the insurer from its obligation to pay SABS to 
  a person convicted of a criminal offence only for the period from when the person 
  is charged until he or she is convicted, with the result that such person is 
  entitled to the payment of SABS subsequent to conviction, and for whatever period 
  he or she qualifies to receive payments. In the circumstances of this case, 
  because Beattie suffered serious injuries in the accident and is totally disabled, 
  counsel for the insurer was of the belief that Beattie would be entitled to 
  be paid an income replacement benefit to at least age 65.</p>
<p>
  [11] Counsel for the insurer concedes that the legislative purpose of s. 30 
  has not been achieved because s. 30(4) is not in harmony with s. 30(1) and (2) 
  in that it fails to provide insurers the same exclusion contained in those provisions 
  where the injured person has been found guilty of a criminal offence. Counsel 
  points to the anomaly of the total loss of SABS by an injured person who was 
  driving without a valid driver's licence as required by s. 30(1)(b) and the 
  partial loss of SABS under s. 30(4) by one convicted of impaired driving causing 
  death. In counsel's submission, this has created an absurd result that was not 
  intended by the legislature. Where, as in this case, an injured person has been 
  convicted of a criminal offence, counsel asks the court to &quot;fix&quot; s. 
  30(4) to ensure harmony with s. 30(1) and (2) by adding whatever language the 
  court believes is required to achieve this result. In doing so, counsel quite 
  properly informed the court that the legislature has taken steps to amend s. 
  30. He was of the view that the amendments, which had been drafted and approved, 
  had not come into force. However, it would appear that at the time this appeal 
  was heard, the amendments, which are in O. Reg. 281/03, were in effect.</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view, although s. 30(4) does not conform with the purpose of s. 30 
  as evidenced by s. 30(1) and (2) in that it does not totally exclude the insurer's 
  statutory obligation to pay SABS to an injured person convicted of a criminal 
  offence, this does not result in an absurdity capable of resolution by resorting 
  to recognized principles of statutory interpretation. Although s. 30(4) results 
  in a situation that fails to advance the purpose of s. 30, as explained by Professor 
  Sullivan in the passage that I have quoted at the outset of my reasons, this 
  is likely because of faulty drafting that has created a lacuna, or gap, in the 
  legislative scheme.</p>
<p>
  [13] It is well-accepted that principles of interpretation may be used to resolve 
  an absurd interpretation. However, this principle resolves conflicts where the 
  words of a provision are reasonably capable of more than one meaning. The principle 
  is explained by Iacobucci J. in Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 
  2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 29: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What, then, in law is an ambiguity? To answer, an ambiguity must be &quot;real&quot; 
  (Marcotte, supra, at p. 115). The words of the provision must be &quot;reasonably 
  capable of more than one meaning&quot; (Westminster Bank Ltd. v. Zang, [1966] 
  A.C. 182 (H.L.), at p. 222, per Lord Reid). By necessity, however, one must 
  consider the &quot;entire context&quot; of a provision before one can determine 
  if it is reasonably capable of multiple interpretations. In this regard, Major 
  J.'s statement in CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] 
  1 S.C.R. 743, at para. 14, is apposite: &quot;It is only when genuine ambiguity 
  arises between two or more plausible readings, each equally in accordance with 
  the intentions of the statute, that the courts need to resort to external interpretive 
  aids&quot; (emphasis added), to which I would add, &quot;including other principles 
  of interpretation&quot; [emphasis in the original].</p>
<p>
  See also Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, at pp. 251 -257.</p>
<p>
  [14] Therefore, this is not a case in which accepted principles of interpretation 
  permit the court to reject an interpretation that results in an absurdity in 
  favour of a plausible alternative interpretation that avoids the absurdity and 
  supports the legislative purpose of s. 30. The reason is that s. 30(4), although 
  not furthering the legislative intent, is clear and unambiguous. It gives rise 
  to but one meaning. Although an interpretation that leads to absurd consequences 
  should be rejected in favour of an interpretation that avoids absurdity, the 
  court cannot do so if, as in this case, because of the clarity of the language 
  used by the legislature there is no plausible alternative interpretation. In 
  all likelihood, s. 30(4) represents an example of drafting oversight.</p>
<p>
  [15] As Professor Sullivan points out at p. 129, legislation is presumed to 
  be accurate and well-drafted consequent to the presumption that the legislature 
  does not make mistakes. Thus, if the words of an Act are clear, they must be 
  followed even though they lead to a manifest absurdity. As a majority of the 
  Supreme Court of Canada commented in R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686 at 
  704: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]here, by use of clear and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, 
  anything is enacted by the legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or 
  absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be&#133;. The fact that a 
  provision gives rise to absurd results is not, in my opinion, sufficient to 
  declare it ambiguous and then embark upon a broad-ranging interpretive analysis.</p>
<p>
  [16] Section 30(4) uses language with the precision that one expects in modern 
  legislation, yet s. 30(4) fails to achieve the legislative purpose of s. 30. 
  Indeed, as a result of a likely drafting oversight, s. 30(4) has achieved the 
  opposite purpose. While in some cases the court will come to the rescue of the 
  legislature by correcting its drafting error, these cases involve minor and 
  obvious errors that can easily be corrected, unlike this case in which the correction 
  of the error as proposed by the insurer would involve a substantial exercise 
  in impermissible judicial redrafting. Moreover, in asking the court to do so, 
  the insurer recognizes that the textual meaning of s. 30(4) is plain and clear.</p>
<p>
  [17] In Friesen v. Canada, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  explained the rationale that precludes the court from engaging in redrafting 
  legislation that has failed to achieve a legislative purpose. In Friesen the 
  court was asked to add language to the definition of &quot;inventory&quot; in 
  the Income Tax Act. At para. 27, Major J. explained why the court was precluded 
  from doing so: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The principal problem with the respondent's interpretation is that the [proposed] 
  words do not appear in the definition in the Income Tax Act. The addition of 
  these words to the definition effects a significant change to the sense of the 
  definition. It is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that the court 
  should not accept an interpretation which requires the insertion of extra wording 
  where there is another acceptable interpretation which does not require any 
  additional wording.</p>
<p>
  [18] In addition, it is helpful to consider Professor Sullivan's analysis of 
  why courts do not have jurisdiction to fill legislative gaps. This is what she 
  writes at p. 136: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While courts are willing to correct drafting errors, they are reluctant to fill 
  gaps in legislation. This reluctance is grounded in two factors. First, unlike 
  mistakes, which are always inadvertent, a gap in legislation may be deliberate. 
  Gaps may result from faulty drafting but equally they may result from factual 
  misconceptions, poor planning or even a considered policy choice. For this reason, 
  gaps are taken to embody the actual intentions of the legislature, which courts 
  are bound to respect. It is up to the legislature rather than the courts to 
  effect any desired change. Second, whether inadvertent or not, gaps result from 
  provisions or schemes that are under-inclusive, and correcting under-inclusiveness 
  would require courts to legislate.</p>
<p>
  [19] Applying the presumption that the legislature does not make mistakes, if 
  it had intended to completely exclude the insurer from its statutory obligation 
  to pay SABS to injured persons convicted of a criminal offence, it would have 
  inserted the necessary language to make that clear. That the legislature failed 
  to do so as a result of a likely oversight does not permit the court to remedy 
  the oversight by redrafting the regulation.</p>
<p>
  [20] It follows that the motion judge was correct in his interpretation of s. 
  30(4) of O. Reg. 403/96.</p>
<p>
  The governing Regulation</p>
<p>
  [21] The motion judge concluded that Beattie's entitlement to SABS was governed 
  by O. Reg. 403/96 and not by O. Reg. 776/93. In reaching this conclusion, he 
  rejected Beattie's contention that it was the 1993 regulation that governed 
  because it was that regulation that was in force when Beattie purchased his 
  contract of insurance from Frontier, which created for him vested rights in 
  the payment of SABS that were not taken away by the 1996 regulation that came 
  into force shortly before Beattie's accident.</p>
<p>
  [22] As I understand the position taken by Beattie's counsel, she contends that 
  his entitlement to SABS is governed by the regulation that was in force in May, 
  1996 when he contracted with Frontier for automobile insurance and not the regulation 
  in force in November, 1996 when he was injured in the automobile accident. It 
  is her position that the legislation that came into force pursuant to which 
  the 1996 regulation was enacted did not have the effect of &quot;amending&quot; 
  his existing insurance policy and thereby impairing his vested right to SABS 
  under the 1993 regulation. She further contends that the Lieutenant Governor 
  in Council exceeded its delegated authority by enacting a regulation that purports 
  to apply retrospectively to vested insurance contracts.</p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, the motion judge was correct in concluding that O. Reg. 403/96 
  governed Beattie's contractual right to SABS. On November 1, 1996, the Automobile 
  Insurance Rate Stability Act, 1996, came into force. This Act changed the automobile 
  insurance regime in the Insurance Act by granting broader tort rights to accident 
  victims and enacting a new no-fault accident benefits, or SABS, schedule. Regulation 
  403/96 was enacted pursuant to this Act and was in force when Beattie's accident 
  occurred. Section 268(1) of the Insurance Act contemplates that the legislature 
  may, from time to time, amend or change accident benefits schedules. Section 
  268(1) reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  268.(1) Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy, including 
  every such contract in force when the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule is 
  made or amended, shall be deemed to provide for the statutory accident benefits 
  set out in the Schedule and any amendments to the Schedule, subject to the terms, 
  conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits set out in that Schedule.</p>
<p>
  [24] In addition, s. 268(1) has the effect of amending every motor vehicle liability 
  policy in force when the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule is amended, which 
  included Beattie's policy, to provide for the statutory benefits set out in 
  an amended Schedule. Consequently, by virtue of s. 268(1), as O. Reg. 403/96 
  was in force at the time of Beattie's accident, his policy has been amended 
  to incorporate the benefits and exclusions contained in the regulation. The 
  power of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations respecting Statutory 
  Accident Benefit Schedules is contained in s. 121(1)9 of the Insurance Act.</p>
<p>
  [25] I would not give effect to the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  Costs appeal</p>
<p>
  [26] Frontier has appealed from the costs of $30,000 awarded to Beattie by the 
  motion judge. It has not sought leave to appeal costs. Moreover, in his submissions 
  counsel for Frontier did not press the issue of costs. In my view, there is 
  no proper reason on which I would grant leave to appeal costs. Consequently, 
  I would deny leave to appeal the motion judge's costs award.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [27] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal. 
  In the circumstances, as each party was unsuccessful, there will be no costs.</p>
