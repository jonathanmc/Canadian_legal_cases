<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appeal from sentence is dismissed as an abandoned appeal. </p>    <P>
  [2] After a detailed review of the evidence and the relevant authorities, the 
  trial judge concluded that the appellant was not detained. Absent a detention, 
  the appellant's rights under s. 10 of the Charter were not engaged. </p>    <P>
  [3] The trial judge's findings of fact are fully justified on the evidence and 
  we have been offered no basis upon which we can interfere with those findings. 
  We note that the appellant did not testify on the voir dire.</p>    <P>
  [4] An application of the controlling jurisprudence (e.g. R. v. Grafe (1987), 
  36 C.C.C. (3d) (Ont. C.A.)) to those facts, the trial judge correctly concluded 
  that the appellant was not detained while he spoke to the officers on the street.</p>    <P>
  [5] The trial judge's finding that the appellant was not detained stands. The 
  Charter challenge to the admissibility of the identification evidence was properly 
  rejected.</p>    <P>
  [6] The conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
