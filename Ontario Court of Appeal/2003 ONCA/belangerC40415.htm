<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The issue on this appeal is whether the motions judge erred in concluding 
  that the minutes of settlement did not contain all the essential terms necessary 
  to constitute an enforceable agreement. In our view he did err. </p>
<p> [2] The motions judge reached his conclusion because paragraph 4 of the minutes 
  provides that the easement agreement and the licensing agreement were to form 
  part of the judgment to be issued, and because, in his view, the terms of those 
  two agreements still had to be negotiated by the parties. In our view, however, 
  the essential terms of the easement agreement were set out in paragraphs 1 and 
  2 of the minutes and the essential terms of the licensing agreement were set 
  out in paragraph 3 of the minutes. No further negotiations were required. </p>
<p> [3] Our view is supported by the record of why the deal between the parties 
  fell apart. The deal fell apart solely because the appellant, Mr. Belanger, 
  refused to contribute to the $2000 costs of obtaining committee of adjustment 
  approval for the easement. When the dispute over payment of the $2000 surfaced 
  the Guilianis did not contend there were outstanding issues over the terms of 
  either the easement agreement or the licensing agreement that the parties had 
  yet to resolve. Whatever complaints they may have voiced to their own lawyer, 
  they made no complaint about the terms of these two agreements to Mr. Belanger 
  or his lawyer. Thus, this appeal turns on the narrow question whether the Giulianis 
  were justified in resiling from the minutes of settlement because of the dispute 
  over the $2000. We do not think that they were justified for two reasons.</p>
<p> [4] First, we think that the obligation undertaken by the Giulianis to grant 
  the easement carried with it the obligation to assume the costs of obtaining 
  committee approval for it. In other words, the Giulianis were required to pay 
  the $2000 and were not justified in looking to Mr. Belanger for contribution. 
</p>
<p> [5] Second, at worst the dispute over the $2000 was one of those minor matters 
  that the parties in paragraph 4 of the minutes of settlement had expressly agreed 
  could be resolved by a judge. </p>
<p> [6] For these brief reasons we have concluded that the minutes of settlement 
  constituted an enforceable agreement between the parties. Therefore we allow 
  the appeal, set aside the judgement of the motions judge and in its place grant 
  judgment in accordance with the minutes of settlement.</p>
<p> [7] The appellant shall have his costs of the motion in the amount of $1500 
  and his costs of the appeal in the amount of $2500, both sums inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
