<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice P.J. Flynn of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 5, 2002.</p>

<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] In this case, the parties asked the trial judge to determine whether the 
  primary residence of the child should be with the mother in Stratford or with 
  the father in Brantford. In addressing this question, the trial judge had the 
  difficult task of determining what was in the child's best interests. His decision 
  was bound to be painful to one party or the other. </p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge determined that it was in the best interests of the child 
  that his primary residence be with the father. We are asked to review and reverse 
  that decision. We are empowered to do so, but only if the trial judge erred 
  in principle or materially misapprehended the evidence. In our view, he did 
  neither. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge rested his conclusion most significantly on his findings 
  that the only really stable place the child has had in his life is the Cormier 
  family home in Brantford, that the father's family is much more supportive of 
  the child's relationship with his mother than vice versa, and that as secondary 
  but important caregivers for the child, the father's mother has a much longer, 
  stronger and more stable relationship with the child than does the mother's 
  fianc&eacute;. There was ample evidence to support these findings and they are 
  all clearly important in assessing the child's best interests. We cannot say 
  that the trial judge erred in giving them the weight that he did.</p>
<p>
  [4] It is true that the trial judge did not expressly address the adverse impact 
  on the child of the reduced time with the mother that will result from his order, 
  given the pre-trial arrangement that split the child's residence equally between 
  the parents. However, he was asked to choose between the two proposals for primary 
  residence. Both parties took the position that the split residence status quo 
  was not in the child's best interests and should end. Indeed, the child himself 
  expressed concern to many of his caregivers about having no home. The trial 
  judge concluded that the split residence arrangement could not continue - a 
  reasonable finding in light of the evidence and given that the child is on the 
  verge of full time school. Either choice of primary residence would have inevitably 
  reduced the time with one parent. In these circumstances it is not reversible 
  error for the trial judge not to refer to the reduced time with the mother in 
  finding that the best interests of the child are served not by continuing the 
  status quo, but by ordering primary residence to be with the father. </p>
<p>
  [5] Nor is it reversible error that the trial judge does not refer in his reasons 
  to the incidents of the father acting in anger. These incidents were not recent 
  and arose largely in the context of the crisis of the marriage break up. That 
  evidence was before the trial judge and, given its historical nature, it was 
  open to him to decline to give it significant weight.</p>
<p>
  [6] Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge addressed the past, but 
  not the future in determining what would be in the child's best interests. We 
  disagree. Both parties presented their parenting plans for the future. The choice 
  of primary residence made by the trial judge is in essence an endorsement of 
  the father's parenting plan as being in the child's best interests. </p>
<p>
  [7] It is true that that plan relied on the strong links that the child has 
  developed since his birth with the Cormier family home, the father's mother 
  and the father's family generally. However, it is just those links and the benefits 
  they bring that, in the trial judge's view made it in the child's best interests 
  that his primary residence should be with the father in Brantford. We cannot 
  find that he erred in coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal must be dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [9] The parties will have two weeks from the date of release of these reasons 
  to provide brief written submissions as to costs of the appeal.</p>
