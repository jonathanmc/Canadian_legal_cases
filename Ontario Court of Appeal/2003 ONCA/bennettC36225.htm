<p>On appeal from the conviction for first degree murder imposed by Justice C. 
  Stephen Glithero of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated 
  December 11, 1999.</p>
<p> MCMURTRY C.J.O.: </p>
<p> OVERVIEW</p>
<p> [1] The appellant appeals from his conviction for first degree murder following 
  a trial by judge and jury. The conviction relates to the killing of Jennifer 
  Ueberschlag, who was found dead in her apartment on Sunday May 10, 1992. The 
  appellant was arrested for first degree murder five years after the killing, 
  on May 13, 1997. He was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to life in 
  prison with no eligibility for parole for twenty-five years on December 11, 
  1999.</p>
<p> [2] The Crown's case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. It 
  included certain expert hair comparison evidence that, in my view, the trial 
  judge erred in admitting. In addition, there were errors in the trial judge's 
  charge to the jury on the use that they could make of certain identification 
  evidence and after-the-fact conduct evidence, including two statements that 
  the appellant made to police. I am satisfied that the cumulative effect of these 
  errors is that the conviction cannot stand and a new trial on the charge of 
  first degree murder is required. </p>
<p> [3] The theory of the Crown in this case was that the appellant wanted a sexual 
  relationship with the eighteen-year-old victim, whom he had met a few weeks 
  before her death. This motivation led him to her apartment on the evening of 
  Friday May 8, 1992, where he asphyxiated her by shoving a cat toy in her mouth 
  to suppress her screams. The killing occurred while he was committing or attempting 
  to commit a sexual assault or a forcible confinement or both. The Crown's position 
  was that the killing took place at around midnight on May 8th.</p>
<p> [4] The circumstantial evidence upon which the Crown's theory rested included 
  the following areas of evidence: the appellant's expressed sexual interest in 
  the victim; scalp and pubic hairs, some of which revealed a DNA match to the 
  appellant and some of which showed microscopic similarities to his hairs, found 
  on the victim's bedclothes and body; various hairs and hair fragments found 
  on the victim's bedclothes and body had so-called &quot;Negroid&quot; characteristics 
  and the appellant was the only black suspect; a trace of semen was found in 
  the vagina (the sample was too small for DNA analysis); the body was nude; the 
  victim had suffered multiple, superficial cuts to her neck and significant bruising 
  to the upper body; the appellant knew how to access the victim's apartment; 
  and the appellant's alleged inculpatory after-the-fact conduct.</p>
<p> [5] The appellant did not testify and the defence did not call any evidence. 
  Defence counsel was unsuccessful on his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal 
  and on his alternative motion to have the first degree murder charge dismissed 
  and the case proceed on a charge of second degree murder. </p>
<p> [6] In his closing address to the jury, defence counsel did not deny that 
  there was evidence that the appellant, who was age 33 at the time of the murder, 
  had expressed sexual attraction for the victim. Nor was it denied that six of 
  his pubic hairs were found on the bedclothes, the body and the body bag in which 
  the victim's body was transported. However, the defence denied a motive to use 
  violence to satisfy the appellant's sexual interest and took the position that 
  the presence of his hairs could be explained by a theory of innocent transfer. 
</p>
<p> [7] Defence counsel argued that the jury could not find beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that it was the appellant who killed Ms. Ueberschlag. Counsel further 
  argued that the jury could not convict on the charge of first degree murder 
  because there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the victim was sexually 
  assaulted or unlawfully confined. The defence alternatively argued that death 
  occurred without the intent to kill and that the only possible offence upon 
  which the jury could make a finding of guilt was manslaughter.</p>
<p> [8] Because of my view that a new trial is required, I will limit my discussion 
  of the facts to those necessary to appreciate the six grounds of appeal pursued 
  by appellant's counsel. These grounds are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) the trial judge erred in admitting trace evidence from the 
  scene of the killing that was not probative and was prejudicial;</p>
<p class="indent">ii) the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury by failing 
  to instruct the jury that they must not draw the speculative and prejudicial 
  inference that the Crown invited them to draw with respect to the trace evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">iii) the trial judge erred in his charge in regard to identification 
  evidence and erroneously allowed the jury to consider as evidence against the 
  appellant an identification which excluded the appellant from being the person 
  who was seen following the victim on the day before she was killed;</p>
<p class="indent">iv) the trial judge erred in his charge in regard to after-the-fact 
  conduct by erroneously allowing the jury to use after-the-fact conduct evidence 
  against the appellant that was prejudicial and had little or no probative value;</p>
<p class="indent">v) any verdict of culpable homicide is unreasonable; and</p>
<p class="indent">vi) the verdict of first degree murder is unreasonable.</p>
<p> RELEVANT FACTS</p>
<p> [9] In the spring of 1992, Jennifer Ueberschlag lived alone in an apartment 
  at 152 Homewood Avenue in Kitchener. She socialized with street youth and was 
  introduced to the appellant through her &quot;street dad&quot;, John MacDonald 
  (known on the street as &quot;Bulldog&quot;), who was leaving town and who asked 
  the appellant to look after Jennifer while he was gone. The introduction occurred 
  somewhere between two weeks and two months before her death. </p>
<p> [10] Jennifer's landlord, David Pawlowski, testified that the appellant had 
  visited her building several times driving a &quot;rusty black Cutlass&quot; 
  with a noisy muffler. </p>
<p> [11] Nicole Rowe, a close friend of Jennifer's, testified that on May 1, 1992 
  (about a week before the killing), Jennifer called her and asked her to come 
  over because she was not comfortable being drunk with the appellant in her apartment. 
  Rowe went to the apartment and while she was there, she saw Jennifer and the 
  appellant sitting beside each other on the bed. He at one point massaged Jennifer's 
  shoulders and tried to push her top off her shoulder. Rowe overheard the appellant 
  ask Jennifer to go out with him and she replied that she loved Jeff [Stadelbauer], 
  her boyfriend, who was then in jail. </p>
<p> [12] When Jennifer was in the bathroom, the appellant asked Rowe how he could 
  win Jennifer over. Rowe replied she would probably not go out with anyone unless 
  Jeff was out of the picture. Rowe testified that the appellant commented, &quot;it 
  could be arranged&quot; and said &quot;his dick ached every time he thought 
  of her&quot;. </p>
<p> [13] The Crown introduced a number of witnesses who gave evidence of the appellant's 
  whereabouts during the afternoon and evening of May 8th. None of the witnesses 
  testified to seeing him at or near Jennifer's apartment near the time of the 
  murder. The Crown witnesses' evidence was inconsistent on the timing of the 
  appellant's activities on the evening of May 8th. In addition, the evidence 
  of Charles Russell, who lived in the same house as the appellant, was totally 
  inconsistent with that of the appellant's acquaintances and Crown witnesses, 
  Valerie Dobbin, Michelle Klobucar, Justina Meekison and Dan Stewart, as well 
  as Jennifer's landlord, Pawlowski. </p>
<p> [14] On the evening of May 8th, Jennifer was out with her parents. They dropped 
  her at her apartment at 10 or 10:30 p.m. Rowe telephoned her at about 11:45 
  p.m., but there was no answer. At 11:55 p.m., James Winters, who lived in the 
  same apartment building, awoke to the sounds of a female screaming and thumping 
  noises. Two or three minutes later he heard another short scream. An estimated 
  five to thirty minutes later, he heard an engine start and a vehicle leave the 
  parking lot. When asked to describe the sound of the engine, he said that it 
  did not sound like his own small Japanese car. He testified that he did not 
  note any unusual sound from the car and also testified that he did not note 
  it having a defective muffler or problems with the exhaust system.</p>
<p> [15] Another tenant in the building, Michael Sommers, testified that the next 
  night, shortly after 11:45 p.m., he heard a loud car with a bad muffler come 
  into the parking lot and stay there for approximately five or ten minutes. It 
  drove around the back of the building and then exited the building around five 
  or ten minutes later. About twenty minutes after the car had left, he saw a 
  light on in Jennifer's apartment and a large shadow moving in the window. The 
  Crown proposed that the inference to be drawn was that the appellant had returned 
  to clean up the crime scene. </p>
<p> [16] On Sunday May 10, 1992 at approximately 7:30 p.m., Jennifer Ueberschlag's 
  nude body was found by her father and Rowe lying face down in the living room. 
  Her face was in a bowl of liquid. </p>
<p> PATHOLOGY</p>
<p> [17] Dr. David McAuliffe, a forensic pathologist, testified that he could 
  find no cause of death other than asphyxia. He was unable to determine the cause 
  of the asphyxiation: there was no sign of manual or ligature strangulation. 
  The Crown and defence theory was that a cat toy found near the body had been 
  inserted into the victim's mouth and caused her death. The pathologist agreed 
  that the cat toy could have obstructed the airway and caused asphyxia if it 
  were inserted sufficiently deep. </p>
<p> [18] There was blunt force trauma to the victim's head, neck and arms. There 
  were four significant bruises to the scalp and her right eye was blackened. 
  There was massive bruising with abrasions on the left side of the face and deep 
  bruising on the left side of the neck. There was bruising to the left and right 
  biceps, consistent with grab marks from behind. There was a serrated abrasion 
  on the right wrist, consistent with a defensive wound. There were 18 to 20 cuts 
  on the neck, which were superficial and did not contribute to her death. The 
  cuts had been inflicted before death or possibly a very short time after death. 
  There was a serrated pattern in some of the cuts, but either a serrated or non-serrated 
  knife could have caused them.</p>
<p> [19] The body had been moved postmortem. Lividity patterns indicated that 
  the victim first lay on her back and later was moved and turned onto her front.</p>
<p> [20] There were no signs of trauma to the vagina or anus. Three spermatozoa 
  were found in the vagina, a sample too small to permit DNA analysis. Normal 
  ejaculate contains hundreds of millions of spermatozoa, which can be found for 
  up to seven days in the vagina of a living woman and longer after death. </p>
<p> THE CRIME SCENE </p>
<p> [21] In the bedroom, the mattress was not sitting squarely on the bed frame 
  and the headboard was at an angle. The bed was not made. There were clothes 
  on the floor near the bed, positioned in a way that suggested the wearer had 
  undressed and dropped them on the floor. The clothes were not damaged. </p>
<p> [22] Police collected hairs and fibres and took swabs and fingerprints from 
  the apartment. The body was examined by laser and luma light in an effort to 
  discover hairs and fibres. Fingerprinting the lower body yielded no fingerprints. 
  Although bruising on the upper body suggested that the victim had been grabbed, 
  the decision was made not to fingerprint the remainder of the body because the 
  body was deteriorating and it was decided that an autopsy needed to be performed 
  immediately. </p>
<p> [23] Twenty identifiable fingerprints were found in the apartment and of these, 
  only five were identified to known individuals. The appellant's fingerprints 
  were found on a bottle of peach schnapps in a cupboard and nowhere else. </p>
<p> FORENSIC EVIDENCE</p>
<p> [24] Kimberley Johnston of the Centre of Forensic Sciences (&quot;CFS&quot;) 
  received various items for forensic analysis and DNA testing, including various 
  swabs taken from the victim's body, bedding and other areas of her apartment, 
  the appellant's knife that he customarily carried with him and roots from several 
  hairs. </p>
<p> [25] Ms. Johnston concluded that the trace amount of semen identified on vaginal 
  swabs from the victim was insufficient to permit generation of a DNA profile. 
  Semen was not detected on any of the swabs from the victim's bedding and body. 
  Blood was detected on swabs of a towel from the bathroom and from the kitchen 
  and dining room floors and carpets, but no DNA results could be obtained from 
  these samples. Blood was not detected on the appellant's knife.</p>
<p> [26] Ms. Johnston performed DNA testing on eight hairs found in the apartment. 
  DNA extracted from four of these hairs matched the appellant's DNA profile: 
  one of the hairs was found on the right buttock of the victim, two were found 
  on the bed sheets and one on the duvet. Another hair found on the back of the 
  victim matched the appellant's DNA profile in three of four loci where it was 
  tested. At the fourth locus, the appellant could not be excluded as a donor 
  of the DNA profile. </p>
<p> [27] The carpet underneath where the body was found was not seized until approximately 
  six years later. By that time, it had been cleaned and other tenants had since 
  lived in the apartment. Ms. Johnston's analysis of a piece of this carpet revealed 
  a semen stain that had not originated from the appellant.</p>
<p> [28] Pamela Newall of the CFS also examined five items that were sent to her 
  for DNA analysis, including a root tissue from a hair found on the carpet below 
  the body and a hair collected from the body bag. She did not find DNA on any 
  of the five items that she examined. </p>
<p> [29] Eric Crocker of the CFS undertook a microscopic examination of some 292 
  human hairs that were found in the apartment. The complicated evidence surrounding 
  this hair comparison analysis will be discussed in detail below. Suffice it 
  to say at this point that Mr. Crocker concluded that thirteen hairs found in 
  the apartment showed different levels of microscopic similarity to the appellant's 
  known hair samples.</p>
<p> [30] There is nothing in the record to indicate the reason for the five-year 
  delay between the killing of Jennifer Ueberschlag and the arrest of the appellant 
  for her murder. It appears that the time lag is at least partially attributable 
  to delay by the CFS which, according to the trial judge, did not perform the 
  DNA testing until approximately five years after the death and did not do much 
  of the microscopic comparison work until 1997.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p> [31] Apart from this delay, other aspects of the investigation are troubling. 
  The failure to test the carpet under the body for semen until six years after 
  the murder and the failure to first fingerprint the upper part of the victim's 
  body, where she was beaten and appeared to have been grabbed, gives rise to 
  a concern that evidence going to the killer's identity may not have been collected. 
</p>
<p> APPELLANT'S STATEMENTS TO POLICE</p>
<p> [32] The appellant gave two statements to police. The first was a verbal statement 
  taken by Detectives Osinga and Close at the appellant's Mill Street residence 
  in Kitchener on May 11, 1992. They advised him of Jennifer's death and told 
  him they would like to rule him out as a suspect and wished him to give a statement. 
  The appellant co-operated, giving a statement and responding to police questions. 
  Detective Close requested the appellant to provide hair, saliva and pubic hair 
  samples and the appellant readily agreed to do so. </p>
<p> [33] On May 13, 1992, Detective Osinga asked the appellant over the phone 
  to attend at police headquarters to answer a few more questions. The appellant 
  asked if he was still a suspect and told that he was. The appellant agreed to 
  come to the station for nine o'clock the next day to give a statement. Detective 
  Osinga testified as follows about what was said to the appellant when he arrived 
  at the station on May 14, 1992: </p>
<p class="indent"> I advised Mr. Bennett that I knew he had given a partial alibi 
  for Friday evening in his previous statement. I said we had spoken to Justine 
  [Justina Meekison] and she seemed to back up that part of his previous statement. 
  I said, she speaks highly of you. I advised Milton that we would want to alibi 
  him from Friday morning, the 8th of May, until the Sunday evening. We needed 
  to know what he had been doing during that period of time. </p>
<p> The appellant provided a more detailed written statement regarding his whereabouts 
  for the time period specified by Detective Osinga. </p>
<p> [34] The content of the appellant's two statements are discussed below in 
  connection with the trial judge's charge on the after-the-fact conduct evidence. 
</p>
<p> ANALYSIS</p>
<p> Issue 1: Did the trial judge err in admitting trace evidence from the scene 
  of the killing that was not probative and was prejudicial? </p>
<p> [35] The defence brought a pre-trial application challenging the admissibility 
  of certain hair comparison analysis and DNA evidence that the Crown sought to 
  introduce at trial. On appeal, only the admissibility of some of the hair comparison 
  evidence is at issue. </p>
<p> (i) Summary of Hair Comparison and Related DNA Evidence </p>
<p> [36] As noted, 292 human hairs were recovered from the victim's apartment 
  and sent for analysis by the CFS. Eric Crocker of the CFS conducted the hair 
  comparison analysis and testified at the voir dire and at trial. His report 
  and testimony included the following terminology and analysis, as quoted verbatim 
  from his report: </p>
<p class="indent"> Type A-1: Unknown scalp hairs that are microscopically similar 
  to a known hair sample. On the basis of this microscopic similarity, these hairs 
  could have originated from the same source as the known sample. </p>
<p class="indent">Type A-2: Unknown scalp hairs that share some, but not all of 
  the microscopic characteristics in common with a known hair sample. On the basis 
  of the shared characteristics, these hairs cannot be eliminated as having originated 
  from the same source as the known sample. Note: This partial similarity, while 
  perhaps useful in an investigative sense, should not be considered to have any 
  probative value in terms of identification.</p>
<p class="indent">Type A-3: Unknown scalp hairs that are dissimilar to the known 
  samples.</p>
<p class="indent">Type B-1: Unknown body hairs that are microscopically similar 
  to the known pubic and chest hair sample. On the basis of this microscopic similarity, 
  these hairs could have originated from the same source as the known sample.</p>
<p class="indent">Type B-2: Unknown body hairs that share some, but not all of 
  the microscopic characteristics in common with a known pubic and chest hair 
  sample. On the basis of the shared characteristics, these hairs cannot be eliminated 
  as having originated from the same source as the known sample. Note: This partial 
  similarity, while perhaps useful in an investigative sense, should not be considered 
  to have any probative value in terms of identification.</p>
<p class="indent">Type B-3: Unknown body hairs that are dissimilar to the known 
  samples.</p>
<p class="indent">Type C: Unknown hairs that include short hair fragments and 
  clippings or limb and immature hairs that are not useful for comparison purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">[Underlining in original.]</p>
<p> [37] Mr. Crocker compared the hairs found at the apartment with comparison 
  samples from the victim, the appellant, and various other suspects and individuals 
  known to have been in contact with the victim, including Joel Coulombe (Jennifer 
  was to be a witness for him at his upcoming sexual assault trial), Chad Tailby 
  (an acquaintance of Jennifer's), Jeff Stadelbauer and others. According to Mr. 
  Crocker, a type B-2 hair similar to Joel Coulombe's body hair sample was found 
  on the victim's pink blanket, although he testified that he had never been in 
  Jennifer's apartment. Mr. Crocker also concluded that two type B-2 hairs similar 
  to Chad Tailby's body hair sample were found on her pink blanket. </p>
<p> [38] A significant number of hairs were found on the victim's body and bedsheets 
  and elsewhere in the apartment that, according to Mr. Crocker, were not similar 
  to any of the known hair samples. The following unknown hairs were found on 
  or under the victim's body or on the body bag: </p>
<p class="indent"> right hand: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  left and right breast: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  right thigh: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  back: 2 unknown scalp hairs<br>
  buttocks: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  left buttocks: 2 unknown body hairs<br>
  body (from laser exam): 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  body bag: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  carpet underneath body: 1 unknown body hair</p>
<p> [39] The following unknown hairs were found on the victim's bedding: </p>
<p class="indent"> top sheet: 1 unknown scalp hair<br>
  1 unknown body hair <br>
  bottom sheet: 2 unknown scalp hairs<br>
  pink blanket: 4 unknown scalp hairs<br>
  3 unknown body hairs<br>
  pillow case and pillow: 1 unknown body hair</p>
<p>[40] In sum, Mr. Crocker's hair analysis indicated that there were three body 
  hairs and eight scalp hairs either on or under the body and body bag that did 
  not come from the victim, the appellant or any of the other known donors. The 
  same is true of four body hairs and seven scalp hairs found in the victim's 
  bedding.</p>
<p> [41] Mr. Crocker concluded that four body hairs found in the apartment were 
  microscopically similar to the appellant's pubic hair sample, in other words 
  that they were type B-1 hairs. These four hairs were described in Mr. Crocker's 
  report as &quot;B1MB&quot; hairs, such abbreviation denoting the hair type and 
  the appellant's initials. In addition, he concluded that six body hairs found 
  in the apartment shared some, but not all of the microscopic characteristics 
  in common with the appellant's pubic hair sample, i.e., type B-2 hairs. These 
  hairs were described in Mr. Crocker's report as &quot;B2MB&quot; hairs, again 
  denoting the hair type and appellant's initials. He also concluded that three 
  scalp hairs found in the apartment shared some, but not all of the microscopic 
  characteristics in common with the hair sample provided by the appellant, i.e., 
  type A-2 hairs. These hairs were referred to in Mr. Crocker's report as &quot;A2MB&quot; 
  hairs. </p>
<p> [42] These thirteen hairs with some level of microscopic similarity to the 
  appellant's known hair samples were found in the following locations: </p>
<p class="indent"> B1MB hairs: 1 on the back of the victim<br>
  1 on the right buttock of the victim<br>
  1 on the body bag<br>
  1 on the washroom floor<br>
  B2MB hairs: 1 on the back of the victim<br>
  1 on the carpet under the victim's body<br>
  1 on the duvet<br>
  2 on the top sheet<br>
  1 on the pink blanket<br>
  A2MB hairs: 2 on the duvet<br>
  1 on the bottom sheet</p>
<p> [43] In Mr. Crocker's opinion, the similarities between the B1MB and B2MB 
  hairs found in the apartment and the sample pubic hairs provided by the appellant 
  indicated, (quoting Mr. Crocker's rather inscrutable testimony on the voir dire), 
  that: &quot;if these hairs being similar to Mr. Bennett's pubic hairs, if they're 
  not Mr. Bennett's pubic hairs, then they're not from Mr. Bennett.&quot; Or as 
  defence counsel put it and which Mr. Crocker accepted, &quot;that's another 
  way of saying if they're from Mr. Bennett, then they must be from his pubic 
  hair &#133; area.&quot; </p>
<p> [44] Mr. Crocker identified six C hairs, i.e., short hair fragments or limb 
  and immature hairs that are not useful for comparison purposes, which he testified 
  had &quot;Negroid&quot; characteristics. The location and description of these 
  C hairs are as follows: </p>

<p>[45] Mr. Crocker testified that C hairs can be readily carried on clothing 
  and transported in and out of a particular area. He also testified that some 
  of the C hairs with Negroid characteristics, including the one found on the 
  victim's perineum (the area between the vagina and anus), exhibited dissimilarities 
  to the appellant's known hair samples. In cross-examination on the voir dire,

<p> (ii) Voir Dire on the Admissibility of the Hair Comparison Evidence</p>
<p> [47] In his submissions on the voir dire, defence counsel did not object, 
  in my view, perhaps unwisely, to the admissibility of all of the microscopic 
  comparison evidence of hairs that did not reveal a DNA match to the appellant. 
  The focus of defence counsel's objection was described by the trial judge as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Ducharme does not challenge the admissibility of the evidence 
  of those hairs from the scene found to have a DNA profile matching that of Mr. 
  Bennett. Nor does he challenge the admissibility of the evidence of those hairs 
  which in the opinion of Mr. Crocker had a type 1 level of comparison to known 
  hairs of Mr. Bennett.</p>
<p> [48] In other words, defence counsel was seeking to exclude evidence of a 
  connection between the appellant and the three B2MB hairs that did not reveal 
  a DNA match to the appellant: one on the pink blanket, one on the victim's back 
  and one from the carpet under the victim's body. Comparison evidence regarding 
  the three A2MB hairs on the bedding was not the focus of the submissions or 
  the trial judge's analysis, but they are type 2 hairs and thus also subject 
  to defence counsel's objection because there was no DNA evidence linking these 
  hairs to the appellant. Defence counsel also objected in his submissions to 
  the admission of evidence that six of the type C hairs had &quot;Negroid&quot; 
  characteristics, &quot;because the only possible relevance of that would be 
  to suggest that it's [the appellant's] hair&quot;. </p>
<p> [49] In a ruling dated July 19, 1999, the trial judge dismissed the defence's 
  application related to the hair comparison evidence and admitted all of the 
  comparison evidence linking the various hairs to the appellant. Although the 
  ruling does not specifically address the admissibility of the evidence regarding 
  the C hairs having &quot;Negroid&quot; characteristics, Mr. Crocker was allowed 
  to give evidence before the jury about the racial characteristics of the C hairs. 
</p>
<p> [50] In arriving at his decision, the trial judge extensively reviewed the 
  Report of The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin, 1998 by the 
  Hon. Fred Kaufman, C.M., Q.C. (&quot;Kaufman Report&quot; or &quot;Report&quot;), 
  which discusses issues surrounding the use or misuse of hair and fibre comparison 
  evidence in the wrongful conviction of Guy Paul Morin. As the trial judge noted 
  in his ruling, the Kaufman Report recommends at pp. 311-2 that hair comparison 
  evidence showing only that an accused cannot be excluded as the donor of an 
  unknown hair, or only that an accused may or may not have been the donor, is 
  unlikely to have sufficient probative value to justify its reception at a criminal 
  trial as circumstantial evidence of guilt. This comment would apply to both 
  the type 1 and type 2 hairs referred to in Mr. Crocker's evidence. </p>
<p> [51] Also noted by the trial judge is that the Kaufman Report refers at pp. 
  312-3 to a possible situation where evidence that an accused cannot be excluded 
  as the donor of a hair left by a perpetrator may have a high degree of probative 
  value. Such a situation would arise, for example, if there are only two likely 
  suspects in a case and hair comparison evidence indicates that hair left by 
  the perpetrator could have come from one suspect and could not have come from 
  the other. The Report goes on to state (at p. 313): </p>
<p class="indent"> In the vast majority of cases, however, such evidence has extremely 
  limited probative value: it merely permits the trier of fact to infer that the 
  accused is one of a limitless class of persons who cannot be excluded as the 
  perpetrator based upon this analysis. </p>
<p> [52] The trial judge then referred to the discussion in the Kaufman Report 
  of the prejudicial effect of hair comparison evidence (at pp. 315 &amp; 320): 
</p>
<p class="indent"> The added difficulty with hair comparison evidence is that 
  its prejudicial effect may be substantial, since the scientific opinion brings 
  with it an aura of respectability and infallibility. The length and complexity 
  of the testimony which must be examined to produce the minute conclusion that 
  the accused cannot be excluded as the donor of the unknown hair has the potential 
  to mislead the jury and cause the testimony to acquire a prominence and importance 
  out of all proportion to its insignificance. Any trier of fact, hearing an exhaustive 
  detailing of the minutia of hair similarities found, could easily (and understandably) 
  conclude that only some legal or professional restraint prevents the experts 
  from saying that the compared hairs come from a common source. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In the least, paraphrasing Mohan, there is a danger that hair 
  and fibre evidence will be misused and will distort the fact-finding process. 
  Dressed up in scientific language which the jury does not easily understand 
  and submitted through a witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence may 
  be accepted by the jury as being virtually infallible and having more weight 
  than it deserves. Yet its probative value may often be insufficient to justify 
  its reception. </p>
<p> [53] Finally, the trial judge noted that the Kaufman Report recommends against 
  using the language &quot;could have originated from the suspect&quot; in scientific 
  findings by the CFS: </p>
<p class="indent"> Certain language enhances understanding and more clearly reflects 
  the limitations upon scientific findings. For example, some scientists state 
  that an item &quot;may or may not&quot; have originated from a particular person 
  or object. This language is preferable to a statement that an item &quot;could 
  have&quot; originated from that person or object, not only because the limitations 
  are clearer, but also because the same conclusion is expressed in more neutral 
  terms. (Executive Summary and Recommendations, Recommendation 10 at pp. 47-8) 
</p>
<p> [54] The trial judge next reviewed in some detail Mr. Crocker's evidence on 
  the voir dire, which fills almost 200 pages of transcript. As noted by the trial 
  judge, Mr. Crocker gave the following evidence with respect to the type 2 hairs, 
  which is reproduced here in summary form: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a hair that reveals a type 2 match, whether of a scalp or body hair, from 
    a microscopic point of view is not at all probative in terms of whether or 
    not the hair came from a particular individual;</li>
  <li>without confirming DNA evidence, the type B2MB hairs do not tell him anything 
    beyond the fact that the unknown hair donor and the appellant can belong to 
    the same class of donors, a class of indeterminate size, and that is why such 
    classification type is not probative of identification of the donor of the 
    hair;</li>
  <li>the lack of probative value in regard to one type B2 hair is not altered 
    if he has five type B2 hairs, each of which are slightly different from each 
    other but each of which has similarities to one or more hairs in the known 
    sample; the finding of five such hairs would be of use from an investigative 
    point of view;</li>
  <li>the finding of a body hair having a B-1 level of comparison to the appellant, 
    at a different location in the apartment, does not make it any more likely 
    that hairs with a type B-2 level of comparison to the appellant actually came 
    from him;</li>
  <li>taking together all of the type B2MB hairs that were found does not make 
    for a stronger case that they are the appellant's hairs; what it does is reduce 
    somewhat the size of the indeterminate class of people from which the hairs 
    could have come, but that size reduction is unquantifiable;</li>
  <li>the fact that three B2MB hairs generated a DNA profile matching that of 
    the appellant does not change the probative value of the other B2MB hairs;</li>
  <li>considering the total number of all of the B1MB and B2MB hairs does not 
    increase the probative value of his opinion whether the B2 hairs are the appellant's; 
    the combined effect of considering all these hairs together is that it would 
    in some way reduce the size of the indeterminate class who could be the donor, 
    but in an immeasurable way so that the class is still of indeterminate size; 
  </li>
  <li>there was nothing about the type C hairs that increased the probative value 
    of the type B2 classification of some hairs as having possibly originated 
    from the appellant;</li>
  <li>if Mr. Crocker had a hundred hairs that he categorized as having a type 
    B-2 level of comparison to a known sample, that would tend to suggest that 
    they came from the same individual, but he was unable to so opine on the strength 
    of five hairs;</li>
  <li>Mr. Crocker did not compare the various B2MB hairs, the one with the others, 
    so as to form any opinion as to their similarities;</li>
  <li>the fact that there are three B1MB hairs, three A2MB hairs and five B2MB 
    hairs has no probative value individually in terms of whether they can be 
    said to be the appellant's; however, viewed collectively, because they have 
    some overlapping characteristics, the highest it can be put is that they may 
    very well have originated from the same individual; the similarities found 
    do not preclude the possibility that these hairs came from more than one donor;</li>
  <li>considering all of the type B2MB hairs together only suggests that they 
    may have come from a single individual but that they certainly do not prove 
    that and that is as high as his opinion can be put;</li>
  <li>considering the type B-1 and B-2 hairs, together with the fact that some 
    were found to have a DNA profile matching that of the accused means that the 
    accused may well be the individual who donated all the B-2 hairs, but that 
    opinion would be based on the effect of the DNA identification and not on 
    the basis of his microscopic hair comparison;</li>
  <li>the submission of one, six or ten type 2 hairs to a jury is prejudicial.</li>
</ul>
<p> [55] The trial judge commented that if the only hair evidence linking the 
  appellant to the scene consisted of those hairs having a type 2 level of comparison, 
  he would have excluded the evidence on the basis that its low probative value 
  was outweighed by the potential prejudicial effect. However, he concluded that 
  the probative value of the type 2 hairs was &quot;somewhat elevated&quot; in 
  this case: </p>
<p class="indent"> In this case the probative value is somewhat elevated by the 
  finding of type 1 hairs, by the finding of a DNA profile matching that of Mr. 
  Bennett on some of these B-1 and B-2 hairs, the effect that finding may have 
  in establishing that those hairs came from him, and by virtue of similarities 
  said to exist between the various type 1 and 2 hairs, the available inference 
  that all the B-2 hairs are his. The proximity of various hairs to each other, 
  in terms of location, may also lend some probative value. The finding that some 
  B-2 hairs had a negroid characteristic has some probative value, given other 
  evidence before me that the police investigation revealed no other possibly 
  involved persons of that racial origin, and the deceased's best friend knew 
  of no other such acquaintances. This of course, may well be offset by the finding 
  of negroid characteristics in some type C hairs having microscopic dissimilarities 
  to the accused's sample hairs. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [56] The trial judge further explained his decision to admit the evidence 
  of the type 2 hair linked to the appellant as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In summary, my view is that the evidence as to type 2 level 
  of comparison has some limited probative value, that in the circumstances of 
  this case the jury is of necessity going to hear hair comparison evidence in 
  any event, that it is not practical to exclude type 2 level of comparison hair 
  evidence without improperly distorting the balance of the hair comparison evidence, 
  and that with appropriate effort by counsel and careful instruction from the 
  court, the potential for prejudice can be satisfactorily addressed. </p>
<p> (iii) Analysis of the Ruling on the Voir Dire </p>
<p> [57] In my view, the trial judge fell into error in deciding to admit the 
  type 2 hair comparison evidence that defence counsel sought to exclude. The 
  prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed its probative value.</p>
<p> [58] The defence's theory was that the appellant's hairs associated with the 
  body and bedding were found there for an innocent reason: his hairs had either 
  been deposited there directly, as he had been sitting on the bed the week before 
  the death, or through innocent transfer, as lividity patterns showed that the 
  body was moved after death and Mr. Crocker accepted that hairs could be transferred 
  to a body if it was sticky. The strength of the defence's theory would be reduced 
  as the number of hairs linked to the appellant and found on the bedding and 
  the body increased. </p>
<p> [59] The only possible relevance of the type 2 hair comparison evidence was 
  to establish the identity of the killer. The inference going to identity would 
  have to be that the finding of six type 2 hairs (three of which were scalp hairs 
  and three body hairs) on the victim's body and bedding, which were linked by 
  Mr. Crocker's evidence to the appellant, combined with the six pubic hairs found 
  on or near the body and on the bedding which defence counsel conceded belonged 
  to the appellant, supported the inference that the appellant was the killer. 
</p>
<p> [60] I am of the view that the probative value of the impugned type 2 evidence 
  was not elevated to the extent found by the trial judge. Having said that, in 
  fairness to the trial judge, I would agree entirely with his comment that, &quot;Mr. 
  Crocker's opinion as to the probative value of the type 2 hairs was, with respect, 
  something less than crisp.&quot; However, Mr. Crocker clearly expressed the 
  opinion that evidence of a type 2 hair comparison, without confirming DNA evidence, 
  is not probative of identification of the donor of the hair. He also testified 
  that the fact that three B2MB hairs generated a DNA profile matching that of 
  the accused does not change the probative value of the other B2MB hairs. His 
  additional, and rather obscure, testimony to the effect that taking together 
  the hairs that showed a type 1 and type 2 comparison to the appellant's known 
  hair samples reduced by an immeasurable amount the size of the indeterminate 
  class who could be the donor of the type 2 hairs did not, in my view, significantly 
  elevate the probative value of the type 2 evidence that the defence sought to 
  exclude. </p>
<p> [61] Moreover, to the extent that the trial judge found that the probative 
  value of the type 2 hair comparison evidence was elevated by virtue of similarities 
  said to exist between the various type 1 and 2 hairs, Mr. Crocker's testimony 
  was that he did not compare the type 2 hairs, one with the other, so as to form 
  any opinion as to their similarities. In addition, the Kaufman Report indicates 
  that an assessment of similarities between hairs is highly subjective (at p. 
  88): </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;The characteristics of a person's hairs vary from hair 
  to hair, and they may differ even within a single hair on a person's body. Hair 
  comparisons are not akin to fingerprint comparisons. Hairs are not unique, and 
  the assessment of the similarities, differences and importance of hair characteristics 
  is highly subjective. Efforts to quantify, through statistical analysis, the 
  probability that a person was the donor of an unknown hair are not generally 
  accepted in the forensic community - in my view, with good reason. [emphasis 
  in original; underlining added.]</p>
<p> [62] A further concern I have with the trial judge's analysis is with his 
  conclusion that the Negroid characteristics of the B2MB hairs increased their 
  probative value. This conclusion is premised on the assumption that there was 
  a finite group of people who could have left these hairs. However, there was 
  not a discrete group of people who could have been the killer in this case. 
  As defence counsel pointed out in his submissions on the voir dire, it had not 
  been established that Jennifer did not have any other black acquaintances. Jennifer's 
  landlord could not say, quoting the trial Crown's language, if there had been 
  any &quot;negro visitors&quot; to the apartment during the time prior to Jennifer's 
  death. Nicole Rowe and Jennifer's parents admitted that they did not know all 
  of Jennifer's acquaintances. And as defence counsel further argued in his pre-charge 
  submissions, it had not been proven that &quot;no other black person could get 
  into the apartment on the night&quot; in question. </p>
<p> [63] Finally, I am of the view that the trial judge erred in concluding that 
  if he excluded the type 2 evidence objected to by defence counsel, he would 
  improperly distort the balance of the hair comparison evidence. The trial judge 
  articulated this concern as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> For understandable reasons, Mr. Ducharme does not seek the 
  exclusion of the evidence of the finding of all these hairs. The finding of 
  hair bearing dissimilarity to any of the known samples, and the finding of hair 
  having a similarity to other known persons and suspects has relevance to his 
  defence. If evidence as to the finding of many other hairs in the apartment 
  is admissible, as is evidence that when microscopically examined some of these 
  hairs were found to have similarity to the hair of other known persons, or to 
  be microscopically dissimilar to any of the known persons, how can such evidence 
  be sensibly placed before the jury without the evidence of a purported B-2 level 
  of comparison of others to Mr. Bennett? Without distorting the evidence? </p>
<p> [64] In my opinion, had defence counsel's position been accepted, Mr. Crocker 
  would not have been put in a difficult position in explaining the evidence to 
  the jury, nor would the evidence have been distorted. Crown counsel could have 
  been permitted to call evidence regarding the type 1 hairs that were microscopically 
  similar to the appellant's, as well as the type 2 body hairs that revealed his 
  DNA profile. For the remaining six A2MB and B2MB hairs, Mr. Crocker could simply 
  have testified that these hairs were found, but that he could not be sure who 
  these hairs came from, instead of being permitted to testify that the appellant 
  could not be excluded as the donor of these hairs. Such an approach would have 
  avoided the strong potential for prejudice associated with this type of evidence, 
  as identified at p. 315 in the Kaufman Report: &quot;Any trier of fact, hearing 
  an exhaustive detailing of the minutia of hair similarities found, could easily 
  (and understandably) conclude that only some legal or professional restraint 
  prevents the experts from saying that the compared hairs come from a common 
  source.&quot; </p>
<p> [65] For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge erred in admitting 
  the type 2 evidence which the defence sought to exclude. Before turning to the 
  next ground of appeal, I also express the opinion that the trial judge further 
  erred in admitting the C hair evidence in this case. Counsel for the appellant 
  did not press this issue on appeal, however, in view of my disposition that 
  a new trial is required, I think it is appropriate to address it.</p>
<p> [66] In his submissions on the voir dire, defence counsel argued that the 
  C hairs should not be admitted. The trial judge said the following about this 
  evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> While type C hairs are not suitable for comparison in Mr. Crocker's 
  opinion, he did conduct some microscopic comparison of those hairs and found 
  the majority of them to exhibit negroid characteristics but to be dissimilar 
  to the known hairs of Mr. Bennett. One of these C hairs was found on the perineum 
  of the victim. The fact that he observed dissimilarities in characteristics 
  as between the known Bennett hairs and these unknown C hairs was not mentioned 
  in his report.</p>
<p> [67] In my view, the type C hairs had extremely low probative value and had 
  significant potential for prejudice given the testimony regarding their racial 
  characteristics. As previously mentioned, Mr. Crocker's evidence was that type 
  C hairs can be readily carried on clothing and transported in and out of a particular 
  area. He also testified that he was not suggesting that these Negroid C hairs 
  came from the appellant and said that they could well have come from another 
  person. He expressed the view in cross-examination that the C hairs in this 
  case do not have any value because they were isolated hair fragments, as opposed 
  to a grouping of numerous similar hair fragments.</p>
<p> [68] On the other hand, the potential for prejudice was significant given 
  that the appellant is a black man and the evidence was that several type C hairs, 
  including the one found on the victim's perineum, exhibited Negroid characteristics. 
  Even though Mr. Crocker testified that most of the six C hairs exhibited dissimilarities 
  to the appellant's known samples, the jury could well have inferred that as 
  the only known black suspect in the case, these hairs must have been his. For 
  these reasons, the trial judge erred in not excluding the evidence regarding 
  the racial characteristics of the C hair from the jury's consideration. </p>
<p> Issue 2: Did the trial judge err in his charge by failing to instruct the 
  jury that they must not draw the speculative and prejudicial inference that 
  the Crown invited them to draw with respect to the trace evidence?</p>
<p> [69] There is a real possibility that the jury misused the hair comparison 
  evidence in this case. </p>
<p> [70] In his ruling on the voir dire, Glithero J. expressed confidence that 
  any prejudice from the type 2 hair evidence could be reduced or eliminated at 
  trial: </p>
<p class="indent"> Such potential prejudice [of the microscopic hair comparison 
  evidence] can in my opinion be very much reduced, if not eradicated, by the 
  proper examination and cross-examination of Mr. Crocker, by the introduction 
  of such other expert evidence as the defence may see fit to elicit, and by my 
  best efforts to carefully instruct the jury as to the limitations on the probative 
  value of this evidence. </p>
<p> [71] The potential for prejudice from the type 2 hair comparison evidence 
  was dramatically increased by the way that Crown counsel in his closing address 
  asked the jury to use this evidence. The Crown urged the jury to draw inferences 
  unsupported by Mr. Crocker's testimony based on a &quot;common sense approach&quot; 
  to the hair evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> But as a matter of common sense, if you find DNA on one of 
  those B-2 hairs, as was done here, that would seem to make it pretty compelling 
  that it was from Mr. Bennett. Were you to find two hairs together, one being 
  a B-1 and one being a B-2, for instance, it would seem highly likely that the 
  same person deposited those there.</p>
<p class="indent">And as Mr. Crocker said in his evidence that while you may have 
  this&#133; this indeterminate class is the phraseology that's used, if you find 
  a number of hairs that vary between each other, but are all very similar to 
  a known sample, it's the fact we have different hairs all narrowing toward a 
  single sample that tends to narrow the range of this indeterminate group.</p>
<p class="indent">And he also went on to say that, in response to a suggestion 
  by my friend, if you had six hairs in exactly the same place, what that would 
  suggest to you, using this logic, is that all six individual hairs probably 
  came from a single individual. And, of course, he's being very careful not to 
  say they would come from Mr. Bennett, or anybody else, but a single person. 
  And that's a pretty logical, common sense approach. </p>
<p class="indent">And in this particular case, we not only have that type of thing, 
  but we also have DNA on some of those hairs, and the fact they're Negroid. [emphasis 
  added.]</p>
<p> [72] The Kaufman Report noted at p. 315 that the Crown used the type of argument 
  based on common sense in the Morin trial: </p>
<p class="indent"> Any trier of fact, hearing an exhaustive detailing of the minutia 
  of hair similarities found, could easily (and understandably) conclude that 
  only some legal or professional restraint prevents the experts from saying that 
  the compared hairs come from a common source. Indeed, Mr. McGuigan very persuasively 
  suggested in his jury address that, apart from the experts, a &quot;common sense&quot; 
  approach to the hair and fibre evidence led inexorably to the conclusion that 
  Christine Jessop had been in the Morin Honda. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [73] Even more problematic in this case is that Crown counsel was misleading 
  and imprecise in the way that he dealt with the hair evidence in his closing 
  argument. For example, he told the jury: &quot;And the B-2's were, I believe, 
  perhaps one exception, all DNA'ed to Mr. Bennett&quot;. Having said that, he 
  went on to tell the jury that they could double check for themselves the numbers 
  and locations of the hairs, as the jurors evidently had with them a chart of 
  the evidence. However, at another point in his closing, the Crown stated in 
  quite an inflammatory manner that all of the B-2 hairs were attributed by DNA 
  to the appellant: </p>
<p class="indent"> And so let's then use common sense. And where these items are 
  found when you look at the B2 hairs, etcetera, and in conjunction with B1 hairs, 
  or DNA'ed hairs, and the lack of other Negroids in Jen's life. And then look 
  as well, when you look at the DNA, at the other commonsensical type approach 
  that these hairs, the body hairs, the pubic hairs left behind with Mr. Bennett's 
  DNA profile on them and bearing some, if not all microscopic similarities to 
  his hair, are attributed, at least by DNA, to a person whose dick ached every 
  time he thought about Jennifer, and who was in fact over there looking for her. 
</p>
<p> [74] And again near the end of his closing, the Crown told the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> And then you look at all&#133;the fact that of all the hairs 
  you find in the apartment, you find two A-2 hairs, which some would suggest 
  we don't even look at A-2 hairs, scalp hairs. I think it's obvious you should 
  look at them.</p>
<p class="indent">But then you find all of these body hairs. And you find them 
  only on the body, in the bedclothes, or in the body bag, or under, with the 
  exception of one in the washroom, with DNA that's linked to him. And they are 
  pubic hairs. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [75] In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that in Mr. Crocker's opinion, 
  type 2 levels of comparison ought not be included in reports that go to the 
  jury and that they are not probative. He said the following about the Crown's 
  address to the jury on using this evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Russell made submissions to you as to the significance 
  of the type 2 comparison hairs and the C hairs. He urged you to draw certain 
  inferences and use the evidence you have in a way that may go beyond Mr. Crocker's 
  opinion as to the use that should be made of it. </p>
<p class="indent">I give you this caution, acknowledging that you are the finders 
  of facts, not me. </p>
<p> [76] The trial judge went on to tell the jury in regard to Mr. Crocker's evidence: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> I would suggest to you that his opinions you can accept, you 
  can reject, but I do not know that you can go adding much to them because you 
  were not given the tools which he used in order to formulate his opinions so 
  as to be able to build your own blocks, if I can put it that way, and go beyond 
  what he gave you in terms of opinion.</p>
<p> [77] He asked the jury to look at the charts before them on the hair evidence 
  and proceeded to summarize the location and type of hairs found in the apartment 
  as indicated in Mr. Crocker's report. </p>
<p> [78] In fairness to the trial judge, crafting an appropriate instruction on 
  the use of the hair evidence in this case was not a simple task and the trial 
  judge went to great lengths to be fair in his charge. However, in my view, the 
  trial judge failed to provide the careful instruction regarding the hair evidence, 
  which he acknowledged on the voir dire was required. </p>
<p> [79] The hair evidence in this case was a morass. It is not safe to assume 
  that the jury was not misled on its significance. The trial judge instructed 
  the jury that some of the Crown's suggested inferences &quot;may have gone beyond 
  Mr. Crocker's opinion&quot;. Yet this instruction significantly understated 
  the unfairness of Crown counsel's treatment of the hair evidence. Crown counsel 
  misstated the expert evidence by suggesting to the jury that they could infer 
  that finding one B-1 hair together with a B-2 hair makes it &quot;highly likely 
  that the same person deposited those there&quot;. Mr. Crocker's evidence did 
  not support such an inference. In addition, Crown counsel's suggestion that 
  all of the type 2 hairs had been &quot;attributed, at least by DNA, to a person 
  whose dick ached every time he thought about Jennifer&quot; misstated and oversimplified 
  the evidence in a way that was capable of seriously misleading the jury to draw 
  unwarranted inferences adverse to the appellant. </p>
<p> [80] The case against the appellant, which was based entirely on circumstantial 
  evidence, cannot be described as an overwhelming one. In this context, the hair 
  comparison evidence was a very important element of the Crown's case. In view 
  of my ultimate disposition directing a new trial, I think it might be of value 
  to give some direction on how the hair evidence ought to be dealt with in this 
  case. </p>
<p> [81] First of all, as explained above, the evidence that certain C hairs revealed 
  Negroid characteristics should not be admitted as evidence for the jury to consider. 
  All that Mr. Crocker should be permitted to say is that various C hairs were 
  found, but that they are not useful for comparison purposes. </p>
<p> [82] Second, the type 2 hair comparison evidence related to the three body 
  hairs and three scalp hairs that were not linked by DNA to the appellant should 
  not be admitted. </p>
<p> [83] Third, I question the wisdom of a concession by defence counsel that 
  the type 1 hairs without a DNA match to the appellant are his hairs. One of 
  these hairs was on the washroom floor and one was found on the body bag. This 
  concession appears to be unwarranted in light of the expert's evidence that 
  a type 1 comparison is not evidence that a hair is definitely that of the known 
  donor, only that it may or may not have come from him. Mr. Crocker acknowledged 
  that he used language that was frowned on by the Kaufman Report when he defined 
  the type 1 hairs in his report as hairs that &quot;could have originated from 
  the same source as the known sample&quot; [emphasis added]. As noted, the Kaufman 
  Report recommends that the phrase &quot;may or may not&quot; have originated 
  from a particular person is preferable to &quot;could have&quot; originated 
  from that person. The Report also recommends that: </p>
<p class="indent"> Evidence that shows only that an accused cannot be excluded 
  as the donor of an unknown hair (or only that an accused may or may not have 
  been the donor) is unlikely to have sufficient probative value to justify its 
  reception at a criminal trial as circumstantial evidence of guilt.</p>
<p> [84] Kaufman concluded at p. 323 that it was not appropriate for him &quot;to 
  articulate any hard and fast rules&quot; as to when hair comparison evidence 
  should be admitted in a criminal trial. I am not prepared to say that the type 
  1 comparison evidence should not have been admitted in the circumstances of 
  the other forensic evidence in this case.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  However, in my view, the jury should be instructed that Mr. Crocker's evidence 
  that certain hairs found at the crime scene are &quot;microscopically similar&quot; 
  to hairs donated by the accused is not to be taken as expert testimony that 
  the found hairs definitely came from the accused. The jury should further be 
  instructed that the inconclusiveness of this evidence is a matter of weight 
  for them to assess in the context of the other pieces of circumstantial evidence 
  relied on by the Crown. </p>
<p> [85] Fourth, as the trial judge properly did, the jury should be reminded 
  of the four hairs that yielded a DNA profile matching that of the accused as 
  well as the fifth hair that had a DNA profile matching his at three of four 
  loci. They should also be reminded of Ms. Johnston's testimony of the population 
  frequency statistics regarding DNA. And further, as the trial judge did in this 
  case, the members of the jury should be instructed to apply their own common 
  sense and good judgment in assessing this evidence. </p>
<p> [86] Fifth, the jury should be instructed that the presence on the body and 
  bed sheets of hair linked by DNA to the appellant had to be considered along 
  with the evidence that a number of head and body hairs that did not come from 
  either the victim or the appellant were also found on the victim's body and 
  her bedding. The trial judge should remind the jury of the number and location 
  of these hairs, as well as the expert's opinion on the type of such hairs, i.e., 
  whether they are body or scalp hairs. </p>
<p> [87] Sixth, with respect to the numerous hairs found in the apartment that 
  did not exhibit any similarities to the appellant's known hair samples, Mr. 
  Crocker could be permitted to give evidence regarding which of these hairs showed 
  a type 1 relationship to the other known donors of the hair samples, including 
  the deceased. For those hairs that showed a type 2 relationship to the other 
  known donors of the hair samples, Mr. Crocker should only be permitted to testify 
  that he cannot be certain who these hairs came from. For the remaining hairs, 
  he should simply be permitted to testify that these hairs were dissimilar to 
  all of the known hair samples. </p>
<p> [88] Finally, the record indicates that the jury had a chart that set out 
  the hair evidence in this case. The chart will of course need to be modified 
  in light of my decision. It is worth emphasizing that some sort of written aid, 
  preferably one that is less confusing than the one found on this record, is 
  required to help the jury in sorting out the admissible hair evidence in this 
  case. </p>
<p> Issue 3: Did the trial judge err in his charge in regard to identification 
  evidence and did he erroneously allow the jury to consider as evidence against 
  the appellant an identification which excluded the appellant from being the 
  person who was following the victim on the day before she was killed?</p>
<p> [89] This ground of appeal relates to the evidence of Dennis Morningstar, 
  a Crown witness with an extensive criminal record and a history of drug abuse. 
  Morningstar testified that on May 6, 1992, he saw the appellant holding Ms. 
  Ueberschlag's hand at a youth drop-in centre called Oasis. He also testified 
  that in the late afternoon or evening of May 7, 1992, Ms. Ueberschlag visited 
  him at his house on Waterloo St. and appeared to be scared and nervous. She 
  called a friend to pick her up. He testified that he saw the appellant standing 
  across the street, leaning against a post and wearing a Walkman. Morningstar 
  agreed with the proposition put to him in cross-examination that the man across 
  the street was &quot;clean shaven, no beard&quot;. However, the evidence of 
  the other trial witnesses was consistent that at the time in question, the appellant 
  had a beard. </p>
<p> [90] In his statement to police in July 1992, Morningstar mentioned having 
  seen the appellant at Oasis on May 6, but he did not mention having seen the 
  appellant outside his house on the following day. He first told police about 
  the May 7th sighting over four years later, in December 1996. At the preliminary 
  inquiry, he was not able to identify the appellant as being the man he saw standing 
  across the street on May 7, 1992. At trial, he identified the appellant as that 
  man. </p>
<p> [91] The Crown, in his closing address, conceded with respect to Morningstar 
  that &quot;there were obviously a number of huge gaps or errors in his evidence&quot; 
  and acknowledged that the jury may find his &quot;evidence to be totally worthless 
  in that sense, in terms of his identification&quot;. Crown counsel went on to 
  give several reasons for not rejecting his evidence out of hand, including that 
  Morningstar did not hear a lot of defence counsel's questions, that Morningstar 
  had mentioned seeing the appellant at Oasis in his July 1992 statement to police 
  and that he testified &quot;in this court that he was certain that that was 
  the man and said that he hadn't seen the beard because the man had his head 
  down across the way. But that that was the guy, and that as he walked away, 
  he turned his face back, and he recognized him.&quot;</p>
<p> [92] In the trial judge's charge to the jury, after bringing up the topic 
  of Morningstar's evidence, the trial judge warned the jury in general terms 
  of the dangers of identification evidence. He summarized Morningstar's testimony 
  and commented as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I am instructing you that you ought to be exceedingly careful 
  with respect to this evidence because I suggest it has a number of real concerns 
  to it. It is very easy to point to someone who is sitting in an enclosure in 
  the courtroom and say that is the man because you are picking out of a line 
  up of one. </p>
<p class="indent">On a previous occasion, this witness was unable to pick the 
  same man out in the same circumstances at a time that was closer to the event. 
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I would suggest that those are matters of real concern and, 
  in addition, he has sworn before you that the man across the street did not 
  have a beard. All of the evidence you had before you, as I appreciate it, is 
  that Mr. Bennett had a beard back in May of 1992. Where a witness describes 
  a person in a way inconsistent with a prominent feature of their appearance, 
  I would suggest to you that it is identification which is worth very, very little 
  and that you ought to be very cautious in accepting the rather bare assertion 
  of that is the man when he points to a line up of one here in the courtroom. 
  [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [93] Counsel for the appellant contends that the trial judge's charge was 
  inadequate because he did not instruct the jury that Morningstar's evidence 
  exonerated the appellant in the limited sense that his evidence indicated that 
  Ms. Ueberschlag appeared to be afraid of a black man other than the appellant 
  on the day before her death. Trial counsel had asked for such an instruction 
  during the pre-charge conference, relying on R. v. Chartier (1979), 9 C.R. (3d) 
  97 (S.C.C.). In Chartier at p. 138, Pigeon J. for the majority stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Appellant was not &quot;positively identified&quot; by 
  the witness Holland&#133;, since the latter said: &quot;I recognize him by his 
  posture, build, facial features, stomach, etc., but the only thing that is different 
  is that his hair was grey at the time of the incident.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">In order for this statement to be an identification, it would 
  have been necessary to establish that the Appellant had had grey hair at the 
  time of the incident, otherwise the witness Holland was not identifying the 
  Appellant, but rather exonerating him. Regardless of the number of similar characteristics, 
  if there is one dissimilar feature there is no identification. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [94] This Court in R. v. Boucher (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 52 at 57-8 applied 
  Chartier to conclude that a notable dissimilarity in identification evidence, 
  absent some other inculpatory evidence, renders the identification evidence 
  of a resemblance of no probative value. In Boucher, this Court quashed a committal 
  against three accused on charges of robbery and related offences. The Crown's 
  case depended on a nexus being shown between certain pants worn by one of the 
  robbers and the clothing worn by one of the accused on the day of the robbery. 
  If the description of the pants matched, the pants could provide the requisite 
  link to the robbery. However, the pants worn by the robber were described by 
  a bank customer as being all black, while the pants worn by the accused were 
  described by another witness as having a white stripe running the length of 
  the leg. At p. 58, Rosenberg J.A. stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> In view of the dissimilar feature of the pants, there was no 
  identification, merely a resemblance. In the absence of some other inculpatory 
  evidence, a resemblance is no evidence. If there were other inculpatory evidence 
  it may be that a trier of fact would have good reason for finding that the customer's 
  testimony was unreliable. Since there was no other evidence, the dissimilarity 
  at worst renders the resemblance of no probative value and possibly stands as 
  an exculpatory feature.</p>
<p> [95] In my view, the trial judge erred in leaving it open for the jury to 
  conclude that the appellant was the person Morningstar saw across the street 
  the day before Jennifer was killed. Morningstar's evidence that the man across 
  the street was &quot;clean shaven, no beard&quot; constitutes a notable dissimilarity 
  in the identification evidence. Again, quoting Boucher at p. 58, &quot;In the 
  absence of some other inculpatory evidence, a resemblance is no evidence&#133; 
  Since there was no other evidence, the dissimilarity at worst renders the resemblance 
  of no probative value and possibly stands as an exculpatory feature.&quot; </p>
<p> [96] There was no evidence other than Morningstar's testimony that the man 
  across the street was the appellant. Accordingly, the trial judge ought to have 
  instructed the jury that Morningstar's identification of the appellant was worthless, 
  not that it was &quot;worth very, very little&quot;. Further, the trial judge 
  ought to have instructed the jury that it was open to them to infer from Morningstar's 
  evidence that he had seen a clean-shaven black man, and not the appellant, standing 
  across the street on the day before the killing and that Jennifer appeared to 
  be afraid of that man. In fairness to the trial judge, the Boucher decision 
  was released after the trial took place.</p>
<p> Issue 4: Did the trial judge err in his charge in regard to after-the-fact 
  conduct by erroneously allowing the jury to use after-the-fact conduct evidence 
  against the appellant that was prejudicial and had little or no probative value? 
</p>
<p> [97] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in leaving with the 
  jury various items of after-the-fact conduct evidence from which they could 
  infer a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant. The first area 
  of evidence relates to the appellant's two statements to police, while the other 
  areas relate to the appellant's behaviour and reaction to various events after 
  the killing. </p>
<p> I. The Alibi Evidence</p>
<p> [98] Crown counsel led the appellant's two statements to police through his 
  examination-in-chief of Detective Close. The statements were introduced as exhibits 
  over defence counsel's objection. </p>
<p> [99] In the first statement, which was given in response to the police's expressed 
  intention of trying to rule out the appellant as a suspect, the appellant said 
  that the last time he talked to Jennifer was on Thursday [May 7]. He said that 
  he went to her house on Friday [May 8] with Dan [Stewart] and Justine [Meekison] 
  with a bottle of tequila and no one was there. They waited for half an hour 
  and no one showed up so they left. He tried to call her Friday night, a few 
  times on Saturday and once on Sunday afternoon but there was no answer. He went 
  to Elora Gorge with the kids [whom he lived with] on Sunday. On the afternoon 
  of May 10, Nicole Rowe had called him and asked if he had seen Jennifer. He 
  told her that he last talked to Jennifer on Thursday and that he had not seen 
  her since. He said he then got kind of worried about her and so he phoned a 
  mutual friend, Michelle, to ask if she had seen her. She said that she thought 
  she saw Jennifer on the bus headed for Fairview [a shopping mall] on Friday 
  but she wasn't sure. He called Rowe and told her this and that was the last 
  he heard until he heard her address on the radio.</p>
<p> [100] In response to police questioning about when he was at Jennifer's apartment 
  on Friday, he indicated that &quot;it was still light - 7 or 7:30, I'm not sure&quot;. 
  He was asked what he did after leaving the apartment and replied, &quot;We came 
  here [the home on Mill Street] and we drank for a bit. We went and dropped Dan 
  and Justine off at Wizards and I came back here.&quot; He said that this was 
  &quot;at 9:30-10&quot;. </p>
<p> [101] After responding negatively to the question if he ever had sexual relations 
  with Jennifer, the appellant said &quot;An hour or so later I went back down 
  to Wizards to find Chris Corbett. She lives at the Y too. I didn't find Chris, 
  so I talked to Justine for a while and then I came back here about 11:30-12.&quot; 
  He was asked if he had ever been in Jennifer's apartment and he replied &quot;Ya, 
  a couple of times.&quot; Finally, he was asked if he knew who would want to 
  kill Jennifer and he replied that he had &quot;no idea&#133; she seemed alright 
  to me.&quot;</p>
<p> [102] The appellant's second statement was given at police headquarters after 
  the police told him that he was still a suspect and in response to their request 
  that he alibi himself from Friday morning until Sunday evening. The appellant 
  wrote that he got up Friday at about 8:30 to get the kids he had been watching 
  off to school and then went back to sleep until about 1 p.m. He watched TV most 
  of the afternoon, got supper ready, cleaned up around the house until about 
  7 and went to Fairview Mall to see Michelle. They went to a friend of her's 
  house until about 8 or 8:30. He left and went downtown to the pool hall (Wizards), 
  where he saw Justine and Dan and asked if they wanted to get drunk because he 
  had tequila. They went to the park where he and Dan drank, but they left because 
  there were too many cops. They went to Jen's house, he knocked, but there was 
  no answer so they sat in the car for awhile. A man he had seen before [this 
  was Jennifer's landlord] offered them pizza and asked a lot of questions. So 
  they left and went to the house where he was staying, drank some more, and then 
  he dropped them off at Wizards. He then went to his friend Bozer's house on 
  Waterloo St., but no one was home. He returned to the pool hall and stayed for 
  about 15 minutes and then went home and watched T.V. the rest of the night. 
  He stayed around the house all day Saturday and Saturday night and went to bed 
  at about 10 p.m. because he, the kids and Miz [Mitsy Roy] were to go to Elora 
  on Sunday. They got up at 4 a.m. and left the house at 7 a.m. and got back at 
  1:30 p.m. He went to sleep until supper at 8 p.m. </p>
<p> [103] A comparison of the two statements reveals some minor differences in 
  the appellant's version of his whereabouts on Friday May 8, 1992. He indicated 
  in the first statement that he went to Jennifer's apartment when it was &quot;still 
  light&quot;, around 7 or 7:30. In contrast, in the second statement he did not 
  give a time when he arrived at her apartment, but his chronology indicates that 
  it was some time after 8 or 8:30. In addition, in the first statement the appellant 
  said that he went to the pool hall to find Chris Corbett, but he did not refer 
  to this in his second statement. In the second statement, the appellant said 
  that he went to his friend Bozer's house, which he had not mentioned in the 
  first statement. Finally, in the first statement he told police that he returned 
  home at about 11:30-12, whereas in the second statement, he did not indicate 
  what time he went home. </p>
<p> [104] The trial judge in his charge to the jury stated there were various 
  items of evidence of things done by the appellant from which the Crown was urging 
  them to draw an inference of guilt, one of which involved the discrepancies 
  in the appellant's two statements regarding his whereabouts on the evening of 
  May 8th. The trial judge described the Crown's position on the significance 
  of the statements as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Crown says that the explanations by Mr. Bennett for his 
  whereabouts on the evening of May 8 are different in those two statements. The 
  Crown argues that the inconsistency in the explanations is such that at least 
  one of them cannot be true. The Crown argues that at least one of them is therefore 
  a deliberate falsehood as to his whereabouts during the evening of the killing 
  and the Crown argues that is something from which you can infer guilt because 
  the Crown says it is more likely that a guilty person would lie about his whereabouts 
  than would an innocent person. </p>
<p> [105] After going over the gist of the statements, the trial judge gave the 
  following instruction: </p>
<p class="indent"> If, having regard to all of these circumstances, you are satisfied 
  that Mr. Bennett was deliberately fabricating or concocting a false alibi in 
  making these statements to the police, and if you are also satisfied that this 
  fabrication or concoction emanated from a sense of guilt for the crime on his 
  part, then you would be entitled to consider that as circumstantial evidence 
  of involvement.</p>
<p> [106] The trial judge stressed that disbelief of the alibi evidence is not 
  proof of concoction. He told the jury that the Crown must prove deliberate concoction. 
  He also told them to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the creation 
  of the statements, whether there were material inconsistencies between them 
  and if so, whether the inconsistencies were deliberate or innocent. He finished 
  his instruction on this point as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is only if you are satisfied that the evidence is actually 
  concocted, that is deliberately fabricated, that you would be entitled to draw 
  an inference of guilt from that evidence.</p>
<p> [107] Appellant's counsel argued that the appellant did not give himself an 
  alibi in the sense of being with someone else at the time of the murder. Counsel 
  further argued that, considering the Crown's theory was that the killing took 
  place at approximately 11:55 p.m. on the Friday night, the appellant did not 
  give himself a clear alibi in either statement because he left open the possibility 
  that he was out on the town at the time of the murder. In the first statement, 
  the appellant placed himself at home at &quot;around 11:30-12&quot;, while in 
  the second statement, he did not give a time when he got home. </p>
<p> [108] While I accept that the appellant did not give himself a strong alibi 
  in the sense of being with someone else at the time of the killing, or being 
  in a location far removed from the scene of the crime at the critical time, 
  I would agree with the respondent that the appellant did give an alibi in the 
  sense that his statements indicate that he was not at the crime scene at the 
  time of the murder. </p>
<p> [109] Counsel for the appellant went on to argue that even if the statements 
  could be taken as providing an alibi, the jury ought to have been told that 
  they could not infer guilt from the statements because there was no extrinsic 
  evidence of concoction in this case. Counsel pointed to a series of cases from 
  this Court, which he says establish that the issue of concoction in connection 
  with an alibi should only be raised when there is extrinsic evidence that the 
  alibi has been concocted, citing R. v. Coutts (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545, leave 
  to appeal refused [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450 ; R. v. Krishantharajah (1999), 133 
  C.C.C. (3d) 157; R. v. Campbell (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 258; R. v. Wristen (1999), 
  141 C.C.C. (3d) 1, leave to appeal refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 419; R. v. Price 
  (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 343; R. v. Diu (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 481; R. v. Blazeiko 
  (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 557; and R. v. O'Connor (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 263. </p>
<p> [110] The respondent submits that there was no need to adduce extrinsic evidence 
  of concoction in this case because Crown counsel was relying on a material inconsistency 
  between the two statements, citing the decisions of this Court in R. v. Ruddick 
  (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 421 at 440, leave to appeal to refused (1981) 57 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 421n (S.C.C.); R. v. Andrade (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 41 at 66-69; and R. 
  v. McInnis (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 515 at 533-534. </p>
<p> [111] The cases cited by the appellant draw a distinction between statements 
  made by an accused which are disbelieved and therefore rejected and statements 
  that can be found to have been concocted in an effort to avoid conviction. The 
  former have no evidentiary value, while the latter can constitute circumstantial 
  evidence of guilt. In Coutts, supra, Doherty J.A. observed at p. 551 that this 
  distinction is: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; essential to ensure that the trier of fact properly 
  applies the burden of proof in cases where statements of an accused are tendered 
  or an accused testifies. If triers of fact were routinely told that they could 
  infer concoction from disbelief and use that finding of concoction as evidence 
  of guilt, it would be far too easy to equate disbelief of an accused's version 
  of events with guilt and to proceed automatically from disbelief of an accused 
  to a guilty verdict. That line of reasoning ignores the Crown's obligation to 
  prove an accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. By limiting resort to concoction 
  as a separate piece of circumstantial evidence to situations where there is 
  evidence of concoction apart from evidence which contradicts or discredits the 
  version of events advanced by the accused, the law seeks to avoid convictions 
  founded ultimately on the disbelief of the accused's version of events. [emphasis 
  added; citations omitted.]</p>
<p> Doherty J.A. went on to hold that a jury should only be instructed that they 
  may find that an accused's statement is concocted and, therefore, capable of 
  constituting circumstantial evidence of guilt, where there is some evidence 
  of actual concoction. </p>
<p> [112] In the case at bar, the differences between the two statements in this 
  case, as even Crown counsel acknowledged in his closing address to the jury, 
  were slight. The Crown in his closing treated the inconsistency as being that 
  the appellant mentioned going to Bozer's place only in his second statement: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> And his alibi, if you will, is slightly different. Not a huge 
  difference, but his whereabouts are clearly differentiate&#133; different to 
  a certain extent from the one statement to the other in that he has himself 
  going to Waterloo Street to look for his friend, Bozer, in the second statement, 
  which hadn't been in the first statement. </p>
<p> [113] On appeal, the Crown now contends that the inconsistency lies in the 
  fact that in the first statement, the appellant potentially had himself out 
  on the town at 11:30-12, and thus he would have had the opportunity to kill 
  the victim, whereas in the second statement, he tightened up the timing to have 
  himself home earlier. I cannot agree with this interpretation. In his second 
  statement, the appellant gave no indication of the timing of his whereabouts 
  any time after 8:30 p.m. on the night of the murder. He said that &quot;he went 
  home and watched TV for the rest of the night&quot;, but did not try to pin 
  down when he returned home on the night of the killing. </p>
<p> [114] In his charge, the trial judge said on several occasions that the Crown's 
  position was that the two accounts were different. However, the trial judge 
  did not attempt to indicate to the jury the nature of the inconsistency between 
  the two statements. Instead, he left it for the jury to determine whether there 
  was any inconsistency, and if so, whether it was material. </p>
<p> [115] In my view, if an instruction permitting a jury to find concoction and 
  to infer guilt based on that finding is to be given, the trial judge is required 
  to identify for the jury what inconsistency in the accused's statements could 
  warrant a finding of concoction. The inconsistency must be compelling in the 
  sense, for example, that there is an indication that the accused was attempting 
  to mislead investigators by fabricating an alibi. As Martin J.A. stated in R. 
  v. Andrade, supra, at p. 67: &quot;the giving of contradictory statements by 
  an accused with respect to his whereabouts at the critical time may in some 
  circumstances constitute evidence upon which the jury is entitled to find that 
  one or both statements are fabricated&quot;. </p>
<p> [116] The trial judge, in my view, erred in instructing the jury that they 
  were entitled to find that the appellant had fabricated an alibi, and that it 
  was open to them to infer guilt from his two statements. The slight differences 
  between his statements were not capable of warranting a finding of concoction. 
  While the trial judge could have told the jury that any differences in the two 
  statements was a factor they could take into account in deciding whether to 
  believe either of them, there was no basis for instructing them that they could 
  go further and use the statements as a separate piece of circumstantial evidence 
  from which guilt could be inferred. Rather, the jury ought to have been told 
  that if they disbelieved the alibi, they should simply discard that evidence, 
  without more: see R. v. Hibbert (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at paras. 
  61 and 67.</p>

<p> II. Other After-the-Fact Conduct Evidence</p>
<p> [117] The appellant identified six other items of after-the-fact conduct that 
  the trial judge left with the jury as being evidence from which the Crown asked 
  them to infer guilt. The items of evidence were: the appellant's anger at a 
  neighbour for telling police that he thought the appellant was capable of killing 
  Jennifer; the appellant telling Nicole Rowe that Jennifer was seen going to 
  a mall on the afternoon of her death; his failure to make certain phone calls 
  upon learning of Jennifer's death; his failure to ask police if Jennifer was 
  the victim; his desire to have copies of statements made to police by his acquaintainces, 
  Justina Meekison and Dan Stewart; and his reaction to the report that police 
  had found a silver letter opener that was missing from Jennifer's apartment. 
</p>
<p> [118] In my view, the trial judge should not have left three of these items 
  of evidence with the jury as evidence from which they could infer consciousness 
  of guilt: the appellant's anger at being described as someone capable of killing 
  the victim, his failure to make certain phone calls and his failure to ask police 
  if Jennifer was the victim. These forms of conduct are examples of demeanour 
  evidence that is highly suspect and easily misinterpreted. Regarding the remaining 
  items, the trial judge erred in not instructing the jury more fully on the limitations 
  of this evidence and in what circumstances it is permissible to draw an inference 
  of consciousness of guilt from it. </p>
<p> [119] Given the importance of this evidence in the context of the Crown's 
  circumstantial case against the appellant, I will describe in some detail the 
  impugned areas of evidence. I then set out the trial Crown's closing arguments 
  to the jury in regard to each, as well as the trial judge's instructions on 
  the use that the jury could make of this evidence. </p>
<p>i) Anger at being described by Doug Hiltz as someone who could kill </p>
<p>[120] The Crown witness, Doug Hiltz, lived across the street from the home 
  where the appellant was staying and he also knew Ms. Ueberschlag. Hiltz testified 
  to having two encounters with the appellant after Jennifer's death. The first 
  was on May 12, 1992. That day, the police arrived at Hiltz's house and questioned 
  him. Hiltz told the police that he thought the appellant was capable of killing 
  Jennifer. The appellant, who had seen the police across the street, came over 
  to ask Hiltz what he told them. Hiltz testified that the appellant got upset 
  when Hiltz told him what he said, and then left. </p>
<p> [121] The second encounter occurred a week or two later. Hiltz testified that 
  there had been rumours circulating down town that he was telling people that 
  the appellant had killed Jennifer. The appellant confronted Hiltz about the 
  rumours and told him that once it was all done and over with, he and Hiltz were 
  going to have a talk and it was not going to be a friendly talk.</p>
<p> [122] The Crown in closing said the following about the evidence of the appellant's 
  conduct towards Doug Hiltz: </p>
<p class="indent"> And you look at how he approached Doug Hiltz, a fellow he'd 
  drunk tequila with the day before, when he knows that the police were over there 
  and&#133;and Hiltz candidly said well sure he'd be mad at me. I said anybody's 
  capable of a homicide. But then later, when he hears Hiltz may have been starting 
  rumours, he says well we're going to&#133;we're going to talk about this later, 
  and it's not going to be nice.</p>
<p> [123] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge repeated Hiltz's evidence 
  regarding his two encounters with the appellant and instructed them as follows: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> It is for you to say whether these things were said and, if 
  so, what importance, if any, attaches to them. Take all the circumstances into 
  account. Question the reasonableness of the reactions attributed to Mr. Bennett.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this evidence is for you to consider. I must say I would 
  suggest, in my submission to you, it is not very hard to understand why someone 
  would be upset if the police had been told by a neighbour of theirs that well, 
  he might have done it because anybody can do it if they have their buttons pushed, 
  and anyone might be upset if they find out somebody else has been spreading 
  rumours about them being involved in a killing.</p>
<p class="indent">It may well be that not only anybody might be upset by these 
  things. It may well be that an innocent person would be more upset than a guilty 
  one. These are all matters for you to consider and upon which to apply your 
  good sense and judgment.</p>
<p>ii) Conversation about Ms. Ueberschlag going to a mall </p>
<p>[124] Nicole Rowe testified that on the Sunday after Jennifer's death and before 
  her body was found, she paged the appellant to ask if he had heard from Jennifer. 
  The appellant called her about fifteen minutes later and said that he went by 
  to drop off a television for Jennifer on Friday at around 7 p.m. and that no 
  one answered. In response to questions put to her in cross-examination, Rowe 
  recalled the appellant telling her that he had heard from Michelle that she 
  thought she had seen Jennifer on a bus going to the mall. Rowe admitted that 
  the conversation about Michelle could have occurred in a second phone call, 
  but she remembered it being in the same call. She testified that the appellant 
  did not tell her anything more about Michelle, or what her last name was, or 
  who she was. </p>
<p> [125] Michelle Klobucar, another Crown witness, was a friend of the appellant's 
  who testified that she had never known of Jennifer and that the appellant had 
  not called her to ask if she had seen her. </p>
<p> [126] In his closing address, Crown counsel said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Was that just an instance of Bennett feigning, faking, an interest 
  in Jennifer to let it appear that he was concerned for her well being and making 
  the inquiries that Nicole Rowe would so obviously want him to do, and that this 
  call back in regard to talking to a mutual friend was merely to convince Nicole 
  of that fact?</p>
<p class="indent">Because if Bennett was the killer, of course, he already knew 
  that Jennifer was dead. And so this would be pure pretext.</p>
<p> [127] The trial judge discussed the Crown's position on this evidence and 
  instructed the jury as follows on how to use it: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Crown asks you to infer that Mr. Bennett was lying when 
  he allegedly told Nicole Rowe when she called him on the Sunday afternoon that 
  he had talked to some girl named Michelle who said she had seen Jen going towards 
  Fairview mall on a bus on the Friday. The Crown's position is that this Michelle 
  must be Michelle Klobucar and that Michelle Klobucar did not testify to any 
  such conversation with Mr. Bennett but rather said that when she spoke to him 
  on the Saturday, he did not have much time to speak to her and sort of brushed 
  her off.</p>
<p class="indent">It is for you to say whether or not these remarks were made. 
  It is for you to say what weight, if any, to attach to them. The Crown's requested 
  inference is that Mr. Bennett said this just to sort of throw everybody off 
  the track and make him look as though he was concerned when in fact he had been 
  the killer.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not know what benefit there would be to telling somebody 
  that you had been told that Jen was seen during the day Friday when that is 
  before the time of the murder. It does not seem relevant in terms of trying 
  to suggest to anyone that that means the murder did not occur or anything like 
  that.</p>
<p class="indent">These are matters that you are asked to consider and that you 
  are asked to use as a basis upon which to draw an inference. As I have said 
  now several times, consider all of the circumstances and my instructions to 
  you on how to handle circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>iii) Failure to make certain phone calls </p>
<p> [128] In his closing, Crown counsel said the following about the appellant's 
  failure to telephone certain people upon learning of Jennifer's death: </p>
<p class="indent"> And in terms of his reaction, does it make a great deal of 
  sense when Nicole Rowe had phoned him up asking if he has some&#133;seen Jennifer 
  around, when Bulldog had asked him to look after Jen? And my friend brought 
  out in cross-examination that he could have found out Bulldog's phone number 
  and that type of thing, that he doesn't talk to Nicole Rowe again after that, 
  doesn't say what happened Nicole? Or I just found out, this is terrible. Or 
  that he doesn't call Bulldog and let him know what's happened, the fellow that 
  introduced them, and the fellow who asked him to look after Jennifer, and he 
  makes no reference to that? Does that seem at all logical?</p>
<p> [129] The trial judge dealt with this evidence in his charge as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Lastly, the Crown argues that the accused man did not act appropriately 
  after the death by not phoning certain people, for instance, Bulldog, who was 
  as you will know Jen's street dad before he moved to Chatsworth, and the inference 
  you are asked to make is that it would be reasonable that Mr. Bennett would 
  have called Bulldog, that Mr. Bennett would have called Nicole Rowe, that Mr. 
  Bennett would have asked people about what had happened. </p>
<p class="indent">Those are all matters for you to consider. Consider, on the 
  basis of the evidence you have, what reasonable inferences arise, if any, from 
  such evidence. Consider whether or not any explanation suggests itself to you 
  from all of the circumstances. Again, it is for you to say what, if any, inferences 
  you are prepared to draw from such evidence, but you should only do so if in 
  your view the requested inference is a reasonable one arising from all of the 
  evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">You will bear in mind that a person might, when faced with circumstances 
  such as you may feel were facing Mr. Bennett at the time, namely that it is 
  clear that in respect to some of these matters he by that time had been questioned 
  by police, indicated that he was a suspect, told that he was not believed. It 
  may well be that there are some elements of panic or embarrassment or fear of 
  false accusation or some other such considerations that should be taken into 
  account. </p>

<p> iv) Utterances to the police on May 11, 1992 </p>
<p> [130] Crown counsel in his closing attached much significance to the appellant's 
  reaction to a call from Detective Close on Monday May 11, 1992 advising that 
  he would like to talk to the appellant about the death of a friend of his, the 
  identity of whom he testified he did not disclose over the phone. Crown counsel 
  asked the jury to infer guilt because, although the appellant asked Det. Close 
  who the deceased was, he did not ask specifically whether it was Jennifer. Counsel's 
  argument on the point is quite lengthy, but particularly significant are the 
  following passages: </p>
<p class="indent"> When a police officer calls you up and says I want to talk 
  to you about the death of a friend of yours, well that narrows the indeterminate 
  class presumably to friends. And if Bennett was concerned about Jen, as he indicated 
  in his statement to the police, if he called her Saturday, had called her Friday, 
  and now you're getting a call from Sunday night from somebody that obviously 
  wouldn't be particularly fond of you, Nicole Rowe, who's asking if he's seen 
  her, and obviously worried about her, and he says he's worried, what would the 
  first reaction be when a police officer calls? It's not Jennifer. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">But wouldn't you at least twig to that and say something, please 
  don't tell me it's Jennifer? I've been worried about her. Her friend, Nicole's 
  worried about her. Unless you already knew exactly who it was. &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">But the lack of curiosity on his part as to what happened to 
  her seems inconceivable. &#133; Wouldn't you want to know something about what 
  happened? The police are calling you about the death of a friend of yours. What 
  would be the first and most logical thing you would want to ask? What happened? 
</p>
<p> [131] The trial judge instructed the jury on the use of this evidence as follows: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> As with the written statements, it is for you to determine 
  whether these things were said. It is for you to determine, if said, whether 
  there is anything about them that warrants the drawing of any inference as requested 
  by the Crown. In so considering, take into account any explanation which in 
  your view reasonably arises from the evidence, having regard to all of the circumstances. 
  It is for you to say what weight, if any, is to be attached to this evidence.</p>

<p> v) Appellant's desire to have copies of statements made to police by Meekison 
  and Stewart </p>
<p>[132] Justina Meekison testified that the appellant approached her and said 
  he wanted to get a copy of the statements that she and Dan Stewart had given 
  to police. She recalled telling the appellant that he was able to see the statements 
  from his lawyer.<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> She further recalled the 
  appellant saying that his lawyer needed the statements from her because the 
  police could change what she had said. She testified that the appellant told 
  her that he didn't do it and the only reason he was a suspect was because he 
  had charges against him. </p>
<p> [133] Crown counsel said the following about this encounter to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> And Bennett's been told that Meekison supports his story, and 
  he's been asked by the police officers to flesh out the rest of the weekend. 
  We need to alibi you for the rest of the weekend. So why does he go back to 
  Meekison on May the 20th in order to get her statement to the police, and that 
  of her boyfriend, Dan Stewart? Why focus on her? Because the killer knows that 
  the important time is Friday night, Saturday morning. Not Saturday. Not Sunday. 
</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> But when Bennett's been told that you're okay, Ms. Meekison 
  supports your story. She thinks you're a good guy on the&#133;when they come 
  to talk to him on May 14th, why go back and talk to her? Why worry about the 
  police changing his statement? She says to him, well can't your lawyer get this? 
  He says, well no, I have to, the police could change it around, presumably to 
  suit their purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">Why go back to her unless he's really worried about the people 
  he's with Friday night, and not to Russell, whom he&#133;could alibi him for 
  Saturday and Sunday as well, unless he knew when Jennifer was killed?</p>
<p> [134] In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown asked them 
  to draw an inference adverse to the accused based on the evidence that he asked 
  Meekison for copies of her statements to the police and those of her boyfriend 
  Stewart. He repeated Meekison's evidence and then instructed the jury as follows: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> It is for you to say whether these things were said. It is 
  for you to consider all of the circumstances, consider any explanations that 
  arise as to why things might be said. It is for you to determine whether these 
  comments mean anything or merit the drawing of any inference.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; You may well be of the view that it is not surprising 
  that Mr. Bennett would want to see what a witness or witnesses has told the 
  police about an event in which he is alleged to have been involved, given that 
  the police had already told him that they did not believe his denial.</p>
<p class="indent">These are matters for you to consider and upon which to apply 
  your good judgment and common sense. You are entitled to draw the requested 
  inference if you think it to be a reasonable one, having considered all of the 
  circumstances.</p>
<p>vi) Letter Opener </p>
<p> [135] Following the murder, rumours were circulating in the community that 
  the victim's silver letter opener with a grim reaper on the handle, which was 
  missing from her apartment, was the murder weapon. A photo of a similar letter 
  opener was in the local newspaper on June 23, 1992. The missing letter opener 
  was never recovered. </p>
<p> [136] In August 1992, police purchased a similar letter opener. They showed 
  a photograph of it to Renee Biddiscombe, the appellant's girlfriend at the time 
  of the murder, who was fifteen years old and heavily addicted to crack cocaine 
  and heroin. Police informed Ms. Biddiscombe that they were investigating the 
  murder of Jennifer Ueberschlag and told her that the appellant was the prime 
  suspect in the killing. Police asked if she had seen the letter opener in the 
  appellant's possession. They also told her that the appellant was married and 
  showed her a copy of his marriage license. </p>
<p> [137] Ms. Biddiscombe testified that she was upset to learn that the appellant 
  was married. She also testified that she assumed the letter opener was the murder 
  weapon and confronted the appellant. She told him that the police thought he 
  was the prime suspect in the killing and that they showed her the photo of a 
  letter opener with a grim reaper handle. His response was that the police were 
  trying to frame him and break them up. </p>
<p> [138] Ms. Biddiscombe further testified that one morning in November 1992, 
  when &quot;she was very strung out&quot;, police stopped her and showed her 
  a grim reaper letter opener in what looked like an evidence bag. They asked 
  if she had seen it before, and she said only in the photo that they had shown 
  her before. Police told her that the victim &quot;didn't die pretty&quot;. </p>
<p> [139] Ms. Biddiscombe said she was upset and went to see the appellant, who 
  was in jail on unrelated charges. She told him that the police had shown her 
  the letter opener. Ms. Biddiscombe testified that after telling the appellant 
  this, he replied &quot;how the fuck did they find that, how the fuck did they 
  find that?&quot;, looked very shocked and became agitated. She asked him if 
  he didn't do it, why was he so upset and he remarked that the police &quot;are 
  trying to frame me and, now they've found that, now they can.&quot; </p>
<p> [140] The Crown in his closing referred to Renee Biddiscombe's evidence as 
  &quot;perhaps the most important evidence of all&quot; and, later, as &quot;absolutely 
  a critical piece of evidence&quot;. He went into considerable detail in his 
  closing about this evidence, but the most pertinent passages are the following: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> But it's Mr. Bennett's reaction that's critical to this. What 
  he does is he goes how the fuck did they find that? How the fuck did they find 
  that? Not, where did they find that. For somebody who might have been worried 
  about being framed for something he didn't do, it's a pretty significant distinction. 
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">He says how the fuck did they find that? In other words, I thought 
  I'd hidden it so well, it was gone forever. How the fuck did they find that?</p>
<p class="indent">Now, why would anybody make the link between the finding of 
  the letter opener, and him being in trouble, and him being framed, unless they 
  knew what the link was? Why would he automatically assume that the finding of 
  the letter opener would in any way shape or form, connect him to the crime, 
  unless he had taken it and he knew its significance&#133;</p>
<p> [141] The trial judge put to the jury the Crown's position that the appellant's 
  reaction supported the inference that he had taken the letter opener and hidden 
  it. He also repeated the defence position that there was nothing to this evidence 
  given the rumours on the street that the letter opener was supposedly tied in 
  with the killing and that the appellant had said to people on many occasions 
  that he was worried about being framed by the police. The trial judge then said: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> These are all matters for you to consider. Consider all of 
  the circumstances. Consider what inferences reasonably arise from those circumstances 
  and be careful in drawing inferences in the sense that you are taking that extra 
  step of making sure that the inference you are requested to draw is indeed a 
  reasonable one arising from the circumstances. </p>
<p>Analysis of the Charge on the After-the-Fact Conduct Evidence</p>
<p> [142] Counsel for the appellant submits that if the trial judge had left only 
  some of this after-the-fact conduct evidence to the jury, his error might have 
  been harmless in isolation. However, in leaving all these items to the jury 
  as evidence from which they could infer consciousness of guilt, the cumulative 
  effect was highly prejudicial, particularly in a case where the Crown's case 
  was entirely circumstantial. </p>
<p> [143] The respondent acknowledges that the first and third items of evidence 
  relied on by Crown counsel as circumstantial evidence of guilt were weak arguments 
  (ie., the appellant's anger at being described by Doug Hiltz as someone who 
  could kill and his failure to make certain telephone calls) and that the reliance 
  on the fourth item was a doubtful argument (ie., the appellant's failure to 
  ask police if Jennifer was the victim in the May 11th phone conversation). According 
  to the respondent, it was open for the Crown to argue and for the jury to conclude 
  that the remaining items of evidence constituted evidence of consciousness of 
  guilt. </p>
<p> [144] The trial judge did not have the benefit of this Court's recent decisions 
  on consciousness of guilt evidence in R. v. Diu (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 481, 
  R. v. Levert (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 71 and R. v. Baltrusaitis (2002), 162 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 539. In Diu, Sharpe J.A. observed at p. 519 that, &quot;it has long been 
  recognized that in certain circumstances, the conduct of an accused after a 
  crime has been committed may provide circumstantial evidence of the accused's 
  culpability with respect to that crime&quot;. He went on to state at p. 520 
  that &quot;it has also been repeatedly recognized that evidence of after-the-fact 
  conduct is often highly ambiguous&#133; There is often a serious risk that the 
  jury may fail to consider alternative explanations for the after-the-fact conduct 
  and erroneously infer guilt&quot;. Sharpe J.A. concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is, therefore, important for the trial judge to ensure, 
  by careful jury instructions, that the jury does not misuse the evidence. Accordingly, 
  there is a well-developed body of jurisprudence to the effect &quot;that juries 
  be carefully instructed that there may be alternative explanations for the accused's 
  conduct and that, in such cases, the accused's conduct is not capable of supporting 
  an inference of consciousness of guilt.&quot; See Jenkins, supra, at p. 471 
  [(1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.)].</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the trial judge should instruct the jury that the 
  evidence of the accused's after-the-fact conduct has only an indirect bearing 
  upon the issue of guilt, and that the jury should exercise caution in inferring 
  guilt because the conduct might be explained in an alternative manner: Arcangioli, 
  supra, at pp. 299-300 [(1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289], citing Gudmondson v. The 
  King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.). The trial judge should also instruct the 
  jury that the evidence of the accused's after-the-fact conduct can only be used 
  to support an inference of guilt where they have rejected any innocent explanation 
  for the conduct: Peavoy, supra, at p. 238 [(1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. 
  C.A.)].</p>
<p> [145] In Baltrusaitis, supra, the Court considered whether the trial judge 
  erred in leaving with the jury evidence of the accused's demeanour on learning 
  of his brother's death, his failure to ask questions about the circumstances 
  of the death and his failure to inform police of a recent meeting with his brother, 
  as after-the-fact conduct capable of supporting an inference of guilt. Moldaver 
  J.A. wrote at pp. 561-2: </p>
<p class="indent"> I agree with the appellant that the three impugned items of 
  evidence should not have been left to the jury as after-the-fact evidence capable 
  of supporting an inference of guilt because the probative value of this type 
  of evidence is highly suspect and easily misinterpreted. The point was recently 
  addressed by this court in R. v. Levert (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 71 (Ont. C.A.), 
  at p. 81 where Rosenberg J.A. stated as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The probative value of this type of evidence [unusually calm 
  reaction by the accused upon being confronted with an allegation of sexual abuse] 
  is highly suspect. In the two recent cases of Susan Nelles and Guy Paul Morin 
  use of the accused's demeanour was found to have played a part in the wrongful 
  prosecution. The Report of the Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul 
  Morin, (1998), Vol. 2, pp. 1142 to 1150, contains an extensive discussion of 
  the dangers of admitting such demeanour evidence. The expert and other evidence 
  introduced at the Commission strongly suggests that this evidence can be highly 
  suspect and should be admitted at a criminal trial with caution. Perceptions 
  of guilt based on demeanour are likely to depend upon highly subjective impressions 
  that may be difficult to convey to the jury and in any event the significance 
  of the reaction will often be equivocal.</p>
<p class="indent">(footnotes omitted)</p>
<p class="indent">The concerns expressed by Rosenberg J.A. apply with equal force 
  to this case. In my view, rather than leaving the impugned items of evidence 
  to the jury as evidence capable of supporting an inference of guilt, the trial 
  judge should have told the jury to ignore them. With respect, his failure to 
  so instruct the jury constituted error. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [146] As explained in Diu, it has long been recognized that the accused's 
  after-the-fact conduct can give rise to a circumstantial inference of guilt; 
  however, it is incumbent on the trial judge to ensure by careful instruction 
  that the jury does not misuse such evidence. Moreover, as explained in Levert 
  and Baltrusaitis, there are some types of post-offence conduct evidence that 
  the trial judge is required to remove from the jury's consideration altogether. 
</p>
<p> [147] In my view, as I stated earlier, the trial judge should not have left 
  the following items of demeanour evidence with the jury as being capable of 
  supporting an inference of guilt: the appellant's anger at being described as 
  someone who could kill, the appellant's failure to call certain people after 
  Jennifer's killing and the appellant's failure to ask police if the victim was 
  Jennifer. The trial judge ought to have told the jury that these items of evidence 
  were not capable of supporting the inference of guilt urged by the Crown and 
  that they should ignore them. These items of demeanour evidence are of the type 
  that this Court in Levert and Baltrusaitis described as having highly suspect 
  probative value and are easily misinterpreted.</p>
<p> [148] With respect to the remaining items of after-the-fact conduct evidence, 
  in my view, it was open to the trial judge to leave these items with the jury. 
  However, the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury that the after-the-fact 
  conduct evidence relied on by the Crown has only an indirect bearing upon the 
  issue of guilt, and that the jury should exercise caution in inferring guilt 
  because the conduct might be explained in an alternative manner. In addition, 
  he ought to have instructed the jury that they must not use this conduct to 
  support an inference of guilt unless they rejected any innocent explanation 
  for the conduct: Diu, supra.</p>
<p> [149] Such a carefully worded instruction was required because two of the 
  three remaining items of evidence had limited probative value on the issue of 
  the identity of the killer. Regarding the evidence that the appellant asked 
  for copies of Meekison and Stewart's statements to police, Crown counsel's argument 
  was that the appellant asked Meekison for her statement because he knew that 
  the important time was Friday night. The Crown's argument ignores that Meekison 
  and Stewart were not providing an alibi for the appellant at the time of the 
  killing, but only for earlier that evening. Moreover, there was no evidence 
  to the effect that the appellant was asking Meekison to change her story or 
  to assist him in providing an alibi for the time of the killing. While there 
  may be some probative value in the appellant's act of asking a witness for statements 
  made to police, in my view, the trial judge needed to more carefully instruct 
  the jury on the limitations of this evidence as a basis for drawing the inference 
  requested by the Crown. It was not enough to simply instruct the jury that they 
  were entitled to draw the requested inference if they thought it was a reasonable 
  one. </p>
<p> [150] The trial judge indicated in his charge that the appellant's statement 
  about someone named Michelle having possibly seen Jennifer on the bus going 
  to Fairview Mall on Friday afternoon was of questionable relevance to the identity 
  of the killer. The trial judge nonetheless left it as evidence for the jury 
  to consider and to decide whether to draw the inference that the appellant was 
  trying to look concerned when in fact he was the killer. In my view, the jury 
  should again have been told to be very cautious in drawing this inference, particularly 
  considering that it had not been established which &quot;Michelle&quot; the 
  appellant was referring to in his statement to police and considering that it 
  was clearly established that Jennifer was alive at the time of the reported 
  trip to the mall. </p>
<p> [151] The evidence of the appellant's reaction to the finding of the letter 
  opener was characterized by Crown counsel as being perhaps the most important 
  piece of evidence and absolutely critical to its case. In my view, it was incumbent 
  on the trial judge to carefully instruct the jury of the need for caution in 
  using this evidence to draw an inference of guilt. The trial judge repeated 
  to the jury the defence position that an innocent explanation of the evidence 
  of the appellant's reaction was available given the widespread (albeit erroneous) 
  rumours that the letter opener was the murder weapon and in light of his belief 
  that the police were trying to frame him for the killing. The trial judge ought 
  to have gone further and instructed the jury that they must not use this conduct 
  to support an inference of guilt unless they rejected any innocent explanation 
  for the conduct.</p>
<p> [152] The respondent submits that if it is found that the trial judge ought 
  not to have left any of these items with the jury as potential inculpatory after-the-fact 
  conduct, this Court should apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of 
  the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C.46. I am not prepared to do so. The Crown's 
  case was entirely circumstantial and the after-the-fact conduct evidence was 
  a critical aspect of its case against the appellant. The jury was improperly 
  permitted to make a finding of a concocted alibi and to draw an inference of 
  guilt there from. As well, three items of after-the-fact conduct evidence were 
  improperly allowed to go to the jury as inculpatory evidence and three other 
  items were put to the jury without an adequate cautionary instruction. I am 
  unable to say in light of these errors, and also in light of the errors that 
  I previously identified in connection with the hair comparison evidence and 
  the identification evidence, that the result of the trial would necessarily 
  have been the same. </p>
<p>Issues 5: Any Verdict of Culpable Homicide is Unreasonable </p>
<p> [153] Counsel for the appellant submits that any finding that the appellant 
  killed Jennifer Ueberschlag is unreasonable. At the close of the Crown's case, 
  defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the 
  basis that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed 
  could conclude that the appellant was the person who caused the death. In the 
  alternative, defence counsel moved for an order directing that the appellant 
  be acquitted of first degree murder and that the case proceed as one of second 
  degree murder.</p>
<p> [154] On the motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge observed that 
  in a case involving circumstantial evidence, the assessment whether or not there 
  is a rational explanation for the circumstantial evidence other than the guilt 
  of the accused is a question for the jury, citing the majority's opinion in 
  R. v. Charemski (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 229-30 (S.C.C.). After reviewing 
  the evidence at some length, the trial judge concluded that given the possible 
  inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, it was possible that the jury 
  could find that the appellant was the attacker. </p>
<p> [155] I am not able to say that the trial judge erred in this assessment. 
  Although this was not a strong circumstantial case, there was evidence capable 
  of supporting the inference that the appellant killed Jennifer. I would not 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p> Issue 6: The Verdict of First Degree Murder is Unreasonable and Unsafe</p>
<p> [156] Counsel for the appellant submits in the alternative that the verdict 
  of first degree murder is unreasonable. In dismissing the defence motion for 
  an order directing that the case proceed as one of second degree murder only, 
  the trial judge concluded that there was some evidence upon which a properly 
  instructed jury acting reasonably could find that the killing occurred while 
  the killer was committing or attempting to commit one of the forms of sexual 
  assault or forcible confinement delineated in s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> [157] Again, I am not prepared to interfere with this finding. Although the 
  evidence that a sexual assault had occurred was not overwhelming, there was 
  some evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could 
  conclude that there was a sexual assault during which the victim was killed. 
  The trial judge identified this evidence as the accused's interest in the victim, 
  the finding of the trace of semen, the body was nude, the state of the bedroom 
  and the finding of hairs consistent with pubic hairs of the accused on the nude 
  body. </p>
<p> [158] I reach the same conclusion with respect to the issue of unlawful confinement. 
  The trial judge was mindful that evidence of assaultive behaviour does not automatically 
  equate to unlawful confinement. He concluded that it was open to the jury to 
  conclude that the killer had assumed control over the liberty of the deceased 
  in a way over and above that which would flow as purely part of a straight assault. 
  I am not prepared to interfere with that finding, given the nature of the injuries 
  to the deceased, and particularly the multiple superficial cuts to the neck, 
  the significant bruising to the face and upper body and the evidence of asphyxiation. 
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p> [159] For the reasons given, I am satisfied that the appellant is entitled 
  to a new trial. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction 
  and order a new trial on the charge of first degree murder. </p>

<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> In R. v. Portillo, [2003] O.J. 3030 (C.A.), 
  Doherty J.A. was not prepared to find that the trial judge erred in law in failing, 
  on his own initiative, to exclude hair comparison evidence that was based only 
  on microscopic similarities. Defence counsel at trial had not objected to the 
  admission of evidence that certain hairs were microscopically similar to the 
  hairs of the appellants and deceased. Portillo does not refer to the type 1 
  and 2 categories used by Mr. Crocker, however, it appears that the hairs at 
  issue would fall into Mr. Crocker&#146;s type 1 category, because they are hairs 
  that &#147;were microscopically similar to the hairs of the appellants and deceased&#148;: 
  see para. 44. In refusing to find that the trial judge erred in admitting this 
  evidence, Doherty J.A. stated that &#147;the fact that hairs which were a DNA 
  match to the appellants were found on the deceased could add to the probative 
  value of the evidence that certain other hairs found at the scene were microscopically 
  similar to the appellants&#146; hairs, and at the same time diminish the potential 
  prejudice. In any event, the trial judge was not asked to exclude the evidence.&#148;
