<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting the 11-year old complainant 
  after a trial by a judge sitting without a jury. The Crown's case rested almost 
  entirely on the evidence of the complainant. The appellant did not testify. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] Counsel for the appellant contends that the reasons for judgment revealed 
  a failure to properly assess the complainant's evidence, a failure to consider 
  evidence that contradicted her evidence, and a misapprehension of some of the 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge began his consideration of the complainant's evidence by 
  indicating that as it was unconfirmed he should &quot;take into account the 
  dangers of considering the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant aged 11&quot;. 
  After referring again to the complainant's age and its effect on the reliability 
  of her evidence, the trial judge commented positively on the complainant's demeanour 
  in the witness stand.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge turned next to the &quot;surrounding circumstances&quot; 
  and reviewed some, but by no means all, of the evidence adduced from the witnesses 
  other than the complainant. He concluded that the Crown had proved its case 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant submits that the trial judge did not adequately consider various 
  inconsistencies in the statements and testimony given by the complainant. The 
  Crown's submissions satisfy us that none of the inconsistencies were so potentially 
  significant as to demand specific consideration by the trial judge in his reasons. 
  To the contrary, the statements and testimony considered as a whole revealed 
  a consistent description of the essential features of the alleged assault.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant submits that the trial judge relied on speculation in concluding 
  that the complainant's evidence should be preferred over that of her aunt where 
  the evidence of the two witnesses was at variance. The trial judge concluded 
  that the aunt's evidence was unreliable because she constantly changed her evidence 
  in response to suggestions from counsel during cross-examination. The trial 
  judge went on to speculate as to why the aunt's evidence was so subject to change. 
  This speculation was not helpful, however, it did not affect the trial judge's 
  conclusion that the variability of the aunt's evidence made it unreliable.</p>
<p>
  [7] Lastly, counsel submits that the trial judge failed to consider evidence 
  from other witnesses, especially the complainant's mother, that was diametrically 
  opposed to the complainant's description of events immediately following the 
  alleged assault. While there were inconsistencies between the complainant's 
  evidence and the evidence of her mother as to the timing of the relevant events, 
  we cannot say that the trial judge's failure to expressly refer to these differences 
  in the evidence indicates that he failed to appreciate that they existed or 
  to consider them in rendering his verdict. The inconsistencies were not so numerous 
  or substantial as to equate a failure to refer to them with a failure to consider 
  them.</p>
<p>
  [8] We would dismiss the appeal.</p>
