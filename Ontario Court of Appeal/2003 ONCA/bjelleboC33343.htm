<p>On appeal from the conviction of Justice Sandra Chapnik of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 9, 1999.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants were convicted of two counts of fraud and two counts of uttering 
  forged documents after a nine-month trial before Chapnik J. and a jury. The 
  fraud entailed a complex scheme involving Overseas Credit and Guaranty Corporation 
  (OCGC) and the sale of limited partnerships to approximately 600 investors. 
  The crown alleged that the investors were defrauded of approximately $22,000,000 
  and that approximately $118,000,000 in fraudulent tax losses were claimed. Bellfield 
  was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and a fine of $1,000,000 and Minchella 
  was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The appellants appeal both conviction 
  and sentence.</p>
<p>
  1. Conviction Appeals: Charter Issues</p>
<p>
  [2] The central issue on the conviction appeals is the admissibility of evidence 
  obtained in violation of the appellants' s. 7 and s. 8 rights under the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms. After a lengthy pre-trial Charter motion, the 
  trial judge found a violation of ss. 7 and 8, but ruled that the evidence should 
  be admitted under s. 24(2). The appellants argue that the trial judge erred 
  in two ways: first, that the nature and extent of the Charter breach was more 
  serious than found by the trial judge; and second, (especially if the trial 
  judge erred with respect to the extent of the Charter breach) the evidence should 
  have been excluded under s. 24(2).</p>
<p> [3] With respect to ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter, the issue is one of timing. 
  When did the violation of the appellants' ss. 7 and 8 rights start? Revenue 
  Canada's Tax Avoidance Section (&quot;TA&quot;) began an investigation of the 
  business losses claimed by various investors in the OCGC partnerships in 1986. 
  The Special Investigations Section of Revenue Canada (&quot;SI&quot;) became 
  involved in May 1987. Thereafter, from June 1987 to June 1989 when search warrants 
  obtained under the Income Tax Act (&quot;ITA&quot;) were executed, SI and TA 
  carried out a joint investigation, sharing information gathered and collaborating 
  on strategy. The involvement of SI was not disclosed to the appellants, and 
  active steps were taken to avoid disclosure of SI's participation until the 
  execution of the ITA search warrants. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge ruled that in relation to this investigation the point at 
  which the appellants' Charter rights arose was January 1988. She found that 
  by that date there were reasonable and probable grounds to support a criminal 
  prosecution and that the appellants, accordingly, were entitled to Charter protection. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] At trial, Chapnik J. did not have the benefit of R. v. Jarvis (2002), 169 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Ling (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 46. The appellants 
  submit that the application of the &quot;predominant purpose&quot; test established 
  by Jarvis and Ling would push back the date upon which Charter rights arose 
  to the time when SI first became involved in the investigation. They argue that 
  since SI's role is to prosecute, the only reason for SI's involvement from the 
  start was the potential criminal prosecution of OCGC and its principals. According 
  to the appellants, Charter rights were breached from the very beginning of SI's 
  involvement in the case. </p>
<p>
  [6] As SI's mandate is prosecution rather than enforcement, SI's involvement 
  is clearly an important factor to consider in determining when Charter rights 
  arise. However, I do not accept the submission that from the moment SI became 
  involved in this case, the appellant's Charter rights were thereby automatically 
  triggered. That argument is not borne out by Jarvis where, at para. 88, the 
  Supreme Court held that there is &quot;no clear formula&quot; that can determine 
  when the income tax authorities &quot;cross the Rubicon&quot; that divides compliance 
  from prosecution, and engages &quot;the adversarial relationship between the 
  taxpayer and the state&quot; so as to trigger Charter rights. Rather, said the 
  Supreme Court, &quot;one must look to all factors that bear upon the nature 
  of that inquiry&quot;, and the involvement of SI is only one of the factors 
  to be considered. At para. 94, the Court stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this connection, the trial judge will look at all factors, including but 
  not limited to such questions as: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) Did the authorities have reasonable grounds to lay charges? 
  Does it appear from the record that a decision to proceed with a criminal investigation 
  could have been made?</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Was the general conduct of the authorities such that it 
  was consistent with the pursuit of a criminal investigation? </p>
<p class="indent">(c) Had the auditor transferred his or her files and materials 
  to the investigators? </p>
<p class="indent">(d) Was the conduct of the auditor such that he or she was effectively 
  acting as an agent for the investigators? </p>
<p class="indent">(e) Does it appear that the investigators intended to use the 
  auditor as their agent in the collection of evidence? </p>
<p class="indent">(f) Is the evidence sought relevant to taxpayer liability generally? 
  Or, as is the case with evidence as to the taxpayer's mens rea, is the evidence 
  relevant only to the taxpayer's penal liability? </p>
<p class="indent">(g) Are there any other circumstances or factors that can lead 
  the trial judge to the conclusion that the compliance audit had in reality become 
  a criminal investigation?</p>
<p>
  [7] While the trial judge did not have the &quot;predominant purpose&quot; test 
  in mind, she did make certain findings on several of these factors. I have already 
  mentioned her finding on the first point: in her view, the authorities did not 
  have reasonable grounds for prosecution until January 1988. She was not persuaded 
  that the general conduct of the authorities was consistent with the pursuit 
  of a criminal investigation from the start. Rather, she found OCGC's tax returns 
  and supporting accounting information had to be obtained and considered before 
  any assessment of the legitimacy of the scheme could be made. She also rejected 
  the contention that TA was acting as the agent for SI.</p>
<p>
  [8] I would not interfere with these findings. In my view, they support the 
  respondent's position that the mere involvement of SI and the use of statutory 
  powers to compel production of the OCGC tax returns and supporting accounting 
  records did not reveal that the predominant purpose was that of prosecution. 
  The income tax authorities did not &quot;cross the Rubicon&quot; of compliance 
  and enter the territory of prosecution from the moment of SI's involvement. 
  </p>
<p> [9] It may be the case that upon full consideration of the Jarvis factors 
  the predominant purpose test was met at a date somewhat earlier than January 
  1988. In other words, as applied in Ling, the adversarial relationship between 
  the appellants and the state may have been engaged prior to the date upon which 
  SI had reasonable and probable grounds for prosecution. Certainly the inquiries 
  and activities of the investigators progressed steadily along a continuum from 
  June 1987 to January 1988. In the circumstances of this case, however, I find 
  it unnecessary to decide the precise date of the Charter breach since I am not 
  persuaded that the result would be different under s. 24(2) in any event. In 
  my view, the appellants simply cannot overcome the trial judge's finding that 
  any evidence obtained as a result of the Charter breach would have been obtained 
  from an independent source or was otherwise discoverable. The trial judge made 
  the following key findings that are unassailable on the record before us: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellants began creating false documents before SI's involvement.</li>
  <li>The appellants had to provide the evidence in relation to the civil audits 
    of the individual investors to support their claims for tax losses, and indeed 
    provided most of the impugned evidence to the investors' counsel from whom 
    it was subsequently seized. </li>
  <li>The appellants disseminated many of the false documents to third parties 
    from whom they could have been easily obtained for the prosecution.</li>
  <li>The appellants continued to produce incriminating documents and Bellfield 
    continued to make incriminating statements in furtherance of the fraud even 
    after they knew that they were under criminal investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [10] Simply put, through their own conduct, the appellants created a situation 
  where they had no realistic option except to provide the income tax authorities 
  with documents and evidence to support their scheme, and that is precisely what 
  they did. Bellfield had been warned from the start by his own advisors that 
  the scheme was likely to attract the attention of the income tax authorities. 
  When, as predicted, over 600 individual investors (who were OCGC's sole source 
  of revenue) were audited for the losses they had claimed, the appellants, as 
  a practical matter and quite apart from any compulsion from investigators determined 
  to prosecute, had to provide the information the investors required to support 
  their tax claims.</p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, even if the breach was more serious than found by the trial 
  judge, that does not undermine her core finding that the evidence obtained as 
  a result was inevitably discoverable. </p>
<p>
  2. Conviction Appeals: Other Issues</p>
<p>
  [12] Bellfield raised several additional grounds of appeal in his factum, but 
  he did not advance those arguments in his oral submissions and I see no merit 
  in them. In his oral presentation, Bellfield tried to persuade us that the scheme 
  that gave rise to these charges was a legitimate business arrangement. I am 
  satisfied that Bellfield's position in that regard was fully and fairly put 
  to the jury. The jury did not accept his explanation and he has failed to persuade 
  us that there is any basis for us to interfere with the jury's verdict.</p>
<p>
  3. Sentence Appeals</p>
<p>
  [13] While at the high end, the sentences imposed by the trial judge fell within 
  the acceptable range. This was a highly sophisticated and massive fraud involving 
  $118,000,000 against the public purse and $22,000,000 against more than 600 
  individuals. It was perpetrated over a lengthy period of time, and involved 
  thousands of documents, off-shore companies and accounts.</p>
<p>
  [14] I do not accept the submission that the trial judge erred in principle 
  in arriving at the sentences she imposed. Nor did she err by failing to apply 
  the Kienapple principle to the uttering charges, since the fabrication of the 
  elaborate documents required to support the scheme involved an additional and 
  distinguishing element. </p>
<p>
  [15] There was evidence from which the trial judge could infer that Bellfield 
  had the capacity to pay a substantial fine and, in any event, s. 734.7(b)(ii) 
  of the Criminal Code requires that before any warrant of committal be issued 
  for failure to pay the fine, the court must be satisfied &quot;that the offender 
  has, without reasonable excuse, refused to pay the fine&#133;&quot; </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants submit that the sentences are tainted with bias as a result 
  of the post conviction reception to which the trial judge invited the jury, 
  counsel and the income tax investigators. One can appreciate at a human level 
  why the trial judge might have shown this kindness to the jury after such a 
  long and difficult trial. However, such a practice seems to me to be ill-advised. 
  It could well detract from the solemnity of the trial process and verdict, and 
  there is a risk that a convicted accused might regard it as an inappropriate 
  celebration of his condemnation. That said, I do not agree that it gave rise 
  to a perception of bias in the present case. Defence counsel participated without 
  objection. In my view, a reasonable observer, viewing the matter realistically 
  and objectively, would not conclude that this act of generosity on the part 
  of the trial judge had any bearing on the sentences she later imposed. </p>
<p>
  4. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [17] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals against conviction. I would 
  grant leave to appeal sentence but dismiss the sentence appeals.</p>
