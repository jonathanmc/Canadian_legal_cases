<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice E. MacDonald of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated January 26, 2000 and from the sentence 
  imposed dated July 25, 2000.</p>
<p>ABELLA J.A. (dissenting): </p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted after trial by judge and jury of one count 
  of sexual assault and one count of sexual interference involving the eight-year-old 
  female complainant, T.D. On July 25, 2000, he was sentenced to eighteen months 
  incarceration plus three years probation. This is an appeal from his conviction 
  and sentence. The issue is the admissibility of similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The incident was alleged to have taken place in the summer of 1996. The 
  complainant and her older brother F.D., who was ten at the time, were visiting 
  the appellant with their father and his girlfriend. The two children were alone 
  with the appellant in his apartment for a period of time that afternoon when 
  their father and his girlfriend left to do some shopping. </p>
<p>
  [3] The complainant was the first witness called to testify about what took 
  place at the appellant's apartment that afternoon. The complainant's evidence 
  was that after her father and his girlfriend left, the appellant accompanied 
  her and her brother to the swimming pool in his apartment complex. After the 
  swim, they returned to the appellant's apartment. T.D. thought that she and 
  her brother took a shower after they returned. </p>
<p>
  [4] T.D. testified that after her shower, she was alone with the appellant in 
  his bed-room, while her brother watched television in the living room. She testified 
  that she sat on the appellant's bed, clothed in one of his T-shirts, but without 
  any underwear on. According to T.D., the appellant pointed a blow dryer on her 
  vagina while she sat on his bed. She also testified that he blew on her vagina 
  with his mouth and then kissed her vagina once. T.D. testified that she thought 
  the appellant then told her that he was sorry and he would never do it again. 
  After the incident T.D walked out of the bedroom and joined her brother, who 
  was watching television on the couch. She did not tell her brother what had 
  happened, nor did she tell her father or her father's girlfriend when they returned 
  to pick the children up at the appellant's apartment. Almost a year later the 
  complainant told her mother that the appellant kissed her &quot;private parts.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [5] The complainant was subjected to extensive cross-examination, which exposed 
  some inconsistencies in her evidence about the details of what had happened 
  on the day in question. For example, the cross-examination revealed some confusion 
  on T.D.'s part as to whether she had gone swimming once or twice on the date 
  of the incident. There was also some confusion on T.D.'s part as to whether 
  or not the sexual assault took place after a second swim, and whether she was 
  wearing a bathing suit or street clothes to swim in. </p>
<p>
  [6] The complainant's brother F.D. also testified about the events of that day. 
  According to F.D., neither he nor his sister had brought swimsuits with them 
  on the afternoon in question, and both swam in their street clothes. F.D. thought 
  he remembered that his sister was wearing shorts, and was certain that she was 
  not wearing jeans. After the swim, he and his sister returned to the appellant's 
  apartment, but, according to F.D., they did not take showers. F.D.'s evidence 
  was that he watched television while T.D. went into the appellant's bedroom 
  to put on a T-shirt. He testified that he could not hear anything in the bedroom 
  and also agreed that he was not sure how long T.D. was in the appellant's bedroom. 
  F.D. testified that his sister emerged from the bedroom wearing one of the appellant's 
  T-shirts, and that she did not talk to him at all for the rest of the night. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant testified on his own behalf and contradicted both T.D. and 
  F.D.'s version of what happened when they returned to his apartment that afternoon. 
  According to the appellant, the two children did not bring their swimsuits, 
  and swam in their street clothes. When the three returned to his apartment, 
  he put both children in his bedroom and gave them dry towels and T-shirts to 
  wear. The appellant testified that he and F.D. had to help T.D. take off her 
  jeans, as they were wet and were a struggle to remove. He gave T.D. a comforter 
  to keep warm and then went down the hall to place their wet clothing in a dryer. 
  When he returned, T.D. was still sitting on his bed and she asked for an extra 
  towel and a blow dryer, which he gave her. T.D. came out of the bedroom a short 
  time later and all three watched television until the children's father and 
  his girlfriend returned. The appellant testified that he did not kiss T.D.'s 
  vagina, nor did he blow on or point a blow dryer at her vagina.</p>
<p>
  [8] After the conclusion of the testimony of T.D. and F.D., the trial judge 
  ruled that the Crown was permitted to call similar fact evidence in the form 
  of testimony from two witnesses who had been complainants in the appellant's 
  two prior convictions for sexual assault. The application was allowed on the 
  basis of a summary of anticipated evidence of the two witnesses. While the witnesses 
  were in their twenties when they testified at trial, both incidents took place 
  thirteen and fourteen years prior to trial, when the witnesses were children 
  under the age of ten. </p>
<p>
  [9] The first of these two witnesses was M.O., who was twenty-four at the time 
  of trial. The appellant was convicted for sexually assaulting her in 1986, when 
  she was ten years old. M.O.'s evidence was that she and a girlfriend went to 
  an apartment-church complex where the appellant worked as a superintendent. 
  The appellant had taken both girls to the roof of the complex and then carried 
  M.O.'s girlfriend downstairs on his back. M.O. then found herself alone with 
  the appellant, and he offered to show her the chapel in the building. After 
  showing her the chapel, he offered M.O. a piggyback ride. M.O.'s testimony was 
  that during the piggyback ride, the appellant rubbed her vagina with his thumb 
  on the outside of her clothing while breathing heavily. M.O. testified that 
  the appellant apologized after the incident and told her it would not happen 
  again. The appellant was convicted of this offence in 1987 and received a suspended 
  sentence. There was evidence that M.O., at the age of 21, pleaded guilty to 
  a charge of fraud for which she received a conditional discharge.</p>
<p>
  [10] The second witness was J.B., who is related to the appellant and was 21 
  at the time of trial. J.B.'s testimony was that in 1987, when he was eight years 
  old, the appellant asked him if he wanted to see the inside of his van. While 
  the two were alone inside the van, they began &quot;play wrestling.&quot; J.B. 
  testified that the appellant first touched the boy's penis on the outside of 
  his clothing then slid his hand inside his shorts and touched his penis directly. 
  J.B. testified that when the incident ended, the appellant told him not to tell 
  anyone what had happened. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of sexual 
  assault on J.B. and was convicted of the offence in 1988.</p>
<p>
  [11] In his testimony, the appellant denied any intentional sexual touching 
  of M.O. and J.B. With respect to M.O.'s evidence, he testified that he did not 
  intentionally rub her vagina from outside her clothes, but suggested that she 
  may have been stuck by a pager that was hooked to his pants. Finally, in response 
  to his relative's testimony, the appellant's evidence was that while the two 
  were play fighting, the boy kicked him in the groin. The appellant responded 
  by grabbing the boy's genitals over his pants and asking him &quot;how do you 
  like that?&quot; The appellant described this as a &quot;playful grab&quot; 
  that was &quot;unintentional.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [12] The jury returned a finding of guilt on the charges of sexual assault and 
  sexual interference involving T.D. The sentencing hearing was held six months 
  after the jury verdict. The appellant was sentenced to eighteen months in custody 
  and a further three years probation.</p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [13] On appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by admitting 
  the similar fact evidence and by failing to adequately review the evidence and 
  the positions of the parties in her charge to the jury. The appellant also seeks 
  leave to appeal his sentence. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [14] In ruling on the admissibility of the evidence of M.O. and J.B. the trial 
  judge instructed herself in accordance with the four part test for admitting 
  evidence of prior discreditable conduct set out in R. v. B.L. (1997), 116 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 481 at 490 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent"> The trial judge who is charged with the delicate process of 
  balancing the probative value of the proposed evidence against its prejudicial 
  effect should inquire into the following matters.</p>
<p class="indent">1. Is the conduct, which forms the subject matter of the proposed 
  evidence, that of the accused?</p>
<p class="indent">2. If so, is the proposed evidence relevant and material?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If relevant and material, is the proposed evidence discreditable 
  to the accused?</p>
<p class="indent">4. If discreditable, does its probative value outweigh its prejudicial 
  effect? </p>
<p>
  Defence counsel at trial and on this appeal conceded that the first three criteria 
  in the foregoing test are met. It is submitted by the appellant that the trial 
  judge erred in concluding on the final criterion that the probative value of 
  the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. </p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada's 
  decision R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), which sets out what 
  is now the guiding test for assessing whether probative value outweighs prejudicial 
  effect in determining the admissibility of similar fact evidence. Based on the 
  analytic framework set out in Handy, in my view the evidence of M.O. and J.B. 
  was properly admitted. </p>
<p>
  [16] According to the analysis in Handy, probative value is assessed by considering 
  the strength of the similar fact evidence (para. 102); identifying the issue 
  at the trial to which the proposed similar facts are said to be relevant (paras. 
  69-75); and by identifying the factors that connect or distinguish the similar 
  fact evidence from the facts alleged in the charge and the degree of similarity 
  required to make the proposed evidence admissible (Handy at paras. 76-84). </p>
<p>
  i. The Strength of the Evidence</p>
<p>
  [17] This factor relates simply to the extent to which the evidence can be proven 
  and any allegations of collusion. As set out above, defence counsel conceded 
  the strength of the evidence at trial and on this appeal. The accused was convicted 
  after trial of one of the former incidents of sexual abuse and pleaded guilty 
  to the other. This factor in the Handy framework is therefore satisfied.</p>
<p>
  ii. Identification of the Issue</p>
<p>
  [18] The second consideration relates to the correct identification of the issue 
  at trial of which the similar fact evidence is said to be probative. The trial 
  judge held that the evidence of discreditable conduct in this case was probative 
  of several issues &quot;other than [the appellant's] propensity to sexually 
  assault young children.&quot; In the words of the trial judge, these issues 
  were: &quot;the credibility of the minor complainant, the credibility of the 
  allegations against [the appellant], [the appellant's] credibility and character, 
  a pattern of behaviour on the part of [the appellant], and the rebuttal of the 
  defence of innocent association.&quot; Earlier in her ruling the trial judge 
  instructed herself that, in weighing the probative value of the evidence of 
  the discreditable conduct against its inherently prejudicial nature, &quot;the 
  question is whether the incident alleged by T.D. occurred.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [19] On one hand, it may be argued that the trial judge framed the issue too 
  broadly in identifying it as the complainant's credibility. In Handy at paras. 
  115-116, Binnie J. cautioned against framing the &quot;issue in question&quot; 
  merely in terms of credibility. It is useful to reproduce his comments on this 
  point: </p>
<p class="indent"> Care must be taken not to allow too broad a gateway for the 
  admission of propensity evidence or, as it is sometimes put, to allow it to 
  bear too much of the burden of the Crown's case [citation omitted]. Credibility 
  is an issue that pervades most trials, and at its broadest may amount to a decision 
  on guilt or innocence.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">Anything that blackens the character of an accused may, as a 
  by-product, enhance the credibility of a complainant. Identification of credibility 
  as the &quot;issue in question&quot; may, unless circumscribed, risk the admission 
  of evidence of nothing more than general disposition.</p>
<p>
  [20] In this case, the trial judge did not frame the issue merely in terms of 
  credibility, but circumscribed it in terms of the conflicting testimony with 
  respect to whether the sexual abuse of T.D. occurred at all. It was proper for 
  the trial judge to describe the issue in terms of &quot;whether the incident 
  alleged by T.D. occurred&quot;.</p>
<p>
  iii. The Relative Cogency of the Factors Connecting, and Distinguishing, the</p>
<p>
  Similar Fact Evidence, and the Evidence of the Offences Charged </p>
<p>
  [21] The third factor in assessing probative value is an assessment of the similarities 
  and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence. 
  Binnie J. sets out a non-exhaustive list of some of the factors connecting similar 
  facts to the circumstances set out in the charge. These connecting factors may, 
  but need not, include the proximity in time of the similar acts to the offence 
  charged; the extent to which the other acts are similar in detail to the offence 
  alleged; the number of occurrences of the similar acts; circumstances surrounding 
  or relating to the similar acts; distinctive features unifying the incidents; 
  intervening events; and any other factor which would tend to support or rebut 
  the underlying unity of the similar acts (Handy at para. 82). It is important 
  to keep in mind that &quot;not every factor is useful in every case, and&#133;cogency 
  also depends on the other evidence&quot; (Handy at para. 121). The trial judge's 
  reasons evince a proper consideration of each of these factors in the probative 
  value analysis.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge began her ruling by highlighting the similarities between 
  the assaults of M.O. and J.B. and the alleged assault of T.D. Her reasons in 
  that regard are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On the matter of the similarities between the assaults of M.O. and J.B., when 
  compared to the alleged assault of T.D., the similarities are: </p>
<p class="indent"> At the time that they were assaulted all three complainants 
  were aged ten and under. M.O. was ten years old, J.B. was eight years old, and 
  T.D. was eight years old.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of each of these incidents, [the appellant] was 
  alone with the complainants. In the case of M.O., the evidence is that he suggested 
  to her that she accompanied him to see the inside of a church which she says 
  he described as being &quot;really pretty&quot;. The church was part of the 
  premises of an apartment building where [the appellant] was a superintendent. 
</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of J.B., the evidence is that [the appellant], after 
  taking J.B. to play video games, took J.B. to his van parked in a parking lot 
  in front of the apartment building where J.B.'s grandmother lived. The evidence 
  is that Blake asked J.B. if he wanted to &quot;check out&quot; the van&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of the current complainant, T.D., [the appellant] 
  was alone with T.D. in his bedroom in his apartment located in the building 
  where [the appellant] was superintendent.</p>
<p class="indent">It is significant to my disposition of this motion that, in 
  all three incidents, there was a component of privacy created by [the appellant] 
  in that [the appellant] lured the complainants to this private setting&#133;In 
  the case of M.O. it was the opportunity to see the church. In the case of J.B., 
  it was the opportunity to see the back of the van. And in the case of T.D., 
  it was getting changed into dry clothes. </p>
<p class="indent">In the case of M.O., the police synopsis records that, after 
  [the appellant] touched her private parts, he told her he was sorry and it would 
  not happen again.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of J.B., [the appellant] told his nephew not to 
  tell anyone what had happened.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of T.D., her evidence was unclear although the suggestion 
  was put to her and she confirmed the possibility of similar words having been 
  used.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of M.O., J.D. and T.D., the complaints involved 
  a brief touching of the genitals. No intercourse or penetration took place.</p>
<p>
  [23] Cogency arises from the circumstances surrounding or relating to the similar 
  acts and the alleged act against T.D. As the trial judge noted, the appellant 
  committed the similar acts in circumstances where he had created a component 
  of privacy. That is, in the two prior incidents and the alleged incident involving 
  T.D., the appellant took advantage of a situation where a component of privacy 
  could be created by inviting the young person into a private location. In the 
  case of M.O., this involved an invitation into the chapel and in the situation 
  involving the J.B., the appellant invited the young boy inside of his van. This 
  is similar to the situation described by T.D., where she found herself alone 
  with the appellant in his bedroom in order to receive dry clothing after her 
  swim.</p>
<p>
  [24] Most notable, perhaps, is the extent to which the evidence of the prior 
  acts of sexual abuse is similar in detail to the offence charged. The two prior 
  acts were committed on children who, like the complainant in this case, were 
  ten years old or younger. The incidents involved brief touching of the children's 
  genitalia and did not involve intercourse or penetration or any invitation to 
  the children to touch the appellant himself. As well, the two prior assaults, 
  as well as the alleged assault, were followed by the appellant either apologizing 
  to the child, or telling them not to disclose what had happened. </p>
<p>
  [25] With respect to distinctive features unifying or distinguishing the similar 
  acts and the offence charged, the appellant submits that peculiar details of 
  the offence charged - namely, the allegation that he pointed a blow dryer at 
  T.D.'s vagina and kissing her vagina - were distinct from, and thereby dissimilar 
  to, the other two instances of sexual abuse, which involved brief genital touching. 
  The distinctiveness of the manner of sexual touching in the alleged offence 
  against T.D. does not obscure the number of similarities. It could just as easily 
  be said that the brevity of the alleged assault against T.D., and the fact that 
  it involved brief genital touching by the appellant only - whether or not it 
  occurred with the hair dryer - is more indicative of similarity or connectedness 
  between the two prior assaults than not. </p>
<p>
  [26] It is also important to note the dissimilarities of the similar act evidence. 
  First, there was a time lapse of over ten years between the assaults against 
  M.O. and J.B. and those forming the subject matter of the charge. Second, one 
  of the previous instances of sexual assault involved a young male, while the 
  other instance and the offence before this court involved young females. </p>
<p>
  iv. Potential Prejudice Arising from the Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [27] Consideration of prejudicial effect of the similar fact evidence involves 
  an assessment of the potential for &quot;moral prejudice&quot; and &quot;reasoning 
  prejudice&quot; that may arise through admission of the similar fact evidence. 
  The former type of prejudice refers to the risk of conviction where guilt is 
  inferred from general disposition or propensity. The latter refers to the risk 
  of distracting or confusing the jury, or of undue consumption of time, as well 
  as the potential that the jury may have difficulty disentangling the subject 
  matter of the charges from the similar fact evidence (Handy at paras. 137-47). 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] The trial judge averted to these precise dangers in her ruling on the similar 
  fact evidence application. On the issue of potential prejudice, the trial judge 
  wrote: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is the risk of deflecting focus from the issues in this case and there 
  is the peril of providing motivation to punish for past misconduct&#133;The 
  prejudice&#133;can be expressed in simple terms. It is that the jury will conclude 
  that, because of past discreditable conduct, [the appellant] committed the offence 
  for which he now stands charged.</p>
<p>
  While recognizing the dangers of admitting the similar fact evidence, the trial 
  judge concluded that the correct admonitions to the jury would sufficiently 
  reduce the potential prejudicial effect of the similar fact evidence and ensure 
  the correct treatment of this evidence by the jury.</p>
<p>
  [29] In her charge to the jury, the trial judge repeatedly emphasized the proper 
  use of the evidence of M.O. and J.B. and specifically instructed the jury on 
  the uses to which the evidence was not to be put. The relevant portion of the 
  charge is: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have to caution you, at the risk of repeating myself, about 
  the use of the evidence of [the appellant's] past discreditable conduct&#133;Just 
  because [the appellant] committed these two previous offences, you cannot, and 
  I emphasize, you cannot assume that he is a bad person who would be likely to 
  have committed the offences for which he now stands charged. </p>
<p class="indent">The second thing that I must warn you about is that you cannot, 
  having heard the evidence of the past offences, try to punish him for his past 
  misconduct by finding him guilty of the offences with which he is now charged 
  and which are contained in the indictment.</p>
<p class="indent">The third thing that I must alert you to is that you must not 
  focus on whether or not [the appellant] committed the previous offences. If 
  you were to do so, your attention would be sidetracked or distracted from the 
  key question that you must decide in this case, namely, whether or not [the 
  appellant] is guilty of the offences for which he now stands charged. </p>
<p>
  The jury was thus clearly instructed on all of the dangers and misuses of the 
  similar fact evidence. The charge dealt with the risk of conviction based on 
  both a desire to punish and a perceived general disposition to sexually abuse 
  young children. The trial judge also dealt with the dangers of reasoning prejudice 
  by cautioning the jury against undue focus on the similar fact offences, and 
  warning jurors to focus on the facts of the offence charged.</p>
<p>
  v. Conclusion on Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [30] I acknowledge that this is not a clear-cut case of admissibility of the 
  similar fact evidence, but I am, in the end, guided by the strong deference 
  to be accorded to trial judges in circumstances such as these. This deference 
  was articulated in, among other cases, R. v. B.(C.R.) (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 
  1 (S.C.C.) at 28, where McLachlin J., admitting similar fact evidence with a 
  time lapse of almost ten years, summarized the approach to be taken by an appellate 
  court in such cases: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While I may have found this case to have been a borderline case of admissibility 
  if I had been the trial judge, I am not prepared to interfere with the conclusion 
  of the trial judge, who was charged with the task of weighing the probative 
  value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect in the context of the case 
  as a whole. </p>
<p>
  [31] The importance of deference was also emphasized by this court in R. v. 
  Harvey (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 296 (C.A.), affd (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 576 (S.C.C.) 
  where Doherty J.A. at paras. 44 and 50 stated that: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he strongly deferential approach to trial judges' decisions 
  as to the admissibility of similar fact evidence continues to play a key role 
  in the jurisprudence: R. v. Arp, supra&#133;</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">If an appellate court is satisfied that on a proper appreciation 
  of the evidence and a proper application of the applicable test for admissibility 
  there is only one reasonable result, either admission or exclusion, the appellate 
  court should intervene if the trial judge did not arrive at that result. If, 
  however, the case is one in which the evidence is such that different trial 
  judges acting reasonably could come to different conclusions as to the admissibility 
  of the evidence depending on their assessments of probative value and prejudicial 
  effect, then the appellate court must defer to the decision of the trial court.</p>
<p>
  [32] The Supreme Court of Canada recently rearticulated this principle of substantial 
  deference in Handy, at para. 153, citing R. v. B.(C.R.). </p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, the potential prejudice arising from the evidence of M.O. and 
  J.B. was outweighed by its probative value. The evidence was highly relevant 
  to the issue of whether the offence against T.D. ever actually happened. The 
  similar fact evidence contained sufficient similarity to the alleged offence 
  against T.D. in terms of the circumstances in which the offences were committed, 
  and the details of the offences themselves. Finally, while the risk of prejudice 
  to the appellant was undoubtedly high, as it inevitably can be when similar 
  fact evidence is admitted, in this case, given the similarity of the offences 
  forming the similar fact evidence and the subject matter of the charge, these 
  dangers were more than adequately addressed by the trial judge in her charge 
  to the jury. While the admission of similar fact evidence is exceptional, the 
  similarities in the evidence of the similar acts of the appellant to the allegations 
  forming the subject matter of the charge justify the admission of the evidence 
  in this case. </p>
<p>
  [34] Where, as here, the probative value of similar act evidence lies in its 
  similarity with the charged offence, its admissibility turns on whether the 
  similarities disclose a propensity with the requisite degree of specificity 
  to justify reception of the evidence despite the unfair prejudice to the accused. 
  The similar fact evidence in this case falls at the admissible end of the spectrum 
  as it discloses a type of circumstance in which the appellant is disposed to 
  sexually abuse children in a particular way. The issue in question is not the 
  appellant's general disposition to sexually abuse children but rather whether 
  the evidence is probative of repeated conduct of a similar type in a specific 
  type of situation. The trial judge adequately summarized the similarities that 
  support the permissible inference with respect to the specific propensity of 
  the appellant to sexually abuse child-ren in a particular way. In her charge 
  to the jury, the trial judge summarized the similarities that justified the 
  reception of the similar fact evidence. The trial judge referred to the fact 
  that the incidents were characterized by a component of privacy created by the 
  appellant and that each involved a brief touching of the genitals with no intercourse 
  or penetration. She also reviewed the evidence that at the conclusion of each 
  incident the appellant either apologized or told the complainant not to disclose 
  what had happened. </p>
<p>
  [35] I would therefore defer to the trial judge's ruling.</p>
<p>
  Charge to the Jury</p>
<p>
  [36] The appellant takes issue with the jury charge in its entirety, submitting 
  that it did not meaningfully review the evidence in the case, the positions 
  of the parties and the evidence relevant to those positions. </p>
<p>
  [37] As set out above, I think the cautionary instruction to the jury with respect 
  to the similar fact evidence was a proper one. The balance of the charge set 
  out the positions of the parties adequately. This was not a complicated case 
  and the main evidentiary discrepancy related to the contradictory accounts of 
  the events given by the appellant and the complainant. Given the simplicity 
  of contested issues at trial, the charge was sufficiently comprehensive and 
  fair and there is no reason to give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant also seeks leave to appeal his sentence. He submits that 
  the length of the custodial sentence is too long and failed to take into account 
  mitigating factors, such as the fact that he had not been convicted of an offence 
  in the previous twelve years and was, at the time of trial, gainfully employed 
  and the sole source of support for his wife. The appellant also submits that 
  given the circumstances of the offence, he does not present a danger to the 
  community and is eligible for a conditional form of imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  [39] As the respondent points out in its factum, there were a number of aggravating 
  factors to justify the custodial sentence of 18 months. These include the recognition 
  of the gravity of a sexual offence on a child and the appellant's record for 
  the same offences. As well, the expert called by the appellant at the sentencing 
  hearing gave evidence of the appellant's failure to address his diagnosis of 
  pedophilia which had been assessed eight years earlier. Given the seriousness 
  of the offence and the appellant's criminal record, the trial judge did not 
  err in rejecting a conditional sentence in the appellant's case. For the same 
  reasons the length of the custodial sentence was within the appropriate range 
  and there is no reason for interfering with the sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [40] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal, both from conviction and from 
  sentence.</p>

  &quot;RSA&quot; &quot;R.S. Abella J.A.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [41] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Abella J.A. 
  As noted by my colleague, the trial judge did not have benefit of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada's recent decisions in R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 
  and R. v. Shearing (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 225. Considered in light of the Handy 
  analytic framework, in my respectful view, as a result of the cumulative effect 
  of five aspects of her reasoning the trial judge set the threshold for admissibility 
  of the discreditable conduct evidence too low. Accordingly, I respectfully disagree 
  with my colleague's conclusion that the discreditable conduct evidence was admissible. 
  I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction, and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  [42] I agree with my colleague's statement of the relevant facts. However, before 
  turning to my analysis, I wish to highlight certain features of the trial judge's 
  reasons that I consider to be important.</p>
<p>
  I. The Trial Judge's Reasons </p>
<p>
  [43] The trial judge began her analysis by identifying the similarities between 
  the discreditable conduct evidence and the evidence of the complainant. My colleague 
  has already quoted this part of the trial judge's reasons. However, I will repeat 
  the quotation for ease of reference: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;the similarities are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) At the time that they were assaulted, all three complainants 
  were aged ten and under. M.O. was ten years old, J.B. was eight years old, and 
  T.D. was eight years old. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) At the time of each of these incidents, B. was alone with 
  the complainants. In the case of M.O., the evidence is that he suggested to 
  her that she accompany him to see the inside of a church which she says he described 
  as being &quot;really pretty&quot;. The church was part of the premises of an 
  apartment building where B. was a superintendent.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of J.B., the evidence is that B., after taking J.B. 
  to play video games, took J.B. to his van parked in a parking lot in front of 
  the apartment building where J.B.'s grandmother lived. The evidence is that 
  B. asked J.B. if he wanted to &quot;check out&quot; the van. J.B. is B.'s nephew.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of the current complainant, T.D., B. was alone with 
  T.D. in his bedroom in his apartment located in the building where B. was superintendent. 
</p>
<p class="indent">It is significant to my disposition of this motion that, in 
  all three incidents, there was a component of privacy created by B. in that 
  B. lured the complainants to a private setting&#133;In the case of M.O., it 
  was the opportunity to see the church. In the case of J.B., it was the opportunity 
  to see the back of the van. And in the case of T.D., it was getting changed 
  into dry clothes.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of M.O., the police synopsis records that, after 
  B. touched her private parts, he told her he was sorry and it would not happen 
  again.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of J.B., B. told his nephew not to tell anyone what 
  had happened.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of T.D., her evidence was unclear although the suggestion 
  was put to her and she confirmed the possibility of similar words having been 
  used.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of M.O., J.B. and T.D., the complaints involved 
  a brief touching of the genitals. No intercourse or penetration took place. 
</p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge turned next to the issue in the trial to which the proposed 
  evidence was said to be relevant and to the question of whether the probative 
  value of the evidence outweighed its potential prejudice. She identified the 
  relevant issue as &quot;whether the incident alleged by T.D. occurred&quot; 
  and then itemized the considerations set out by this court, in R. v. B.L., R. 
  v. G.M.A. (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 as being relevant to probative value and 
  prejudicial effect. </p>
<p>
  [45] On the question of probative value the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidence of discreditable conduct in this case is probative of several issues 
  other than B.'s propensity to sexually assault young children. These issues 
  include the credibility of the minor complainant, the credibility of the allegations 
  against B., B.'s credibility and character, a pattern of behaviour on the part 
  of B., and the rebuttal of the defence of innocent association [emphasis in 
  the original].</p>
<p>
  [46] On the question of prejudicial effect, the trial judge noted the following 
  risks of prejudice arising from the evidence: the risk of deflecting focus from 
  the issues in the case; the peril of providing motivation to punish for past 
  misconduct; and the risk that the jury would use the discreditable conduct evidence 
  to conclude that B. committed the offences with which he was charged.</p>
<p>
  [47] The trial judge completed her analysis by concluding that the risks of 
  prejudice arising from the evidence could be adequately addressed by admonishing 
  the jury concerning the proper treatment of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  II. Analysis</p>
<p>
  A) The Handy Analytic Framework</p>
<p> [48] This court summarized the main components of the Handy analytic framework 
  in R. v. K.(C.P.)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. Without repeating the 
  entire summary, the highlights are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">-- evidence of other discreditable conduct is presumptively 
  inadmissible; </p>
<p class="indent"> -- evidence of other discreditable conduct may be admitted 
  where the prosecution establishes, on a balance of probabilities, &quot;that 
  in the context of a particular case the probative value of the evidence in relation 
  to a particular issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies 
  its reception&quot;; </p>
<p class="indent">-- Probative value may be assessed in the following manner: 
</p>
<p class="indent">-- by considering the strength of the similar fact evidence, 
  including the extent to which the evidence can be proven and any allegations 
  of collusion; </p>
<p class="indent">-- by identifying the &quot;issue in question&quot; and its 
  relative importance in the particular trial; </p>
<p class="indent"> -- by identifying the factors that connect or distinguish the 
  similar fact evidence to or from the facts alleged in the charge and the degree 
  of connection required to make the proposed evidence admissible. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p class="indent"> -- if the similar fact evidence &quot;is not properly capable 
  of supporting the inferences sought by the Crown, generally, the analysis need 
  go no further&quot;; </p>
<p class="indent"> -- potential prejudice to the accused may be assessed in the 
  following manner: </p>
<p class="indent"> -- by considering the potential for &quot;moral prejudice&quot; 
  against the accused, meaning the risk of convicting the accused because he is 
  a &quot;bad person&quot; rather than based on proof that he committed this offence. 
</p>
<p class="indent">-- by considering the potential for &quot;reasoning prejudice&quot; 
  against the accused, meaning the risk of distracting or confusing the jury, 
  or of undue consumption of time, and the danger that the jury may have difficulty 
  disentangling the subject matter of the charges from the similar fact evidence. 
</p>
<p>
  B) Application of the Handy Analytic Framework to the Facts of this Case</p>
<p>
  [49] As already noted, in my respectful view, reviewed with the benefit of the 
  Handy analytic framework, the cumulative effect of five aspects of the trial 
  judge's reasoning led her to set the threshold for admissibility of the discreditable 
  conduct evidence too low: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) she framed the issue in question too widely, allowing too 
  broad &quot;a gateway&quot; for the admission of discreditable conduct evidence; 
</p>
<p class="indent">ii) she did not identify the degree of connection to the alleged 
  offence required to make the discreditable conduct evidence admissible;</p>
<p class="indent">iii) in assessing the cogency of the discreditable conduct evidence, 
  she relied primarily on generic similarities between it and the evidence of 
  the complainant; </p>
<p class="indent">iv) in assessing the cogency of the discreditable conduct evidence, 
  she did not identify the features of proposed evidence that distinguished it 
  from the evidence of the complainant; and </p>
<p class="indent">v) she failed to recognize the significant moral prejudice arising 
  from the generic quality of the similarities she identified. </p>
<p>
  [50] Moreover, applying the Handy analytic framework to the facts of this case, 
  I conclude that the discreditable conduct evidence was not admissible.</p>
<p>
  i. The Strength of the Evidence</p>
<p>
  [51] As noted by my colleague, defence counsel conceded the strength of the 
  discreditable conduct evidence at trial and it is not an issue on appeal.</p>
<p>
  ii. Identification of the Issue in Question</p>
<p>
  [52] Initially, the trial judge framed the issue in question as &quot;whether 
  the incident alleged by T.D. occurred&quot;. However, she later found that the 
  discreditable conduct evidence was probative of several issues &quot;other than 
  [the appellant's] propensity to sexually assault young children&quot;. Those 
  issues were the credibility of the complainant, the credibility of the allegations, 
  B.'s credibility and character, a pattern of behaviour on the part of B., and 
  rebuttal of the defence of innocent association.</p>
<p>
  [53] As noted by my colleague, at paras. 116 and 117 of Handy, Binnie J. cautioned 
  that framing &quot;the issue in question&quot; as credibility may result in 
  &quot;too broad a gateway for the admission of propensity evidence&quot; therefore 
  &quot;risk[ing] the admission of evidence of nothing more than general disposition 
  (&quot;bad personhood&quot;)&quot;. In particular, he noted that when the issue 
  in question is framed as the complainant's credibility, &quot;anything that 
  blackens the character of the accused&quot; tends to enhance the credibility 
  of the complainant. </p>
<p>
  [54] One of the purposes of identifying the issue in question is to assist in 
  determining the degree of connection necessary to make the discreditable conduct 
  evidence admissible. In this case, the trial judge did not discretely identify 
  the standard that she used. However, as I will explain more fully below, in 
  admitting the discreditable conduct evidence the trial judge relied primarily 
  on generic similarities to the complainant's evidence and did not consider the 
  distinguishing features in the evidence. In my view, characterizing the issue 
  in question, at least in part, as credibility played a significant role in the 
  trial judge's determination that the proposed evidence was sufficiently similar 
  to the complainant's evidence to warrant its admission. </p>
<p>
  [55] Moreover, I do not consider that the trial judge's reference to additional 
  issues cured the problems associated with framing the issue in question, at 
  least in part, as credibility. Read in context, the trial judge's reference 
  to a pattern of behaviour on the part of the appellant referred to a potential 
  inference to be drawn from the evidence and was not intended to identify an 
  issue at the trial in the manner contemplated by the Handy analytic framework. 
  </p>
<p>
  [56] In addition, when the trial judge referred to &quot;rebuttal of the defence 
  of innocent association&quot;, she was really referring to whether the incident 
  occurred and not identifying a distinct issue that might permit the admission 
  of discreditable conduct evidence based on a different degree of connection. 
  Unlike one of the earlier incidents in which the appellant was involved, in 
  this case, there could be no suggestion that the form of touching alleged by 
  the complainant was accidental or that the complainant misconstrued its true 
  character. </p>
<p>
  iii. The Relative Cogency of the Factors Connecting, and Distinguishing, the 
  Discreditable Conduct Evidence and the Evidence of the Offences Charged; and 
  the Degree of Connection Required to Make the Proposed Evidence Admissible</p>
<p>
  [57] Analyzed under this heading, three aspects of the trial judge's reasoning 
  led her to set the threshold for admissibility too low.</p>
<p>
  [58] First, the trial judge failed to identify the degree of connection to the 
  alleged offence necessary to make the proposed evidence admissible.</p>
<p>
  [59] At paras. 76 to 80 of Handy, Binnie J. discussed the necessity and importance 
  of this step: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [76] The principal driver of probative value in a case [involving similar fact 
  evidence] &#133; is the connectedness (or nexus) that is established between 
  the similar fact evidence and the offences alleged, particularly where the connections 
  reveal a &quot;degree of distinctiveness or uniqueness&quot; [citation omitted]. 
  As stated by Cory J. in Arp, at para. 48: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove a fact in issue, in order 
  to be admissible, the trial judge should evaluate the degree of similarity of 
  the alleged acts and decide whether the objective improbability of coincidence 
  has been established. Only then will the evidence have sufficient probative 
  value to be admitted. </p>
<p>
  [78] The issue in the present case is not identification but the actus reus 
  of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity &#133; must be 
  higher or lower than in an identification case. The point is that the issue 
  is different, and the drivers of cogency in relation to the desired inferences 
  will therefore not be the same [emphasis in the original].</p>
<p>
  [79] If, for example, the complainant in this case had not been able to identify 
  the respondent as the perpetrator of the alleged offence, the conduct described 
  by the ex-wife was not so &quot;particular and distinctive&quot; as to amount 
  to a &quot;signature&quot; or &quot;fingerprints at the scene of the crime&quot; 
  that would safely differentiate him from other possible assailants.</p>
<p>
  [80] On the other hand, in a case where the issue is the animus of the accused 
  towards the deceased, a prior incident of the accused stabbing the victim may 
  be admissible even though the victim was ultimately shot - the accused says 
  accidentally&#133; The acts could be said to be dissimilar but the inference 
  on the &quot;issue in question&quot; would nonetheless be compelling. </p>
<p>
  [60] In Shearing, where the issue in question was, in part, whether some of 
  the alleged incidents occurred, Binnie J. concluded, at para. 48, that, &quot;a 
  persuasive degree of connection between the discreditable conduct evidence and 
  the offence charged&quot; is required. As the issue in question in this case 
  was the same, I conclude that the same degree of connection was required.</p>
<p>
  [61] Second, in finding the proposed discreditable conduct evidence admissible, 
  the trial judge relied primarily on generic similarities between the proposed 
  evidence and the allegations of the complainant. In describing the similarities 
  as generic, I mean that the identified similarities describe general, rather 
  than specific, aspects of the conduct and contain limited detail, with the result 
  that the identified similarities are likely to be present in most incidents 
  of sexual touching involving children. </p>
<p> [62] Broadly stated, the similarities identified by the trial judge can be 
  summarized as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the appellant had sexually touched children aged 10 years or under on two 
    occasions in the past;</li>
  <li>both prior incidents involved genital touching;</li>
  <li>both prior incidents occurred in private; and</li>
  <li>the appellant told one of the children that he was sorry and that it would 
    not happen again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [63] In my view, these descriptions relate to non-specific conduct and lack 
  detail. Moreover, the fact that none of the incidents involved more intrusive 
  conduct does not change the generic quality of the identified similarities. 
  </p>
<p>
  [64] The risk in relying primarily on generic similarities to support an inference 
  that the actus reus occurred is twofold. One, the initial inference arising 
  from the prior conduct becomes so general, that it approaches bad personhood. 
  Two, because of their non-specific character, generic similarities may mask 
  underlying dissimilarities that could be important in a particular case. </p>
<p>
  [65] In this case, the initial inference that can be drawn from the identified 
  similarities in the appellant's past conduct amounts to little more than that 
  he has engaged in genital touching of children aged ten or under in the past, 
  in circumstances involving privacy, and that following the sexual abuse, he 
  may apologize to the child. Although not irrelevant, this inference contributes 
  only marginally to determining whether the specific incident described by the 
  complainant actually took place. </p>
<p>
  [66] Third, the trial judge did not identify the features of the proposed discreditable 
  conduct evidence that distinguished it from the complainant's evidence. As a 
  result, she did not consider the impact of the distinguishing features on the 
  probative force of the proposed evidence. </p>
<p> [67] In this case, the significance of the distinguishing features in the 
  evidence is best highlighted by reviewing the Handy list of connecting factors: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>proximity in time of the similar acts to the alleged offence-the discreditable 
    conduct incidents occurred approximately nine years and ten years prior to 
    the alleged offence and therefore were remote in time from it; </li>
  <li>the extent to which the other acts are similar in detail to the alleged 
    offence-apart from the generic similarity that all of the incidents involved 
    touching children's genitals, none of the incidents are similar in detail. 
    Moreover, the incident described by the complainant is somewhat distinctive, 
    in that it involved oral contact and use of an item external to the appellant's 
    body;</li>
  <li>the number of occurrences of the similar acts-two;</li>
  <li>circumstances surrounding or relating to the similar acts-all of the incidents 
    occurred in circumstances involving privacy;</li>
  <li>any distinctive features unifying the similar acts and the offence charged-none;</li>
  <li>any intervening events-none; and </li>
  <li>any other factor which would tend to support or rebut the underlying unity 
    of the similar acts and the offence alleged-none.</li>
</ul>
<p> [68] In Handy, Binnie J. noted that remoteness in time increases the possibility 
  of character reform and may also affect the relevance and reliability of discreditable 
  conduct evidence<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>. In addition, the small 
  number of incidents and their remoteness from the incident in question diminishes 
  their probative value as a pattern of conduct. </p>
<p>
  [69] I conclude that apart from generic similarities, there are no distinctive 
  unifying features of the discreditable conduct evidence and the complainant's 
  evidence. Moreover, particularly when considered in conjunction with the distinguishing 
  features of the evidence (including remoteness in time), the identified similarities 
  fail to establish a persuasive degree of connection.</p>
<p>
  iv. Potential prejudice </p>
<p>
  [70] Turning to the potential prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence, the 
  trial judge carefully identified many of the risks arising from the evidence. 
  In my view, however, she failed to recognize that relying primarily on generic 
  similarities to justify admission of the discreditable conduct evidence magnified 
  the risk that the jury would misuse it. The reason for this is twofold. First, 
  the inference arising from the prior conduct came closer to bad personhood, 
  increasing the risk that the jury would reason that because the appellant had 
  sexually touched children in the past, he must have done so on this occasion. 
  Second, particularly because the trial judge did not identify the distinguishing 
  features in the evidence, the general nature of the identified similarities 
  masked the distinguishing features in the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [71] I conclude that the probative value of the proposed discreditable conduct 
  evidence failed to outweigh the risk of prejudice it created and therefore, 
  that it was not admissible.</p>
<p>
  III. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [72] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside the appellant's 
  conviction, and order a new trial. </p>
