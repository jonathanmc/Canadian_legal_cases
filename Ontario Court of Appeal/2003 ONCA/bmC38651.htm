<p>The appellant, Brian M., appeals against the sentence imposed by Justice Peter 
  R. Mitchell of the Ontario Court of Justice dated March 28, 2002.<br>
  <br>
  Charge<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant plead guilty and was convicted of robbery and sexual assault 
  under s. 344 and s. 271 of the Criminal Code, respectively. He was sentenced 
  by Mitchell J. on March 28, 2002 to time served (229 days) plus sixteen months 
  secure custody and eight months open custody to be followed by a period of probation 
  of four months.<br>
</p>
<p>Nature of Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[2] This is an appeal to sentence only. The appellant submits that the period 
  of incarceration should be reduced by eliminating the period of open custody.<br>
</p>
<p>Facts <br>
</p>
<p>[3] On Saturday, August 11, 2001 at 10:15 p.m., the first complainant was walking 
  home from a restaurant in the City of Burlington. The appellant grabbed her 
  from behind, placed his right arm around her neck, and threw her to the ground. 
  The appellant said &quot;Are you all right, bitch? You need some cock.&quot; 
  The accused then shoved his fingers down her throat. He grabbed her purse, which 
  contained personal identification and $80.00, and ran away with the items. The 
  victim suffered bruises and other minor injuries as well as psychological trauma.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] On the same evening at approximately 11:00 p.m., the second complainant 
  was leaving a restaurant in Burlington and began to walk home. The appellant 
  grabbed her from behind and threw her to the ground as she entered a hydro right 
  of way near her home. He attempted to remove her belt and grabbed at her breast 
  saying, &quot;If you want to live, shut the fuck up, or I'll kill you.&quot; 
  The appellant then stuck his fist in the victim's mouth. The victim screamed 
  and her father, who happened to be walking the family dog nearby, came to investigate. 
  He only realized it was his daughter when he saw her on the ground. The father 
  grabbed the appellant who managed to run away. The appellant was seventeen years 
  old and intoxicated when he committed both offences.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The appellant was arrested that night and remained in custody from the 
  date of his arrest on August 11, 2001 to the date of his plea of guilty on January 
  30, 2002. The trial judge imposed a sentence that exceeded that recommended 
  by both crown counsel and defence by three months (one month more of closed 
  custody and two months more open custody). On appeal, the appellant submits 
  that his dysfunctional and abusive family background, extensive pre-trial custody, 
  and the progress he had made by the time of sentencing should have been taken 
  into account by the trial judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider the extremely 
  difficult upbringing of the young offender. His father was an alcoholic, there 
  was constant fighting between his parents, he was left to fend for himself at 
  an early stage and he has a learning disability. The fresh evidence filed indicates 
  that while in custody the young offender has been able to complete high school 
  credits, and has regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous and psychological counselling. 
  There was a serious incident in the unit in which he resided and he showed maturity 
  by not becoming involved in the incident with his peers. The appellant was in 
  custody before sentencing for 7 &frac12; months. He was sentenced to a further 
  24 months. The appellant submits, in the alternative, that the sentence imposed 
  was excessive and outside the appropriate range. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] We agree that the sentence is at the very upper end of the range. In the 
  submissions of defence counsel at trial, the trial judge had the benefit of 
  the submissions respecting the home circumstances of the appellant and his expression 
  of remorse. The trial judge did not refer to this in his reasons but he did 
  refer to the prior pre-sentence report and noted that the appellant was four 
  months into his one year of probation at the time these offences were committed. 
  We acknowledge that the fresh evidence filed indicates that the appellant has 
  made significant progress in addressing many of the concerns raised by these 
  offences. However, we are concerned that the psychological summary indicates 
  that very little has been addressed regarding seriousness of the offences and 
  achieving an understanding of what happened and why. It is our view that the 
  more appropriate place to take the appellant's progress into account is on a 
  review of the sentence in the Youth Court after one year of the sentence has 
  been served, which would be in March of this year. At that time, the fact and 
  duration of whether open custody remains appropriate should be considered. The 
  appeal from the disposition as to sentence is therefore dismissed.</p>
