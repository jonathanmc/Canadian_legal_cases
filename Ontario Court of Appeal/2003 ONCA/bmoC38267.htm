<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas Lissaman of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 24, 2002.</p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] In 1989, each of the appellants (the &quot;investors&quot;) gave a promissory 
  note to one of the Reemark group of companies (&quot;Reemark&quot;) as partial 
  payment for a residential condominium unit purchased for investment purposes. 
  At the time the individual promissory notes were signed, each of the notes was 
  included in a document booklet containing a series of agreements relating to 
  the investor's condominium purchase. Reemark later assigned the promissory notes 
  (the &quot;Notes&quot;) to the Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>
  [2] Following the assignments, the investors made the regular instalment payments 
  under the Notes to the Bank of Montreal for several months. However, in early 
  1992, the investors discovered that Reemark had never transferred registered 
  title to the condominium units into their respective names and they stopped 
  paying the Notes. On April 24, 2002, the Bank of Montreal obtained judgment 
  on the Notes against the investors.</p>
<p> [3] The main issue on the investors' appeal is whether the trial judge erred 
  in concluding that the Notes are &quot;unconditional promises &#133; to pay&quot; 
  within the meaning of s. 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 
  B-4<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a>. In particular, the investors contend 
  that the trial judge erred by distinguishing this case from the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's decision in Range v. Belvedere Finance Corp.<a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> 
  In Range, Pigeon J. held that a promissory note should not be interpreted independently 
  from the conditional sale contract to which it was appended and therefore found 
  that the note was conditional.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge did not err. 
  I would accordingly dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  II. Background</p>
<p>
  [5] Between May 1989 and December 1989, each of the investors signed a General 
  Agreement and seven other agreements (the &quot;General Agreement and Appended 
  Contracts&quot;) agreeing to purchase a residential condominium unit and related 
  services from Reemark. The condominium units were located in one of four existing 
  British Columbia residential condominium apartment buildings and were occupied 
  by tenants. </p>
<p>
  [6] The seven contracts appended to the General Agreement were the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> i. Purchase Agreement;</p>
<p class="indent">ii. Financial Schedule; </p>
<p class="indent">iii. Trust Agreement; </p>
<p class="indent">iv. Services Agreement; </p>
<p class="indent">v. Rental Pooling and Management Agreement; </p>
<p class="indent">vi. Guarantee Agreement; and </p>
<p class="indent">vii. Appliance Lease.</p>
<p> [7] The individual Purchase Agreements provided that the investors would purchase 
  beneficial ownership in their condominium units on December 30, 1989 (the &quot;Closing 
  Date&quot;), and that they would acquire registered title to their units on 
  the Transfer Date, projected to be September 30, 1990<a name="r3"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  [8] Under the Purchase Agreements, the purchase price of the individual condominium 
  units was payable as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> i. a $1,500 cash deposit on signing the General Agreement and 
  Appended contracts;</p>
<p class="indent">ii. cash equal to approximately 72% of the purchase price of 
  the unit to be raised by way of a first mortgage from a financial institution; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">iii. the balance by way of a promissory note from each of the 
  investors to Reemark.</p>
<p> [9] Pending the Transfer Date, Reemark was entitled to register an Interim 
  Mortgage encumbering individual condominium units up to the amount of the purchase 
  price of that unit less the deposit. In addition, the General Agreement and 
  Appended Contracts provided that a Manager would collect and pool the rents 
  for each building, applying the rent first, in payment of building expenses<a name="r4"></a><a href="#4">[4]</a> 
  and then in payment of the unit mortgages. During a Guarantee Period, Reemark 
  agreed to pay shortfalls in building expenses and in the unit mortgages by way 
  of a Cash Flow Loan to be advanced to each of the investors. </p>
<p>
  [10] The investors signed the Notes on the same day as they executed the General 
  Agreement and Appended Contracts. On the day the documents were signed, representatives 
  of Reemark presented to each investor a blue booklet (the &quot;Booklet&quot;) 
  containing copies of the General Agreement and Appended Contracts and the promissory 
  note. Each of the investors signed the documents in the Booklet and left the 
  Booklet with Reemark. Although the investors did not notice it at the time they 
  signed the Notes, the promissory note in each Booklet was attached to the Booklet 
  by a perforated edge.</p>
<p> [11] Between November 22, 1989 and June 29, 1990, Reemark sold the investors' 
  Notes<a name="r5"></a><a href="#5">[5]</a> to the Bank of Montreal pursuant 
  to the Purchase Agreements and Assignment. Under the Purchase and Assignment 
  Agreements, Reemark assigned all of its rights and benefits but not its obligations 
  under the investors' Purchase Agreements to the Bank of Montreal<a name="r6"></a><a href="#6">[6]</a>. 
  After receiving notice of the assignment of their respective promissory notes, 
  the investors made their monthly payments to the Bank of Montreal. </p>
<p>
  [12] In December 1991, each of the investors received a letter from the first 
  mortgagee demanding payment of their unit mortgages, which were in arrears. 
  Subsequently, the investors also learned that Reemark had not transferred registered 
  title to the individual condominium units into their respective names. Within 
  a short period, all of the investors stopped paying the instalments on the Notes.</p>
<p>
  [13] In March 1992, Reemark sent a letter to the investors, setting out a proposal 
  whereby the investors could acquire title to their respective condominium units. 
  The investors rejected the proposal, claiming that Reemark's failure to convey 
  registered title amounted to a total failure of consideration and that it released 
  them from their obligations under the General Agreement and Appended Contracts. 
  In addition, the investors disputed the first mortgagee's claim that they were 
  liable on the unit mortgages.</p>
<p>
  [14] In May 1994, after the buildings were sold under power of sale, the Bank 
  of Montreal sued the investors on the Notes. </p>
<p> [15] The trial proceeded, based in part, on an Agreed Statement of Facts. 
  In addition to many of the facts noted above, the Agreed Statement of Facts 
  includes the following significant statements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Investors were not aware of the legal concepts of negotiable instruments 
    or holder in due course or the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act in 
    that regard.</li>
  <li>Prior to the Bank purchasing the Reemark Notes, none of [the] Investors 
    had any direct contact or communication with the Bank.</li>
  <li>The Bank was not, and could not have been, aware of Reemark's problems when 
    the Bank purchased the Promissory Notes. The Bank did not contemplate, nor 
    did it have any reason to believe that the Investors' investment would fail 
    at the time when the Bank bought their Promissory Notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  III. Section 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act</p>
<p>
  [16] Sections 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  176. (1) A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one 
  person to another person, signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or 
  at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to, or to the 
  order of, a specified person or to bearer [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  IV. Range v. Belvedere Finance Corp.</p>
<p>
  [17] The investors contend that the trial judge erred by failing to find that 
  this case is governed by the result in Range v. Belvedere Finance Corp. As Range 
  forms the underpinning of the investors' position, I will summarize that decision 
  in some detail. </p>
<p>
  [18] In April 1960, Mr. Range signed a conditional sales contract and promissory 
  note for the purchase of a fur coat. The promissory note and conditional sales 
  contract were on a printed form supplied by a finance company. The promissory 
  note was at the bottom of the form, separated from the conditional sale contract 
  by a perforated line. The words, &quot;Negotiable Instrument&quot;, appeared 
  on the side of the note. </p>
<p>
  [19] The conditional sale contract provided that the purchase price of the coat 
  was payable in 24 monthly instalments, commencing on May 10, 1960, at the office 
  of a finance company. It also included the following provision: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A negotiable promissory note has been delivered by the purchaser to the vendor 
  as evidence of the said total deferred payments, but not in payment thereof.</p>
<p>
  [20] At the time the documents were signed, the vendor promised to deliver the 
  coat within two to three weeks. However, the vendor went bankrupt a few months 
  later, and the coat was never delivered.</p>
<p>
  [21] After the documents were signed, the vendor endorsed the note and delivered 
  it to the finance company, still appended to the conditional sale contract. 
  Prior to the due date of the first payment on the note, an employee of the finance 
  company contacted Mrs. Range and learned that the coat had not been delivered. 
  Subsequently, the finance company delivered the conditional sales agreement/promissory 
  note to its bank as part of a collateral security package for the finance company's 
  loans. When the finance company later became insolvent, Belvedere Finance Corp. 
  purchased the finance company's claim against Mr. Range. </p>
<p>
  [22] At the time of purchasing the claim, Belvedere received the form comprising 
  the conditional sales contract and the note as well as an account card, with 
  the words &quot;non-delivery&quot; noted on the card. Belvedere detached the 
  note from the conditional sales contract and commenced an action against Mr. 
  Range.</p>
<p>
  [23] Justice Pigeon determined that the note could only be construed as an unconditional 
  promise to pay if read independently of the conditional sales contract. On that 
  issue, Pigeon J. noted at p. 262 that Belvedere &quot;wished to be in a position 
  to exercise rights arising out of the contract of sale, as well as those arising 
  out of the 'note'&quot;, and found that &quot;[w]hat was transferred &#133; 
  was the entire documentation as a whole&#133;&quot; </p>
<p> [24] Considering the documents as a whole, Pigeon J. concluded that a printed 
  condition on the back of the contract<a name="r7"></a><a href="#7">[7]</a> made 
  it clear that the promise to pay was conditional. He said at p. 261: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If, on the other hand, the note and the contract are considered as a whole, 
  the first condition indicates that the promise to pay is conditional: in the 
  event of repossession of the article sold, the purchaser is exonerated from 
  further liability. There is no doubt that the same result must obtain in the 
  event of non-delivery. </p>
<p>
  [25] In light of those findings, Pigeon J. determined that the note in issue 
  was not a bill of exchange.</p>
<p> [26] Justice Pigeon then considered whether Range was distinguishable from 
  Killoran v. Monticello State Bank.<a name="r8"></a><a href="#8">[8]</a> Killoran 
  was an earlier decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which the court found 
  that a promissory note appended to a conditional sales contract on a perforated 
  page was severable from the conditional sales contract, and that the promissory 
  note met the statutory requirement of being an unconditional promise to pay. 
  Justice Pigeon relied on the presence of a cut-off clause in the Killoran conditional 
  sales contract expressly stipulating that the obligation under the note was 
  unconditional, and that &quot;it would enure to the benefit of any holder of 
  the note, notwithstanding anything which might take place between the purchaser 
  and the vendor as a result of the conditional sale&quot;. Justice Pigeon said, 
  &quot;[n]o such provision appears in the case at bar, and I would even go so 
  far as to say that the clause in the contract relating to the &quot;note&quot; 
  implies the contrary&quot; [emphasis added]. </p>
<p> V. The Trial Judge's Reasons <a name="r9"></a><a href="#9">[9]</a> </p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge found that the Notes were unconditional on their face and 
  therefore concluded that they were promissory notes within the meaning of s. 
  176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act. He distinguished this case from Range on 
  the basis that, unlike Belvedere Finance Corp, at the time the Bank of Montreal 
  negotiated the Notes, it did not have notice of a failure of consideration. 
  Further, the trial judge held that the decision in Range was directed at consumer 
  notes made on the same piece of paper as the underlying instalment contract. 
  He also said at p. 11 of the reasons for judgment: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ignoring the fact that the Notes in question clearly constitute unconditional 
  promises to pay on their face would frustrate the fundamental purpose of the 
  statute to facilitate business transactions and to create flexible negotiable 
  instruments.</p>
<p>
  VI. Analysis </p>
<p>
  Did the trial judge err in holding that the Notes were unconditional promises 
  to pay within the meaning of s. 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act? </p>
<p>
  [28] The investors' main submission on appeal is that the trial judge erred 
  in concluding that this case is distinguishable from Range. In particular, the 
  investors contend that, in determining whether the Notes are unconditional promises 
  to pay, the trial judge erred by referring to the fact that the Bank of Montreal 
  did not have notice of a total failure of consideration.</p>
<p>
  [29] Relying on Range, the investors claim that the Notes cannot be read separately 
  from the other documents that were included in the Booklets. They submit that 
  this case should not be decided based on any superficial distinction that may 
  exist between a contract and a note contained on one page, separated by a perforated 
  line (Range), and a longer agreement in a bound volume containing a note with 
  a perforated edge (this case). Moreover, the investors contend that the absence 
  of a cut-off clause, such as was present in Killoran, supports their position 
  that the Notes should be construed in conjunction with the General Agreement 
  and Appended Contracts.</p>
<p>
  [30] Finally, the investors submit that, just as in Range, the circumstances 
  of this case require that their promises to pay be read as being subject to 
  an implied condition, namely that payment was contingent on delivery of the 
  article that was sold, which, in this case, is registered title to the condominium 
  units.</p>
<p>
  [31] I do not accept the investors' submissions. In my view, this case is distinguishable 
  from Range. I conclude that the Notes meet the statutory requirement of being 
  unconditional promises to pay for four reasons.</p>
<p>
  [32] First, as the investors' acknowledged at trial, the Notes themselves contain 
  no conditions. Accordingly, on their face, the Notes meet the statutory requirement 
  of being unconditional promises to pay.</p>
<p>
  [33] Second, in my view, the conclusion in Range that the note should not be 
  read independently from the conditional sales contract was based on more than 
  the simple fact that the contract and the note were appended. Most significantly, 
  when distinguishing Range from Killoran, Pigeon J. referred to the clause in 
  the conditional sale contract specifying that the note was given as evidence 
  of the deferred payments but not in payment of them and found that that clause 
  implied that the note did not stand independently from the conditional sales 
  contract. There is no similar provision in the General Agreement and Appended 
  Contracts. Moreover, the clause in the Purchase Agreement requiring that the 
  purchasers provide the Notes, in effect recognizes them as separate instruments. 
  In my view, the absence of a cut-off clause is a neutral factor, which neither 
  supports nor detracts from the investors' position.</p>
<p> [34] Third, I agree with the trial judge's statement that, apart from consumer 
  transactions, &quot;the fundamental purpose of the [Bills of Exchange Act is] 
  to facilitate business transactions and to create flexible negotiable instruments&quot;.<a name="r10"></a><a href="#10">[10]</a> 
  I also agree that it would frustrate the purposes of the Bills of Exchange Act 
  to hold that an apparently unconditional promissory note must be interpreted 
  in conjunction with a related contract on the sole ground that it is appended 
  to that contract by a perforated edge. I conclude that additional factors, such 
  as the clause in the Range conditional sale contract referred to by Pigeon J., 
  are necessary to mandate such an interpretation. As there are no such factors 
  present in this case, I conclude that the Notes are severable from the other 
  documents contained in the Booklets and that they should be read independently 
  from those documents.</p>
<p>
  [35] Fourth, even if the Notes are not severable from the other documents in 
  the Booklets, I specifically reject the investors' submission that, just as 
  in Range, the circumstances of this case require that their promises to pay 
  be read as being subject to an implied condition. The investors submit that 
  Range stands for the proposition that the courts will imply a term that a promise 
  to pay is conditional where it is necessary and appropriate to do so. They say 
  that, in Range, Pigeon J. acted to remedy a problem relating to consumer vulnerability 
  and they rely on the acknowledgement in the Agreed Statement of Facts that they 
  had no understanding of the legal consequences of signing a promissory note 
  to assert that their circumstances are similar. </p>
<p>
  [36] Assuming that Pigeon J. implied a term into the conditional sale contract 
  in Range, in my view, he did so to interpret the contract in a commercially 
  reasonable way and not to address any issue of consumer vulnerability. In Range, 
  the conditional sale contract contained an explicit term releasing the purchaser 
  from further liability for payment in the event the vendor repossessed the coat. 
  In light of that provision, Pigeon J. found, as a matter of logic, that, if 
  the coat was never delivered, there could be no obligation to pay. </p>
<p>
  [37] Here, not only is there no provision similar to that relied on by Pigeon 
  J., the investors' Purchase Agreements and the Notes make it clear that the 
  investors were obliged to commence paying the Notes prior to the Transfer Date. 
  In my view, there is no basis for implying a term that payment of the Notes 
  was conditional on Reemark fulfilling its obligation to transfer registered 
  title.</p>
<p> [38] Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. <a name="r11"></a><a href="#11">[11]</a> 
</p>
<p>
  VII. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [39] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at 
  $12,450 plus G.S.T. and disbursements as agreed by the parties.</p>

  in the Joint Compendium stipulates a projected Transfer Date of December 30, 
  1990 in paragraph 11.03 and in paragraph 12.01. However, the Agreed Statement 
  of Facts and the trial judge refer to a projected Transfer Date of September 
  30, 1990. The projected Transfer Date was subject to acceleration or extension 
  as specified in the Purchase Agreement, but no such change took place.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a><a href="#r4">[4]</a> A sample Offering Memorandum for one 
  of the buildings indicates that it was anticipated that that building would 
  operate at a loss for at least an initial period.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><a href="#r5">[5]</a> The Agreed Statement of Fact indicates 
  that &#147;all but one of the Investors&#146; Promissory Notes were sold by 
  Reemark to the Bank&#148; during this period. However, no separate issues were 
  raised on appeal concerning the remaining promissory note.</p>
<p><a name="6"></a><a href="#r6">[6]</a> Paragraph 2 of a sample Purchase Agreement

<p><a name="7"></a><a href="#r7">[7]</a> The condition read as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">1. Title to the articles being sold pursuant to this contract 
  shall remain in the vendor until the full purchase price with respect to this 
  conditional sale has been paid: in the event of default by the purchaser in 
  making payments in accordance with the conditions contained herein, vendor shall 
  have the option of demanding immediate payment of the instalments which have 
  fallen due, or of repossessing the said articles without liability, and without 
  being required to repay money already received by it on account of the purchase 
  price under this conditional sale, in which case purchaser shall not be liable 
  for the balance of the purchase price owing on this conditional sale. </p>

<p><a name="9"></a><a href="#r9">[9]</a> The investors raised three issues at 
  trial. However, it is unnecessary that I set out a complete summary of the trial 
  judge&#146;s reasons in order to dispose of the issues raised on this appeal.</p>
<p><a name="10"></a><a href="#r10">[10]</a> See for example, J.S. Ziegel, B. G&eacute;va

<p><a name="11"></a><a href="#r11">[11]</a> The investors raised a second ground 
  of appeal relating to whether they had a valid defence to the Notes if the Notes 
  are not valid bills of exchange. As their second ground of appeal was premised 
  on the success of their first ground, it is unnecessary that I deal with the 
  second ground.</p>
