<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John F. McGarry of the Superior Court
  of Justice dated January 8, 2003.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.:</p>
<p>
  Nature of Appeal</p>
<p> [1] The Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (&quot;ETA&quot;), provides for 
  the collection of funds due to the federal government respecting the Goods and 
  Services Tax and for the transmission of these monies by those who collect them. 
  When funds that have been collected have not been remitted, the Canada Customs 
  and Revenue Agency (the &quot;CCRA&quot;) sends a Notice to Pay to account debtors 
  of the tax debtor (the company that was to remit the GST collected). The issue 
  in this appeal is whether a Notice to Pay, received by creditors of the tax 
  debtor prior to the tax debtor's assignment in bankruptcy but remitted after 
  the assignment, gives the CCRA priority over the tax debtor's secured creditors. 
  It is common ground that ordinarily a garnishee that is received prior to an 
  assignment in bankruptcy but that has not been executed does not take priority 
  over the rights of secured creditors. The issue on this appeal is whether s. 
  317 of the ETA, which creates a statutory garnishee, yields the same result. 
  Section 317(3) states:</p>
<p class="indent">
  s. 317.(3) Despite any other provision of this Part, any other enactment of
  Canada other than the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, any enactment of a province
  or any law, if the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a particular person
  is, or will become within one year, liable to make payment</p>
<p class="indent">(a)	to a tax debtor,
or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to a secured creditor who has right to receive the payment
  that, but for a security interest in favour of the secured creditor, would
  be payable
    to the
tax debtor,</p>
<p class="indent">the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the particular
  person to pay without delay, if the moneys are payable immediately, and in
  any other
  case as
and when the moneys become payable, the moneys otherwise payable to the tax debtor
or the secured creditor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account
of the tax debtor's liability under this Part, and on receipt of that notice
by the particular person, the amount of those moneys that is so required to be
paid to the Receiver General shall, despite any security interest in those moneys,
become the property of Her Majesty in right of Canada to the extent of that liability
as assessed by the Minister and shall be paid to the Receiver General in priority
to any such security interest.</p>
<p>
Facts</p>
<p>
[2] BMO was the banker of Vita Pharm, a vitamin manufacturer which executed a
general security Agreement which, in turn, was filed under the Personal Property
Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 ("PPSA") against the debtor's
accounts receivable. Vita Pharm owed the Bank approximately $2,000,000 with respect
to outstanding loans.</p>
<p>
[3] On February 22, 2001 the CCRA served Vita Pharm with a Requirement to Pay,
in the sum of $133,099.36 relating to GST owed under the ETA. The following day,
February 23, 2001 the Bank of Montreal, (the "Bank") issued a petition
for a Receiving Order against Vita Pharm. On March 8, 2001 Vita Pharm was adjudged
bankrupt and a Receiving Order was made against it under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Act (the "BIA"). </p>
<p>
[4] On February 27, 2001, the CCRA issued a further Requirement to Pay for the
same amount plus accumulated interest for a total of $133,319.82 to eighteen
account debtors of Vita Pharm in respect of the GST debt.</p>
<p>
[5]	On March 8, 2001 a Trustee was appointed. </p>
<p>
[6] Subsequent to March 8, 2001, the CCRA received funds in excess of the amount
owing and forwarded the excess to the trustee. Currently, there is still more
than $1,000,000 owed to BMO and there are no assets available for security. </p>
<p>
[7] The issue below was whether the bankruptcy of Vita Pharm affected the right
of CCRA to receive payment under the Requirements to Pay issued prior to the
date of bankruptcy. </p>
<p>
[8] The application judge held that the Crown issued its Requirement to Pay before
the bankruptcy, and thus, pursuant to the clear wording of s. 317 (3) of the
ETA the money became the property of the Crown to the extent of the GST liability.
He dismissed the Bank's application. </p>
<p>
[9] The Bank submits that the application judge erred and that the Receiving
Order made against Vita Pharm takes precedence over and stays the rights of the
CCRA to receive payments under the Requirements to Pay.</p>
<p>
Analysis</p>
<p>
[10]	I would disagree with the Bank's submission. As the application judge
held, on receipt of the Requirement to Pay the funds become the property of Her
Majesty to the extent of Vita Pharm's liability as assessed by the Minister.
Vita Pharm has no residual right in the funds and so the Trustee cannot acquire
any rights. Vita Pharm's bankruptcy cannot give the Bank any right to the
funds because they never became the property of the Trustee. </p>
<p>
[11] This interpretation is supported by the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Alberta (Treasury Branches) v. M.R.N., [1996] 1 S.C.R. 963 at 971.
In that case the court observed that section 224 (1.2) of the Income Tax Act,
S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63, provides for a statutory garnishment remedy identical
to the one provided for in s. 317 of the ETA where a company or individual has
failed to remit GST that was collected as required by the provisions of the ETA.
At paras. 38 and 39 Cory J. for the majority stated:</p>
<p class="indent">
In Friesen, supra, it was held that the words of the Income Tax Act should be
given their plain and ordinary meaning in accordance with the structure and purpose
of the Act. It is clear that in enacting the sections of the ITA and ETA under
consideration Parliament was attempting to ensure the priority of the claim of
the MNR over that of other creditors. The primary task of collecting and remitting
taxes and contributions under both Acts rests with those who are employers and
those who sell goods and services. These amounts so collected could be said to
belong not to the collecting debtor entities but to the government. In a sense
the funds collected but not remitted might be considered to be held in a form
of trust since the entities that have collected these funds are not in any circumstances
entitled to retain them. Rather, they must remit the funds. In those circumstances
the priority granted to the MNR cannot possibly be said to be expropriation without
compensation.</p>
<p>
In an effort to ensure the recovery of these amounts collected for the MNR, Parliament
has endeavoured to ensure the priority of the claims of the MNR to these funds
over other creditors. The majority of the courts that have considered this issue
since the 1990 amendment have concluded that Parliament has succeeded in achieving
this aim [citations omitted].</p>
<p>
[12] Those words are equally applicable to this case. In essence s. 317(3) provides
a form of garnishment enabling the federal government to intercept monies owed
to tax debtors. Once a notice to pay is served, the funds acquired thereafter
never become the property of the tax debtor. </p>
<p> [13] The money in the hands of the creditors of the tax account debtors are 
  not just any funds due to any tax debtor. The tax debtor is a conduit for the 
  transmission of tax collected by it for the CCRA. The account debtors of the 
  tax debtor are the instrument by which the debtor transmits the tax he was required 
  to collect to the CCRA: See by analogy Quebec (Deputy Minister of Revenue) v. 
  Giguere (Trustee of) (1998), 2 C.B.R. (4th) 292 at 298 aff'd [2001] J.Q. no 
  4825. </p>
<p>
[14] The appellant submits that under s. 70(1) of the BIA a receiving order takes
precedence over a garnishment that has not been completely executed by payment
being made because s. 317(3) of the ETA is made subject to the BIA. Otherwise,
the appellant submits the court would not be giving effect to the words, "other
than the BIA". The words "other than the BIA" have meaning
apart from the interpretation suggested by the appellant. They mean that any
GST payments that become due after a receiving order in Bankruptcy has been made
no longer can be collected in priority to other creditors. </p>
<p>
[15] In my opinion the contrary interpretation in Forget et al. v. Quebec (Deputy
Minister of Revenue), [2003] J. Q. no 1026 (C.S.) is not correct and is inconsistent
with the authorities I have mentioned above. The decision overlooks the distinction
made in Giguere, supra, between an ordinary debt and one owed to the government
such as income tax from source deductions of tax from employees where the tax
debtor is only a conduit of funds for the government.</p>
<p>
[16] I would dismiss the appeal. No costs being requested there are no costs
of the appeal.</p>
