<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John S. Poupore of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 11, 2002 and reported at (2002), 16 C.P.C. (5th) 105. 
  </p> <P>
  BY THE COURT:</p> 
<P> [1] The appellants appeal the order of Poupore J. dated January 11, 2002, 
  striking the claims and denying leave to add proposed claims advanced on behalf 
  of the estates of nineteen deceased individuals (&quot;the estate claims&quot;) 
  and on behalf of 189 individuals (&quot;the secondary plaintiffs&quot;)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  who claim damages for breach of fiduciary duty, and for loss of guidance, care 
  and companionship under s. 61 of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (&quot;FLA&quot;). 
</p>
<P>
  [2] The order was made following the hearing of two motions. One motion was 
  brought by the appellants to sever certain claims made by individuals in actions 
  other than the present one, to consolidate the severed claim to this action, 
  and to amend the statement of claim by adding certain plaintiffs. The respondents 
  brought a cross-motion under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure to strike 
  out the claims advanced on behalf of the estates and the secondary plaintiffs, 
  on the ground that they disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The respondents 
  also opposed the addition of further estate claimants and secondary plaintiffs 
  to the action, on the same ground. This appeal concerns the motions judge's 
  decision on the cross-motion striking the claims advanced by the estates and 
  by the secondary plaintiffs, and his decision on the motion denying leave to 
  add like claimants to the existing action. </p> <P>
  [3] In our view, the motions judge was correct in striking and disallowing the 
  estate claims and the claims under the FLA on the basis that they disclosed 
  no reasonable cause of action. The secondary plaintiffs' claims for breach of 
  fiduciary duty were also properly dismissed, except as against the federal Crown. 
  In respect of the latter, we conclude that the motions judge erred in finding 
  that it was plain and obvious that the claims cannot succeed. </p> <P>
  FACTS</p> <P>
  [4] The fifty-six plaintiffs, referred to as &quot;Males&quot; and &quot;Females&quot; 
  in the existing and proposed amended statement of claim, are identified in the 
  pleading as Indians. The Males and Females will be referred to collectively 
  as &quot;the primary plaintiffs.&quot; The primary plaintiffs advance individual 
  claims stemming from their attendance, for a period of time between 1934 and 
  1960, at St. Peter Claver Industrial School for males and St. Joseph School 
  for females. The two schools were located near Spanish, Ontario. They were residential 
  schools established by the federal government, as represented in this action 
  by the defendants the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister for Indian 
  and Northern Affairs. It is alleged that the residential schools were established 
  to implement a government policy &quot;the objective of which was to eradicate 
  aboriginal cultures and to effect the assimilation of Indians into the non-aboriginal 
  white Christian Canadian society.&quot; The residential schools were run respectively 
  by the defendants, The Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada, and The Daughters of 
  the Immaculate Heart of Mary. It is alleged that both schools fell under the 
  supervision of the remaining defendants, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sault 
  Ste. Marie and the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Sault 
  Ste. Marie. </p> <P>
  [5] The primary plaintiffs claim damages for a variety of causes of action including 
  assault and battery; forcible and wrongful confinement; physical, mental and 
  sexual abuse; forced labour; breach of fiduciary duty; and negligence. Not all 
  of the primary plaintiffs claim for all of these causes of action. The claims 
  advanced by the primary plaintiffs are not contested in this proceeding, save 
  and except for the nineteen estate claims, brought on behalf of deceased former 
  students. The respondents contend that those claims are statute-barred.</p> <P>
  [6] The 189 secondary plaintiffs are identified in the pleading as &quot;family 
  members or relatives&quot; of the primary plaintiffs. However, counsel advised 
  the court that they are all children of the primary plaintiffs. Fifty-six of 
  these secondary plaintiffs are the children of the estate claimants; however, 
  it is not necessary to distinguish between these secondary plaintiffs and the 
  others for the purpose of this appeal. None of the secondary plaintiffs attended 
  the schools, and none was born or conceived at the time their parents attended 
  the schools. </p> <P>
  [7] The secondary plaintiffs claim damages for breach of fiduciary duty. Their 
  claim against the federal government is based on the allegation that, by virtue 
  of the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution Act, 1982, and the provisions 
  of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, as amended from time to time, it owed 
  them, as the generational descendants of the primary plaintiffs, a duty to act 
  as a protector of their aboriginal rights, including the protection and preservation 
  of their language, culture, and their way of life. They allege that, by reason 
  of the application of government policy, they have been deprived of the full 
  benefit of the transmission of their Indian culture from their parents, the 
  primary plaintiffs, and they have been denied the opportunity to achieve a full 
  and normal family, social, and economic life, as has been afforded to other 
  Canadians, and as would have been the case except for the application of the 
  policy. The claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the other defendants 
  is based on their participation, for remuneration, in the implementation of 
  the government policy. </p> <P>
  [8] The secondary plaintiffs also claim damages under s. 61 of the FLA for loss 
  of guidance, care and companionship that each could reasonably have expected 
  to receive from the primary plaintiffs, if the latter had not suffered the abuse 
  resulting from the implementation of the policy.</p> <P>
  [9] The motions judge struck the secondary plaintiffs' claims from the statement 
  of claim as not disclosing a cause of action. The claim for breach of fiduciary 
  duty was struck on the basis that none of the secondary plaintiffs were either 
  born or conceived at the time of the alleged breach of duty. By reason of that 
  fact, the motions judge held that the secondary plaintiffs could not prove the 
  existence of a fiduciary relationship between themselves and the defendants 
  at the time that their parents were residents at the schools. He held further 
  that no material facts were pleaded in support of their claim for breach of 
  fiduciary duty, save and except as against the federal government, and even 
  in respect of the claim against the latter, there were insufficient facts to 
  support it. </p> <P>
  [10] The motions judge struck the secondary plaintiffs' claims under the FLA 
  on the basis that they fell outside the purview of s. 61 because none of the 
  family relationships with the primary plaintiffs was in existence at the time 
  that the tortious conduct occurred. Further, he held that, because the tortious 
  conduct occurred prior to the legislative enactment of the right of action, 
  to allow the claim would result in a retroactive and therefore impermissible 
  application of the statute. </p> <P>
  [11] Finally, the motions judge struck the estate claims on the basis that they 
  were barred by virtue of s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.3.</p> <P>
  ISSUES</p> <P>
  [12] The three issues in this appeal are as follows:</p> <P>
  (1) Did the motions judge err in striking the secondary plaintiffs' claims for 
  breach of fiduciary duty?</p> <P>
  (2) Did the motions judge err in striking the secondary plaintiffs' Family Law 
  Act claims?</p> <P>
  (3) Did the motions judge err in striking the estate claims as statute-barred?</p> <P>
  ANALYSIS</p> <P>
  [13] All parties agree that the correct test to be applied on a motion to strike 
  all or part of a statement of claim under Rule 21.01(1)(a) or (b) is whether 
  it is &quot;plain and obvious&quot; that the statement of claim discloses no 
  reasonable cause of action: see Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. 
  As Wilson J. noted in Hunt, this test is rooted in the need for courts to ensure 
  that their process is not abused. However, as she noted at p. 977, &quot;[t]he 
  fact that the case the plaintiff wishes to present may involve complex issues 
  of fact and law or may raise a novel legal proposition should not prevent a 
  plaintiff from proceeding with his action.&quot; Although the appellants concede 
  that the motions judge relied on the correct test, they submit that he erred 
  in applying it, by failing to recognize that the novelty of their claims provided 
  no basis for striking them at this stage of the proceeding. </p> <P>
  [14] In our view, the motions judge instructed himself in accordance with the 
  correct test. We do not read his reasons as dismissing the claims simply because 
  they were novel. Indeed, he expressly stated that it would be improper to dismiss 
  the claims on that basis. Rather, he dismissed them because, in his view, they 
  were not tenable at law. As counsel for the appellants properly conceded at 
  the hearing, the novelty of a claim, in and of itself, provides no reason for 
  allowing it to proceed if it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action. 
  </p> <P>
  (1) Did the motions judge err in striking the secondary plaintiffs' claims for 
  breach of fiduciary duty?</p> <P>
  a) The motions judge's decision</p> <P>
  [15] The motions judge held that, in order to sustain a cause of action for 
  breach of fiduciary duty, the secondary plaintiffs must establish a fiduciary 
  relationship between the parties and conduct by the fiduciary that is in breach 
  of that relationship. He then referred to the common characteristics that usually 
  serve to identify fiduciary relationships, as set out by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in Lac Minerals v. International Corona Resources Ltd., [1989] 2 S.C.R. 
  574 at 577-78:</p> 
<P class="indent"> (1) The fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion 
  or power;</p>
<P class="indent">(2) The fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion 
  so as to affect the beneficiary's legal or practical interests; and </p>
<P class="indent">(3) The beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy 
  of the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.</p>
<P>
  [16] With respect to the Crown, the motions judge stated as follows at paras. 
  37-38: </p> 
<P class="indent"> The Federal Government removed the Residents from the care 
  of their parents and assumed that role. The Residents were placed in boarding 
  schools where all decisions affecting their interests were made for them. </p>
<P class="indent">I am satisfied that by virtue of the Constitution Act of 1867 
  [sic] the provisions of the Indian Act as amended and with the implementation 
  of the &quot;residential school policy' for the education of children, the Federal 
  Government assumed a duty to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the 
  education of aboriginal peoples. I come to this conclusion after reviewing the 
  decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 
  335 and in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075.</p>
<P>
  [17] The motions judge then noted, and correctly so, that the issue was not 
  whether the primary plaintiffs could prove that the Crown owed them a fiduciary 
  duty but whether their children, the secondary plaintiffs, could do so despite 
  the fact that none was yet born at the relevant time. He concluded that it was 
  plain and obvious that they could not because no fiduciary duty may be owed 
  to a non-existent individual at the time of the alleged breach. He stated as 
  follows at para. 42:</p> 
<P class="indent"> It is plain and obvious that the secondary plaintiffs are not 
  able to prove the existence of a fiduciary relationship between themselves and 
  the defendants at the time that their parents were residents at the Schools. 
  There is therefore no substantive question of law in the secondary plaintiffs' 
  claim for breach of fiduciary duty that can go to trial. </p> 
<P>
  [18] As noted earlier, the motions judge held further that no material facts 
  were pleaded in support of the secondary plaintiffs' claim for breach of fiduciary 
  duty, save and except as against the federal government, and even in respect 
  of the claim against the latter, he expressed the view that there were insufficient 
  facts to support it. </p> <P>
  [19] The appellants did not present any argument in this court in support of 
  their claim for breach of fiduciary duty against those defendants other than 
  the federal Crown. We see no reason to interfere with the motions judge's finding 
  that the pleading did not present, let alone support, a claim against them. 
  We will therefore deal with this ground of appeal only as it relates to the 
  Crown.</p> <P>
  b) The position of the parties</p> <P>
  [20] The secondary plaintiffs submit that the fiduciary relationship between 
  the Crown and the aboriginal peoples of Canada is well-recognized. It is a relationship 
  that is rooted in history, not in the pleading. They submit that the nature 
  of this relationship gives rises to a presumption of fiduciary obligations owed 
  by the Crown to aboriginal peoples in general and, more specifically, to themselves. 
  </p> <P>
  [21] In particular, the secondary plaintiffs submit that fiduciary obligations 
  arose by reason of the fact that the Crown, in establishing the residential 
  schools, embarked upon a unilateral undertaking related to the education, housing 
  and social development of aboriginal peoples. They allege that the residential 
  schools were established to implement a governmental policy, the objective of 
  which was to bring about the eradication of the aboriginal culture, past, present 
  and future. Hence they submit that it was foreseeable, if not intended by the 
  Crown, that the long-term consequence of its actions would deprive not only 
  the primary plaintiffs, but also their generational descendants, of their culture, 
  history and status as a nation. In these circumstances, they submit that the 
  fiduciary obligations arising from the Crown's actions extended not only to 
  the residents of the schools but also to themselves as the members of the next 
  generation. </p> <P>
  [22] In the alternative, the secondary plaintiffs submit that, even if the long-term 
  effect of the residential school policy could not be said to be a breach of 
  the fiduciary duty owed to them, the Crown's failure to take corrective measures 
  to restore to the secondary plaintiffs their culture, history and status, is 
  itself a breach of the fiduciary duty. </p> <P>
  [23] The Crown submits that the secondary plaintiffs have not pleaded any facts 
  to support the allegation that a fiduciary duty was owed to them, as children 
  of the former students at the schools. It is submitted that the pleading discloses 
  none of the essential ingredients necessary to found a fiduciary relationship 
  between the parties. In this respect, the Crown stresses the importance of the 
  fact that none of the secondary plaintiffs were born or even conceived when 
  the acts complained of are said to have occurred. </p> <P>
  [24] The Crown submits further that an Indian right is a collective right, not 
  an individual right and that the secondary plaintiffs have not pleaded any facts 
  to support a collective claim. In this respect, the Crown notes in its factum 
  that &quot;[p]resumably the secondary plaintiffs are advancing their fiduciary 
  duty claims on the basis that they are the children of 'native Indians' even 
  though they have not pleaded that they themselves are members of any aboriginal 
  collectivity.&quot; The Crown therefore submits that the secondary plaintiffs' 
  claims are in effect individual claims based on alleged breaches of fiduciary 
  duty owed to each of them by virtue of familial relationships only. </p> <P>
  [25] Finally, the Crown submits that the law has always distinguished between 
  an unborn child and a child after birth. It is the Crown's position that the 
  secondary plaintiffs are asking the court to ignore this distinction and to 
  take a further step in recognizing a duty of care owed to future generations 
  of children not yet conceived. The Crown submits that this approach would give 
  rise to the spectre of indeterminate liability and, moreover, would constitute 
  a radical extension of the common law that is properly within the purview of 
  the legislature, not the court. </p> <P>
  c) Analysis</p> <P>
  [26] It is important to note at the outset that, in order to prove the existence 
  of a fiduciary duty, it is not sufficient for the appellants to rely solely 
  on the general fiduciary nature of the relationship between the Crown and the 
  aboriginal peoples of Canada. In Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (National 
  Energy Board), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 159, the Supreme Court of Canada stated as follows 
  at p. 183:</p> 
<P class="indent"> It is now well settled that there is a fiduciary relationship 
  between the federal Crown and the aboriginal peoples of Canada: Guerin v. The 
  Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335. Nonetheless, it must be remembered that not every 
  aspect of the relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary takes the form 
  of a fiduciary obligation: Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources 
  Ltd., [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574. The nature of the relationship between the parties 
  defines the scope, and the limits, of the duties that will be imposed. </p> 
<P>
  [27] More recently, in Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, Binnie J., 
  writing for the Court, reviewed some of the relevant jurisprudence on the various 
  fiduciary obligations that have been imposed on the Crown as a result of its 
  relationship with the aboriginal peoples. He then stated the following at para. 
  81: </p> 
<P class="indent"> But there are limits. The appellants seemed at times to invoke 
  the &quot;fiduciary duty&quot; as a source of plenary Crown liability covering 
  all aspects of the Crown-Indian band relationship. This overshoots the mark. 
  The fiduciary duty imposed on the Crown does not exist at large but in relation 
  to specific Indian interests [emphasis added].</p> 
<P>
  [28] Binnie J. then noted at para. 82 that &quot;[s]ince Guerin, Canadian courts 
  have experienced a flood of 'fiduciary duty' claims by Indian bands across a 
  whole spectrum of possible complaints&quot; and he cited several cases by way 
  of example. The cases that he cited involved claims to structure elections; 
  to require the provision of social services; to rewrite negotiated provisions; 
  to cover moving expenses; to suppress public access to information about band 
  affairs; to require legal aid funding; to compel registration to individuals 
  under the Indian Act; and to invalidate a consent signed by an Indian mother 
  to the adoption of her child. Binnie J. then stated as follows at para. 83:</p> 
<P class="indent"> I offer no comment about the correctness of the disposition 
  of these particular cases on the facts, none of which are before us for decision, 
  but I think it desirable for the Court to affirm the principle, already mentioned, 
  that not all obligations existing between the parties to a fiduciary relationship 
  are themselves fiduciary in nature (Lac Minerals, supra, at p. 597), and that 
  this principle applies to the relationship between the Crown and aboriginal 
  peoples. It is necessary, then, to focus on the particular obligation or interest 
  that is the subject matter of the particular dispute and whether or not the 
  Crown had assumed discretionary control in relation thereto sufficient to ground 
  a fiduciary obligation [emphasis added].</p> 
<P>
  [29] The question here, of course, is not whether the secondary plaintiffs' 
  claims for breach of fiduciary duty, as pleaded, would likely or probably succeed 
  at trial but whether it is plain and obvious that they would not. In considering 
  this question, the facts as pleaded must be taken as proven.</p> <P>
  [30] As noted earlier, the Crown's submissions, in large part, are based on 
  the fact that none of the secondary plaintiffs were born or conceived at the 
  time of the alleged wrong. The motions judge accepted the Crown's position. 
  In our view, the Crown's submissions would be more persuasive if the claims 
  in question were individual claims founded in tort. The question would then 
  arise whether a remedy could be sought for a wrong that occurred long before 
  each plaintiff was born or conceived. In order to prove their claims, the plaintiffs 
  would have to establish the existence of a duty of care in accordance with the 
  test set out in Cooper v. Hobart, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537 and in Edwards v. Law 
  Society of Upper Canada, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562. In applying this test, even on 
  a Rule 21 motion (Edwards was a pleadings case), the court could conclude, as 
  the motions judge did in this case, that none of the secondary plaintiffs could 
  prove that a duty of care was owed to him or her because there was not sufficient 
  proximity between the parties at the time the wrong occurred. The court could 
  further conclude, as is argued by the Crown in this case, that to allow such 
  a claim would constitute a radical extension of the common law of tort, a matter 
  that should be left to the legislature. See for example, Winnipeg Child and 
  Family Services (Northwest Area) v. D.F.G., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 925, where the court 
  refused to extend common law principles of tort where the change would, among 
  other things, overturn the rule that rights accrue to a person only at birth, 
  and recognize a fetal right to sue the mother carrying the fetus. </p> <P>
  [31] However, the secondary plaintiffs' claims for breach of fiduciary duty 
  are not founded in tort. Fiduciary law is a creature of equity. Different considerations 
  apply. The claim for breach of fiduciary duty, in both its foundation and scope, 
  is conceptually different from tort law. See, for example, Norberg v. Wynrib, 
  [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226 where McLachlin J. (as she then was) stated at p. 272: </p> 
<P class="indent"> The foundation and ambit of the fiduciary obligation are conceptually 
  distinct from the foundation and ambit of contract and tort. Sometimes the doctrines 
  may overlap in their application, but that does not destroy their conceptual 
  and functional uniqueness. In negligence and contract the parties are taken 
  to be independent and equal actors, concerned primarily with their own self-interest. 
  Consequently, the law seeks a balance between enforcing obligations by awarding 
  compensation when those obligations are breached, and preserving optimum freedom 
  for those involved in the relationship in question. The essence of a fiduciary 
  relationship, by contrast, is that one party exercises power on behalf of another 
  and pledges himself or herself to act in the best interests of the other.</p> 
<P>
  [32] Further, as Binnie J.'s review of the law in Wewaykum Indian Band reveals, 
  fiduciary law in Canada, particularly in respect of the Crown's relationship 
  with aboriginal peoples, is a very dynamic area of Canadian law. The nature 
  and extent of the particular obligations that may arise out of this relationship 
  are matters that remain largely unsettled in the jurisprudence. </p> <P>
  [33] This state of the law does not mean, of course, that any claim for breach 
  of fiduciary duty arising out of the relationship between the Crown and the 
  aboriginal peoples of Canada must necessarily survive the pleading stage. The 
  same test under Rule 21 applies to this kind of action. It does mean, however, 
  that more claims of this nature may be, as of yet, unprecedented but nonetheless 
  tenable at law within the meaning of Rule 21. </p> <P>
  [34] In this case, it is clear that there is a fiduciary relationship between 
  the federal Crown and the secondary plaintiffs as aboriginal people. We do not 
  agree with the Crown's contention that the pleading discloses none of the essential 
  ingredients necessary to found a fiduciary relationship because the claims for 
  breach of fiduciary duty are in effect nothing more than individual claims based 
  on family relationships and not claims as aboriginal people. While this can 
  be said of their FLA claims, it is our view that the pleading goes beyond those 
  claims and is sufficient to establish the fiduciary nature of the relationship 
  between the Crown and the secondary plaintiffs as an aboriginal people. </p> <P>
  [35] As noted earlier, however, the existence of a fiduciary relationship, in 
  and of itself, does not suffice. There must be a particular context that could 
  give rise to the imposition of a fiduciary obligation. In this respect, we agree 
  with the motions judge's conclusion that, with the implementation of the &quot;residential 
  school policy&quot;, the federal Crown &quot;assumed a duty to act in a fiduciary 
  capacity with respect to the education of aboriginal peoples.&quot; However, 
  in the factual context of this case, we do not agree with his further conclusion 
  that it is plain and obvious that the fiduciary duty did not extend to the secondary 
  plaintiffs simply on the basis that they were not yet in existence at the time. 
  This ignores the essence of the secondary plaintiffs' claim. They allege that 
  the very purpose of the Crown's assumption of control over the primary plaintiffs 
  was to strip the Indian children of their culture and identity, thereby removing, 
  as and when they became adults, their ability &quot;to pass on to succeeding 
  generations the spiritual, cultural and behavioural bases of their people.&quot; 
  Hence, the secondary plaintiffs claim that they were specifically targeted by 
  the governmental policy. They further allege that they were profoundly and adversely 
  affected as a result. </p> <P>
  [36] In these circumstances, we do not find that this is an appropriate case 
  to determine in summary fashion whether the fiduciary duty extended to the secondary 
  plaintiffs without the benefit of an evidentiary record. We would therefore 
  give effect to this ground of appeal. </p> <P>
  (2) Did the motions judge err in striking the secondary plaintiffs' Family Law 
  Act claims?</p> <P>
  [37] The motions judge struck the secondary plaintiffs' FLA claims on the basis 
  that they disclosed no reasonable cause of action. His analysis focused on two 
  sub-issues: whether the requisite family relationship under s. 61 of the FLA 
  must have been in existence at the time of the tortious conduct, and whether 
  allowing recovery under the FLA for wrongful acts that occurred prior to the 
  enactment of the FLA (or its predecessor, the Family Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 
  1980, c. 152 (FLRA)) would constitute an impermissible retroactive application 
  of the statute. </p> <P>
  [38] Section 61 of the FLA, which is substantially identical to its predecessor, 
  s. 60 of the FLRA, reads as follows:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 61(1) If a person is injured or killed by the fault or neglect 
  of another under circumstances where the person is entitled to recover damages, 
  or would have been entitled if not killed, the spouse, as defined in Part III 
  (Support Obligations), same-sex partner, as defined in Part III, (Support Obligations), 
  children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters of the 
  person are entitled to recover their pecuniary loss resulting from the injury 
  or death from the person from whom the person injured or killed is entitled 
  to recover or would have been entitled if not killed, and to maintain an action 
  for the purpose in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<P class="indent">(2) The damages recoverable in a claim under subsection (1) 
  may include, </p>
<P class="indent">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">(e) an amount to compensate for the loss of guidance, care and 
  companionship that the claimant might reasonably have expected to receive from 
  the person if the injury or death had not occurred.</p>
<P>
  [39] The motions judge first addressed the issue of the existence of a family 
  relationship at the time of the tortious conduct. He began by noting that, prior 
  to the enactment of the FLRA in 1978, there was no cause of action available 
  at common law for family members for loss of guidance, care and companionship. 
  </p> <P>
  [40] Relying on various cases including Pole v. Hendery (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 
  486 (C.A.) and Ficht v. Kitchen (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 495 (H.C.J.), Poupore J. 
  found that the FLRA provision was enacted to protect family relationships from 
  disturbance or destruction due to tortious conduct and, consequently, that a 
  claim cannot be made thereunder unless the family relationship was in existence 
  at the time that the tortious conduct occurred. He relied on Ficht, as well 
  as several other cases, to support his further finding that an individual cannot 
  be born or marry into a claim under the FLA. </p> <P>
  [41] The motions judge rejected the appellants' contention that it was sufficient 
  to show that the requisite relationship was in existence at the time the cause 
  of action was discovered. He held that the discoverability principle is a rule 
  of statutory interpretation, which, when applicable, only postpones the running 
  of a limitation period and does not create a cause of action that would not 
  otherwise exist under the FLA.</p> <P>
  [42] The motions judge noted that none of the primary plaintiffs attended the 
  schools after 1960 and that none of the secondary plaintiffs were born or conceived 
  at the time the primary plaintiffs attended the schools. He therefore concluded 
  that the requisite family relationship did not exist at the time of the alleged 
  tortious conduct and no FLA claims could properly be advanced.</p> <P>
  [43] The motions judge then addressed the second issue of whether allowing these 
  FLA claims would constitute an impermissible retroactive application of the 
  statute. Citing the decision in Yuill v. McMullen (1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 178 (H.C.J.), 
  aff'd (1980), 28 O.R. (2d) 624 (C.A.), among others, he held that neither s. 
  61 of the FLA nor s. 60 of the FLRA operate retroactively. He further found 
  that the tortious conduct occurred at least 18 years and as many as 68 years 
  before any right to claim for such damages rose under the FLRA. He concluded 
  that allowing these claims to proceed would create a new cause of action where 
  one never existed in the past and would result in the retroactive and therefore 
  impermissible application of s. 61 of the FLA.</p> <P>
  [44] The secondary plaintiffs submit that the motions judge erred in striking 
  their FLA claims. They submit that the relevant time that must be considered 
  in respect of both questions, the existence of the requisite relationship and 
  the application of the statute, is not the time when the tortious conduct occurred, 
  but rather the time when the cause of action accrued. They argue that according 
  to the discoverability principle, as set out by the Supreme Court in K.M. v. 
  H.M., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, a cause of action only accrues when a party discovers 
  the connection between the harm suffered and the circumstances from which the 
  harm arose. Consequently, they submit that their derivative claims cannot be 
  determined until after the discoverability principle has been considered in 
  the context of the evidence at trial. </p> <P>
  [45] In our view, the appellants' reliance on the discoverability principle 
  is misguided. Even if the cause of action was not discoverable until after the 
  FLRA or the FLA was in force and the requisite relationship was in existence, 
  the discoverability principle does not create a cause of action where none previously 
  existed. Rather, it is &quot;a general rule applied to avoid the injustice of 
  precluding an action before the person is able to raise it&quot;: see Haberman 
  v. Peixeiro, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549 at para. 36. When applicable, it can postpone 
  the running of a limitation period that would otherwise result in the plaintiff 
  being deprived of a right of action that he or she had at the time of the tortious 
  conduct and which might otherwise be lost as a result of the hidden nature of 
  the injury or damages that would result from the conduct. </p> <P>
  [46] We are in substantial agreement with the motions judge's reasons in respect 
  to the FLA claims. Based on his analysis, it is plain and obvious that the FLA 
  claims brought on behalf of the secondary plaintiffs disclose no reasonable 
  cause of action. The motions judge acted appropriately in striking these claims 
  from the statement of claim. We would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p> <P>
  (3) Did the motions judge err in striking the estate claims as being barred 
  by s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act?</p> <P>
  [47] The motions judge noted that the estate claims were framed in tort or breach 
  of fiduciary duty. He further noted that, at common law, there is no cause of 
  action available to relatives for any tort or injury to a deceased person or 
  to the property of a deceased person. The right of action is found in the Trustee 
  Act and, consequently, the claims are subject to the two-year limitation period 
  prescribed by s. 38(3) of that Act. Relying on Waschkowski v. Hopkinson Estate 
  (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.), he held that the discoverability principle 
  does not apply to overcome the statutory bar imposed by s. 38(3). The action 
  was commenced in November of 1999 but all of the deceased residents died well 
  before November 1997. As the estates had to have brought their actions within 
  two years of the date of death in order to meet the two-year limitation period, 
  the claims were struck.</p> <P>
  [48] In coming to this conclusion, the motions judge rejected the appellants' 
  argument that s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act had no application to these particular 
  plaintiffs because s. 42 of the Indian Act vested administration of &quot;Indian 
  estates&quot; exclusively in the federal government. He held that s. 42 applied 
  to &quot;matters and causes testamentary&quot; and that &quot;matters and causes 
  testamentary&quot; related solely to the grant and revocation of probate of 
  wills and administration and incidental matters.</p> <P>
  [49] We agree with the reasoning and result of the motions judge on those matters.</p> <P>
  [50] The appellants submit that the motions judge erred in failing to consider 
  the contractual or quasi-contractual nature of the estate claims to compensation 
  for unpaid wages. They argue that, as a claim for breach of contract could be 
  sustained at common law, such claims do not depend upon the existence of the 
  Trustee Act and, therefore, are not statute-barred. Consequently, they argue, 
  the motions judge erred in striking the estate claims.</p> <P>
  [51] In addition, they argue that because an action for breach of fiduciary 
  duty is a separate cause of action sounding in neither tort nor contract, it 
  is not an action for personal injury or tort within the meaning of s. 38(1) 
  of the Trustee Act and therefore is not statute-barred by virtue of s. 38(3).</p> <P>
  [52] On a plain reading of s. 38(1) of the Trustee Act, the statutory bar prescribed 
  by s. 38(3) applies to claims advanced by executors or administrators of an 
  estate for &quot;all torts or injuries to the person&quot;:</p> 
<P class="indent"> Actions by executors and administrators for torts</p>
<P class="indent">38. (1) Except in cases of libel and slander, the executor or 
  administrator of any deceased person may maintain an action for all torts or 
  injuries to the person or to the property of the deceased in the same manner 
  and with the same rights and remedies as the deceased would, if living, have 
  been entitled to do, and the damages when recovered shall form part of the personal 
  estate of the deceased; but, if death results from such injuries, no damages 
  shall be allowed for the death or for the loss of the expectation of life, but 
  this proviso is not in derogation of any rights conferred by Part V of the Family 
  Law Act [emphasis added]. </p>
<P class="indent">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">Limitation of actions</p>
<P class="indent">(3) An action under this section shall not be brought after 
  the expiration of two years from the death of the deceased.</p>
<P>
  [53] We reject the argument that s. 38(1) should be restricted in application 
  to torts alone; to do so is to ignore the words &quot;or injuries to the person&quot;. 
  Such an approach is in conflict with the basic principle of statutory interpretation 
  that every word in a statute is to be given meaning. </p> <P>
  [54] In determining whether the estate claims fall within the scope of s. 38(1) 
  of the Trustee Act, the focus is not upon the form of the action but, rather, 
  the nature of the injury. The question to be asked in determining its applicability 
  is whether the alleged wrong constituted an injury to the deceased person. See 
  Smallman v. Moore, [1948] S.C.R. 295, and Roth v. Weston Estate (1997), 36 O.R. 
  (3d) 513 (C.A.). </p> <P>
  [55] Whether the claim for forced labour is framed in tort, contract, quasi-contract 
  or breach of fiduciary duty, the claim is for injury of a personal nature. The 
  core of the alleged wrongdoing is the failure of those running the residential 
  schools to compensate the deceased persons for the work they were forced to 
  perform. In other words, the claims arise out of the treatment that the deceased 
  plaintiffs endured at the residential schools. As such, the claims for forced 
  labour are within the meaning of &quot;injuries to the person&quot;. Accordingly, 
  they fall squarely within the provisions of s. 38(1) of the Trustee Act and 
  are subject to the applicable two-year limitation period in s. 38(3).</p> <P>
  [56] The same analytical approach applies to the estate claims for breach of 
  fiduciary duty. Again, the focus is not upon the form of the action but whether 
  the alleged wrong constitutes an injury to the person. It is apparent that the 
  alleged breaches of fiduciary duty are said to have inflicted injury upon the 
  deceased persons and therefore the claims for breach of fiduciary duty are within 
  the ambit of s. 38(1).</p> <P>
  [57] Where an action is statute-barred against the individual pursuant to the 
  Trustee Act, it is also statute-barred against the Crown by virtue of ss. 3, 
  10 and 24 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50.</p> <P>
  [58] Thus, it is plain and obvious that the estate claims cannot succeed. The 
  motions judge made no error in striking the estate claims and we dismiss this 
  ground of appeal.</p> <P>
  DISPOSITION </p> <P>
  [59] The appeal is allowed in part and the judgment below is varied to accord 
  with these reasons. In light of the divided success, we make no order as to 
  costs as between the appellants and the Crown. The other respondents may, if 
  so advised, file their bills of costs and written submissions within 15 days. 
  The appellants may file their responding submissions on costs within 10 days 
  thereafter.</p>
