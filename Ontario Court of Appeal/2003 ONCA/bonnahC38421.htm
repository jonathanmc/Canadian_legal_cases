<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lynn D. Ratushny of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 21, 2002.</p>   <P>
  DOHERTY J.A.:</p>   <P>
  I</p>   
<P> [1] This appeal comes to this court with leave from the order of Ratushny 
  J. dismissing an application for judicial review.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  There are three issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (the &quot;Board&quot;) have 
    the authority to transfer Zachary Bonnah (&quot;Zachary&quot;) to a different 
    school for safety reasons while an appeal from the decision to change his 
    placement under provisions relating to exceptional pupils was outstanding?</li>
  <li>Did the Board act fairly in ordering Zachary's transfer?</li>
  <li>Was the decision to transfer Zachary for safety reasons supported by the 
    record?</li>
</ul>
<P>
  [2] Events which have transpired since the order granting leave to appeal have 
  settled the question of Zachary's placement within the Board. The appeal has 
  been rendered moot in that any decision this court might make would not affect 
  Zachary's present placement. While a court will usually not hear moot appeals, 
  it has a discretion to do so. I would exercise that discretion in favour of 
  determining the first of the three issues outlined above on its merits. I would 
  not address the merits of the second and third issues. </p>   <P>
  II</p>   <P>
  [3] Zachary is eleven years old and has a variety of disabilities. He functions 
  at the level of a kindergarten child. Zachary is an &quot;exceptional pupil&quot; 
  as that phrase is defined in the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2 (the &quot;Act&quot;). 
  As an exceptional pupil, Zachary's placement and the program provided for him 
  are determined according to a detailed regulatory scheme designed to determine 
  and serve the needs of students who face challenges like those faced by Zachary. 
  </p>   <P>
  [4] Zachary has attended school since he was six years old. From December 1996 
  to March 2000, he attended Clifford Bowey Public School. That school caters 
  to the needs of children with developmental disabilities. Beginning in the fall 
  of 2000, Zachary was placed in a regular class environment at Manor Park Public 
  School. Initially, he was in the regular class on a part-time basis. An educational 
  assistant was provided to help Zachary. In September 2001, Zachary began the 
  school year in a regular grade two class at Manor Park Public School on a full 
  time basis.</p>   <P>
  [5] In October 2001, the principal of Manor Park requested a review Zachary's 
  placement. That request was based in part on safety concerns. Zachary, who acted 
  out on occasion, was much larger than the other children in the grade two classroom. 
  Under the relevant regulation, Zachary's placement was reviewed initially by 
  the Identification Placement and Review Committee (&quot;IPRC&quot;).</p>   <P>
  [6] On October 26, 2001, the IPRC recommended that Zachary be moved from Manor 
  Park back to Clifford Bowey, a segregated placement school. Zachary's parents 
  would not consent to the change in his placement and exercised their rights 
  of appeal. Pursuant to the relevant regulations, Zachary was to remain in his 
  placement in the regular grade two class pending the outcome of the appeals 
  unless his parents agreed to a change. </p>   <P>
  [7] The principal at Manor Park remained concerned about the safety of Zachary, 
  other students and staff. Those concerns were expressed to Zachary's parents 
  and officials at the Board. In late December 2001, Mr. Bonnah was advised that 
  it had been decided that Zachary's continued presence at Manor Park posed an 
  immediate and significant risk to the safety of himself, other students and 
  staff. Mr. Bonnah was told that Zachary would be transferred because of those 
  safety concerns from Manor Park to Clifford Bowey effective when school resumed 
  in January 2002. The school authorities referred to this as an administrative 
  transfer. </p>   <P>
  [8] Mr. Bonnah's appeal from the decision of the IPRC was still outstanding. 
  In Mr. Bonnah's view, the administrative transfer was an attempt to circumvent 
  the stay of the IPRC decision effected by the appeal taken by Mr. Bonnah from 
  that decision. He decided not to send Zachary to Clifford Bowey, but to challenge 
  the Board's action by way of judicial review. Zachary did not return to school 
  in January 2002 and was still not in school when this appeal was heard in December 
  2002. </p>   <P>
  [9] The application for judicial review was dismissed in March 2002. Leave to 
  appeal was granted in June 2002. When leave was granted, the appeal from the 
  decision of the IPRC was still outstanding. On the hearing of this appeal on 
  December 6, 2002, the court received fresh evidence detailing the progress of 
  that appeal. </p>   <P>
  [10] In April and June 2002, the appeal was heard by the Special Education Appeal 
  Board (SEAB). In July 2002, SEAB recommended a semi-integrated placement which 
  combined part time attendance in regular classes with part time placement with 
  other exceptional students. The Board chose to implement some, but not all of 
  the SEAB recommendations.</p>   <P>
  [11] Mr. Bonnah appealed the Board's decision to the Special Education Appeal 
  Tribunal (the &quot;Tribunal&quot;). The appeal was heard in October 2002. The 
  Tribunal issued its interim decision on December 3, 2002 and its final decision 
  on January 14, 2003. The Tribunal allowed the appeal, but did not order that 
  Zachary be placed in Manor Park School. The thrust of the Tribunal's order is 
  set out below:</p>   
<P class="indent"> The Tribunal orders that the Ottawa-Carleton District School 
  Board place Zachary Bonnah forthwith in a grade 7 regular class in a community 
  school where there is also a class for children with a dual diagnosis. Within 
  the regular class setting, Zachary will participate in opening exercises, lunch, 
  physical education, music, and if a computer lab is available, a computer program. 
  The remainder of Zachary's school day will be spent in the dual diagnosis classroom 
  where he will receive his academic program.</p>   
<P>
  [12] The decision of the Tribunal is final and cannot be appealed. The Board 
  has a placement available that will conform with the order of the Tribunal.</p>   <P>
  III</p>   <P>
  The reasons of the application judge</p>   <P>
  [13] The application judge concluded that, like all other students, Zachary 
  did not have a vested right to attend any particular school within the jurisdiction 
  of the Board. She further held that the Board had the authority to transfer 
  students for safety reasons. That authority extended to exceptional pupils, 
  even if the transfer had the effect of changing an exceptional pupil's placement 
  while an appeal in respect of that placement was outstanding. The application 
  judge next held that the Board's decision to transfer Zachary for safety reasons 
  was open to judicial review on the grounds that the Board had acted without 
  legal authority or unfairly. She held, however, that the Board's transfer of 
  Zachary was made fairly and with just cause. She concluded, at para. 39:</p>   
<P class="indent"> There were bona fide and serious safety concerns arising from 
  Zachary's behaviour at Manor Park. The Board had the statutory power to make 
  its administrative transfer decision based on those safety concerns. In making 
  that decision, it did not act unfairly toward the Applicant. The issues at the 
  heart of this dispute involve the educational resources needed for Zachary to 
  be able to succeed in a regular school environment. Those issues are more appropriately 
  decided under the Regulation 181/98 procedures [the IPRC appeal procedures] 
  and not on this application.</p>   
<P>
  IV</p>   <P>
  The mootness issue</p>   <P>
  [14] In its application and notice of appeal, the appellant sought an order 
  setting aside the transfer of Zachary from Manor Park to Clifford Bowey and 
  a direction that Zachary's placement not be altered pending the outcome of the 
  appeal from the IPRC ruling. Events have overtaken the relief sought by the 
  appellant. Zachary's placement has now been determined by the Tribunal. Whatever 
  decision this court might make will not affect that placement. </p>   <P>
  [15] In Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353, Sopinka 
  J. said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> The doctrine of mootness is an aspect of a general policy or 
  practice that a court may decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical 
  or abstract question. The general principle applies when the decision of the 
  court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or 
  may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have 
  no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. 
  This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding 
  is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. 
  Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events 
  occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy 
  exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. 
  &#133;</p>   
<P>
  [16] This case fits squarely within the description of mootness provided in 
  Borowski, supra. Borowski, supra, however, makes the further point that a court 
  has a discretion to decide a matter that has been rendered moot. The principles 
  governing the exercise of that discretion are set out in Borowski, supra, at 
  pp. 358-63 and were recently summarized by this court in Payne v. Ontario (Minister 
  of Energy, Science and Technology), [2002] O.J. No. 2566 (C.A.), 162 O.A.C. 
  48. According to those principles, a court may exercise its discretion in favour 
  of hearing a moot appeal where the issue that has become moot was fully litigated 
  before the court, is of general importance and is likely to arise in the future 
  either in litigation involving the same parties or different parties. </p>   <P>
  [17] Those factors weigh strongly in favour of hearing this appeal insofar as 
  it involves the question of the interaction of the Board's duty to ensure the 
  safety of its schools and its obligations to exceptional pupils. The conflict 
  between the Board's duty to remove a student from a particular school to preserve 
  the safety of that school and the Board's obligation to leave an exceptional 
  pupil in his current placement pending the completion of the appeal process 
  will surely arise again. An interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 
  Act and its regulations by this court would guide school boards and parents 
  when these difficult problems arise and will hopefully avoid the need for further 
  litigation. The issue is also ripe for resolution in that it has been fully 
  litigated before this court. The court has had the advantage of full and careful 
  submissions from the parties, and helpful submissions from the intervener, the 
  Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and Law. I would decide the first issue 
  raised on this appeal.</p>   <P>
  [18] The second and third grounds of appeal relate to the fairness of the process 
  followed by the Board in arriving at its decision to transfer Zachary, and the 
  merits of that decision. Neither ground of appeal raises an issue of general 
  importance. The determination of each of these issues depends on an analysis 
  of the specific facts and circumstances revealed by this record. The application 
  judge conducted that analysis to the extent that she felt she was entitled to 
  do so on a judicial review application. Since Zachary's placement has now been 
  determined by the Tribunal, nothing would be gained by this court entering upon 
  a consideration of the fairness of the process used in deciding to transfer 
  Zachary or the merits of that decision. </p>   <P>
  V</p>   <P>
  The statutory and regulatory scheme</p>   <P>
  [19] Everyone agrees that schools must strive to create an environment in which 
  all students, including those with exceptional needs, can thrive and achieve 
  their full potential. It is equally clear, however, that if schools are not 
  safe, students cannot achieve that potential. The Act and its regulations address 
  both imperatives. </p>   <P>
  [20] The Act and regulations provide a comprehensive scheme for the identification 
  and placement of exceptional pupils. Broadly stated, the provisions provide 
  for a committee which identifies exceptional pupils and determines, hopefully 
  with the co-operation of school authorities and parents, the appropriate placement 
  for those students who are identified as exceptional pupils. Placement decisions 
  are subject to two levels of appeal at the instance of the parents.</p>   <P>
  [21] The phrase &quot;exceptional pupil&quot; first appeared in the Education 
  Act in 1980: The Education Amendment Act, 1980, S.O. 1980, c. 61. An &quot;exceptional 
  pupil&quot; is defined as:</p>   
<P class="indent"> [A] pupil whose behavioural, communicational, intellectual, 
  physical or multiple exceptionalities are such that he is considered to need 
  placement in a special education program &#133;</p>   
<P>
  [22] The key provision in the Act is s. 8(3):</p>   
<P class="indent"> The Minister shall ensure that all exceptional children in 
  Ontario have available to them, in accordance with this Act and the regulations, 
  appropriate special education programs and special education services without 
  payment of fees by parents or guardians resident in Ontario, and shall provide 
  for the parents or guardians to appeal the appropriateness of the special education 
  placement, and for these purposes the Minister shall, </p>
<P class="indent">(a) require school boards to implement procedures for early 
  and ongoing identification of the learning abilities and needs of pupils, and 
  shall prescribe standards in accordance with which such procedures be implemented; 
  and</p>
<P class="indent">(b) in respect of special education programs and services, define 
  exceptionalities of pupils, and prescribe classes, groups or categories of exceptional 
  pupils, and require boards to employ such definitions or use such prescriptions 
  as established under this clause. &#133;</p>
<P>
  [23] Ontario Regulation 181/98, as amended by O. Reg. 137/01, entitled &quot;Identification 
  and Placement of Exceptional Pupils&quot; puts flesh on the statutory bones 
  of s. 8(3) of the Act. Section 10 provides for the creation of the IPRC. Section 
  14 sets out the manner in which a pupil may be referred to IPRC for a determination 
  of whether that pupil should be identified as an exceptional pupil. If the pupil 
  is so identified, the IPRC will make a placement decision. Sections 15 and 16 
  describe the nature of proceedings before the IPRC and the material that it 
  may consider. </p>   <P>
  [24] Section 17 of the regulation directs that the IPRC is to consider placement 
  in a regular class with appropriate special educational services before it considers 
  the option of placement in a special education class. If placement in a regular 
  class with appropriate special educational services meets the exceptional pupil's 
  needs and is consistent with the preferences of the parents, the exceptional 
  pupil should be placed in a regular class. </p>   
<P> [25] In Eaton v. Brant County Board of Education, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 241 at 278-79, 
  Sopinka J. indicated that the placement decision must take into account all 
  of the needs of the exceptional pupil, including safety concerns. Ultimately, 
  the best interests of the exceptional pupil would determine the appropriate 
  placement. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<P>
  [26] Sections 18 and 19 of the regulation require the IPRC to notify the parents 
  of its decision and to reassess that decision if so requested by the parents. 
  Section 20 is an important provision on this appeal: </p>   
<P class="indent"> 20(1) A board shall implement a placement decision made by 
  a committee under this Part when one of the following two events occurs:</p>
<P class="indent">2. A parent of the pupil consents in writing to the placement.</p>
<P class="indent">3. The time period provided in subsection 26(2) for filing a 
  notice of appeal from the decision expires without a notice of appeal being 
  filed.</p>
<P class="indent">(2) The board shall implement a placement decision made by a 
  committee under this Part as soon as possible after an event described in paragraph 
  1 or 2 of subsection (1) occurs.</p>
<P class="indent">(3) A board that, without the written consent of a parent of 
  the pupil, implements a placement decision made by a committee under this Part 
  shall give written notice of the implementation to a parent of the pupil.</p>
<P>
  [27] I agree with the appellant's contention that the effect of s. 20 is to 
  stay the placement decision of the IPRC when a parent files a notice of appeal. 
  While the appeal is outstanding, the exceptional pupil's placement remains as 
  it was before the IPRC decision. </p>   <P>
  [28] The appeal goes to the SEAB pursuant to s. 26 of the regulations. SEAB 
  is authorized to make recommendations concerning the placement of the exceptional 
  pupil to the relevant school board. The school board must consider those recommendations 
  but is not obliged to accept them (s. 28, s. 29). After a school board determines 
  what action it will take on the recommendations made by SEAB, it must notify 
  the parent of that decision (s. 30). Section 31(1) of the regulation reads:</p>   
<P class="indent"> 31(1) The board shall implement a decision under subsection 
  30(1) when one of the following events occurs:</p>
<P class="indent15">1. A parent of the pupil consents in writing to the decision. 
</p>
<P class="indent15">2. Thirty days have elapsed from receipt of the notice under 
  subsection 30(1) by a parent of the pupil and no appeal has been commenced in 
  respect of the decision under section 57 of the Act.</p>
<P class="indent15">3. An appeal under section 57 of the Act from the decision is 
  dismissed or abandoned.</p>
<P>
  [29] Once again, I agree with the appellant's contention that the effect of 
  s. 31 is to prevent a school board from implementing a placement decision it 
  makes after an SEAB recommendation while an appeal is pending from that decision. 
  </p>   <P>
  [30] The appeal contemplated by s. 31 of the regulation goes to the Special 
  Education Tribunal (&quot;Tribunal&quot;) pursuant to s. 57(3) of the Act. The 
  Tribunal may dismiss the appeal or may grant the appeal and make such order 
  as it considers necessary with respect to the placement of the exceptional student. 
  The decision of the Tribunal is final and binding on the parties. </p>   <P>
  [31] Looked at in isolation from other provisions of the Act and the regulations, 
  the scheme governing the placement of exceptional pupils clearly contemplates 
  that the placement of those pupils will not change while the placement decision 
  is being made and reviewed at the various levels provided for in the Act and 
  regulations. I agree, however, with the respondent that those provisions cannot 
  be viewed in isolation. </p>   <P>
  [32] Counsel for the Board submits that the principal's authority to exclude 
  Zachary from Manor Park School is found in s. 265 of the Act which outlines 
  the duties of a principal, and in a regulation passed under s. 305 of the Act 
  which allows the Minister to make regulations governing access to school premises. 
  Section 265(1)(m) reads:</p>   
<P class="indent"> It is the duty of a principal of a school in addition to the 
  principal's duties as a teacher,</p>
<P class="indent">(m) subject to an appeal to the board, to refuse to admit to 
  the school or classroom a person whose presence in the school or classroom would 
  in the principal's judgment be detrimental to the physical or mental well-being 
  of the pupils; &#133;</p>
<P>
  [33] Section 305 is included in Part XIII of the Act, entitled &quot;Behaviour, 
  Discipline and Safety&quot;. That part of the Act was introduced by the Safe 
  Schools Act, 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 12. The section empowers the Minister to make 
  regulations governing access to school premises. Ontario Regulation 474/00 governing 
  access to school premises provides in part:</p>   
<P class="indent"> 3(1) A person is not permitted to remain on school premises 
  if his or her presence is detrimental to the safety or well-being of a person 
  on the premises, in the judgment of the principal, a vice-principal or another 
  person authorized by the Board to make such determination.</p>   
<P>
  [34] Read together, s. 265(1)(m) and s. 3(1) of the regulation authorize principals 
  to refuse to allow persons into a school, and to require persons to leave a 
  school, where the principal determines that the presence of that person in the 
  school would be detrimental to the safety of others in the school. These provisions 
  allow principals to act quickly where the conduct of a person puts the safety 
  of those under the charge of the principal at risk. Obviously, a principal can 
  properly exercise these powers only where the safety concerns are genuine, and 
  the principal's response to those concerns is a reasonable one in all of the 
  circumstances. If it were shown that a principal used these powers to circumvent 
  an obligation to leave an exceptional pupil in his or her placement pending 
  an appeal, the court could intervene by way of judicial review just as it could 
  if a principal used these powers for any other improper purpose.</p>   <P>
  [35] The word &quot;person&quot; in s. 265(1)(m) and s. 3(1) of the regulation 
  should be given its normal meaning. That meaning encompasses pupils as well 
  as non-pupils. Nor, in my view, does the existence of special provisions relating 
  to the placement of exceptional pupils warrant interpreting the word &quot;person&quot; 
  in s. 265(1)(m) and s. 3 of the regulation as not including exceptional pupils. 
  Section 265(1)(m) and s. 3(1) are not concerned with the placement of students 
  according to their educational needs, but rather with preserving the safety 
  of schools. The question of where an exceptional pupil should be placed to meet 
  that pupil's best interests is a different question from the question of whether 
  at a particular point in time a student poses a risk to the safety of himself 
  or others in the school where he has been placed. It is an undeniable fact of 
  life that a student may be both an immediate safety risk to others and an exceptional 
  pupil. An interpretation of s. 265(1)(m) and s. 3(1) that would place exceptional 
  pupils beyond the reach of a principal's power to exclude persons for safety 
  reasons from the school is not only inconsistent with the language used in the 
  Act and the regulation, but would seriously imperil the safety of exceptional 
  pupils and other children who interact with that exceptional pupil. Where there 
  are genuine safety concerns, considerations of the best interests of the child 
  must extend to all of the children whose safety is at risk. </p>   <P>
  [36] That is not to say that the pupil's status as an exceptional pupil with 
  respect to whom a placement decision is been made will be irrelevant to the 
  manner in which a principal exercises his or her authority under s. 265(1)(m) 
  and s. 3(1) of the regulation. Placement of exceptional pupils requires considerable 
  expertise and careful assessment. Where a placement decision is challenged by 
  the parents, it is clearly the policy of the Act and the regulations to leave 
  the status quo in place while that challenge is considered. Where a principal 
  must exercise his powers under s. 265(1)(m) or s. 3(1), he or she must bear 
  in mind the special significance of the placement decision as it relates to 
  exceptional pupils and strive to minimize any interference with that placement. 
  For example, if safety concerns can be properly addressed by removal from the 
  classroom rather than the school, then the more limited removal must be preferred 
  in the case of an exceptional pupil. </p>   <P>
  [37] Similarly, I see no reason to interpret the discipline provisions in Part 
  XIII of the Act as not being applicable to exceptional pupils. The power to 
  discipline by way of suspension or expulsion must have the potential to reach 
  all pupils if it is to serve its purpose. As the regulations recognize, however, 
  disciplinary measures must take into account individual circumstances: O. Reg. 
  137/01, s. 2. I need not explore the application of the discipline provisions 
  to exceptional pupils in any more detail as the Board does not rely on its power 
  to discipline to support its decision to transfer Zachary.</p>   <P>
  [38] Although I cannot accept the submission advanced by the appellant to the 
  effect that exceptional pupils are, by virtue of their status, beyond the reach 
  of s. 265(1)(m) and s. 3(1), I also cannot accept the Board's contention that 
  exceptional pupils can be transferred to a different school for safety reasons 
  while an appeal from a placement decision is pending. Neither s. 265(1)(m) nor 
  s. 3(1) authorizes a transfer. Nor do I understand the Board to argue that any 
  other provision of the Act or regulations made under the Act expressly authorized 
  the transfer of Zachary for safety reasons. As I understand the submission, 
  the Board contends that its power to order the transfer flows from its power 
  to remove Zachary from Manor Park for safety reasons and its general authority 
  to determine what school any particular student should attend within the Board. 
  </p>   <P>
  [39] The Board's submission may have merit in the case of pupils who are not 
  exceptional pupils. I need not determine that question. Whatever may be the 
  case with other pupils, an exceptional pupil who is appealing from a placement 
  order made by the IPRC has a right to retain his or her current placement pending 
  the outcome of that appeal. That right flows from the provisions outlined above 
  which effectively stay the IPRC decision. In my view, that express right to 
  remain in the placement cannot be overridden by any implied power to transfer 
  for safety reasons. </p>   <P>
  [40] Under the present scheme, a principal, and ultimately the Board, may exclude 
  an exceptional pupil from his or her school or class for legitimate safety reasons. 
  They cannot, however, alter that placement by purporting to transfer the exceptional 
  pupil to a different school. Having determined that Zachary could not attend 
  Manor Park because of safety concerns, the most the Board could do under the 
  present scheme was offer an alternative placement to Zachary's parents where, 
  in the Board's view, the safety concerns did not arise. Zachary's parents would 
  then have to decide whether to send Zachary to that other school pending the 
  outcome of their appeal. If they declined to do so, Zachary would remain out 
  of school. </p>   <P>
  [41] I cannot leave this case without observing that it is obvious that all 
  parties desire what is best for Zachary. It is most unfortunate that he was 
  out of school for all of 2002. It may be that the regulations should be amended 
  to give the appropriate body (for example, the IPRC) the authority, where the 
  circumstances demand, to address safety concerns by way of interim placement 
  orders that would have effect pending the resolution of any appeal from a placement 
  decision.</p>   <P>
  VI</p>   <P>
  [42] I would dismiss the appeal as moot. This is not a case for costs.</p>
