<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge relied upon clear evidence that for over forty years, the 
  Hunter's Beach cottages including the respondents and their predecessors in 
  title, used the disputed area for parking of their vehicles. He was fully justified 
  in concluding that the parking of the vehicles along the right of way was an 
  ancillary right included with the grant of the right-of-way to the cottages.</p>
<p>
  [2] In determining that parking is an ancillary right, the trial judge properly 
  considered those factors relevant to determining what is reasonably necessary 
  to the enjoyment of the right of way, including a consideration of the language 
  of the conveyance creating the easement, the purpose and circumstances surrounding 
  the creation of the right of way, the history of its development and the circumstances 
  of its use.</p>
<p>
  Prescriptive Easement</p>
<p>
  [3] In light of our conclusion on the issue of ancillary rights, it is not necessary 
  to decide the question of whether the respondents acquired a right to park by 
  way of prescriptive easement.</p>
<p>
  Breadth of Relief</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant asks, in the alternative, that the relief ordered below be 
  restricted in a number of ways. The first request is for an order making it 
  clear that the right to park is limited to the respondents. In our view, no 
  such order is required. By the express terms of paragraph 1 of the judgment, 
  the declared rights are those of the respondents. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant also proposed a number of possible restrictions to the area 
  in which parking was permissible on the right of way and that parking be restricted 
  to certain months of the year. We see no basis upon which to alter the terms 
  of the relief ordered below. The trial judge was called upon to determine the 
  nature and extent of the ancillary rights. He arrived at his conclusions through 
  an application of the correct legal principles and after a thorough review of 
  the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [6] The other related requests seek orders of this court declaring the rights 
  of the appellant as owner of the right-of-way. Those requests are not properly 
  before this court, not having been argued or decided below. </p>
<p>
  Compensation to Boone for Cost of Tank Installation</p>
<p>
  [7] The legal basis upon which the trial judge ordered the appellant to pay 
  the respondent, Carol Boone, the cost of the original installation of the holding 
  tank is unclear. In light of the trial judge's factual finding that the tank 
  was improperly placed on the right of way due to the carelessness of both Boone 
  and the appellant, the cost of the original installation shall be borne equally 
  by them. We would not order interest to be paid on the sum that will consequently 
  be due from the appellant to Boone because Boone has had the benefit of having 
  the tank on the appellant's land in the intervening period.</p>
<p>Nuisance</p>
<p>
  [8] There is no question but that the appellant's conduct seriously interfered 
  with the respondents' use and enjoyment of their cottage properties, including 
  that of the respondent Boone following the injunction. The damage award appears 
  proper and based on reasonable conclusions of fact. There is no basis for appellate 
  intervention.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part. Paragraph 7 of the Judgment 
  shall be varied to read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> This court orders that the plaintiff Carol Boone shall remove 
  the holding tank located on the Disputed Street Allowance, at her expense, upon 
  the Defendant reimbursing her for one half of the cost of the original installation 
  of the holding tank and the cost of pre-packing and levelling the resulting 
  hole shall be the Defendant's to bear;</p>
<p>
  [10] As the respondents have been largely successful, costs of the appeal are 
  ordered in their favour fixed in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST, to the respondent Boone and $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and 
  GST, to the respondents Lafferty and Jutzi.</p>
