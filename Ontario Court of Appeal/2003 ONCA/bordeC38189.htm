<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice W.J. Lloyd Brennan of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on November 14, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the sentence totalling five years and two months 
  imprisonment imposed by Brennan J. following the appellant's plea of guilty 
  to a number of offences including possession of a loaded restricted weapon, 
  aggravated assault and using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence. 
  The appellant submits that the sentence should be reduced because of systemic 
  and background factors. The appellant applies to admit fresh evidence to inform 
  the court about the impact of those factors on young black males; especially 
  those growing up, like the appellant, in the Regent Park community. This issue 
  was not raised before the trial judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] I have reviewed the extensive material filed by counsel for the appellant 
  on this appeal. Systemic racism and the background factors faced by black youths 
  in Toronto are important matters and in another case I believe that they could 
  affect the sentence. In this case, the crimes are so serious that the systemic 
  and background factors could not affect the length of the sentence. Accordingly, 
  I would dismiss the application to admit the fresh evidence. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] However, this appellant was only 18 when he committed these offences. In 
  my view, the trial judge did not give proper consideration to the appellant's 
  youth and that a first penitentiary sentence should be as short as possible. 
  I would therefore reduce the sentence to four years and two months.<br>
</p>
<p>THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES</p>
<p>[4] The appellant was a resident of Regent Park. This is an area of subsidized 
  housing near the downtown area of the City of Toronto. On May 18, 2000 the appellant 
  was released on bail on a charge of assault while resisting arrest. A term of 
  his release was that he not be in a certain geographical area that in effect 
  banished him from the Regent Park area. On July 30, 2000, the appellant was 
  in the Regent Park area when an acquaintance of the appellant shot another man. 
  The appellant was charged with failing to comply with a recognizance as a result 
  of this incident.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Days later, on August 2, 2000, the appellant was again in the Regent Park 
  community when he was confronted by a group of persons who believed he was associated 
  with the July 30th shooting. The group began to chase the appellant. As he was 
  fleeing, the appellant removed a .45 calibre handgun and fired a number of shots 
  into the air. He was later charged with possession of a loaded restricted firearm 
  as a result of this incident.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] On August 15, 2000, the appellant committed the most serious offences. 
  The appellant was again in the prohibited area laying in wait for Jamaul Cramona. 
  The appellant repeatedly pistol-whipped the victim outside a convenience store. 
  In the course of the assault, the handgun discharged but the bullet did not 
  injure the victim. The victim required numerous stitches to close the wounds 
  to his face. The handgun used in this offence was the same handgun used by the 
  appellant's acquaintance in the July 30th shooting. The appellant was charged 
  with aggravated assault, using a firearm in the commission of an offence and 
  failing to comply with his release as a result of this incident.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The police finally apprehended the appellant on August 24, 2000 when he 
  was again in the Regent Park area. He was charged with failing to comply with 
  his release conditions. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] The appellant remained in custody until his sentencing on November 14, 
  2001. He spent this time in the Toronto (Don) Jail under conditions that the 
  trial judge described as &quot;medieval, barbaric, dreadful&quot;. The trial 
  judge gave the appellant credit for 31 months of pre-trial custody.<br>

<p>THE APPELLANT'S BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[10] The appellant was born on January 17, 1982 and was only 18 years of age 
  when he committed these offences and 19 when he was sentenced. He has a substantial 
  youth record including crimes of violence. Between 1996 and 1999 the appellant 
  was convicted in youth court of trafficking in a narcotic, fail to attend court, 
  carrying a concealed weapon, robbery, mischief, fail to comply with a disposition, 
  assault, and assault causing bodily harm. His longest previous disposition was 
  six months secure custody and 100 days of open custody. He was on probation 
  when he committed these most recent offences and also in breach of an order 
  that he not possess any firearms or ammunition.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The appellant is one of seven children. He never knew his father. Several 
  of his brothers have different fathers. There was no stable male figure in the 
  appellant's life. The appellant's mother suffers from mental illness and the 
  Children's Aid Society was frequently involved with the family. The appellant 
  was never physically or sexually abused. The appellant's upbringing was chaotic 
  and in 1994 he was apprehended by the C.A.S. The appellant ran away from the 
  foster homes in which he was placed. In 1997, the appellant's mother abandoned 
  the children and returned to Trinidad for a period of time. Several of the appellant's 
  brothers have also had trouble with the law.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] The appellant has a common law relationship with a young woman and they 
  have a daughter who was about two months old when the appellant embarked on 
  this string of offences. Some of the appellant's assault convictions relate 
  to abuse of his common law spouse. She lived with the child in Regent Park. 
  Despite the bail order prohibiting the appellant from being in the Regent Park 
  area, the appellant visited his spouse and child on a daily basis before his 
  arrest. His spouse and her mother, both of whom were supportive of the appellant, 
  would seem to have encouraged these visits.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The appellant has abused alcohol since he was fifteen years of age. The 
  appellant had previously taken some counselling for alcoholism as a term of 
  probation but he did not carry through with the programme. The appellant claimed 
  that he was intoxicated when he committed these offences. His spouse contradicted 
  this claim and there is no other evidence to support the appellant's position<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The appellant was chronically truant from school and was suspended for 
  assaultive and aggressive behaviour. His mother did nothing to encourage the 
  appellant's attendance at school or to address his behaviour. While the appellant 
  did well when in custody, his response to probation was poor. The author of 
  the pre-sentence report stated that the appellant &quot;has a pattern of positive 
  performance in secure settings, but then a poor response to supervision in the 
  community&quot;. The appellant has no marketable skills and has worked only 
  sporadically at temporary jobs.<br>
</p>
<p>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p>[15] The trial judge reviewed the principles and objectives of sentencing. 
  He concluded that denunciation and general and specific deterrence where the 
  paramount considerations. He was concerned that the appellant represented a 
  danger to the community. The trial judge placed special emphasis on the appellant's 
  use of a handgun in two of the offences. He stated that the sentence must be 
  of sufficient length that it would deter others and send a &quot;signal to other 
  young men in this city [that] violent assaults with especially with guns will 
  result in serious penalties&quot;. He referred to the presence of handguns as 
  a &quot;scourge&quot; in the community &quot;which the court has repeatedly 
  denounced&quot; and intended the sentence to &quot;reflect again the court's 
  determination to do what we can to deliver the message: No more guns.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The trial judge referred to the appellant's youth record and his lack 
  of response to previous less lenient dispositions. The trial judge expressed 
  his dismay at having to impose a penitentiary sentence on an offender who was 
  only 18 when he committed the offences. He expressed the hope that the appellant 
  might reform and take advantage of the support from his spouse and her family.<br>
</p>
<p>THE PROPOSED FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p>[17] The appellant filed a number of reports prepared by various groups concerning 
  systemic racism in Canada. These various reports chronicle a history of poverty; 
  discrimination in education, the media, employment and housing; and overrepresentation 
  in the criminal justice system and in prisons. Common among these reports is 
  the assertion that aside from the experiences of Aboriginal peoples, there is 
  no other community in Canada that has faced and continues to face this combination 
  of factors.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Among the reports filed by the appellant is the Report of the Commission 
  on Systemic Racism in the Ontario Criminal Justice System (Toronto: Queen's 
  Printer, 1995). This Commission was established in 1992 to inquire into and 
  make recommendations about the extent to which criminal justice practise, procedures, 
  and policies in Ontario reflect systemic racism toward racial minority, especially, 
  black communities. One clear finding of the Commission is that there has been 
  a dramatic increase in prison admissions for black offenders in Ontario in recent 
  years. This increase is especially apparent with regard to drug offences. <br>
</p>
<p>[19] Until this Report, research in the area of overrepresentation in the criminal 
  justice system tended to focus on Aboriginal Canadians. Research conducted by 
  J.V. Roberts and A.N. Doob prepared for the Commission provided the first major 
  empirical study on the treatment of black accused. See: &quot;Race, Ethnicity, 
  and Criminal Justice in Canada&quot; in M. Tonry (ed.), Ethnicity, Crime and 
  Immigration (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997) 469. This study focused 
  on the bail and sentencing stages of the criminal justice process in Ontario. 
  The authors considered offence categories of robbery, sexual assault, drugs, 
  serious assault and bail violations. The findings demonstrated racial disparities 
  at both these stages of the process. More specifically, the greatest disparities 
  were found for the drug offences. Chapter 4 of the Report explores the problem 
  of the impact of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; on black offenders. Other relevant 
  factors addressed in the Report that contribute to this problem of overrepresentation 
  include social and economic inequalities, as well as differential enforcement.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] While racial disparities were found, the authors highlight that the relationship 
  between race, crime and imprisonment is difficult to demonstrate. Patterns of 
  direct discrimination may be found with some offences, however they are unlikely 
  to simply be a function of the differences in the seriousness of the offence. 
  Rather, indirect discrimination arising from judges' reliance on neutral factors 
  such as employment status and detention before trial contribute to the higher 
  incarceration rates among black offenders [Chapter 8, p. 280; Roberts and Doob, 
  p. 512]. In addition, the authors found unexplained race disparities that were 
  not due to the gravity of the charge, record, plea, crown election, pre-trial 
  detention, unemployment of other social factors. The Report attributes these 
  results to direct racial discrimination. <br>
</p>
<p>[21] The appellant also filed a more recent report prepared by the African 
  Canadian Legal Clinic entitled Anti-Black Racism in Canada: A Report on the 
  Canadian Government's Compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination 
  of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (July 2002). This report is a response 
  to the Canadian government's account of its compliance with the International 
  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is critical 
  of both the Canadian and Ontario Governments. An excerpt from the Executive 
  Summary, at p. 4, captures the problem as viewed from the Clinic's perspective. 
  After summarizing Canada's position, the Clinic says this:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, African Canadians will point out 
  the day-to-day challenges and difficulties of living within their communities, 
  the continued challenges of living in a society polarized by racism in which 
  they are subordinate and subject to the exploitation and abuse of the White 
  community. As a result of this continuing pattern of discrimination, the African 
  Canadian community and particularly its youth, interact with police officers 
  much often than other communities. There is a disproportionate number of African 
  Canadians living in poverty and in overcrowded neighborhoods. In addition, there 
  are a disproportionate number of Black households in communities that lack human 
  and recreational services. Negative interactions between African Canadian students 
  and school officials often result in the enforcement of &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; 
  policies. African Canadian peoples are subject to an inordinately high number 
  of hate motivated attacks. A severely disproportionate number of Black youth 
  attend schools with predominantly non-African Canadian teachers. These teachers 
  have low expectations of African Canadian students who in turn, disengage from 
  schools in high numbers. African Canadians face the overwhelming challenges 
  of maintaining the identity of their families as a result of an increasingly 
  oppressive immigration system. Cultural institutions and the media negatively 
  portray the image of African Canadians. Finally, African Canadian adults are 
  either unemployed, underemployed, subject to harassment within the workplace 
  and left with few career opportunities.</p>
<p>[22] Another point that is highly relevant to the question of judicial consideration 
  of systemic and background factors at sentencing is judicial education. This 
  point was addressed by the Commission at p. 285 of its Report:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The longstanding absence from the criminal justice system 
  of agencies that specialize in serving racialized communities, together with 
  many judges' distance from these communities, makes it particularly likely that 
  community-based options for black and other racialized people may be unknown. 
  While comprehensive presentence reports on individual accused may address this 
  problem to some extent, judges should not be wholly dependent on probation officers 
  for information that is so important to fairness in sentencing.</p>
<p>[23] This recommendation by the Commission highlights the importance of this 
  issue being addressed before the trial judge on the basis of proper evidence. 
  On the appeal in this case, counsel for the appellant filed copies of two pamphlets 
  for programmes directed particularly to black youth. These pamphlets were not 
  particularly helpful in showing how these community programmes could assist 
  the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] This brief summary does not do justice to the wealth of information in 
  these various reports. Since, however, I have concluded that the evidence is 
  not admissible on this appeal, I do not need to review it in any greater detail.<br>
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>The admissibility of the fresh evidence</p>
<p>[25] The impact of systemic racism and other background factors facing the 
  African Canadian community was not raised before the trial judge. Counsel for 
  the appellant submits that this evidence should be received on this appeal because, 
  in effect, the trial judge made the social context relevant by his focus on 
  general deterrence and his concern to send a message to the &quot;community&quot; 
  about the use of guns. Mr. Tanovich asserts that in those circumstances it is 
  only proper that the court see the whole picture, that is, understand the social 
  conditions that contributed to the violence perpetrated by the appellant. Alternatively, 
  the appellant submits that the court can take judicial notice of systemic racism 
  against the African Canadian community just as the courts have been directed 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 to 
  take judicial notice of systemic racism against aboriginals . He relies on a 
  number of decisions where the courts have taken judicial notice of systemic 
  racism against blacks, albeit in different contexts, such as jury selection, 
  interaction with police, and prison population. See R. v. Parks (1993), 84 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), R. 
  v. S. (R.D.) (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) and Sauv&eacute; v. Canada 
  (Chief Electoral Officer), 2002 SCC 68.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The Crown opposes the admission of the evidence. Ms. Eplett points out 
  that this evidence could have been introduced at trial and, since it was not, 
  there is insufficient evidence to show how these systemic and background factors 
  actually impacted upon the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The test for admission of fresh evidence on a sentence appeal was set 
  out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. L&eacute;vesque (2000), 148 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 193. I do not need to deal with that test in any detail. The admission 
  of this evidence fails because it cannot meet the criterion that the proposed 
  fresh evidence would likely affect the result. The appellant's fundamental submission 
  is that because of the similarity between the plight of Aboriginal Canadians 
  and African Canadians, the court should adopt a similar form of analysis for 
  the purposes of sentencing. Further, he submits that the background of the appellant 
  exhibits many of the same factors often found in the background of Aboriginal 
  offenders including poverty, family dislocation, chaotic child rearing and alcoholism. 
  I accept that there are some similarities and that the background and systemic 
  factors facing African Canadians, where they are shown to have played a part 
  in the offence, might be taken into account in imposing sentence. However, for 
  the following reasons, the evidence is not relevant in this case.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] In Gladue and R. v. Wells (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 368 (S.C.C.) the court 
  explained the approach courts must take to the sentencing of aboriginal offenders 
  in light of s. 718.2(e). Section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code provides that<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment 
  that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, 
  with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>[29] The offenders in those two cases were aboriginals and the reasons of the 
  court naturally focused on the impact of s. 718.2(e) on such offenders given 
  the special mention of aboriginal offenders in the provision. Some of the language 
  used by the court, however, could equally apply to the approach to sentencing 
  other similarly disadvantaged groups. For example, in para. 65 of Gladue the 
  court summarizes the conditions that have led to the over-representation of 
  aboriginal offenders in Canada's prisons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The unbalanced ratio of imprisonment for aboriginal 
  offenders flows from a number of sources, including poverty, substance abuse, 
  lack of education, and the lack of employment opportunities for aboriginal people. 
  It arises also from bias against aboriginal people and from an unfortunate institutional 
  approach that is more inclined to refuse bail and to impose more and longer 
  prison terms for aboriginal offenders. There are many aspects of this sad situation 
  which cannot be addressed in these reasons. What can and must be addressed, 
  though, is the limited role that sentencing judges will play in remedying injustice 
  against aboriginal peoples in Canada. Sentencing judges are among those decision-makers 
  who have the power to influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the 
  justice system. They determine most directly whether an aboriginal offender 
  will go to jail, or whether other sentencing options may be employed which will 
  play perhaps a stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, 
  victim, and community, and in preventing future crime [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[30] Some of the same things could be said of the over-representation of African 
  Canadians in our jails and penitentiaries. I think that in an appropriate case 
  a sentencing judge might find assistance from the approach described by the 
  court in Gladue and Wells, even though that approach is grounded in the special 
  reference to aboriginal offenders in s. 718.2. However, this is a matter that 
  should be addressed at trial where the evidence can be tested and its relevance 
  to the particular offender explored. <br>
</p>
<p>[31] As well, I note that the affirmative duty placed upon the judge by s. 
  718.2(e), to take judicial notice of the unique systemic and background factors 
  that have contributed to the difficulties faced by aboriginal people in the 
  criminal justice system and throughout society at large and to inquire into 
  the unique circumstances of aboriginal offenders, by its terms, only applies 
  to aboriginal offenders. See Gladue at paras. 82-85 and Wells at paras. 53-55.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Further, an important part of the Gladue analysis hinged on the fact that 
  the traditional sentencing ideals of deterrence, separation, and denunciation 
  are often far removed from the understanding of sentencing held by aboriginal 
  offenders and their community. At para. 70 the Gladue court noted, &quot;most 
  traditional aboriginal conceptions of sentencing place a primary emphasis upon 
  the ideals of restorative justice. This tradition is extremely important to 
  the analysis under s. 718.2(e).&quot; This link for the African Canadian community 
  is missing from the fresh evidence. The importance that the Supreme Court attached 
  to the sentencing conceptions of aboriginal communities results from the specific 
  reference to aboriginal offenders in s. 718.2(e). In this regard, aboriginal 
  communities are unique. However, the principles that are generally applicable 
  to all offenders, including African Canadians, are sufficiently broad and flexible 
  to enable a sentencing court in appropriate cases to consider both the systemic 
  and background factors that may have played a role in the commission of the 
  offence and the values of the community from which the offender comes.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] I would not dismiss the application to admit the fresh evidence in this 
  case because it was not adduced before the trial judge or because of this gap 
  in the evidence. Instead, I would not admit the evidence because the proposed 
  evidence would not affect the result. In Gladue and Wells the Supreme Court 
  held that the more serious and violent the crime the less likely that the sentence 
  for an aboriginal offender will differ from the sentence imposed on any other 
  offender. This point is captured at paras. 79-80 of the Gladue reasons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, even where an offence is considered serious, the 
  length of the term of imprisonment must be considered. In some circumstances 
  the length of the sentence of an aboriginal offender may be less and in others 
  the same as that of any other offender. Generally, the more violent and serious 
  the offence the more likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment 
  for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will be close to each other or the same, 
  even taking into account their different concepts of sentencing.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As with all sentencing decisions, the sentencing of 
  aboriginal offenders must proceed on an individual (or a case-by-case) basis: 
  for this offence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community, 
  what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code? What understanding 
  of criminal sanctions is held by the community? What is the nature of the relationship 
  between the offender and his or her community? What combination of systemic 
  or background factors contributed to this particular offender coming before 
  the courts for this particular offence? How has the offender who is being sentenced 
  been affected by, for example, substance abuse in the community, or poverty, 
  or overt racism, or family or community breakdown? Would imprisonment effectively 
  serve to deter or denounce crime in a sense that would be significant to the 
  offender and community, or are crime prevention and other goals better achieved 
  through healing? What sentencing options present themselves in these circumstances? 
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p>[34] The Court restated this position in Wells at para. 44:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Let me emphasize that s. 718.2(e) requires a different 
  methodology for assessing a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender; it does 
  not mandate, necessarily, a different result. Section 718.2(e) does not alter 
  the fundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit 
  for the offence and the offender. Furthermore, in Gladue, as mentioned the Court 
  stressed that the application of s. 718.2(e) does not mean that aboriginal offenders 
  must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the principles 
  of restorative justice and less weight to goals such as deterrence, denunciation, 
  and separation (at para. 78). As a result, it will generally be the case, as 
  a practical matter, that particularly violent and serious offences will result 
  in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal offenders 
  (Gladue, at para. 33). Accordingly, I conclude that it was open to the trial 
  judge to give primacy to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in this 
  case on the basis that the crime involved was a serious one [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[35] This appellant committed a crime of great violence and used a loaded handgun 
  on two separate occasions. The Gladue approach would not lead to any different 
  sentence for these violent and serious offences. This does not mean that the 
  background factors as revealed in the pre-sentence report are irrelevant. To 
  the contrary, they are very important, but they are important because, as was 
  said by the court in para. 80 of Gladue, the sentencing must proceed on an individual 
  (or a case-by-case) basis: for this offence, committed by this offender, harming 
  this victim, in this community. To paraphrase a comment by Brooke J.A. in R. 
  v. Roud and Roud (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 226 (Ont. C.A.) [leave to appeal to 
  S.C.C. refused (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 226n] at 242 the trial judge has a duty 
  to the public, and has a duty to the offender. The judge cannot discharge either 
  without fairly complete information as to the offender, his background and his 
  character. This necessarily includes whatever information is available about 
  the background and other factors that have led to the offender being before 
  the courts. I will now turn to those considerations.<br>
</p>
<p>The fitness of the sentence</p>
<p>[36] Aside from the gravity of the appellant's crimes, the overwhelming factor 
  is his youth. In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in focusing almost 
  exclusively on the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence, given 
  the appellant's age and that this was his first adult prison sentence and his 
  first penitentiary sentence. The length of a first penitentiary sentence for 
  a youthful offender should rarely be determined solely by the objectives of 
  denunciation and general deterrence. Where, as here, the offender has not previously 
  been to penitentiary or served a long adult sentence, the courts ought to proceed 
  on the basis that the shortest possible sentence will achieve the relevant objectives. 
  The trial judge's repeated references to the need to send a message and his 
  statement that the sentence was meant to deter others who resort to guns make 
  it clear that general deterrence and to a less extent denunciation determined 
  the length of the sentence. In my view, this error led the trial judge to impose 
  an excessive sentence for the aggravated assault.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] On the other hand, I agree with the trial judge that this case called 
  for a penitentiary sentence notwithstanding the appellant's age. His very serious 
  youth record, his failure to respond to other measures and his repeated violation 
  of court orders indicated that specific deterrence would be an important objective. 
  The string of offences, two involving use of a loaded handgun, required a lengthy 
  sentence. These circumstances, however, had to be balanced against the appellant's 
  age and his chaotic background as part of a dysfunctional family being raised 
  in poverty by a mother who unfortunately had few parenting skills and suffered 
  from a mental illness. There was also some reason for optimism about the appellant's 
  chances for rehabilitation. The pre-sentence report indicates that while the 
  appellant did not respond particularly well to community-based programmes, he 
  did do well in a more structured environment.<br>
</p>
<p>The other alleged errors in principle</p>
<p>[38] The appellant submits that the trial judge made several other errors in 
  principle. He submits that the trial judge failed to give effect to the totality 
  principle and the so-called &quot;jump principle.&quot; In my view, the trial 
  judge did not err in either respect. As to totality, the Criminal Code requires 
  that the trial judge impose at least one year's imprisonment for each of the 
  two firearms offences and the sentence for using a firearm offence had to be 
  consecutive to the sentence for aggravated assault. See Criminal Code ss. 85(3), 
  (4) and 95(2)(a). The trial judge was right to impose consecutive sentences 
  for the three separate incidents. <br>
</p>
<p>[39] I do not think the jump principle had much application in this case. This 
  principle cautions a court against imposing a dramatically more severe sentence 
  than the sentences imposed upon the offender for similar offences in the recent 
  past. It has little application where the severity of the offender's crimes 
  shows a dramatic increase in violence and seriousness. While the appellant had 
  a serious youth record, the premeditated unprovoked pistol whipping of the victim 
  with a loaded handgun was such a serious escalation in violence that it required 
  a much more severe sentence than had been imposed upon the appellant as a youth. 
  That sentence was justified not only for purposes of general deterrence and 
  denunciation but as a matter of specific deterrence. Despite his youth, the 
  appellant revealed himself as a dangerous individual and unfortunately a lengthy 
  sentence had to be imposed.<br>
</p>
<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[40] Accordingly, I would dismiss the application to admit fresh evidence. 
  I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal and reduce the sentence 
  for aggravated assault by one year so that the appellant's total sentence is 
  four years and two months.<br>
