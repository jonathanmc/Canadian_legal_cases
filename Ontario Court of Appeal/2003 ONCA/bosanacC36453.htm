<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P class="center">Released Orally: March 27, 2003</p>    
<P>
  [1] We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's conclusion that since 
  the plan of subdivision was never registered, the domestic contract was no longer 
  operative. We do not think the definitions of assets or agreement in the domestic 
  contract can be applied to exclude from the NFP calculation the appellant's 
  interest in the investment.</p>    <P>
  [2] In light of the income statement and financial statements of Sandwell Fuels, 
  it was open to the trial judge to impute an amount from that company to the 
  appellant's income.</p>    <P>
  [3] It was also open to the trial judge to award the quantum of spousal support 
  she did based on the respondent's financial statement and the evidence at trial. 
  We see no error in awarding this amount retroactively.</p>    <P>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $15,000.</p>
