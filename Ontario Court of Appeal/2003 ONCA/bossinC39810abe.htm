<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant entered into a separation agreement that specifically contemplated 
  his retirement and the appropriate disposition of his retirement income as between 
  him and the respondent. As McWatt J. recognized, once the agreement was incorporated 
  into a judgment, in order to vary his spousal support obligation, the appellant 
  was required to demonstrate a material change in circumstances. Having reviewed 
  the extensive record before her, she found that there was no material change 
  in circumstances, either in the appellant&#8217;s financial situation or his 
  health, that called for a change in his support obligation. Rather, she found 
  that his financial difficulties were the product of his debts and his lifestyle. 
  She further found that the respondent is, and continues to be, dependent on 
  the appellant for support. </p>
<p> [2] McWatt J.&#8217;s findings are entitled to deference in this court, and 
  we are not persuaded that she made any reversible error in making them. Accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed in the amount of $4,500, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
