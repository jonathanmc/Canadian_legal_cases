<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT RE COSTS</p>
<p>[1] On April 17, 2002, we dismissed the appellants' appeals from two orders 
  of Nordheimer J. In our endorsement, we invited the parties to make brief written 
  submissions concerning costs. Counsel for the appellants Antonio Bottan and 
  Rear View Mirror made brief submissions but also indicated that his retainer 
  had been terminated and that Mr. Bottan may need additional time to retain counsel 
  or make further submissions. We have not received any further submissions on 
  behalf of Mr. Bottan and Sandra Bottan has not made any submissions.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondents seek a total of $44,648.23 on account of fees, disbursements 
  and GST for the appeal, the fresh evidence application and for two motions for 
  which they were awarded costs. In our view, the costs sought for this appeal 
  are excessive given the issues involved and that counsel for the respondents 
  had acted for them throughout in the many proceedings in the Superior Court 
  of Justice. </p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, we would fix the costs of the appeal and the fresh evidence 
  application at $15,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements, the costs of the 
  motion before Goudge J.A. at $3,500 inclusive of GST and disbursements and of 
  the motion before Simmons J.A. at $3,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements. 
  In the result, the appellants shall pay costs to the respondents on a partial 
  indemnity basis fixed at $21,500.</p>
