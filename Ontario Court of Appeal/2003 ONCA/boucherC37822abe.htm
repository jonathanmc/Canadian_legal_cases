<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The real underlying issue is whether the trial judge erred in the exercise 
  of his discretion in striking the pleadings. We are of the opinion that he did 
  not. There was a long history of delay and there was no material before him 
  to support any other conclusion than the one he reached.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] In view of this, whether Quinn J. proceeded on February 1, 2002 or after 
  the thirty day period for appealing is immaterial. He was entitled to proceed 
  as he did.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] Costs to the respondent fixed in the amount of $3000 all inclusive on a 
  partial indemnity basis.</p>
