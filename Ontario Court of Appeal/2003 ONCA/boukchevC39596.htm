<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a Crown appeal from a sentence of 21 months incarceration concurrent 
  for one count of dangerous driving causing death and one count of failing to 
  remain at the scene of an accident contrary to s. 249(4) and 252 (1.3) respectively 
  of the Criminal Code. In addition, a driving prohibition of five years was imposed 
  plus a DNA order.</p>
<p>[2] On September 16, 2002, at 10:45 p.m. the respondent ran a red light at 
  a high rate of speed, flashed his high beams to get people out of his way as 
  he continued to drive at an excessive rate of speed, came to another well-lit 
  intersection, ran over the 20 year old victim while he ran another red light 
  and dragged her about 190 meters north of where she was first struck. There 
  was no evidence that the respondent applied his brakes at any time before or 
  after striking the victim. Even though the respondent's windshield was shattered 
  and the front end of his van was severely damaged, he drove on without stopping. 
  This, despite knowing he had caused the victim's death and that he had left 
  her body lying in the middle of the road. The respondent circled around various 
  side streets then abandoned the van just south of the collision. About three 
  hours later the police found the abandoned van and traced it to the respondent 
  at his parents' home. During this time he did not report the accident. When 
  investigated, the appellant gave a statement that two female hitchhikers had 
  stolen his van that night after he had stopped at a variety store to buy a pack 
  of cigarettes. When alcohol was detected by the investigating officer on the 
  respondent's breath, the respondent told police he had consumed some alcohol 
  after arriving at his parents' apartment. Later he gave a videotaped statement 
  to the same effect at the police station. The respondent was on bail for unrelated 
  offences at this time. Ultimately, however, the respondent pled guilty to the 
  offences for which he was sentenced. </p>
<p>[3] In sentencing the respondent, the sentencing judge gave the respondent 
  credit for four and a half months pretrial custody on the usual two for one 
  basis, or nine months. Thus, the sentence is effectively a sentence of thirty 
  months. The respondent is 59 years old and has accumulated a lengthy record 
  for driving offences. In a fifteen year span between 1982 to 1997, the respondent 
  was convicted of driving offences in all but three of those years. He had two 
  prior convictions for careless driving in 1983 and 1987 and seven convictions 
  for either driving while his licence was suspended or driving while disqualified. 
  During this time, the longest single period of incarceration that the appellant 
  served for these offences was six months. In May of 1998, the appellant was 
  given a medical suspension of twenty-two months and his licence reinstated in 
  March of 2000. Following this, until the date of the accident there were no 
  convictions.</p>
<p>[4] The respondent had two driving-related criminal convictions: one for impaired 
  driving (September of 1992) and another for driving while disqualified (February 
  of 1993). In addition, he has prior criminal convictions for assault, assault 
  causing bodily harm, obstruct peace officer (x 2), fail to appear and fail to 
  comply with recognizance.</p>
<p>[5] At the sentencing hearing Crown counsel suggested a sentence of 7 years 
  less pre-trial custody, plus a lifetime driving prohibition and a DNA order. 
  The defence suggested a sentence in the range of 24-30 months, less pretrial 
  custody, plus a five-year driving prohibition. The sentencing judge did not 
  give reasons respecting the driving prohibition. </p>
<p>[6] The appellant submits that the sentence is demonstrably unfit and does 
  not achieve an appropriate level of denunciation and deterrence. We agree. Sentences 
  have tended to increase in severity for these types of offences because of the 
  heightened recognition of the need for general deterrence and protection of 
  the public. Having regard to the decisions in R. v. Routsis, [1995] O.J. #543, 
  (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Rij, [1994] O.J. # 2850 (Ont. C.A.), we are of the opinion 
  that a fit sentence is five years less nine months credit for pre-trial custody 
  for a sentence of four years and three months. In light of the horrendous driving 
  record of the respondent and the respondent's flagrant disregard for prior driving 
  prohibitions and licence suspensions we also impose a lifetime driving prohibition. 
</p>
<p>[7] The appeal as to sentence is allowed and a sentence of four years and three 
  months plus a lifetime driving prohibition is imposed.</p>
