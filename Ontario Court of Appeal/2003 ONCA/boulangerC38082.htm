<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ian V.B. Nordheimer of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated March 20, 2002.</p>
<p>GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] In this action the appellant, Aline Boulanger, is suing Johnson &amp; Johnson 
  Corporation, two of its subsidiaries (Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Products 
  Inc./Produits Medicaux Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc., and Janssen-Ortho Inc.) and 
  the Attorney General of Canada. The three Johnson &amp; Johnson companies are 
  the respondents in this appeal. The Attorney General of Canada did not participate 
  in this court.</p>
<p>
  [2] The action is brought as a proposed class action on behalf of all persons 
  in Canada (and their relatives) who used the prescription drug Prepulsid, which 
  was manufactured by the respondents. The drug was approved by Health Canada 
  in 1990 for sale in Canada to treat certain gastrointestinal disorders. The 
  statement of claim alleges that the appellant has suffered serious health problems 
  as a result of taking Prepulsid, that this was true for many who ingested it 
  and that the drug provided no beneficial effect to its users. As a consequence 
  of these proceedings, it was withdrawn from general distribution in August 2000.</p>
<p>
  [3] The statement of claim alleges a number of causes of action against Health 
  Canada which are not relevant for this appeal. As against the respondents, the 
  appellant alleges liability based on negligence, failure to warn, breach of 
  fiduciary duty, breach of warranty and collateral contract, and seeks damages 
  as a result. These too are not in issue in this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] However, two claims by the appellant are central to this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [5] First, in addition to her other claims, the appellant seeks damages from 
  the respondents based on the filings made by the respondents with Health Canada 
  for the purpose of obtaining its approval to market Prepulsid in Canada. The 
  appellant alleges that in making these filings, the respondents were fraudulent 
  or negligent and failed to comply with the provisions of the Food and Drugs 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27.</p>
<p>
  [6] Second, the appellant claims reimbursement of the purchase price paid for 
  the drug.</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondents moved under rule 21.01(1) to strike the paragraphs supporting 
  both claims as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The motions judge agreed, 
  and as a result, struck out a number of paragraphs of the statement of claim. 
  This is the appeal from that order. </p>
<p>
  [8] It is common ground that the test to be applied to the contested paragraphs 
  in the pleading is whether it is plain and obvious that they disclose no reasonable 
  cause of action.</p>
<p>
  [9] The first set of paragraphs which were struck are those dealing with the 
  respondents' filings with Health Canada. There the appellant pleads that in 
  order to sell Prepulsid in Canada, the respondents had to seek regulatory approval 
  from Health Canada. The appellant says that the respondents' filings to obtain 
  this approval were fraudulently or negligently prepared and failed to comply 
  with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. The respondents failed to disclose 
  to Health Canada problems about which the respondents knew or ought to have 
  known.</p>
<p>
  [10] The motions judge found that in so far as these pleadings simply allege 
  a nominate tort of breach of statute, they cannot be sustained. I agree. While 
  a statutory requirement can inform a common law duty of care, there is no cause 
  of action in tort for breach of a statute. See Canada v. Saskatchewan Wheat 
  Pool, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 205.</p>
<p>
  [11] The motions judge also concluded that these pleadings could not be sustained 
  on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. Again I agree. It is clear that 
  in Canada, actual reliance is a necessary element of an action in negligent 
  misrepresentation and its absence will mean that the action cannot succeed. 
  See Hercules Managements Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165 at para. 
  18. Here there is absolutely no assertion of reliance by the appellant (or by 
  anyone on her behalf) on the representations of the respondents to Health Canada. 
  Indeed there is no pleading of reliance on the fact of regulatory approval. 
  This complete absence of reliance is fatal to a negligent misrepresentation 
  claim. Thus these paragraphs of the statement of claim cannot be said to disclose 
  a reasonable cause of action based on misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
  [12] However, in my view, the paragraphs are sustainable on the basis of the 
  appellant's negligence claim against the respondents. That claim is broadly 
  pleaded. The appellant alleges that the respondents negligently designed, formulated, 
  tested, manufactured, labelled, distributed, advertised, marketed and promoted 
  Prepulsid and thus caused harm to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [13] There is no doubt that the respondents owed a duty of care to the appellant 
  as a consumer of their drug product. The respondents concede as much in their 
  factum. The only question is whether that duty can be said to extend to the 
  representations which the respondents made to Health Canada to obtain the regulatory 
  approval needed to market Prepulsid in this country. </p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant's allegation is that the standard of care required of the 
  respondents includes taking reasonable care in the filings they made to obtain 
  regulatory approval and that without that approval, Prepulsid would not have 
  been available to harm the appellant. These filings are pleaded as an aspect 
  of the respondents' conduct which caused the appellant harm and which fell below 
  the standard required of a reasonable drug manufacturer. They are one of the 
  ways in which the appellant says the respondents were negligent. Framed this 
  way, I cannot say that it is plain and obvious that such a claim will fail. 
  Indeed the claim could appropriately be viewed as one of negligent misstatement. 
  See Haskett v. Equifax Canada Inc., [2003] O.J. No. 771 (C.A.), leave to appeal 
  to S.C.C. requested. </p>
<p>
  [15] Thus I would allow this aspect of the appeal and dismiss the motion to 
  strike these paragraphs of the statement of claim (namely, the first sentence 
  of paragraph 3 the words &quot;which the Plaintiff states were fraudulently 
  and/or negligently prepared and in violation of the provisions of the Food and 
  Drug Act&quot;, in paragraph 20 the words &quot;and for damages resulting from 
  the fraudulent and/or negligent filings with Health Canada to obtain its approval 
  for Prepulsid and failure to comply with the provisions of the Food and Drug 
  Act&quot; and paragraph 29, paragraph 56(n) and paragraphs 63.1 through 63.6).</p>
<p>
  [16] The second set of paragraphs struck from the statement of claim asserts 
  that the appellant is entitled to reimbursement for the full purchase price 
  which she paid for Prepulsid. This is not pleaded as damages for the respondents' 
  unlawful conduct. There is a separate pleading which seeks the purchase price 
  as a part of the damages claimed and which is not attacked by the respondents.</p>
<p>
  [17] In seeking to reverse the order striking these paragraphs, the appellant 
  offers three arguments. In my view, they are each easily answered.</p>
<p>
  [18] First, the appellant says that reimbursement is properly claimed as a remedy 
  for the negligence which she has pleaded. I disagree. The reimbursement sought 
  in these paragraphs is not pleaded as damages for the harm caused by the respondents' 
  negligent conduct, but simply as a claim for the return of monies paid. Put 
  that way rather than as damages, the respondents' negligence cannot yield the 
  entitlement to reimbursement pleaded.</p>
<p>
  [19] Second, the appellant also claims reimbursement as a remedy for the respondents' 
  alleged breach of contract. Again I disagree. The claims of breach of contract 
  as against the respondents (including implied warranty) were not attacked in 
  this motion, but assuming that they can be successfully maintained by the appellant 
  against the manufacturer of the drug (who is not the seller), reimbursement 
  (as distinct from damages equivalent to the purchase price) would not follow 
  as a remedy. Reimbursement would come only with rescission of the contract and 
  that is not available here, since the drugs cannot be returned. The parties 
  cannot be restored to their pre-contractual positions. See Kingu v. Walmar Ventures 
  Ltd. (1986), 10 B.C.L.R. (2d) 15 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [20] Third, the appellant seeks to support these paragraphs on the basis of 
  unjust enrichment. In my view this argument also fails. The difficulty is that 
  the purchase price for which the appellant seeks reimbursement was paid to the 
  retailer not to the respondents. Any benefit to the respondents from this payment 
  was indirect and only incidentally conferred on the respondents. Unjust enrichment 
  does not extend to permit such a recovery. In Peel (Regional Municipality) v. 
  Canada; Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Ontario, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762, McLachlin 
  J. said this at para. 58: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To permit recovery for incidental collateral benefits would be to admit of the 
  possibility that a plaintiff could recover twice - once from the person who 
  is the immediate beneficiary of the payment or benefit (the parents of the juveniles 
  placed in group homes in this case), and again from the person who reaped an 
  incidental benefit. [Citations omitted.] It would also open the doors to claims 
  against an undefined class of persons who, while not the recipients of the payment 
  or work conferred by the plaintiff, indirectly benefit from it. This the courts 
  have declined to do. The cases in which claims for unjust enrichment have been 
  made out generally deal with benefits conferred directly and specifically on 
  the defendant, such as the services rendered for the defendant or money paid 
  to the defendant [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [21] Thus I would dismiss the appeal from the order striking these paragraphs 
  from the statement of claim. </p>
<p>
  [22] Success being divided, there should be no order of costs in this court.</p>
