<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the test under Rule 26 for substituting Dr. Petrasek for John 
  Doe 1 has not been met. It is far from clear from the Statement of Claim that 
  Dr. Petrasek could have identified himself as having been directly implicated. 
  The only direct reference that the respondent claims points to Dr. Petrasek, 
  is about the positioning of Mr. Bourque for surgery. There is, however, no evidence 
  that Dr. Petrasek did the positioning or was responsible for it. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] Given that, there was nothing in the Statement of Claim to point the &quot;litigating 
  finger&quot; at Dr. Petrasek, and he not ought to have been substituted. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of Justice Dunn is set aside, 
  and the motion under Rule 26 is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of 
  $2,000.</p>
