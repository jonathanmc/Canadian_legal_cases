<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Catzman and Simmons JJ.A.</p>
<p>
  [1] Mr. Pattillo submits that the appellant, James Brandon, who is alleged to 
  have been responsible for the undue influence upon his mother, was not the beneficiary 
  of the impugned instruments signed by his mother and that the presumption of 
  undue influence therefore does not apply in the present case. That submission 
  ignores the reality that James effectively acquired control of the island for 
  the duration of the trust and that he and his side of the family were the beneficiaries 
  of the influence exerted upon Clara in the procurement of those instruments 
  in favour of James' son, Jamie.</p>
<p>
  [2] In any event, quite apart from any presumption, we read paragraphs 115 and 
  116 of Howden J.'s reasons for judgment as a finding that James had &quot;physical 
  and moral control and persuasion over his mother&quot; and that he in fact exercised 
  that power in a manner that amounted to undue influence at and prior to the 
  time she executed the impugned instruments. That finding is supported by evidence 
  presented at a lengthy trial and canvassed in thorough reasons by the trial 
  judge. Moreover, it is not undermined by the opinion of a solicitor who was 
  not privy to the evidence that was adduced at trial of all of the family interactions 
  that preceded the execution of the instruments. We are not persuaded that the 
  trial judge made any error that would warrant appellate intervention with that 
  finding.</p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Abella J.A.: (Dissenting)</p>
<p>
  [4] In my view, even if these circumstances can be said to give rise to a presumption 
  of influence, it has been rebutted not only by the assertive and unshaken evidence 
  of Clara Brandon but by the cogent evidence of her solicitor, Mr. Hacker. There 
  was, with respect, no basis for critiquing the legal advice given to Clara Brandon 
  and it was an error to find that his duty included making inquiries of others 
  to see if there was a sound factual basis for her views. This raises the threshold 
  too high. Mr. Hacker, who had been introduced to her by Gordon Brandon several 
  months earlier, spent an appropriate amount of time with Clara Brandon and satisfied 
  himself that she understood the terms of the documents. He also concluded that 
  her reasons for the disposition to her grandson were genuine and independently 
  made, particularly her concern that the island remain in the Brandon name, that 
  Gordon could lose his share of the island to creditors, and that Gordon might 
  dispose of his share to his friend, a Midland business man. Mr. Hacker was not 
  obliged to do any more than he did.</p>
<p>
  [5] In addition, her friend Ms. Daub testified that Clara Brandon was mentally 
  alert and able to make her own decisions. The pressure to divide the island 
  came from Gordon. James was satisfied with the status quo which would have resulted 
  in each brother getting 50% of their mother's share of the island when she died.</p>
<p>
  [6] Clara Brandon was entitled to divide the property as she saw fit. In the 
  absence of any evidence rebutting her evidence, or any adverse finding of credibility, 
  it was, with respect, a reversible error for the trial judge to disregard her 
  evidence or that of Mr. Hacker. Just because James was her more attentive son 
  and she had a closer relationship with him, does not, in these circumstances, 
  disentitle her to favour his family over her other son's. I am satisfied any 
  presumption has been thoroughly rebutted.</p>
<p> [7] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment, and dismiss Gordon Brandon's 
  action.</p>
