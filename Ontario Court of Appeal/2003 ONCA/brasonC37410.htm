<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We required submissions from the Crown on only the main ground of appeal 
  argued by counsel for the appellant.</p>
<p>[2] The complainant testified that she was viciously beaten by the appellant 
  in his hotel room over about a two hour span. According to her evidence, he 
  eventually allowed her to leave and she went directly to the nearby hospital, 
  arriving there shortly after 4:00 a.m.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant testified that while he had been with the complainant earlier 
  in the evening, he had nothing to do with her assault. The appellant and his 
  former wife both testified that they were together at her farm at the time of 
  the alleged assault. </p>
<p>[4] The Crown put the appellant's telephone records into evidence. The records 
  effectively placed the appellant in his hotel room shortly after 4:00 a.m. making 
  a telephone call to his former wife. If the appellant made that call, he could 
  not have been with his former wife at her farm and he must have been at the 
  hotel room as alleged by the complainant.</p>
<p>[5] The appellant contends that the trial judge did not address the preconditions 
  to admissibility of the telephone records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence 
  Act. Counsel contends that the trial judge did not consider whether these records 
  were made in the usual and ordinary course of business. Counsel also argues 
  that the trial judge failed to consider the reliability of the telephone records, 
  both as it relates to the admissibility of the records and the weight to be 
  given to the records if they were admissible. </p>
<p>[6] With respect to the argument based on s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, 
  it would appear that trial counsel conceded that the preconditions to admissibility 
  under s. 30 had been met and that the reliability of the telephone records was 
  the only issue. The basis for counsel's objection at trial is, however, somewhat 
  unclear. We are satisfied that the evidence of Mr. Young does demonstrate that 
  the records produced by him were made and kept in the usual and ordinary course 
  of business. </p>
<p>[7] With respect to the arguments based on reliability, the fact that these 
  were records made in the usual and ordinary course of business, provided a basis 
  upon which the trial judge could find that the records were reliable. The trial 
  judge specifically found that these records were reliable. While the evidence 
  of Mr. Young may not have been helpful to the Crown in some respects, it does 
  not render the trial judge's finding that the records were reliable unreasonable, 
  or provide any basis for the claim that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  in determining the reliability of the records. </p>
<p>[8] The appellant has also appealed sentence. He received a sentence of 3 years 
  on top of the equivalent of 4 months pre-trial custody. In our view, this was 
  a vicious, cowardly attack which warranted a lengthy sentence. We are entitled 
  to interfere with the sentence imposed at trial only where there is an error 
  in principle, or where the sentence is manifestly unreasonable. In our view, 
  there is no error here and it cannot be said that the length of the sentence 
  is clearly unreasonable. </p>
<p>[9] The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted 
  and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
