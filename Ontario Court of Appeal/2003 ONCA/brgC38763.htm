<p>Application for review pursuant to s. 16(9) of the Young Offenders Act to reverse 
  the reasons and order for transfer of Justice S.G. Radley-Walters of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated August 9, 2002. </p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The applicant is 43 years old. He is charged with sexual offences allegedly 
  committed between 1972 and 1977 when he was 13 to 18 years of age. The complainant 
  is his sister. She was 8 to 13 years old at the time of the alleged incidents. 
  She reported the sexual incidents to the police only recently, in June 2000. 
  The Crown obtained an order pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Young Offenders Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 (the &#147;YOA&#148;) for the transfer of the charges from 
  youth court to ordinary court. This is an application brought pursuant to s. 
  16(9) of the YOA for review of the transfer order.</p>
<p>[2] The relevant test governing the transfer application under s. 16(1) of 
  the YOA is set out in the following subsections: </p>
<p class="indent">(1.1) Order &#150; In making the determination referred 
  to in subsection (1)&#133;, the youth court, after affording both parties and 
  the parents of the young person an opportunity to be heard, shall consider the 
  interest of society, which includes the objectives of affording protection to 
  the public and rehabilitation of the young person, and determine whether those 
  objectives can be reconciled by the youth being under the jurisdiction of the 
  youth court, and</p>
<p class="indent">(a) if the court is of the opinion that those objectives 
  can be so reconciled, the court shall</p>
<p class="indent">(i) in the case of an application under subsection (1), 
  refuse to make an order that the young person be proceeded against in ordinary 
  court, &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) if the court is of the opinion that those objectives 
  cannot be so reconciled, protection of the public shall be paramount and the 
  court shall</p>
<p class="indent">(i) in the case of an application under subsection (1), 
  order that the young person be proceeded against in ordinary court in accordance 
  with the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with the offence&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Considerations by youth court &#150; In making the 
  determination referred to in subsection (1) &#133; in respect of a young person, 
  a youth court shall take into account</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the seriousness of the alleged offence and the circumstances 
  in which it was allegedly committed;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the age, maturity, character and background of the 
  young person and any record or summary of previous findings of delinquency under 
  the Juvenile Delinquents Act, chapter J-3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 
  1970, or previous findings of guilt under this Act or any other Act of Parliament 
  or any regulation made thereunder;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the adequacy of this Act, and the adequacy of the 
  Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament that would apply in respect of 
  the young person if an order were made under this section, to meet the circumstances 
  of the case;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the availability of treatment or correctional resources;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) any representations made to the court by or on behalf 
  of the young person or by the Attorney General or his agent; and</p>
<p class="indent">(f) any other factors that the court considers relevant.</p>
<p>[3] The application for review in this court is governed by s. 16(9):</p>
<p class="indent">(9) Review of youth court decision &#150; An order made 
  in respect of a young person under this section or a refusal to make such an 
  order shall, on application of the young person or the young person's counsel 
  or the Attorney General or the Attorney General's agent made within thirty days 
  after the decision of the youth court, be reviewed by the court of appeal, and 
  that court may, in its discretion, confirm or reverse the decision of the youth 
  court.</p>
<p>[4] The Crown alleges a total of eight incidents of sexual touching. Some of 
  the incidents were allegedly committed when the applicant was 13 years old. 
  At the transfer hearing, the Crown conceded that the charges in relation to 
  allegations arising before the applicant became 14 were not capable of transfer 
  pursuant to s. 16(1) of the YOA. As well, the jurisdiction of the youth court 
  does not extend to one of the offences, as it was allegedly committed after 
  the applicant attained the age of 18 years and was no longer a young person. 
  A charge was brought in ordinary court in relation to that incident. Hence this 
  application relates only to those incidents that allegedly occurred after the 
  applicant reached the age of 14 and before he was 18 years old. </p>
<p>[5] The complainant also reported a number of other sexual incidents involving 
  the applicant&#146;s older brother and their uncle, and charges were laid against 
  them. Some of the charges against the applicant&#146;s brother were also brought 
  in youth court but were subsequently transferred to ordinary court with his 
  consent. The charges against the uncle were brought in ordinary court as he 
  was an adult at the relevant time. The Crown intends to join the applicant with 
  the other two accused on one information in ordinary court if the charges are 
  transferred. </p>
<p>[6] The allegations against the applicant involve acts of simulated intercourse 
  without clothing, oral sex, and acts of sexual touching of the complainant under 
  her clothing. The allegations against the applicant&#146;s brother involve a 
  larger number of incidents involving forced masturbation and simulated sexual 
  intercourse from the time the complainant was 8 years old. Some further offences 
  involving full sexual intercourse and forced masturbation are alleged to have 
  been committed by the applicant&#146;s brother when the complainant was 13 to 
  23 years of age. The charges against the complainant&#146;s uncle involve four 
  incidents of full sexual intercourse when she was 13 and 15 years of age. He 
  was in his fifties at the time.</p>
<p>[7] At the hearing, the Crown called Melanie Ferdinand, the provincial coordinator 
  for Assessment, Placement and Transfer from the Ministry of Public Safety and 
  Security, to provide expert opinion evidence on the facilities and opportunities 
  available to both young offenders and adults in the provincial correctional 
  system. A predisposition report was also prepared and filed with the court to 
  assist in determining whether the charges should be proceeded with in ordinary 
  court.</p>
<p>[8] The youth court judge made reference to the following facts in his consideration 
  of the various factors set out in the YOA:</p>
<p>&middot; the alleged offences involved a breach of trust by an older sibling 
  towards a younger sibling;</p>
<p>&middot; the applicant is mature, married and has two children aged twenty 
  and fifteen;</p>
<p>&middot; no other allegations of sexual impropriety were made against him; 
  his only involvement with the criminal justice system resulted in a conditional 
  discharge in 1995 for assaulting his son;</p>
<p>&middot; there are limited correctional services available for mature, older 
  offenders who have been convicted of offences committed while they were young 
  persons;</p>
<p>&middot; contrary to the youth custodial system, the adult custodial system 
  allows for earned remission on sentences, temporary absence passes, conditional 
  sentences and intermittent sentences; </p>
<p>&middot; the youth custodial system, and more particularly its treatment programs, 
  is not geared to handle offenders who are over the age of twenty years of age 
  at the time of disposition; and</p>
<p>&middot; when incarcerated young offenders reach the age of twenty, an application 
  is normally made under s. 24.5(1) to have the offender serve his sentence in 
  an adult facility.</p>
<p>[9] The predisposition report revealed that the correctional authorities recommended 
  that the applicant not be placed in a facility for youth.</p>
<p>[10] In all the circumstances, the youth court judge concluded that the objectives 
  of affording protection to the public and rehabilitation of the offender could 
  not be reconciled by the applicant being in youth court. In particular, he found 
  that the protection of the public includes other young offenders and that placement 
  of the applicant in a facility for youth &#147;would put both parties in danger 
  and at risk.&#148; He also adopted the reasoning in R. v. G.S. (1991), 5 O.R. 
  (3d) 97 (C.A.) where this court held at p. 109 that &#147;[i]t is reasonable 
  to assume that it was the intention of Parliament that, other things being equal, 
  the older a young person is, the heavier the age factor weighs in favour of 
  making the transfer order. That would seem to be a matter of pure common sense.&#148;</p>
<p>[11] The standard of review in this court is aptly set out by Doherty J.A. 
  in R. v. J.C. (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 59 at para. 15:</p>
<p class="indent">The appellate court must consider the applicable statutory 
  principles and make its own evaluation of the merits of the application. In 
  doing so, the appellate court will accept any credibility assessments and findings 
  of fact made by the judge hearing the application unless those findings are 
  unreasonable or are based on a misapprehension of the evidence or a failure 
  to consider relevant evidence: R. v. M. (S.H.) (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 503 at 
  pp. 548-49 (S.C.C.); R. v. C. (D.) (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 547 (Ont. C.A.) at 
  p. 558, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1994), 86 C.C.C. (3d) vii.</p>
<p>[12] In my view, the youth court judge&#146;s findings and his conclusion that 
  the charges should be transferred are reasonable and entirely supported by the 
  evidence. I also agree with his conclusion on my own evaluation of the merits 
  of the application. </p>
<p>[13] The most significant circumstance in this case is the fact that the applicant 
  is 43 years old. Although age is but one of the considerations set out under 
  s. 16(2), as noted by this court in R. v. G.S., the older the age of the &#147;young 
  person&#148;, the heavier this factor will weigh in favour of a transfer. In 
  my view, this conclusion is inescapable given the very nature of the youth court 
  system. As noted by L&#146;Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. in R. v. S.H.M. (1989), 50 
  C.C.C. (3d) 503 at 513 (S.C.C.):</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer deprives the youths of their entitlement to 
  the rehabilitative philosophy and treatment resources of the system specially 
  designed to meet their needs. </p>
<p>[14] This underlying concern about the effect of a transfer permeates many 
  of the considerations set out in s. 16(2). It also informs much of the court&#146;s 
  determination under s. 16(1.1) as to whether the objective of rehabilitation 
  can be reconciled with the youth remaining in youth court. However, the concern 
  about depriving the offender of the benefits of a system designed to meet his 
  needs does not arise in the case of a 43-year-old person. On the contrary, the 
  youth court system will generally be ill-suited to meet the mature offender&#146;s 
  rehabilitative needs. </p>
<p>[15] The appellant&#146;s age and the consequent ill-suitability of his placement 
  in a youth facility with other young offenders was also specifically noted by 
  the application judge. The application judge was of the view that such a placement 
  raised a concern for the safety of both the appellant and the other young offenders. 
  The appellant submits that this kind of concern is one that should be addressed 
  at the time of disposition only. He notes s. 24.5(1) of the YOA which allows 
  for the transfer of a young offender who has attained the age of 18 years to 
  a provincial adult facility to serve his disposition where the court considers 
  it to be in the best interest of the young person or in the public interest. 
</p>
<p>[16] In my view, the availability of a transfer under s. 24.5(1) does not preclude 
  the application judge on a transfer application under s. 16(1) from considering 
  the effect of any potential placement of the offender in a youth facility when 
  it is relevant. Other young offenders can properly be considered as part of 
  the public in determining the need for protection of the public under s. 16(1.1). 
</p>
<p>[17] I note finally that the public interest in the efficient administration 
  of justice by avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is also a relevant factor 
  under s. 16(2)(f), insofar as it can be considered within the parameters of 
  the broad objectives in s. 16(1.1): see R. v. F.O.; R. v. K.G. (2002), 163 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 426 at para. 79 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. D.M. (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 130 
  (Ont. C.A.). In this case, this additional factor provides further support for 
  the transfer of the charges to ordinary court. </p>
<p>[18] For these reasons, I agree with the youth court judge&#146;s conclusion 
  on the evidence before him that the objectives of affording protection to the 
  public and rehabilitation of the appellant cannot be reconciled under the jurisdiction 
  of the youth court. I would dismiss the application for review and confirm the 
  order for transfer. </p>
