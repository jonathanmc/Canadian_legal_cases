<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The applications judge ruled that there was no conflict sufficient to warrant 
  the removal of the respondent as executrix/trustee. On the basis of the record 
  before him, he determined that there was no other creditor of the estate except 
  the executrix/trustee in her capacity as residual beneficiary. We agree with 
  his findings and conclusions, all of which were open to him based on the application 
  and the evidence filed.</p>
<p> [2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs payable to the respondent 
  on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $4000.00 inclusive of G.S.T. and 
  disbursements.</p>
