<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice James A. Fontana of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice on May 23, 2000.</p>

<p>
  MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On May 23, 2000, following her trial before Justice Fontana of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, the appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine for the 
  purpose of trafficking, possession of marijuana and possession of a restricted 
  weapon. She received a twenty-month conditional sentence and probation. She 
  appeals against conviction only.</p>
<p>
  [2] The primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting 
  into evidence items from the appellant's residence seized by the police in the 
  execution of a general warrant issued under s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. In particular, the appellant submits that the impugned 
  evidence was obtained in a manner that violated her privacy rights under s. 
  8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that it should have been 
  excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The secondary issue is whether the verdicts 
  are unreasonable. Specifically, the appellant submits that on this record, the 
  evidence does not support a finding that she was in possession of the drugs 
  and restricted weapon discovered in her residence. </p>
<p>
  [3] For reasons that follow, although I agree that the evidence seized from 
  the appellant's residence was obtained in a manner that violated her rights 
  under s. 8 of the Charter, I am satisfied that it was properly admissible under 
  s. 24(2) of the Charter. I am further of the view that it was open to the trial 
  judge to find that the appellant was in possession of the drugs and restricted 
  weapon located in her residence. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [4] On April 30, 1999, the Ottawa police obtained a general warrant under s. 
  487.01 of the Criminal Code. The target of the warrant was the appellant, Tessie 
  Brooks. The warrant permitted the police to conduct surveillance on Ms. Brooks 
  and, upon certain pre-conditions being met, it authorized them to enter her 
  residence at 1113 Burgundy Lane and search for cocaine and drug-related items. 
  The grounds for obtaining the warrant consisted of current information provided 
  by several unidentified police informants and information gathered by the police 
  from their surveillance of the appellant over a six-week period commencing in 
  mid-March 1999. </p>
<p>
  [5] In a nutshell, the police had reason to believe that Ms. Brooks was trafficking 
  in crack cocaine. According to the confidential informants, Ms. Brooks had a 
  particular method of doing business. Using various automobiles to make her deliveries, 
  she would contact customers on her cell phone and arrange to meet them at specified 
  times and places. At any given time, she would only keep a small quantity of 
  cocaine on her person. Once her supply dwindled, she would return to her residence 
  and retrieve more drugs. She would then return to the streets and continue her 
  phone calls and deliveries. </p>
<p>
  [6] On April 29, 1999, one of the confidential informants advised the police 
  that Ms. Brooks was going to be &quot;very active&quot; on April 30. With that 
  information, as well as other information the police had collected, Sgt. Ansari 
  of the Ottawa Police Service prepared an Information to Obtain a General Warrant 
  under s. 487.01 of the Code. He was assisted in that regard by two local Crown 
  Attorneys. On April 30, Sgt. Ansari met with a justice of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice and he obtained the general warrant.</p>
<p>
  [7] As indicated, the warrant authorized the police to conduct surveillance 
  of Ms. Brooks and, if certain pre-conditions were met, it permitted the police 
  to enter and search her residence for drugs and drug-related items. Appendix 
  C to the warrant contained the pre-conditions. It provided as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) APPENDIX &quot;C&quot; (Terms and Conditions)</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) This warrant to search and seize may only be executed at 
  the address [1113 Burgundy Lane] if</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the said Tessie Brooks has, within the three (3) hours 
  immediately prior to entry into the said premises, been</p>
<p class="indent"> (A) followed or surveilled by police officer(s) while she is 
  either the operator of, or a passenger in, a motor vehicle, and</p>
<p class="indent"> (B) observed by police officer(s) to be engaged in behaviour 
  that gives rise to reasonable and probable grounds, in all the circumstances, 
  to believe that she is making deliveries of controlled substances, and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) subsequent to the events mentioned in (i)(a) above, Tessie 
  Brooks is arrested and searched, and found to be</p>
<p class="indent"> (A) the operator of, or a passenger in, a vehicle in which 
  cocaine (including crack) or a substance reasonably believed by the police to 
  be cocaine (or crack) is found, including any cocaine (or crack), or similar-looking 
  substance, found on or about the said operator or passenger, or </p>

<p class="indent"> (B) the operator of, or a passenger in, a vehicle from which 
  a substance referred to in sub-paragraph (A) above, has been ejected.</p>
<p>
  [8] On a voir dire held to determine the legality of the search of the appellant's 
  residence, Sgt. Ansari explained why the police had applied for a general warrant 
  as opposed to one of the more conventional warrants available under s. 487 of 
  the Criminal Code or s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 
  1996, c.19 (&quot;CDSA&quot;): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. O.K. so the purpose of obtaining this general warrant was to arrest -- was 
  to conduct a search of the residence of Ms. Brooks following her arrest.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. O.K. And certainly, you'd also be aware that you'd have 
  the right, as you often do, to arrest and then seek a search warrant after the 
  arrest.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, that's correct, and if I may elaborate on that &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. &#133; that was the reason why we obtained a general search 
  warrant.</p>
<p class="indent"> I was fully aware of the powers of the CDSA in that, once an 
  arrest was made, we could've applied for a CDSA warrant.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Right.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. But time was of the essence in this case and in our - in 
  my opinion or my belief as a drug officer, news does travel fast and I was afraid 
  there may have been a possibility that, had we arrested the individual based 
  on our observations and then gone back and obtained a CDSA search warrant, in 
  that timeframe, perhaps other contact may have been made back to the original 
  residence and evidence may be flushed.</p>
<p class="indent"> Now, this is again all conjecture and -- and speculation &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Right.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. .. but based on -- on my experience, news does travel fast 
  on the street.</p>
<p>
  [9] From this extract, it is apparent that Sgt. Ansari believed that in order 
  to have reasonable grounds to search Ms. Brooks' residence, the police first 
  had to catch her in the act of trafficking. Once that occurred, then based on 
  the information received from the confidential informants, the police could 
  reasonably expect to find a cache of drugs at her residence. In these circumstances, 
  a general warrant was the warrant of choice. It enabled the police to move quickly 
  on Ms. Brooks' residence following her arrest in an effort to prevent someone 
  on the premises from destroying the drugs before the police could obtain a conventional 
  warrant. In that regard, however, Sgt. Ansari readily conceded that apart from 
  &quot;conjecture and &#133; speculation&quot; and his general knowledge that 
  &quot;news &#133; travel[s] fast on the street&quot;, he had no reason to believe 
  that exigent circumstances existed in this case. </p>
<p>
  [10] The search of the appellant's residence at 1113 Burgundy Lane proved fruitful. 
  In the kitchen, the police found a small amount of marijuana in a cupboard. 
  It was wrapped in tinfoil. In another cupboard, they found a grey Wal-Mart bag 
  containing two baggies and a loaded 380 calibre semi-automatic handgun wrapped 
  in a handkerchief. One of the baggies contained fifty foil-wrapped rocks of 
  crack cocaine. Also located in the kitchen was a cell phone with the number 
  613-724-8284 and a Bell Mobility bill relating to it. The bill was dated April 
  5, 1999, and showed a total amount owing of $1,114.96. It was addressed to the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  [11] The police found other items of interest in the kitchen. These included 
  two Avis car rental records, the first for a vehicle rented by the appellant 
  on February 25 and returned on March 19, 1999, the second for a vehicle rented 
  by her on March 19 and returned on April 19, 1999. The two bills totalled $1,358.38. 
  A portion of another Bell Mobility bill was also found in the kitchen. It related 
  to telephone number 613-290-5464 and showed a total of 2,210 calls between February 
  5 and March 3, 1999. That telephone number was the number of the cell phone 
  dropped by the appellant at the scene of her arrest.</p>
<p>
  [12] The police also searched a green Pontiac Grand Am parked outside the appellant's 
  residence. In the glove compartment, they found an Avis rental agreement showing 
  that the car was rented to the appellant on April 25, 1999 and that it was due 
  to be returned on May 25, 1999. </p>
<p> [13] In the master bedroom of the residence, the police found a lease showing 
  &quot;Lynn Brooks&quot; as the lessee.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  Also found in the master bedroom were two Bell Mobility receipts reflecting 
  payments by the appellant on November 20 and 30, 1998 in the total amount of 
  $782. In addition, two Canada Trust transaction records were found, the first 
  showing a cash deposit of $3,540 on November 16, 1998, the second showing a 
  $1,200 cash payment on March 25, 1999 to the appellant's MasterCard account. 
  The police also seized some Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services 
  documentation addressed to the appellant at 1113 Burgundy Lane. They showed 
  that the appellant received monthly family benefits totalling $1,060.64. According 
  to the evidence at trial, that was her only legitimate source of income. In 
  view of this, the police determined that her monthly expenses exceeded her monthly 
  income by over $2,000.</p>
<p>
  [14] Against that backdrop, I turn to the appellant's s. 8 Charter arguments.</p>
<p>
  The Section 8 Charter Issues</p>
<p>
  Trial Judge's Ruling</p>
<p>
  [15] The police entered and searched the appellant's residence pursuant to the 
  general warrant issued under s. 487.01 of the Code. The relevant sections of 
  that provision are reproduced below: </p>
<p class="indent"> s. 487.01 (1) A provincial court judge, a judge of a superior 
  court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552 may issue 
  a warrant in writing authorizing a peace officer to, subject to this section, 
  use any device or investigative technique or procedure or do any thing described 
  in the warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search 
  or seizure in respect of a person or a person's property if</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing 
  that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offence against this or 
  any other Act of Parliament has been or will be committed and that information 
  concerning the offence will be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure 
  or device or the doing of the thing;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests 
  of the administration of justice to issue the warrant; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) there is no other provision in this or any other Act of 
  Parliament that would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting 
  the technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) A warrant issued under subsection (1) shall contain such 
  terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable to ensure that any search 
  or seizure authorized by the warrant is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [16] As indicated, the warrant contained certain pre-conditions that had to 
  be met before the police could lawfully enter and search the appellant's residence.</p>
<p>
  [17] At trial, defence counsel (not Mr. Davies) argued the case on the basis 
  that the search of the appellant's residence was unreasonable and in contravention 
  of her rights under s. 8 of the Charter because the police did not comply with 
  the pre-conditions of the warrant before conducting the search. The trial judge 
  did not address that argument in his reasons. Instead, he found that the pre-conditions 
  in the warrant were &quot;[n]either contemplated [n]or authorized by s. 487.01(3).&quot; 
  He provided two main reasons for that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [18] First, he held that the phrase &quot;terms and conditions&quot; in s. 487.01(3) 
  does not refer &quot;to obstacles which must be overcome before the warrant 
  may be executed&quot; but to &quot;terms and conditions which must be complied 
  with in the course of the search and seizure in order to protect the dignity 
  and privacy of the individual insofar as possible.&quot; Second, he considered 
  the conditions in Appendix C of the warrant to be offensive because they effectively 
  &quot;left [it] to the control officer to determine if and when certain conditions 
  precedent had been satisfied&quot; so as to justify entry into the appellant's 
  residence. In the trial judge's view, Parliament could not have intended &quot;a 
  procedure whereby the decision to breathe life into a search warrant ... is 
  delegated to the control officer.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [19] Having concluded that the pre-conditions in Appendix C were invalid, rather 
  than striking down the warrant, the trial judge determined that the unauthorized 
  pre-conditions were mere &quot;surplusage&quot; and that the failure to observe 
  them was &quot;not vital to the execution of the warrant itself.&quot; Accordingly, 
  since the s. 8 argument raised by the defence hinged on the failure of the police 
  to comply with the pre-conditions in Appendix C before entering and searching 
  the appellant's residence, the trial judge ruled that the search was valid and 
  the evidence obtained from it admissible. </p>
<p>
  Position of the Parties on Appeal</p>
<p> [20] On appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge was correct in 
  holding that the pre-conditions in the warrant were unauthorized. In view of 
  this court's decision in R. v. Noseworthy (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 376, the appellant 
  accepts that s. 487.01 allows for anticipatory warrants (warrants that may only 
  be executed upon the fulfillment of certain pre-conditions).<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  In other words, she disavows, correctly in my view, the trial judge's holding 
  that the phrase &quot;terms and conditions&quot; in s. 487.01(3) refers only 
  to &quot;terms and conditions which must be complied with in the course of the 
  search and seizure in order to protect the dignity and privacy of the individual 
  insofar as possible&quot; (see para. 18, supra). Nonetheless, she maintains 
  that the pre-conditions in Appendix C were offensive because they were not &quot;clear, 
  explicit and narrowly drawn&quot; and they left it to the police to decide, 
  in their unfettered discretion, if the conditions had been met. In other words, 
  contrary to the dictates of Hunter v. Southam (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), 
  the pre-screening that should have been done by a judicial officer was improperly 
  delegated to the police.</p>
<p> [21] In support of her argument, the appellant relies on United States v. 
  Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1993), in which the United States Court of 
  Appeals for the First Circuit considered the constitutionality of anticipatory 
  warrants. For present purposes, the importance of the case lies in the court's 
  conclusion that such warrants are constitutionally permissible so long as they 
  contain sufficient safeguards to minimize the risks associated with them. Of 
  the various safeguards outlined by the court in Ricciardelli, at p. 12, the 
  appellant emphasizes the following three: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The conditions in the anticipatory warrant must be explicit, clear, and 
    narrowly drawn so as to avoid misunderstanding or manipulation by government 
    agents.</li>
  <li>The triggering event must be ascertainable and preordained.</li>
  <li>The warrant should restrict the officers' discretion in detecting the occurrence 
    of the event to almost ministerial proportions, similar to a search party's 
    discretion in locating the place to be searched.</li>
</ul>
<p>[22] The appellant urges us to adopt and apply those safeguards to anticipatory 
  warrants issued under s. 487.01 of the Code. She further submits that, to the 
  extent the trial judge applied them in his assessment of the general warrant 
  at hand, he was correct in concluding that the pre-conditions did not adequately 
  limit the discretion of the police and were therefore unacceptable. She maintains, 
  however, that having come to that conclusion, the trial judge should have struck 
  the warrant down rather than treat the pre-conditions as mere surplusage.</p>
<p>
  [23] Alternatively, the appellant attacks the validity of the warrant on the 
  basis that it should not have issued because the requirement of s. 487.01(1)(c) 
  was not met. Specifically, she submits that the police had available to them 
  other provisions in the Criminal Code or the CDSA that they could have utilized 
  to obtain a warrant to search the appellant's residence. </p>
<p>
  [24] Finally, the appellant submits that if the general warrant was valid, the 
  police failed to comply with the pre-conditions contained in it. Accordingly, 
  she argues that the ensuing search of her residence was unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [25] With respect to s. 24(2) of the Charter, the appellant contends that the 
  evidentiary record is insufficient for this court to make a proper determination. 
  She therefore submits that the matter should be sent back to the trial court. 
  Alternatively, she maintains that, on the existing record, we should refuse 
  to admit the evidence under s. 24(2). </p>
<p>
  [26] The Crown takes the position that the pre-conditions in the warrant were 
  valid. In particular, Crown counsel submits that they were explicit, clear and 
  narrowly drawn and that the warrant did not leave it to the police to decide, 
  in their unfettered discretion, if they had been met. Crown counsel further 
  takes the view that the warrant itself was properly obtained and properly executed.</p>
<p>
  [27] With respect to s. 24(2), the Crown submits that if the appellant's s. 
  8 Charter rights were violated, this court is capable of making the s. 24(2) 
  determination on the record as it exists. He further submits that when the principles 
  governing the application of s. 24(2) are applied to the facts of this case, 
  the evidence obtained from the appellant's residence should be ruled admissible. 
  </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [28] For reasons that will become apparent, the facts of this case do not lend 
  themselves to a comprehensive discussion of the nature and type of pre-conditions 
  contemplated by s. 487.01(3). Suffice it to say that in order to avoid the risks 
  associated with anticipatory warrants, I think there is much to be said for 
  insisting on pre-conditions that are explicit, clear and narrowly drawn. Furthermore, 
  without finally deciding the matter, I am inclined to the view that the pre-conditions 
  in the instant warrant were acceptable. The pre-conditions contained in clause 
  3(i)(a)(A) and (B) of Appendix C were straightforward and explicit. In essence, 
  they required the police to have reasonable grounds to arrest the appellant 
  for trafficking in drugs. As for the second set of pre-conditions contained 
  in clause 3(i)(b)(A) and (B), although they could have been drafted with greater 
  precision, they too, in my opinion, were quite explicit. </p>
<p>
  [29] As indicated, however, a full discussion of the nature and type of conditions 
  contemplated by s. 487.01(3) is best left for another day. In this case, having 
  regard to Sgt. Ansari's evidence, the existence of exigent circumstances was 
  the only possible basis for seeking a general warrant instead of one of the 
  more conventional warrants. However, the Information to obtain the warrant made 
  no mention of exigent circumstances and Sgt. Ansari's testimony did not fill 
  that gap. On the contrary, he readily conceded that apart from conjecture, there 
  was no reason to believe that the circumstances of this case differed from other 
  cases of its kind. In other words, leaving aside mere possibilities, the police 
  had no reason to believe that the appellant's arrest would trigger the destruction 
  of drugs or other evidence at her residence before the police could obtain a 
  conventional warrant to search it.</p>
<p>
  [30] It follows, in my view, that the impugned warrant was invalid because it 
  failed to comply with the statutory pre-condition set out in s. 487.01(1)(c). 
  That pre-condition states, in part, that a general warrant can only be issued 
  where &quot;there is no other provision&#133; that would provide for a warrant 
  &#133; permitting &#133; the thing to be done.&quot; For reasons already stated, 
  that is not this case. It follows that the general warrant was invalid and the 
  search of the appellant's residence must therefore be treated as a warrantless 
  search. As such, it amounted to a contravention of the appellant's privacy rights 
  under s. 8 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [31] In view of my conclusion that the warrant itself was invalid, I need not 
  consider the appellant's further argument that the search was unreasonable because 
  the police failed to comply with the second set of pre-conditions contained 
  in clause 3(i)(b)(A) and (B) of the warrant. That issue, however, is one that 
  must be addressed in the s. 24(2) analysis.</p>
<p>
  Section 24(2)</p>
<p>
  [32] In my view, the s. 24(2) analysis can be done on the existing record. Section 
  24(2) was a live issue at trial and the parties led evidence in relation to 
  it. The record is complete and credibility findings do not pose a problem because 
  there are no material facts in dispute.</p>
<p>
  [33] Turning to the principles that govern the application of s. 24(2), the 
  parties acknowledge that the evidence obtained from the appellant's residence 
  was non-conscriptive. I agree. Accordingly, trial fairness considerations do 
  not arise. </p>
<p>
  [34] In her bid to exclude the evidence, the appellant relies primarily on the 
  seriousness of the violation. She submits that a warrantless search of a residence 
  is always serious. She further submits that the police wilfully or recklessly 
  failed to comply with the pre-conditions found in clause 3(i)(b)(A) and (B) 
  of the general warrant that had to be met before they could gain lawful entry 
  into her residence. For convenience, the clause in question is reproduced below: </p>
<p class="indent"> (3)(i) This warrant to search and seize may only be executed 
  at the address [the appellant's residence] if &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) subsequent to the events mentioned in (i)(a) above [surveillance 
  of the appellant while she is in a motor vehicle and reasonable and probable 
  grounds to believe that she is making deliveries of a controlled substance], 
  Tessie Brooks is arrested and searched, and found to be </p>
<p class="indent">(A) the operator of, or a passenger in, a vehicle in which cocaine 
  (including crack) or a substance reasonably believed by the police to be cocaine 
  (or crack) is found, including any cocaine (or crack), or similar-looking substance, 
  found on or about the said operator or passenger, or</p>
<p class="indent">(B) the operator of, or a passenger in, a vehicle from which 
  a substance referred to in sub-paragraph (A) above, has been ejected.</p>
<p class="indent">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [35] The facts underlying the appellant's submission are straightforward. The 
  police observed Ms. Brooks and an unknown male leave a restaurant and walk to 
  her car. Ms. Brooks entered the car and sat in the driver's seat. The male then 
  leaned through the open window. Before doing so, he reached into his right-hand 
  pocket. </p>
<p>
  [36] Acting on the belief that Ms. Brooks was engaged in a drug transaction, 
  the police moved in just as the male stepped back from the window. Upon seeing 
  the police, he brought his hand to his mouth. He was then tackled to the ground, 
  at which point he spit out two pieces of tinfoil. Each contained crack cocaine. 
  Upon her arrest, the appellant dropped a cell phone onto the pavement. Although 
  a search of her car revealed no drugs, the police found $177 concealed in her 
  brassiere.</p>
<p>
  [37] On these facts, the appellant submits that the pre-conditions in subparagraphs 
  (A) and (B) of clause 3(i)(b) were not met because no drugs were found in the 
  car and no drugs were &quot;ejected&quot; from the car. On the latter point, 
  the police conceded in cross-examination that they did not actually see Ms. 
  Brooks hand drugs to the male in return for cash; nor could they be certain 
  that the male was purchasing drugs as opposed to selling them. That being so, 
  the appellant submits that the police knew or should have known that the pre-conditions 
  in subparagraphs (A) and (B) had not been met and that in proceeding to enter 
  and search Ms. Brooks' residence, they acted in flagrant disregard of the terms 
  of the warrant. </p>
<p>
  [38] With respect, I disagree. Giving effect to that argument would allow form 
  to triumph over substance. Apart from the fact that a strong argument can be 
  made that drugs were found about Ms. Brooks following her arrest, thereby satisfying 
  the requirements of subparagraph (A), I have no doubt that the police honestly 
  believed, with good cause, that the pre-conditions in one or the other of the 
  subparagraphs had been met. The circumstantial evidence supports their belief 
  that the transaction which they observed involved Ms. Brooks selling crack cocaine 
  to the unknown male. Whether the cocaine in question was found &quot;about&quot; 
  Ms. Brooks when the male spat it out (in compliance with subparagraph (A)) or 
  whether it was &quot;ejected&quot;, in the sense of &quot;removed&quot; from 
  her vehicle when she sold it to him (in compliance with subparagraph (B)), is 
  of no consequence. </p>
<p>
  [39] In sum, I reject the submission that in relying upon the transaction at 
  the car as a basis for proceeding further and searching the appellant's residence, 
  the police were acting in flagrant disregard of the terms of the warrant. On 
  the contrary, at most, they committed an honest error in judgment. </p>
<p>
  [40] Moreover, apart from that one aspect of their conduct, the police otherwise 
  conducted themselves with the utmost of good faith. Manifestly, that diminishes 
  the seriousness of the violation.</p>
<p>
  [41] Also, in my view, the seriousness of the violation is attenuated by the 
  fact that the police had reasonable grounds to search the appellant's residence. 
  Had they known that the general warrant was invalid, they could have sought 
  and obtained a conventional warrant under either s. 487 of the Code or s. 11 
  of the CDSA. In other words, this is not a case in which the police were acting 
  on mere suspicion. The fact that they were legitimately entitled to search the 
  appellant's premises mitigates the seriousness of the violation. (R. v. Puskas 
  (1998), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 548 at 554 (Ont. C.A.)).</p>
<p>
  [42] In sum, although I would not classify the breach as trivial, its seriousness 
  is substantially diminished by the mitigating factors that I have mentioned.</p>
<p>
  [43] Given my assessment of the seriousness of the violation, I have little 
  difficulty in holding that the administration of justice would suffer greater 
  disrepute from the exclusion of the evidence seized from the appellant's residence 
  than its admission. The crimes at issue (other than the marijuana offence) are 
  very serious. The police found a substantial quantity of crack cocaine in the 
  appellant's residence. It was packaged and ready for distribution. They also 
  found a loaded handgun. By any measure, those items constitute a deadly combination. 
  </p>
<p>
  [44] In these circumstances, where the guilt of the appellant for serious crimes 
  is established by real evidence and the exclusion of that evidence would result 
  in her acquittal, I am satisfied that, on balance, exclusion of the evidence 
  would have a greater negative impact on the repute of justice than would its 
  admission. (R. v. Puskas, supra at 556; R. v. Laurin (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 
  519 at 537 (Ont. C.A.)).</p>
<p>
  [45] Accordingly, I am satisfied that the evidence seized from the appellant's 
  residence was properly admissible under s. 24(2). </p>
<p>
  Unreasonable Verdict</p>
<p>
  [46] Earlier in these reasons, I outlined the items found by the police in the 
  appellant's residence. I do not intend to repeat them. Suffice it to say that 
  in combination, taking into account the cell phone records, the car rental agreements, 
  the amount of legitimate income available to the appellant compared to her monthly 
  expenses, the finding of the gun in the same bag as the crack cocaine and the 
  activities of the appellant that resulted in her arrest, I am satisfied that 
  it was open to the trial judge to find that she was in constructive possession 
  of the items found. Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [47] The items seized from the appellant's residence, including the drugs and 
  firearm, were properly admissible. On the whole of the evidence, it was open 
  to the trial judge to find that the appellant was in constructive possession 
  of those items. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from the conviction.</p>
