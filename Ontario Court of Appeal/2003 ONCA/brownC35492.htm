<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, this appeal must be allowed. </p>
<p>[2] The witness Anderson was an accomplice and required a complete Vetrovec 
  warning. The warning given by the trial judge failed to alert the jury to the 
  dangers of acting on the unconfirmed evidence of this witness and of certain 
  frailties of the evidence. We are particularly concerned with the trial judge&#146;s 
  use of the expression &#147;gilding the lily&#148;, which may well have detracted 
  from the force of the warning. </p>
<p>[3] This error standing on its own might not have been sufficient to require 
  a new trial. However, the charge to the jury on the frailties of the identification 
  evidence was inadequate.</p>
<p>[4] Mr. Opoku purported to identify the appellant from his voice; yet there 
  was no foundation laid for his ability to identify the appellant&#146;s voice. 
  In those circumstances, the purported voice identification had no probative 
  value. This was not made clear to the jury. To the contrary, the trial judge 
  left this evidence as capable of identifying the appellant. Even if some inference 
  could be drawn that Mr. Opoku had spoken to the appellant on prior occasions, 
  at a minimum a very strong direction of the nature given by the trial judge 
  in R. v. Portillo would have been required.</p>
<p>[5] The instruction on eye-witness identification was also inadequate and failed 
  to bring home to the jury the frailties of the eye-witness identification.</p>
<p>[6] Notwithstanding there was no objection to the charge to the jury, we are 
  of the view that this is not a proper case for the application of the proviso 
  in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. This conviction mostly rested on 
  the testimony of an unsavoury witness and frail identification evidence. It 
  was essential that the jury be properly directed on those matters.</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed, the convictions set aside and 
  a new trial order.</p>
