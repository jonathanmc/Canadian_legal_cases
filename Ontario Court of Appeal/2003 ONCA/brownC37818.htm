<p>On appeal from an order of Justice W. Brian Trafford of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 28, 2002.</p>    <P>
  MORDEN J.A.:</p>    <P>
  Introduction</p>    <P>
  [1] This is an application for leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, an 
  appeal by the Crown from an order of Trafford J., sitting as a summary conviction 
  appeal court judge, that set aside the respondent's conviction on a charge of 
  driving &quot;over 80&quot; contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 
  1985, c.C-46 and ordered a new trial. Trafford J.'s reasons are reported at 
  57 O.R. (3d) 615.</p>    <P>
  [2] Trafford J.'s decision to set aside the conviction is based on his conclusion 
  that the trial judge's conduct of the trial gave rise to a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. The sole issue on this appeal is whether he rightly came to this conclusion. 
  For the reasons that follow I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <P>
  Overview of the Case</p>    <P>
  [3] Before addressing the appellant's submissions, I shall set forth a brief 
  overview of the case and state the basic issue at the trial. On November 1, 
  1999, Constable Olson, who was an Acting Sergeant at the time in the Toronto 
  Police Service (&quot;the officer&quot;) was engaged in general patrol duties 
  on the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto in a marked police supervisor's jeep. At 
  around 12:55 a.m., he signalled Decovan Brown (the respondent), an African-American 
  who was wearing a baseball cap and a jogging suit and driving a brand new Ford 
  Expedition, to pull over to the right shoulder of the road. The officer informed 
  the respondent that the speed limit was ninety kilometres an hour and that the 
  respondent had been travelling &quot;in excess&quot; of that speed.</p>    <P>
  [4] The officer detected the odour of alcohol on the respondent's breath and 
  suspected that he had alcohol in his body. The respondent, who was on his way 
  home from a Halloween party, said that he had consumed a couple of drinks. He 
  failed the roadside screening test demanded by the officer who then arrested 
  him for &quot;driving over 80&quot;. He was taken to the police station at 45 
  Strachan Avenue, which was the closest location where breath-testing equipment 
  was set up and manned. The subsequent breath analysis showed that the respondent's 
  blood-alcohol concentration was 140 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres 
  of blood. He was released after the breath test.</p>    <P>
  [5] There was only one issue raised at the ensuing trial: what was the reason 
  for the officer stopping the respondent on the Don Valley Parkway? Was it because 
  the respondent was speeding and had twice crossed out of and back into the lane 
  in which he was travelling, as testified to by the officer, or was it because 
  he was a young black male driving an expensive car?</p>    <P>
  [6] At the outset of the trial the respondent's counsel applied under ss. 9 
  and 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order excluding 
  the evidence of the breath analysis. The defence contended that the officer's 
  stopping of him was an arbitrary detention under s. 9 because it was based, 
  not on the fact that he was speeding, but rather on racial profiling.</p>    <P>
  [7] There is no dispute about what racial profiling means. In its factum, the 
  appellant defined it compendiously: &quot;Racial profiling involves the targeting 
  of individual members of a particular racial group, on the basis of the supposed 
  criminal propensity of the entire group&quot; and then quoted a longer definition 
  offered by the African Canadian Legal Clinic in an earlier case, R. v. Richards 
  (1999), 26 C.R. (5th) 286 (Ont. C.A.), as set forth in the reasons of Rosenberg 
  J.A. at p. 295:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Racial profiling is criminal profiling based on race. Racial 
  or colour profiling refers to that phenomenon whereby certain criminal activity 
  is attributed to an identified group in society on the basis of race or colour 
  resulting in the targeting of individual members of that group. In this context, 
  race is illegitimately used as a proxy for the criminality or general criminal 
  propensity of an entire racial group.</p>    
<P>
  [8] The attitude underlying racial profiling is one that may be consciously 
  or unconsciously held. That is, the police officer need not be an overt racist. 
  His or her conduct may be based on subconscious racial stereotyping.</p>    <P>
  [9] In the opening part of his submission before this court, counsel for the 
  appellant said that he did not challenge the fact that the phenomenon of racial 
  profiling by the police existed. This was a responsible position to take because, 
  as counsel said, this conclusion is supported by significant social science 
  research. I quote from the Report of The Commission on Systemic Racism in the 
  Ontario Criminal Justice System (Toronto: Queen's Printer for Ontario, 1995) 
  (Co-chairs: M. Gittens and D. Cole) at 358:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The Commission's findings suggest that racialized characteristics, 
  especially those of black people, in combination with other factors, provoke 
  police suspicion, at least in Metro Toronto. Other factors that may attract 
  police attention include sex (male), youth, make and condition of car (if any), 
  location, dress, and perceived lifestyle. Black persons perceived to have many 
  of these attributes are at high risk of being stopped on foot or in cars. This 
  explanation is consistent with our findings that, overall, black people are 
  more likely than others to experience the unwelcome intrusion of being stopped 
  by the police, but black people are not equally vulnerable to such stops.</p>    
<P>
  [10] There is no dispute respecting the test to be applied under s. 9 of the 
  Charter. The question is whether the police officer who stopped the motorist 
  had articulable cause for the stop. Articulable cause exists where the grounds 
  for stopping the motorist are reasonable and can be clearly expressed: R. v. 
  Wilson (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (S.C.C.) at 144. If a police officer stops 
  a person based on his or her colour (or on any other discriminatory ground) 
  the purpose is improper (Brown v. Durham Regional Police Force (1998), 131 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.) at 17) and clearly would not be an articulable cause.</p>    <P>
  [11] Accordingly, to succeed on the application before the trial judge, the 
  respondent had to prove that it was more probable than not that there was no 
  articulable cause for the stop, specifically, on the evidence in this case, 
  that the real reason for the stop was the fact that he was black. </p>    <P>
  [12] The trial judge heard the application. By agreement, the Crown adduced 
  its evidence on the application and on the trial at the same time. It called 
  two witnesses, the officer and Constable O'Donovan. The defence adduced evidence 
  solely with respect to the application, calling the respondent and a private 
  investigator, Albert Duncan, who had made a videotape of the stretch of the 
  Don Valley Parkway where the events had occurred.</p>    <P>
  [13] Following the evidence and hearing submissions on behalf of the respondent, 
  the trial judge, after stating that he did not need to hear from the Crown counsel, 
  dismissed the application. No further evidence was offered at the trial and 
  the trial judge convicted the respondent and imposed a fine of $2,000.</p>
<P>
  An Outline of the Evidence and of the Trial Judge's Reasons</p>    <P>
  [14] There are three south bound and three north bound lanes on the Don Valley 
  Parkway. The officer testified that he was travelling at approximately 100 kilometres 
  an hour south bound in the slow lane, on the right, near the Don Mills Road 
  exit. Shortly after 12:45 a.m. he caught sight of the respondent's vehicle in 
  his left rear view mirror as it was overtaking him travelling south bound in 
  the lane closest to the centre divider. The respondent's vehicle passed the 
  officer at a speed that the officer estimated at 120 kilometres an hour. The 
  Don Valley Parkway has a posted speed limit of 90 kilometres an hour.</p>    <P>
  [15] The officer changed lanes, got behind the respondent and began to follow 
  him. In his evidence in-chief, the officer said there appeared to be a single 
  occupant in the car. In cross-examination he said that he determined that there 
  was one occupant in the car when he approached it on foot after they had come 
  to a stop. He said that he had had &quot;no indication whatsoever&quot; whether 
  there was one person or five people in the respondent's car when he was on the 
  road. The defence contended that his reluctance in cross-examination to admit 
  an ability to see into the car, which he had acknowledged in-chief, tended to 
  support Mr. Brown's evidence (to which I shall refer) and to discredit his own.</p>    <P>
  [16] After the officer got behind the respondent's vehicle, it slowed down to 
  between 80 to 85 kilometres an hour over the kilometre and a half to two kilometres 
  that the officer estimated he followed the respondent. The wheels on the passenger 
  side of the respondent's vehicle crossed over the lane dividing line twice. 
  As the result of his observations, the officer activated his emergency equipment 
  at 12:55 a.m. and pulled the respondent's vehicle over on the right shoulder 
  of the road just north of the Bayview exit ramp on the south bound Don Valley 
  Parkway.</p>    <P>
  [17] A printout from the Mobile Data Terminal (MDT), established that the officer 
  had done a vehicle check on the respondent's vehicle at 12:52 a.m., before he 
  pulled him over. An MDT is a small terminal in the police vehicle that allows 
  the officer to run vehicle checks that can be read on a small screen. In this 
  way, the officer can determine ownership of the vehicle being checked, run CPIC 
  queries, and find out whether the vehicle has been reported stolen or if it 
  had been the subject of other police inquiries. The officer said that such checks 
  were a matter of police safety and that he did them routinely. The respondent's 
  vehicle had not been reported stolen. The officer did not remember whether he 
  received this information before or after he pulled the respondent over.</p>    <P>
  [18] After the officer had stopped the respondent, he approached the vehicle 
  and the respondent put down his driver's side window. The officer asked him 
  whether he knew what the speed limit was along the highway. The respondent suggested 
  100 kilometres an hour. The officer told him that it was 90 and that he had 
  been in excess of that speed when he passed the officer. The respondent produced 
  a Florida driver's licence on demand and told the officer that he played professional 
  basketball for the Toronto Raptors. The officer described the respondent as 
  being polite and quiet spoken.</p>    <P>
  [19] The respondent agreed in cross-examination that his and the officer's accounts 
  of the roadside conversation seemed to &quot;match&quot;. The respondent submits 
  that it is noteworthy that in neither participant's account was the 120 kilometres 
  per hour speed estimate mentioned. It was not suggested that the officer would 
  have stopped the respondent for a speeding infraction if he were travelling 
  only 10 kilometres an hour over the posted speed limit. The officer had admitted 
  to driving at 100 kilometres an hour on the occasion in question.</p>    <P>
  [20] As stated in the overview above, the respondent failed the roadside screening 
  test. He was arrested at 1:04 a.m. The officer explained to the respondent his 
  right to counsel and made the demand that he accompany him for the purpose of 
  providing samples of his breath so that an analysis of his blood-alcohol concentration 
  could be made.</p>    <P>
  [21] Constable Steve O'Donovan had arrived on the scene by the time of the arrest. 
  He sat in the back of the officer's jeep with the respondent for the ride to 
  the police station. They left the scene at 1:06 a.m. The respondent testified 
  that the officer had made notes on a piece of paper, scribbling something while 
  he was sitting in the driver's seat of the jeep before they left for the station. 
  A videotape record was made of the events that took place at the police station 
  and portions of it were played at trial during the cross-examination of the 
  officer. A piece of white paper was visible on the videotape and the respondent 
  testified that it was the notes the officer made. The officer did not know what 
  the paper was. He denied writing notes at the scene and denied making them on 
  some later date. He testified that he prepared them in his notebook after he 
  got to the station and before the respondent was handed over to the breath technician 
  and that he referred to these notes when reporting to the technician.</p>    <P>
  [22] The respondent was detained in the station before the officer in charge 
  at 1:19 a.m. and was taken to the breath technician at 1:45 a.m.</p>    <P>
  [23] The officer was questioned by the breath technician. The videotape showed 
  him with his opened notebook, to which he referred as he answered the technician's 
  questions. There were a number of discrepancies between his answers to the technician 
  and the information recorded in his notebook, which demonstrated, according 
  to the defence, that he was referring to the undisclosed white paper rather 
  than the notebook.</p>    <P>
  [24] The officer was cross-examined on entries in his notebook relating to the 
  appellant's speed. The officer wrote that he estimated the respondent's speed 
  to be &quot;10 120 kmp&quot;. This was an important point for the defence because, 
  if the officer had originally intended to write a number between 100 and 109, 
  it would have been supportive of the respondent's evidence that he was travelling 
  at 100 kilometres an hour.</p>    <P>
  [25] The officer acknowledged that he had failed to have the officer in charge 
  of the station sign off on his notes, as he was required to do when he reported 
  off duty on November 1, 1999, and that he had every opportunity to write the 
  notes between November 1 and November 5, which was the next date entries were 
  made in the notebook.</p>    <P>
  [26] As indicated, the respondent's evidence &quot;matched&quot; the officer's 
  in many respects. He admitted that he was travelling in excess of the speed 
  limit, although he estimated the speed as being only 100 kilometres an hour. 
  He testified that he would never pass a police officer on the road. He was from 
  the United States and that was something he would not do. He was travelling 
  in the centre lane on the DVP and he first noticed the police jeep when, around 
  Don Mills Road, he glanced to his right and saw it pull in next to him on his 
  passenger side. It was there for a few seconds. He described the officer as 
  looking into his vehicle. He changed lanes to the right in order to let the 
  police vehicle pass him. The officer pulled him over. He did not know why he 
  was being stopped.</p>    <P>
  [27] In his reasons on the application the trial judge accepted the evidence 
  of the officer over that of the respondent and concluded that he was &quot;satisfied 
  that the officer stopped Mr. Brown for precisely the reasons that he stated 
  in his evidence. I am satisfied that Mr. Brown was in fact speeding at an estimated 
  120 kilometres an hour.&quot; </p>    <P>
  [28] The trial judge did not accept the evidence of Mr. Brown on the basis that 
  he had been drinking and on the basis that he had failed to notice the posted 
  90 kilometres an hour speed limit signs. There was evidence that there were 
  a series of these signs. This led to the inference that he had not been particularly 
  careful in the observations he was making that night, including his observations 
  as to his speed.</p>    <P>
  [29] The trial judge dealt with several of the defence submissions respecting 
  frailties in the officer's evidence. Generally, the trial judge concluded that 
  they did not support &quot;the kind of allegations that have been made here 
  in this case.&quot; He did think that it was &quot;a little odd&quot; that the 
  officer stated to the breath technician that the time of the offence was 12.58 
  a.m. (which was after the respondent had stopped driving) because this was the 
  time that he decided that the respondent had committed an offence.</p>    <P>
  [30] The respondent before us expressed one or two mild criticisms of the trial 
  judge's findings on his credibility. For example, he submits that the videotape 
  showed that there were no signs of alcohol impairment. These points were not 
  pursued and so I will say nothing more on them. I observe, however, that in 
  two places there may be an indication that the trial judge had not grasped the 
  point made by the defence. First, he said that he detected no basis to think 
  that there was any racially motivated hostility on the part of the officer directed 
  at Mr. Brown and that he saw no evidence to justify the conclusion that Mr. 
  Brown was treated in a particular way because he was black or that he was a 
  Toronto Raptor. This is not, however, responsive to the argument of subconscious 
  racial profiling. Second, he dealt with the issue respecting the changing in 
  the notes from &quot;10&quot; to &quot;120&quot; as though the defence was suggesting 
  a fabrication of the notes. This was not the defence counsel's point.</p>    <P>
  The Appeal to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court</p>    <P>
  [31] The respondent's primary ground of appeal to the summary conviction appeal 
  court was that the trial judge conducted the trial in a manner that gave rise 
  to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The appeal judge gave effect to this ground. 
  After correctly stating the legal test for reasonable apprehension of bias, 
  which I will set forth later in these reasons, he analyzed &quot;the trial as 
  a whole&quot;. In this part of his reasons the appeal judge said that there 
  was &quot;a significant amount of evidence to support the [s. 9] application&quot; 
  and concluded:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The approach of the defence was a simple one - to attack the 
  credibility of the arresting officer for the purposes of convincing the learned 
  trial judge to reject his evidence on material points and to invite the Court 
  to accept the testimony of Mr. Brown as credible and reliable evidence proving 
  inferentially the subconscious racial stereotyping leading to the arrest. While 
  the learned trial judge eventually knew and appreciated the essential nature 
  of the application, he did not show such an understanding at all material times 
  throughout the trial. The discretionary power given to a trial judge to call 
  upon the defence at the beginning of an application under s. 24 of the Charter 
  to summarize the anticipated evidence was not used in this case. See R. v. Kutynec 
  (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301 (Ont. C.A.) for an elaboration of these principles. 
</p>    
<P>
  [32] Following this, the appeal judge commented on four &quot;specific aspects 
  of the conduct of the learned trial judge in this case&quot;. It is in this 
  part of his judgment that the appeal judge sets forth his reasons for concluding 
  that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias in this case.</p>    <P>
  [33] Because I will be examining these aspects in some detail later in these 
  reasons, I will now merely set forth a brief description for each aspect in 
  the order the appeal judge dealt with them:</p>    <P>
  1. Remarks made by the trial judge at the conclusion of the sentencing of the 
  respondent;</p>    <P>
  2. Remarks made by the trial judge during the respondent's counsel's submissions 
  to him after the evidence had been called;</p>    <P>
  3. Remarks made by the trial judge during the cross-examination of the officer; 
  and</p>    <P>
  4. Remarks made by the trial judge admonishing defence counsel for his tone 
  of voice in cross-examination of the officer and references to the amount of 
  time being taken to present the application. </p>    <P>
  [34] The appeal judge concluded his reasons as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Looking at these themes, in the context of the trial as a whole, 
  I am satisfied that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in this case. 
  This is not a case of a trial judge being biased. This analysis on appeal is 
  not a substitution of my view of the merit of the application for the view of 
  the learned trial judge. The result he arrived at was not unreasonable. However, 
  this is a case where a reasonable person who is aware of the prevalence of racism 
  in our community, the nature of the application and the traditions of integrity 
  and impartiality in the judiciary would, after looking at the trial as a whole, 
  reasonably apprehend a bias on the part of the learned trial judge.</p>    
<P>
  The Grounds of the Appeal to this Court</p>    <P>
  [35] The appellant advances three grounds of appeal:</p>    <P>
  1. Although the appeal judge correctly stated the test for reasonable apprehension 
  of bias, he erred in his application of the test in this case.</p>    <P>
  2. The appeal judge erred in finding that there was any, let alone substantial, 
  evidence to support the defence contention that the arrest of the respondent 
  resulted from racial profiling.</p>    <P>
  3. The appeal judge erred by setting, in effect, a lower standard for the application 
  of the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias in cases involving allegations 
  of racism.</p>    <P>
  [36] There is some overlap in these grounds of appeal in that there are factors 
  or considerations that are relevant to each ground or, at least to two of them. 
  Having noted this, I should say at the outset that the main and most comprehensive 
  ground is the first. For this reason, I shall address it after dealing with 
  the second and third grounds. Before considering any of the grounds of appeal, 
  I shall deal with the test for reasonable apprehension of bias and then the 
  standard of appellate review applicable to this appeal.</p>    <P>
  The Test for Determining Reasonable Apprehension of Bias</p>    <P>
  [37] The test, which both sides accept on this appeal, is set forth in the following 
  portion of the reasons of L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. and McLachlin J. in R. v. 
  S. (R.D.) (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at 367-368:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is that set out 
  by de Grandpr&eacute; J. in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National 
  Energy Board), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, 68 D.L.R. (3d) 716. Though he wrote dissenting 
  reasons, de Grandpr&eacute; J.'s articulation of the test for bias was adopted 
  by the majority of the Court, and has been consistently endorsed by this Court 
  in the intervening two decades: see, for example, Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 
  2 S.C.R. 673, 23 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 24 D.L.R. (4th) 161; R. v. Lipp&eacute;, [1991] 
  2 S.C.R. 114, 64 C.C.C. (3d) 513; Ruffo v. Conseil de la Magistrature, [1995] 
  4 S.C.R. 267, 130 D.L.R. (4th) 1. De Grandpr&eacute; J. stated, at pp. 394-95:</p>    
<P class="indent15"> &#133;the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, 
  held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question 
  and obtaining thereon the required information.&#133; [T]hat test is &quot;what 
  would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - 
  and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is 
  more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, 
  would not decide fairly.&quot;</p>
<P class="indent15">&#133;.. </p>
<P class="indent15">The grounds for this apprehension must, however, be substantial 
  and I &#133; [refuse] to accept the suggestion that the test be related to the 
  &quot;very sensitive or scrupulous conscience&quot;.</p>
<P class="indent15">&#133;.</p>
<P class="indent"> Although judicial proceedings will generally be bound by the 
  requirements of natural justice to a greater degree than will hearings before 
  administrative tribunals, judicial decision-makers, by virtue of their positions, 
  have nonetheless been granted considerable deference by appellate courts inquiring 
  into the apprehension of bias. This is because judges &quot;are assumed to be 
  [people] of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular 
  controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances&quot;: United States 
  v. Morgan 313 U.S. 409 (1941) at p. 421. The presumption of impartiality carries 
  considerable weight, for as Blackstone opined at p. 361 in Commentaries on the 
  Laws of England III, cited at footnote 49 in Richard F. Devlin, &quot;We Can't 
  Go On Together with Suspicious Minds: Judicial Bias and Radicalized Perspective 
  in R. v. R.D.S.&quot; (1995), 18 Dal. L.J. 408, at p. 417, &quot;[t]he law will 
  not suppose possibility of bias in a judge, who is already sworn to administer 
  impartial justice, and whose authority greatly depends upon that presumption 
  and idea&quot;. Thus, reviewing courts have been hesitant to make a finding 
  of bias or to perceive a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of a judge, 
  in the absence of convincing evidence to that effect: R. v. Smith &amp; Whiteway

<P>
  The Standard of Appellate Review</p>    <P>
  [40] The jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal is dependent on the appeal 
  being based on a question of law alone (Criminal Code, s. 839(1)). The respondent, 
  in raising no jurisdictional objection, accepts, correctly in my view, that 
  the appeal is based on a question of law alone. The application of the legal 
  test for reasonable apprehension of bias to the facts in this case involves 
  a question of law: R. v. Biniaris (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 
  23; R. v. Araujo (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 18; and see, 
  generally, Murneinik, &quot;The Application of Rules: Law or Fact?&quot; (1982), 
  98 L.Q.R. 587. Accordingly, the standard of review is that of correctness: Housen 
  v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.) at paras. 8 and 9. This 
  means that if our view is different from that of the appeal judge on the application 
  of the test for reasonable apprehension of bias, it is our duty to substitute 
  our conclusion for his.</p>    <P>
  [41] I shall now deal with the grounds of appeal.</p>    <P>
  The Gounds of Appeal Considered</p>    <P>
  (I) Is there Evidence of Racial Profiling in this Case?</p>    <P>
  [42] I am satisfied that there was evidence before the trial judge which was 
  capable of supporting a finding of racial profiling. The appeal judge made brief 
  reference to it in paragraph 16 of his reasons under the heading: &quot;The 
  Analysis of The Trial as a Whole.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [43] Before outlining this evidence it might be helpful to consider the legal 
  considerations relevant to the proof of racial profiling in this case.</p>    <P>
  [44] A racial profiling claim could rarely be proven by direct evidence. This 
  would involve an admission by a police officer that he or she was influenced 
  by racial stereotypes in the exercise of his or her discretion to stop a motorist. 
  Accordingly, if racial profiling is to be proven it must be done by inference 
  drawn from circumstantial evidence.</p>    <P>
  [45] The respondent submits that where the evidence shows that the circumstances 
  relating to a detention correspond to the phenomenon of racial profiling and 
  provide a basis for the court to infer that the police officer is lying about 
  why he or she singled out the accused person for attention, the record is then 
  capable of supporting a finding that the stop was based on racial profiling. 
  I accept that this is a way in which racial profiling could be proven. I do 
  not think that it sets the hurdle either too low (which could be unfair to honest 
  police officers performing their duties in a professional and unbiased manner) 
  or too high (which would make it virtually impossible for victims of racial 
  profiling to receive the protection of their rights under section 9 of the Charter).</p>    <P>
  [46] In the present case, in addition to submitting that the facts (a young 
  black person wearing a baseball hat and jogging clothes driving an expensive 
  new car) fit the phenomenon of racial profiling, the respondent refers to several 
  features of the evidence which support the argument that the officer was not 
  being truthful about the real reasons for the stop. I have set forth some of 
  it in the outline of the evidence, above, and will refer to the evidence again 
  in my consideration of the grounds of appeal relating to the application of 
  the test for reasonable apprehension of bias. Briefly, the record includes: 
  the respondent's evidence that the officer looked into his car before following 
  and stopping him; evidence of the second set of notes prepared by the officer 
  to firm up his reasons justifying the stop after he became aware the person 
  under arrest was a well-known sports figure likely to undertake a defence of 
  the charge against him; a licence check that the officer made before he stopped 
  the respondent; and discrepancies between the times recorded in his notebook 
  and those which he gave to the breathalyzer technician.</p>    <P>
  [47] It appears to me that the appellant's submission that there is no evidence 
  to support a finding of racial profiling is, in effect, an argument that racial 
  profiling should not be found on the evidence presented. For example, the appellant 
  submits that the positive evidence in support of a proper reason for stopping 
  the respondent, which the appellant submits was supported by the respondent, 
  destroys any arguable claim of racial profiling.</p>    <P>
  [48] In response to this, it must be noted that all that the respondent agreed 
  to is that the first matter that the officer raised with him was the speed at 
  which he was travelling. The officer did not say to him that he was driving 
  at 120 kilometres an hour. The respondent's evidence was that he was not exceeding 
  100 kilometres an hour. Further, the officer's statement respecting speed could 
  have been a pretext for the stop. Accordingly, it can hardly be said that the 
  respondent's evidence destroyed his claim.</p>    <P>
  [49] The appellant's other submissions under this heading similarly indicate 
  a process of reasoning with the evidence to arrive at a conclusion that there 
  was no profiling rather than showing an evidential record incapable of supporting 
  racial profiling.</p>    <P>
  (II) Did the Appeal Judge Set a Lower Standard for The Test of Reasonable Apprehension 
  of Bias?</p>    <P>
  [50] The appellant submits that the appeal judge erred by setting, in effect, 
  a lower standard for the application of the test for a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias because the case involved an allegation of racism. I do not think that 
  this ground of appeal is made out. The appeal judge rightly observed, and the 
  respondent took no issue with the observation, that a judge hearing any application 
  based on an allegation of racial profiling &quot;must be scrupulously aware 
  of the need to maintain the public confidence and the ability of the Courts 
  to hear and determine such applications fairly.&quot; In my view, this does 
  not mean that the appeal judge was lowering the standard for determining reasonable 
  apprehension of bias but was, rather, paying appropriate regard to the substantive 
  context in which the allegation was made.</p>    <P>
  [51] Part of the appellant's argument in relation to this ground of appeal is 
  that the trial judge erred in his application of the principles relating to 
  the reasonable apprehension of bias to the evidence. This argument substantially 
  overlaps submissions that are made in relation to the ground of appeal respecting 
  error in the application of the test for reasonable apprehension of bias and 
  I shall consider it in the next part of these reasons.</p>    <P>
  (III) Did The Appeal Judge Err in His Application of the Test for Reasonable 
  Application of Bias?</p>    <P>
  [52] As I have said, the appeal judge based his conclusion of reasonable apprehension 
  of bias on four aspects of the trial judge's conduct. The transcript of the 
  whole trial must be considered in assessing the overall effect of the trial 
  judge's conduct, and the most sensible way of doing this is to consider the 
  parts of the trial in the order in which they took place. This is the manner 
  in which a reasonable and informed observer of the proceedings would have seen 
  them unfold before concluding, at the end of the trial, whether or not the trial 
  judge's conduct gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Accordingly, 
  I shall consider the appeal judge's conclusions respecting the conduct of the 
  trial judge under the following headings: (a) during the giving of the evidence, 
  specifically, the cross-examination of the officer; (b) during defence counsel's 
  submissions on the s. 9 application; and (c) during the sentencing proceedings.</p>    <P>
  [53] It may be helpful at this point to note that the trial took two days. On 
  the first day the officer gave his evidence. On the second day Constable O'Donovan 
  gave brief evidence in the morning and was followed by the respondent and his 
  expert witness, Albert Duncan. In the afternoon of the second day, the respondent's 
  counsel made his submissions on the application, the trial judge decided the 
  application, and then, when no further evidence was offered, the trial was completed 
  with the conviction of the accused and the passing of the sentence.</p>    <P>
  (a) During the cross-examination of the officer</p>    <P>
  [54] The appeal judge's conclusions respecting this part of the trial are as 
  follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Third, several remarks made by the learned trial judge during 
  the cross-examination of the arresting officer on material aspects of the application, 
  viewed in the context of the trial as a whole, appeared to show a failure to 
  understand the importance of the evidence, a tendency to prejudge the merit 
  of the application or an inclination to assist the officer at critical stages 
  of the cross-examination. Interjections leading to these appearances occurred 
  during the cross-examination of the arresting officer on a number of important 
  themes - the driver was believed to be a black man as soon as the arresting 
  officer's attention was directed to the Ford Expedition, the existence of a 
  second set of notes that was destroyed and not disclosed to the defence and 
  the time when the appellant was pulled over in relation to the computerized 
  check done by the arresting officer to see, inter alia, if the licence was reported 
  stolen. Despite saying that he had not made up his mind and would listen to 
  the application, the comments of the learned trial judge that &quot;&#133;it 
  is a very serious allegation [the trial judge's words were &quot;it is very 
  serious allegations]&#133; and if it is [really] based on the kind of questions 
  you are asking now, I find it a little troubling &#133;&quot;, viewed reasonably, 
  created the appearances of a very different mindset at these and other critical 
  stages of the trial. </p>
<P class="indent">Fourth, in the context of these points, the remarks of the judge 
  admonishing the defence counsel for the tone of his voice in the cross-examination 
  of the arresting officer and the references to the amount of time being taken 
  to present the application take on a different meaning than might first be apparent. 
  By themselves, they would not be sufficient to allow the appeal. In the context 
  of the trial as a whole, they added to the appearances of injustice in this 
  case.</p>
<P>
  [55] While I fully appreciate that the significance of any particular part of 
  the trial can only be determined in the context of the trial as a whole, I shall, 
  initially, separately address the matters referred to in the statements of the 
  appeal judge. These include (i) a failure to understand the importance of the 
  evidence, (ii) a tendency to prejudge the merits of the application or assist 
  the officer, (iii) references to the amount of time being taken, and (iv) other 
  references to the trial judge's conduct. In some instances, I will express a 
  provisional opinion on the impugned conduct.</p>    <P>
  (i) A failure to understand the importance of the evidence</p>    <P>
  [56] The trial judge's comments that are relevant to this subject are not specified 
  in the appeal judge's reasons. As a general matter, I do not think that a failure 
  to understand the importance of evidence at the time it is given, by itself, 
  affords a foundation for a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias. It is, 
  merely, a failure to understand. A question by the trial judge designed to clarify 
  his or her understanding of the evidence, while it necessarily indicates a lack 
  of understanding, is, of course, proper.</p>    <P>
  [57] If, however, there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the trial 
  judge's failure to understand the evidence is the result of the judge having 
  a closed mind on the issue to which the evidence is addressed, then the misunderstanding 
  is a factor that should be taken into account. Having said this, I think I should 
  add that the crucial time to assess the effect of a failure to understand the 
  importance of the evidence is at the end of a case, after the judge has heard 
  all of the evidence and counsel's submissions on it.</p>    <P>
  [58] There are passages in the transcript which indicate a failure on the part 
  of the trial judge to understand the import of evidence sought on the cross-examination 
  of the officer. I will not set forth the instances of this because they are, 
  for the most part, followed by defence counsel taking advantage of the opportunity 
  to explain the significance of his questions. Further, this particular point 
  is also covered by parts of the transcript related to the appeal judge's conclusion 
  that the trial judge showed a tendency to prejudge the merit of the application 
  and an inclination to assist the officer at critical stages of the cross-examination. 
  I turn to them now.</p>    <P>
  (ii) A tendency to prejudge the merit of the application or an inclination to 
  assist the officer at critical stages of the cross-examination</p>    <P>
  [59] The most significant conduct of the trial judge that falls under this heading 
  is the trial judge's statement quoted, in part, in the appeal judge's reasons 
  set forth above in paragraph 54. It relates to the cross-examination of the 
  officer respecting whether he was reading from his notebook when he gave certain 
  relevant times to the breathalyzer technician at the police station on November 
  1, 1999. As I have said, what happened at the police station was recorded on 
  a videotape which was made at the station and was an exhibit at the trial. The 
  following intervention then took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> A. Well sir, I'd like to see the videotape before I say any 
  more.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: It's an important point, Your Honour. </p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Well without necessarily agreeing with that, I do 
  not think there is any rule prohibiting you from asking this kind of question 
  but, it is very serious allegations, Mr. Skurka.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Yes.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: And if it is really based on the kind of questions 
  you are asking now, I find it a little troubling. I am obviously going to keep 
  an open mind about all of this, but so far we have heard from the officer that 
  he just made these notes a short time before he had this conversation with the 
  Intoxilizer officer. There is no particular reason to assume, is there, that 
  everything that was in his mind a few minutes earlier had suddenly evaporated 
  and he necessarily had to flip pages of his book to provide answers to questions 
  and bearing in mind that this is not an experiment taking place in a nuclear 
  physics laboratory where perhaps seconds and minutes being recorded with great 
  precision matter. This just seems so far removed from the gist of the allegations 
  here and what I would have thought the focus of the trial would be on. </p>
<P>
  [60] These statements amount to an admonishment of, or at least a warning to, 
  defence counsel. The trial judge's expression of the view that the application 
  raised &quot;very serious allegations&quot; and that he found it &quot;a little 
  troubling&quot; appears to reflect an attitude that can reasonably be characterized 
  as judicial resistance to the application. The allegation of racial profiling 
  was, of course, serious - just as serious as the impact of the racial profiling 
  in question on the respondent, if such were the case. This was the issue that 
  the trial judge would have to decide at the end of the application. While the 
  evidence was being given, the proper judicial attitude should have been one 
  of detachment rather than one which appeared to show only concern respecting 
  the impact of the defence allegations on the officer.</p>    <P>
  [61] The trial judge's comment that he was &quot;going to keep an open mind&quot; 
  reflected his recognition that the comments he had just made could well be understood 
  as indicating a mind disposed against the application.</p>    <P>
  [62] The complaint arising from the trial judge's first intervention in the 
  cross-examination relates to differing evidence the officer gave respecting 
  the time when he first noticed that there was just one occupant in the Ford 
  Expedition as it made its way down the Don Valley Parkway. In his evidence in-chief, 
  he stated that there appeared to be a single occupant and then in cross-examination 
  he said that he determined that there was a single occupant when he walked up 
  and looked in the window of the vehicle. The following exchange took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> A. I don't actually recall, sir, exactly what I said there 
  in evidence in-chief. The determination that there's one person in that vehicle 
  because of the glass on the vehicle, I really, I could not say for sure until 
  I walked up and looked in the window of that vehicle. There could have been 
  more people inside the vehicle. That's what I'm saying to you.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: To be fair, Mr. Skurka, I think his evidence was 
  that when he followed the vehicle, there appeared to be a single occupant.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: I'm sorry.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. There appeared to be - you said - that's the point that I'm 
  putting to you sir, that you made a determination at the scene that there appeared 
  to be a single occupant in the car and that that was not a determination that 
  you made when you got to the roadway and the car was stopped, correct, sir?</p>
<P class="indent">A. I disagree with you</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: I do not think we have to get involved in a semantic 
  debate. I think there may be a difference between appearances and a determination.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: I'll accept what your Honour is saying.</p>
<P>
  [63] This intervention reflected a misunderstanding of the object of the cross-examination 
  at this point and it appeared to be on the side of the police officer. What 
  the officer saw, or thought he saw, when he was in his vehicle, was an important 
  part of the defence case. However, I think it is a small point in light of the 
  ensuing cross-examination, where defence counsel continued to pursue the differences 
  in the officer's evidence in-chief and in cross-examination.</p>    <P>
  [64] The next intervention followed evidence of discrepancies between the times 
  of events recorded in the officer's notebook and the times which he gave to 
  the breathalyzer technician. The defence's position was that the officer only 
  purported to read the times from his notebook but was actually reading from 
  notes on the white sheet that had not been disclosed to the defence. The intervention 
  is reflected in the following exchange:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Mr. Skurka, you do seem to be spending an inordinate 
  amount of time dealing with this, and on the face of them they don't seem all 
  that important to the essence of this case.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: They're extremely important and I'll tell Your Honour 
  I don't mind if the witness is here when I say this, and I'll tell you why. 
  It's important because it's going to be the position of the defence that this 
  officer prepared two notebooks, two set of notes and that's why it's crucial. 
  And that he prepared a second set of notes days after November 1st when he realized 
  who he was dealing with in terms of the accused in this case and what steps 
  he had to cover up in terms of explaining his reasons for stopping Mr. Brown. 
  So it's vital, crucial to the defence to provide Your Honour with - I can't 
  just come to you ---</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Yes, fine, fine. Go ahead.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: All right. Thank you, sir. </p>
<P>
  [65] Immediately following this, defence counsel said to the witness &quot;&#133; 
  you're smiling, do you find this funny, sir? Is this a joke?&quot; The following 
  then took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Just a minute. I do not think we have to spend court 
  time having that kind of exchange. Mr. Skurka, just ask questions and the officer 
  will answer them and we'll made some progress in this case.</p>    
<P>
  [66] The cross-examination of the officer on his reaction to defence counsel's 
  explanation to the judge respecting the notes would seem to be proper and should 
  have been allowed. The intervention appeared to protect the officer. It did 
  not, however, deflect counsel from continuing to pursue all aspects of the notes, 
  particularly the timing of the events.</p>    <P>
  [67] The next intervention during the cross-examination to which the respondent 
  refers relates to discrepancies in the police officer's evidence on the time 
  the offence was committed as set forth in a synopsis he prepared and the officer's 
  reasons for these discrepancies. The trial judge said:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Sorry, you could have been referring to this record 
  produced by the Intoxilizer when you prepared this, the synopsis?</p>
<P class="indent">THE WITNESS: I could very well have been, yes. Your Honour, 
  I can honestly say I have no recollection of doing that synopsis, so what I 
  used whether it was my memobook or the record from the Intoxilizer, I do not 
  know.</p>
<P>
  [68] This intervention shows the trial judge coming to the assistance of the 
  officer with a speculative suggestion of an answer that the officer himself 
  had not thought of and which he did not ultimately adopt. It did not, however, 
  prevent the cross-examination on the officer's previous answers continuing with 
  its momentum as the respondent submits.</p>    <P>
  [69] The next part of the cross-examination to which the respondent refers is 
  the passage in which the trial judge commented on defence counsel's tone of 
  voice during his cross-examination of the officer on whether he had &quot;clocked&quot; 
  the respondent's speed. The officer said that he had not. The following exchange 
  then took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Can I just ask, Mr. Skurka, why you are using that 
  tone? This is just a trial in a courtroom, there is no need to be so outraged 
  and to use that kind of tone with the evidence.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: It's not outrage, Your Honour, with respect. It's 
  simply the way I conduct my cross-examination.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Well tone it down because I do not think it is appropriate. 
  I think you should treat the witness with some courtesy and try to stay calm.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Yes, thank you, Your Honour. </p>
<P>
  [70] The respondent submits that because the respondent's excessive speed was 
  the alleged reason the officer gave for stopping him, there was absolutely nothing 
  wrong in the circumstances with counsel revealing his outrage on the subject. 
  The respondent further submitted that such an intervention cannot fail to be 
  distracting at best and intimidating at worst.</p>    <P>
  [71] It is not possible for anyone not present at the trial to come to a definitive 
  conclusion on this submission. Certainly, the trial judge has a responsibility 
  to regulate the decorum of the participants in a trial and I cannot say that 
  the trial judge's comments were unwarranted. I would note that the intervention 
  had no inhibiting effect on counsel pursuing the line of questioning on which 
  he was embarked.</p>    <P>
  [72] The respondent relies on a further part of the cross-examination to show 
  a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge. This segment 
  relates to the cross-examination of the officer on the entry in his notebook 
  relating to the respondent's speed in which he wrote &quot;10 120 kmp&quot;. 
  In the outline of the evidence above I explain why this was an important point 
  for the defence. The following exchange took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Q. So that this was going to be somewhere we know between 100 
  and 109, correct? Before you crossed it out.</p>
<P class="indent">A. I think it's just an error.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. But as you were writing this, this was going to be a three 
  digit number and it was going to be 100 to 109. We can agree on that, can't 
  we?</p>
<P class="indent">A. I think it's just an error sir.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. Well you weren't going to say that you estimated it to be 
  10 kilometres an hour, were you, when you started to write this.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Mr. Skurka, he has explained three times. There is 
  no point arguing with him. And it is quite visible what it is that it appears. 
  Whether it is consistent with your theory or not is something you can argue 
  later, but anybody looking at it can see that there is one zero with a line 
  through it and 120 beside it. He has agreed that he made a mistake and corrected 
  it.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: No, but with respect, if I could address this point. 
  I'm merely making the point that it wasn't a two digit number that was crossed 
  out, I'm suggesting to this officer that he was going to write a number that 
  was three digits. I'm obligated to put that to him if that's my position, with 
  respect. Obligated.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Yes. I think you are obligated to put it once if 
  it is important to you. I do not think it is necessary to repeat it three times.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Fair enough, thank you, Your Honour.</p>
<P>
  [73] The respondent submits that the issue was not whether the officer had made 
  an error, but whether the error reflected the truth respecting the respondent's 
  speed. The respondent submits that the trial judge's intervention effectively 
  shielded the officer from any questioning on the point.</p>    <P>
  [74] I agree with the comments of the trial judge that there was sufficient 
  evidence in the record to enable defence counsel to make his point during the 
  argument at the end of the evidence. I also think that counsel was entitled 
  to develop the evidence supporting the point by further cross-examination of 
  the officer on his thought processes. In fact, however, counsel very soon after 
  cross-examined the officer on his thought processes when he &quot;started to 
  write in that notebook before [he] corrected the mistake &#133;&quot;. There 
  was no intervention by the trial judge in this cross-examination. In the result, 
  the intervention did not shield the officer from answering questions on the 
  point.</p>    <P>
  (iii) References to the amount of time being taken to present the application</p>    <P>
  [75] Part way through the first morning of the trial, the trial judge, as shown 
  in the part of the record quoted previously in paragraph 64, said to defence 
  counsel that he seemed &quot;to be spending an inordinate amount of time dealing 
  with this, and on the face of them they don't seem all that important to the 
  essence of the case&quot;. Later in the morning he said that he &quot;was a 
  little curious about why a case like this had been set for two days&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [76] After the midday adjournment, defence counsel informed the trial judge 
  that the two-day trial was fixed at a pretrial conference over which a judge 
  had presided. The judge concluded his response to this as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> &#133;but in any event, you take as much time as you need. 
  We obviously have the time available and there is no need to feel that you are 
  being rushed at any time.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Thank you, sir. I'm grateful for that.</p>    
<P>
  [77] The matter of the time being taken by the trial was not raised again. While 
  the trial judge's observations respecting the time may have indicated some impatience 
  on his part in the early part of the trial and the failure to appreciate the 
  potential significance of some of the evidence, it was clear by the beginning 
  of the afternoon of the first day that counsel need not be concerned about the 
  time factor.</p>
<p>(iv) Other references by the appeal judge to the trial judge's conduct</p>    <P>
  [78] The appeal judge referred to an interjection by the trial judge during 
  the cross-examination on the &quot;theme&quot; that the driver was believed 
  to be a black as soon as the arresting officer's attention was directed to the 
  Ford Expedition. The officer's belief in this regard, was, of course, an essential 
  element in the defence case but I do not think that the transcript shows any 
  intervention by the trial judge during cross-examination on this subject and 
  none were brought to our attention. It may be that the appeal judge had in mind 
  the intervention relating to the cross-examination I have dealt with relating 
  to when the officer knew there was just one occupant in the car.</p>    <P>
  [79] Further, although the subject of whether the officer had received the report 
  back from the Mobile Date Terminal (&quot;the Computerized check done by the 
  arresting officer&quot;) before or after he stopped the respondent's car was 
  an important matter covered in the cross-examination of the officer, the transcript 
  shows no significant interventions of the trial judge during this part of the 
  trial and none were referred to in the argument before us.</p>    <P>
  Summary</p>    <P>
  [80] If the argument supporting reasonable apprehension of bias were based solely 
  on what happened during the cross-examination of the officer, I think that it 
  would fail. Although the trial judge's expression of concern to defence counsel 
  respecting the &quot;serious&quot; allegation made is troubling, I think that 
  the record shows that the trial judge, generally, conducted the trial in a businesslike 
  and even-handed manner. Defence counsel was denied no line of inquiry. This 
  part of the record, on its own, falls short of showing the convincing and cogent 
  evidence required to support a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>    <P>
  (b) The trial judge's interventions during defence counsel's submissions</p>    <P>
  [81] With respect to the submissions segment of the trial, the appeal judge 
  said:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Second, while dialogue with counsel during submissions can, 
  and often times does, move the trial to an orderly conclusion by defining the 
  issues to be determined and inviting counsel to make concise submissions on 
  them, that is not what occurred in this case. Here, the learned judge entered 
  into the following dialogue with the defence counsel during his submissions:</p>
<P class="indent"> MR. SKURKA: What I would ask to be permitted, is to give you 
  the building blocks of the position I'm taking, that's all.</p>
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: I could be anxious if you did because&#133;</p>
<P class="indent"> MR. SKURKA: Thank you.</p>
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: &#133;and I think&#133; if you want me to be frank 
  with you so you know what my concerns are.</p>
<P class="indent"> MR. SKURKA: I do want you to be frank.</p>
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: But it does concern me that you have made such serious 
  allegations, really quite nasty, malicious, potentially, accusations based on, 
  it seems to me, nothing and you are going to have to persuade me that there 
  is some appropriate basis on which to make this kind of accusation about an 
  alleged racist motivation on the part of the officer. I did not understand your 
  client to say that he had any difficulty with the officers in the dealings that 
  he had with them. He agreed that the officer's evidence concerning the conversation 
  they had was accurate. We saw the videotape. There did not seem to be any particular 
  tension or hostility between the two when they were at the police station.</p>
<P class="indent"> This remark arguably showed a failure to appreciate material 
  aspects of the evidence at a late stage in the trial. It also arguably showed 
  a failure to appreciate that racial profiling can be a subconscious factor impacting 
  on the exercise of a discretionary power in a multicultural society. Granted, 
  the learned trial judge invited defence counsel to persuade him of the merit 
  of his position. This invitation, however, was a hollow one as the appearances 
  of this dialogue in the context of the trial as a whole are reasonably open 
  to the interpretation that he had determined the merit of the application before 
  counsel was heard on it and that he did not understand the practice of racial 
  profiling. This interpretation of these remarks is consistent with the inappropriate 
  remarks he made while sentencing the appellant.</p>
<P>
  [82] There were other comments made by the trial judge during the submissions 
  which the respondent submits are relevant to this issue. I shall refer to them.</p>    <P>
  [83] Early in the argument the following exchange took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Well, I guess the question ---</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Harassing is ---</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: --- that arises then what evidence is there of any 
  improper purpose on the part of the officer. Surely the fact that the driver 
  who is speeding happens to be black does not provide any evidence that the officer 
  stopped him.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: I haven't said that, Your Honour, with respect.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Well, all right. Well, I am asking you what evidence 
  is there of any improper purpose? </p>
<P>
  [84] At this time the trial judge had heard evidence that the officer had pulled 
  beside the respondent's car, looked toward the respondent, fell back and requested 
  an Mobile Data Terminal check, signalled the respondent over and written a separate, 
  undisclosed set of notes about the encounter. As counsel submitted, pulling 
  over a person who &quot;happens to be black&quot; had never been the basis of 
  the application. These words, at that stage of the case, could well have been 
  understood as trivializing the application and indicating the trial judge's 
  resistance to it.</p>    <P>
  [85] Soon after this the following exchange took place:</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: All right. And just so we are all on the same wave 
  length, the illegitimate purpose here was what?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: The illegitimate purpose was to check this car out 
  and the occupant of the car for criminal and quasi-criminal purposes related 
  to the MDT check that he'd conducted with full knowledge that the person was 
  being stopped because they were a person of colour.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: And hence according to defence theory, why would 
  Constable Duncan and Acting Sergeant Olson want to do that? He is employed by 
  Traffic Services to patrol the highways. Why would he want ---</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Because he made assumptions.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: --- to conduct an improper groundless criminal investigation 
  on somebody who just happened to be driving down the Don Valley Parkway.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Well you could ask that about every racial profiling 
  case. My respectful submission ---</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Oh no, I do not think so.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: All right.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: It seems to me that if we are talking about Jane 
  and Finch and some allegation concerning a pattern of abusive detentions of 
  people who just happen to be using the streets it is one thing. When we are 
  talking about the Don Valley Parkway, where thousands of drivers, a good percentage 
  of whom I assume, given the demographics of this community, are people of colour, 
  are stopped because of stated traffic reasons, how does that give rise to an 
  allegation of improper purpose? </p>
<P>
  [86] Racial profiling provides its own motivation - a belief by a police officer 
  that a person's colour, combined with other circumstances, makes him or her 
  more likely to be involved in criminal activity. Defence counsel was correct 
  in saying that question could be asked of every racial profiling case. He could 
  not be expected to advance a motivation for a racial profiling beyond the motive 
  inherent in the practice itself.</p>    <P>
  [87] The trial judge's remark that it would be different if the case arose at 
  Jane and Finch and involved a &quot;pattern of abusive detentions of people 
  who just happened to be using the street&quot; reflects two misunderstandings. 
  First, there was no evidence supporting the trial judge's assumption that racial 
  profiling is more likely to occur in an area where the population includes a 
  large proportion of the targeted racial group. Such evidence was not likely 
  to be available. Studies on racial profiling establish that it is more likely 
  to occur in areas where its victims look out of place than in areas where their 
  skin colour is prominent: D. Harris, Profiles on Injustice: Why Racial Profiling 
  Cannot Work (New York: New Press, 2002) at 69-71.</p>    <P>
  [88] Second, the trial judge's reference to a &quot;pattern of abusive detention&quot; 
  set the test higher than any individual litigant would practically be able to 
  satisfy. It is difficult to see why he would have thought the respondent should 
  be required to show a particular instance of police conduct that fit a wider 
  pattern.</p>    <P>
  [89] A reasonable observer might have thought that these statements by the trial 
  judge indicated a resistance to the actual defence before him: that a police 
  officer had made assumptions about a black man driving an expensive car before 
  stopping him and then lied about his reasons for the stop.</p>    <P>
  [90] Soon after this, the exchange set forth in paragraph 81 of these reasons 
  took place. In his remarks the trial judge said that the defence had made &quot;serious&quot; 
  and &quot;quite nasty, malicious, potentially, accusations based on, it seems 
  to me, nothing &#133;&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [91] The reasonable observer could take from these words that the trial judge 
  was strongly disposed against the application and that the most significant 
  factor for him was the impact of the application on the officer. The description 
  of the respondent's case as &quot;serious&quot; was a repetition of what the 
  trial judge had said during the cross-examination.</p>    <P>
  [92] Later in the submissions, the following exchange took place.</p>    
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Are we really at the point where a police officer 
  has to worry about saying, I stopped a motor vehicle being driven by a driver 
  who was black, because it gives rise to some allegation by the defence, that 
  the reason the vehicle was stopped was because the driver was black?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: No, I'm not ---</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: You seem to be suggesting that the officer knew he 
  was black, but took deliberate steps to avoid saying that, because otherwise, 
  somebody would have attached some significance to the officer's observation, 
  suggesting that it was indicative of some improper motive. </p>
<P>
  [93] This reflects the same thought as that indicated in the trial judge's earlier 
  intervention: &quot;surely the fact that the driver who is speeding happens 
  to be black does not provide any evidence that the officer stopped him [for 
  an improper purpose]&quot;. The case for the defence was based on more that 
  the fact that the driver of the car was black.</p>    <P>
  [94] Finally, near the end of the submissions, defence counsel quoted a passage 
  from R. v. Parks (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324 (C.A.) at 342 to the effect that a 
  large segment of the community subconsciously operates on the basis of negative 
  racial stereotypes. Part of this passage was quoted with approval by L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. and McLachlin J. in R. v. S. (R.D.), supra at paragraph 38 of these reasons:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Racism, and in particular anti-black racism, is a part of our 
  community's psyche. A significant segment of our community holds overtly racist 
  views. A much larger segment subconsciously operates on the basis of negative 
  racial stereotypes.</p>
<P>Defence counsel said that he relied on the last sentence in 
  this passage. The following then took place:</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Well, I honestly do not understand that. How can 
  you say the officer is lying about your client doing 120, and yet in some subtle 
  subconscious kind of racism, when you say that it has caused the officer to 
  perjure himself in a courtroom with the object of having your innocent client, 
  sorry not your innocent client, we are dealing here with a Charter application, 
  but in order to justify an arbitrary detention. How can you say that that is 
  subtle subconscious racism?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. SKURKA: Because I'm not saying that, what my point is this, 
  that he has made, my respectful submission, stereotypes about the man in that 
  car. It's not as if he holds or harbours racist views.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: I do not think that is appropriate. You are making, 
  it seems to me, a clear cut, serious, quite offensive allegation with respect 
  to an officer, and I don't think it's really proper for you to mask it at the 
  end of the day by quoting from Parks, and suggesting that some segments of society 
  are subject to subconscious racial stereotyping, and perhaps that is what is 
  happening here. You have made the allegation that the officer has fabricated 
  a set of notes, that he has come to the courtroom and told all sorts of lies 
  about your client. And in my view that simply is not consistent with this passage 
  that you have chosen to read from Parks. </p>
<P>
  [95] It may be noted that this is the third time that the trial judge has characterized 
  the application as being based on a &quot;serious&quot; allegation, as well 
  as a &quot;quite offensive&quot; allegation. The main impact of this could be 
  to make it clear to the observer that the trial judge disapproved of what had 
  been said about the officer and that he was not open to the characterization 
  of the officer as someone who was not an overt racist but, rather, one who acted 
  on subconscious beliefs and then, when required to justify his actions, invented 
  evidence for this purpose.</p>    <P>
  Summary</p>    <P>
  [96] As a general proposition, it may be said that a trial judge has considerably 
  more scope to intervene during the submissions segment of the trial than during 
  the evidence segment. The purpose of the intervening is to enable the judge 
  to obtain the assistance of counsel on matters that are of concern to him or 
  her in order to fully understand the case that is being submitted. Judicial 
  interventions for this purpose do not have to take any particular form and I 
  do not rule out blunt statements of the judge's tentative conclusions, provided 
  that their purpose is to afford counsel the opportunity to &quot;bring the judge 
  around&quot;. I think that some of the trial judge's statements could be understood 
  as serving this purpose. Others, however, such as those expressing the trial 
  judge's view that the allegations in the application were &quot;serious, offensive, 
  nasty, or malicious,&quot; are somewhat like conversation-stoppers and serve 
  mainly to indicate the judge's general antipathy to the application and not 
  to elicit helpful responses.</p>    <P>
  [97] The foregoing considerations are of concern. I will return to them after 
  considering the appeal judge's opinion respecting the trial judge's conduct 
  during the sentencing.</p>    <P>
  (c) The trial judge's remarks during the sentencing</p>    <P>
  [98] Near the end of his reasons for the sentence he imposed, the trial judge 
  said:</p>    
<P class="indent"> I should say as well that I do not know whether my tone this 
  afternoon might have displayed my distaste for the matters that were raised 
  during the course of the trial, but that really is not relevant to determining 
  the sentence. I do not disagree with the officer's initial assessment of you. 
  You dealt with him apparently in a polite and courteous way, and I had the impression 
  when you were giving your evidence that you are that sort of person. So there 
  is nothing inherently reprehensible about your conduct that I think should be 
  treated as an aggravating factor when it comes to imposing sentence, which is 
  not to say that it would not be nice if perhaps you might extend an apology 
  to the officer because, I am satisfied, the allegations were completely unwarranted. 
  But that is only my assessment. You are not required to share it and I will 
  leave it to you to do what you think is right in that regard.</p>    
<P>
  [99] The appeal judge said that &quot;as the application was clearly one of 
  arguable merit, [these] remarks &#133; were completely inappropriate&quot;. 
  He said that they created &quot;an appearance of a mindset throughout the trial 
  inconsistent with the duty to be impartial&quot;. He went on to say:</p>    
<P class="indent"> No defendant need apologize to anyone for an application brought 
  at trial by a competent defence counsel where the application is of arguable 
  merit, even if it does not succeed. For a trial judge to regard the presentation 
  of such an application as distasteful is a significant departure from his/her 
  obligation to ensure the appearances of justice and the essential fairness of 
  the trial. It is materially inconsistent with the duty of a judge to hear and 
  determine the application with an open mind. Similar observations by this Court 
  would be appropriate if the learned trial judge had accepted the defence position 
  on the application and suggested to the police officer that he apologize to 
  the defendant.</p>    
<P>
  [100] The appellant submits that, while the trial judge's comments, especially 
  in relation to the apology, would have been better left &quot;unsaid&quot;, 
  it is wrong to characterize them as creating the &quot;appearance of a mindset 
  throughout the trial inconsistent with the duty to be impartial&quot; [emphasis 
  added]. Further, it was wrong to &quot;reason back&quot; from these comments 
  at the end of the trial to say that they coloured everything that preceded them. 
  The appellant further submits that the judge's &quot;distaste&quot; arose from 
  the lack of a foundation for the allegations in the case.</p>    <P>
  [101] I am not persuaded by these submissions. There is no &quot;reasoning back&quot; 
  involved in concluding that the trial judge's statement reflected a view that 
  he held during the trial. His statement related directly to his &quot;distaste 
  for the matters that were raised during the course of the trial&quot; [emphasis 
  added] and indicates that his attitude was one of distaste for the defence position. 
  The statement acknowledges that this attitude may have been noticed by the respondent 
  and, necessarily, by all other persons in the courtroom.</p>    <P>
  [102] Further, as I have indicated earlier in these reasons, there was evidence 
  on which racial profiling could be found. Accordingly, although it was open 
  to the trial judge not to accept this evidence following a fair and impartial 
  hearing, it cannot be said there was &quot;a lack of foundation for the allegations 
  in this case&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [103] I need not labour the point that the open indication of distaste or, to 
  use a synonym, aversion, during the presentation of a case is utterly inconsistent 
  with the duty of a judge to listen dispassionately with an open mind. It could 
  reasonably have signalled to the respondent that the trial judge had a fixed 
  and negative view of the defence raising issues of race.</p>    
<P> [104] The suggestion of an apology, an act that is not part of the proper 
  judicial function, was consistent with the judge's expression of distaste and 
  reinforces the appearance of the primacy of his concerns for the effect of the 
  application on the officer. It can only be seen as being demeaning to the respondent 
  who had given evidence that, if accepted, supported a finding of racial profiling.</p>
<P>
  Conclusion</p>    <P>
  [105] Accepting that a finding of a reasonable apprehension of bias should not 
  be made except on the basis of cogent evidence, I feel obliged to conclude, 
  in agreement with the appeal judge, that on the record reviewed in these reasons 
  the finding should be made. I have said that the evidence segment of the trial, 
  standing alone, would not support such a finding. The submission segment gives 
  rise to concerns. The remarks made during sentencing do not stand on their own. 
  By their very terms they relate back to what took place during the trial and, 
  in my view, remove any doubts about the impact of the trial judge's conduct 
  on the mind of a reasonable observer who had been present throughout the trial. 
  I think that this observer would have felt that the trial judge showed such 
  an antipathy and resistance to the application that he was unable to hear and 
  determine it with an open and dispassionate mind.</p>    <P>
  Disposition</p>    
<P> [106] I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.</p>
