<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In our view Rule 20.04(4) provided a proper basis for the motions judge 
  to decide the question of law on this motion.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] As to the malicious prosecution claim we need not finally pronounce on 
  her answer to the question of law, because we agree with the motions judge that 
  this claim cannot be said to have been properly pleaded until 2002 and is therefore 
  prescribed.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] As to the first defamation claim, it too was not pleaded until 2002 and 
  is clearly presented.<br>
</p>
<P>[4] As to the second defamation claim arising from the March 29, 1993 letter 
  there is nothing on the record to indicate that it was written outside the scope 
  of the author's authority. On its face, the opposite appear to be the case. 
  The limitation period in the P.A.P.A. was therefore properly applicable and 
  the motions judge was correct in finding this claim is prescribed as well.<br>
</p>
<P>[5] In the result, the appeal is dismissed. Costs fixed on a partial indemnity 
  basis at $3000.</p>
