<p>On appeal from a finding of guilt by Justice Lawrence P. Thibideau of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated April 18, 2001.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, B.S.M., was charged with committing a sexual assault on D.P. 
  on March 23, 2000. Following a trial before Thibideau J. presiding as a Youth 
  Court judge, B.S.M. was found guilty of this offence. She was sentenced to two 
  years probation. She appeals the finding of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant and the complainant were grade 6 classmates. The appellant 
  was 12 years old; the complainant was 11. After school on March 23, 2000, the 
  complainant and another classmate, D.N., went to the appellant's apartment. 
  The appellant's foster mother was at the apartment when the three girls arrived, 
  but left sometime later.</p>
<p> [3] D.P. and D.N. alleged that, during a game of &quot;house&quot;, the appellant 
  kissed them on the mouth and put her tongue in their mouths. D.P. also claimed 
  that the appellant followed her to the bathroom, pulled down her pants and underwear, 
  and tried to induce the family dog to mount and &quot;hump&quot; her. Finally, 
  both girls alleged, that while they were in the bedroom, the appellant pulled 
  down their pants and underwear and licked their genitals. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant testified in her own defence. She admitting kissing D.P. and 
  D.N. in the context of the game they were playing, but denied putting her tongue 
  in their mouths. She also testified that the oral sex and the sexual activity 
  involving the dog did not take place.</p>
<p> [5] The trial judge disbelieved the appellant's testimony. He believed the 
  testimony of D.P. and D.N. and found that it was corroborated in important respects 
  by the testimony of the appellant's foster mother and foster father. In a 15-page 
  oral judgment, the trial judge found the appellant guilty of sexual assault.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant appeals the finding of guilt on three grounds.</p>
<p>
  (1) Burden of proof</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant asserts that the trial judge's reasons for judgment disclose 
  that he decided the case solely on the basis of &quot;preferring&quot; the testimony 
  of the complainant and other Crown witnesses over that of the appellant. This 
  line of reasoning, the appellant contends, is contrary to the approach mandated 
  in many leading cases, particularly R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. The appellant 
  further submits that the trial judge's treatment of the issue of D.P.'s and 
  D.N.'s motive for accusing her of sexual misconduct was inconsistent with the 
  burden of proof in a criminal trial. </p>
<p>
  [8] I disagree. Although the trial judge did conclude that the evidence of the 
  Crown witnesses &quot;must be preferred&quot;, and although he did not refer 
  explicitly to the W.(D.) formula, it is clear from a reading of his reasons 
  as a whole that he applied the burden of proof in a proper fashion. He carefully 
  reviewed the evidence of the witnesses, gave clear reasons for disbelieving 
  the appellant's testimony and, importantly, was alive to physical evidence and 
  testimony from the appellant's foster parents that tended to support the complainant's 
  testimony: see R. v. Tyrrell (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 50 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [9] Similarly, although the trial judge's language on the motive issue was not 
  optimum, any concern about the trial judge's formulation dissolves in the context 
  of his comprehensive reasons read in their entirety. The trial judge's very 
  full canvass of the evidence in his reasons establishes that he was cognizant 
  of, and properly applied, the criminal burden of proof.</p>
<p>
  (2) Inconsistencies and improbabilities in evidence of Crown witnesses</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in concluding that &quot;[t]he 
  evidence of [D.P. and D.N.] regarding sexual assault by [the appellant] is similar 
  but not identical, both as to their own personal experience and what they saw 
  and heard in relation to the other.&quot; The appellant points to inconsistencies 
  with respect to the timing of the French kissing (during the game of &quot;house&quot; 
  in the afternoon or later in the evening) and the location of the sexual activity 
  involving the dog (bathroom or bedroom).</p>
<p>
  [11] I do not accept the appellant's submission on this issue. The trial judge 
  specifically acknowledged that there were inconsistencies in the testimony of 
  D.P. and D.N. However, he concluded that their testimony was &quot;similar in 
  essential details with respect to the kind of conduct seen or complained of&quot;. 
  In my view, the record amply supports this conclusion. The core of the testimony 
  of D.P. and D.N. who, it must be emphasized, were 11 years old at the time of 
  the incident, was indeed very similar - namely, French kissing, oral sex and 
  sexual activity with the dog. The discrepancies in their testimony were minor 
  and need to be viewed in the context of the common sense approach articulated 
  by Wilson J. in R. v. B.(G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30 at 55: &quot;While children 
  may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where 
  of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived 
  what happened to them and who did it.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [12] Under the rubric of 'improbability', the appellant contends that D.P.'s 
  testimony about the events in the apartment on a Thursday afternoon and evening 
  was underminded by the testimony of the appellant's foster mother that D.P. 
  showed up for a planned sleepover (which the foster mother cancelled for unrelated 
  reasons) on Friday evening. The appellant contends that it was incumbent on 
  the trial judge to deal with this evidence because it rendered the appellant's 
  testimony about the events on Thursday highly improbable.</p>
<p>
  [13] I do not accept this submission. The complainant was asked no questions 
  about the Friday sleepover. The matter was mentioned briefly in the testimony 
  of the appellant and her foster mother. There could have been any number of 
  reasons why D.P. appeared to be willing to participate in the sleepover on Friday, 
  none of which were explored with the witnesses. There is no obligation on a 
  trial judge to deal with every piece of evidence in reasons for judgment. I 
  do not think that the skimpy evidence relating to the sleepover was so bizarre 
  or contradictory that it required specific treatment by the trial judge in his 
  reasons: see R. v. R.(D.), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 291 at 314-15, and R. v. Pregent, 
  [1998] O.J. No. 153 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1998] S.C.C.A. 
  No. 340.</p>
<p>
  (3) Other misapprehensions of evidence</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  in four areas - the girls' telephone call to their parents on Thursday night, 
  the torn scarf in the bedroom, the alleged inconsistencies in the appellant's 
  testimony, and the evidence about whether the appellant changed her clothing 
  on the night in question.</p>
<p>
  [15] In my view, these are minor matters. I see no error in the manner in which 
  the trial judge reviewed this evidence or in the inferences he drew from it.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [16] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
