<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the decision of MacDonald J. dismissing her 
  appeal from conviction by Fernandez J. The appellant has no prior criminal record 
  and we recognize the impact these convictions have had on her and her family. 
  We have therefore carefully reviewed the transcripts of evidence, the reasons 
  of MacDonald J. and Fernandez J. and the other material filed by the appellant. 
  Unfortunately, we have determined that this appeal must be dismissed. Under 
  the Criminal Code we have only a very limited jurisdiction and can only intervene 
  where there are errors of law alone. </p>
<p>
  [2] None of the matters raised before us raise questions of law alone.</p>
<p>
  [3] The absence of the exhibits in this appeal did not prejudice the appellant. 
  The exhibits are described on the record. None of the matters raised required 
  that we actually see the exhibits.</p>
<p>
  [4] Questions of credibility are uniquely a matter for the trial judge. The 
  trial judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant's daughter's evidence 
  was of limited assistance for the reasons he gave. Any alleged errors at most 
  involved questions of mixed fact and law. We do not agree that the trial judge 
  simply judged Samantha's evidence on the basis of negative stereotypes about 
  children's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [5] The procedure adopted at trial of a blended voir dire and trial was unusual 
  but did not unfairly impact on the trial. The judge could not have been under 
  any misconception that the defence conceded that the appellant's statements 
  were admissible.</p>
<p>
  [6] The misapprehension of the evidence of Officer Blakely that he tested the 
  machine with a valid TTC token did not amount to an error of law since that 
  piece of evidence played no part in the trial judge's conclusions.</p>
<p>
  [7] We are satisfied that all of the parties understood where the coins, foreign 
  and Canadian, were found. This issue in any event does not involve a question 
  of law alone.</p>
<p>
  [8] The officer had grounds to arrest the appellant since he apparently found 
  her committing the offence. The arrest was therefore lawful. The matters raised 
  by Mr. Bujtor on his wife's behalf do not cast any doubt on the lawfulness of 
  the arrest or the validity of the convictions.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, leave to appeal is dismissed.</p>
