<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Wolch's submissions focused primarily on the suggested error of Cullity 
  J. in failing to find that all of the bills were interim rather than final and, 
  secondarily, in failing to find the presence of special circumstances. The question 
  whether bills are interim or final is a question of fact. Cullity J. found as 
  a fact that they were final and that the appellant knew or ought reasonably 
  to have known this to be so. Cullity J. also specifically found as a fact, on 
  a review of the record, that there were no special circumstances. There was 
  evidence in the record to support these findings. We agree with them and see 
  no reason to disturb them.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs, which we fix in the amounts 
  of $3,000 for the respondent Assuras and $2,500 for the respondent Bennett Best 
  Burn. These figures are inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
