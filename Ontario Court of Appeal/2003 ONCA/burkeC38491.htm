<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Susan Greer of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated June 6, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is a representative action involving claims made on behalf of certain 
  former members of the Hudson Bay Company (&quot;the Bay&quot;) pension plan 
  (&quot;the Plan&quot;). The plaintiffs left the Plan when the Bay sold the division 
  in which they worked. Their pension rights were transferred to their new employer. 
  The Plan continued for the Bay's remaining employees. The plaintiffs assert 
  a claim to a pro-rata share of the actuarial surplus that existed in the Plan 
  at the time of the sale. The plaintiffs also contend that the actuarial surplus 
  would have been larger but for certain impugned practices adopted by the Bay 
  prior to the sale. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Bay sought the determination of the following questions under Rule 21.01(1)(a) 
  and the motions judge gave the following answers: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) Surplus Entitlement</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) whether, assuming no full or partial termination of the 
  Plan occurred at the time of the sale of the Northern Stores Division in 1987, 
  the plaintiffs have a current entitlement to a transfer of, or any other legal 
  or equitable right or interest in, any portion of Plan assets, including actuarial 
  surplus existing in the ongoing Plan pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the 
  Trust Agreements, the Pension Agreement and the Pensions Benefits Act, R.S.O. 
  1980, c. 373, as amended, or the Pensions Benefit Act, 1987, S.O. 1987, c. 35, 
  whichever is applicable;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: This question cannot be answered on a Rule 21 motion 
  and must proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) whether, assuming (without admitting) that a partial termination 
  of the Plan did occur upon the sale of the Northern Stores Division in 1987, 
  the plaintiffs have a current entitlement to a transfer of any portion of Plan 
  assets, including actuarial surplus existing in the ongoing Plan, pursuant to 
  the terms of the Plan, the Trust Agreements, the Pension Agreement and the Pensions 
  Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 373, as amended, or the Pensions Benefit Act, 
  1987, S.O. 1987, c. 35, whichever is applicable;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: This question cannot be answered on a Rule 21 motion 
  and must proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) whether statements made in the Booklets are capable in 
  law of giving rise to any legal or equitable right or interest of the plaintiffs 
  in any portion of Plan assets, including actuarial surplus existing in the ongoing 
  Plan, if no such right or interest otherwise exists pursuant to the terms of 
  the Plan, the Trust Agreements, the Pension Agreement and the Pensions Benefits 
  Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 373, as amended, or the Pensions Benefit Act, 1987, S.O. 
  1987, c. 35, whichever is applicable;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: This question cannot be answered on a Rule 21 motion 
  and must proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) Contribution Holiday</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) whether the terms of the Plan, on or before May 25, 1987, 
  authorized the Bay to take contribution holidays when the Plan contained an 
  actuarial surplus;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: The Plan neither provides nor prohibits contribution 
  holidays.</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) whether amendments made to the Plan relating to contribution 
  holidays, on or before May 25, 1987, were consistent with the power of amendment 
  provided for in the Plan;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: There is no need to answer this question.</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) whether statements made in the Booklets or any provision 
  of the Trust Agreements were capable in law of precluding the Bay from having 
  taken contribution holidays on or before May 25, 1987, which were otherwise 
  authorized by the Plan;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: This issue will have to go to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) Administrative Costs and Expenses</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) whether the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreements 
  in effect between July 1, 1982, and May 25, 1987, required the Bay to pay the 
  costs and expenses of administering the plan and the trusts;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: Yes</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) whether amendments to the Plan and the Trust Agreement 
  relating to the payment of the costs and expenses of administering the Plan 
  and the trusts that were in effect between July 1, 1982, and May 25, 1987, were 
  consistent with the powers of amendment provided for in the Plan and the Trust 
  Agreements;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: No</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) whether statements made in the Booklets were capable 
  in law of precluding such amendments to the Plan and the Trust Agreements;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: Yes</p>
<p class="indent"> (d ) Pension Source</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) whether the terms of the Plan obligate the Bay to pay at 
  least one half of the cost of pensions benefits to which Plan members may become 
  entitled pursuant to the terms of the Plan;</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: There is no express term in the Plan itself </p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) whether statements made in the Booklets are capable in 
  law of giving rise to an obligation that the Bay pay at least one half of the 
  cost of pension benefits to which Plan members may become entitled pursuant 
  to the terms of the Plan</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: The issue will have to go to trial</p>
<p>
  [3] This appeal concerns only the answers to question 2 (c) concerning administrative 
  costs and expenses.</p>
<p>
  [4] These questions must be considered in light of the fact that they concern 
  one relatively narrow aspect of a complex case that is proceeding to trial. 
  It is also important to understand the three questions in relation to each other. 
  It is common ground that the motions judge's affirmative answer to question 
  2 (c)(i) was determined by her negative answer to question 2 (c)(ii). She appears 
  not to have considered the effect of the impugned amendments relating to the 
  payment of the costs and expenses of administering the Plan and the trusts, 
  but rather based her affirmative answer to question 2 (c)(i) on her conclusion 
  under question 2 (c)(ii) that the amendments were not valid. Moreover, the plaintiffs 
  contend that, even if the booklets were not capable in law of precluding the 
  amendments, they still affect the proper interpretation of the amendment power 
  and the answer to question 2 (c)(ii).</p>
<p>
  [5] To determine the effect, if any, of the booklets, they must be assessed 
  in light of the circumstances in which the statements were made; their effect, 
  if any, is bound up with the question of reliance. The trial judge reached this 
  conclusion in relation to questions 2 (a)(iii), 2 (b)(iii) and 2(d)(ii) and 
  held that these matters must be dealt with at trial. In our view, she should 
  have disposed of question 2 (c)(iii) in the same manner. She should have refused 
  to answer the question and directed that that the issue proceed to trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] Indeed, it appeared from the oral submissions addressed to this court that, 
  far from settling an issue that would allow the litigation to proceed to trial 
  in a more efficient manner, the affirmative answer to question 2 (c)(iii) may 
  have obfuscated the issues for trial. Does the affirmative answer mean that 
  the legal point has been decided in the plaintiffs' favour and the only issue 
  remaining is that of actual reliance on the booklets? Or, does it mean simply 
  that the motions judge was not prepared to foreclose all legal argument on the 
  issue of whether the booklets were capable in law of precluding amendments to 
  the Plan and Trust Agreements? Issues raised by questions such as question 2 
  (c)(iii) cannot be effectively or efficiently disposed of in a piecemeal fashion. 
  As the motions judge held in relation to the other &quot;booklet&quot; issues, 
  the entire question, both factual and legal, should be dealt with at trial on 
  the basis of a full factual record. </p>
<p>
  [7] The remaining questions, 2 (c)(i) and 2 (c)(ii) must be considered in relation 
  to each other and in relation to question 2 (c)(iii). As already noted, the 
  motions judge appears to have collapsed question 2 (c)(i) into question 2 (c)(ii) 
  regarding the validity of the amendments. The real issue is whether or not the 
  amendments were properly made.</p>
<p>
  [8] Taken in isolation, question 2 (c)(ii) appears to present a discrete legal 
  issue that could properly be answered on a Rule 21 motion. The difficulty is 
  that question 2 (c)(ii) does not stand in isolation, but rather forms a part 
  of a much larger package of questions - including question 2 (c)(iii) - that 
  must be sent on to trial. The plaintiffs ask us to take into account the wording 
  of the booklets in considering question 2 (c)(ii). If we were to find that the 
  motions judge erred in her answer to question 2 (c)(ii), the validity of the 
  amendments would still be alive as the plaintiffs would still be left with their 
  argument that the amendments are &quot;precluded&quot; by statements in the 
  booklets.</p>
<p>
  [9] In our view, the three questions at issue on this appeal are so inextricably 
  linked that they cannot be broken into parts, some of which may be properly 
  answered on a Rule 21 motion. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the answers 
  to questions 2 (c)(i), 2 (c)(ii) and 2 (c)(iii) are set aside and all three 
  issues will be sent to trial. </p>
<p>
  [10] The motions judge awarded both parties costs of the motion from the Bay 
  Pension Fund on a substantial indemnity basis. That order has not been challenged 
  and we would not disturb it. However, we do not consider it appropriate to accede 
  to the request of both parties that the costs of the appeal be paid out of the 
  Fund on a partial indemnity basis. The only issue on this appeal was the Bay's 
  liability for certain administrative costs and expenses. It cannot be said that 
  the Bay should recover its costs on the basis that it was merely defending the 
  interests of the Fund. The respondents unsuccessfully argued that we should 
  uphold the order in their favour. In these circumstances, the parties should 
  bear their own costs of the appeal, and accordingly, we make no order as to 
  costs. </p>
