<p>Motion to quash an appeal from the judgment of Justice Harriet E. Sachs of 
  the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated November 26, 2001.</p>
<p>BORINS J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This is a motion by the respondent Canadian Professional Engravers Association 
  Inc. (&quot;CPEA&quot;) to quash the plaintiffs' appeal on the ground that it 
  was not commenced within the time stipulated by rule 61.04(1) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure. The other respondents, Pentex Print Master Industries Inc. 
  (&quot;Pentex&quot;) and Dosey George Black (&quot;Black&quot;), join in the 
  motion, and in addition, seek an order permitting them to proceed with their 
  cross-appeal from the trial judge's costs disposition.<br>
</p>
<p>Background<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Ms. Byers' claim for damages caused by the alleged negligence of the respondents 
  was dismissed by a jury on November 26, 2001. The jury assessed the damages 
  of Ms. Byers, as well as the damages of her family members under the Family 
  Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, in the amount of $1,607,199.21. In her endorsement, 
  the trial judge dismissed the appellants' action in accordance with the verdict 
  of the jury. The trial judge heard submissions with respect to costs on January 
  24, 2002 and March 8, 2002. On April 10, 2002, she released her reasons for 
  judgment on costs, now reported as Byers (Litigation Guardian) v. Pentex Print 
  Master Industries Inc. (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 409. She made no order for the payment 
  of costs.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Following the jury's verdict, the trial judge adjourned to January 22, 
  2002, CPEA's claim for contribution and indemnity against Ms. Byers' mother, 
  Gail Byers, and her mother's company. Given the finding of no liability, this 
  claim was dismissed as moot on January 4, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] On April 23, 2002 the appellants served a notice of appeal on the respondents 
  asking that the jury's decision on liability be set aside. On May 1, 2002, the 
  respondents Pentex and Black served a notice of cross-appeal seeking leave to 
  appeal from the trial judge's disposition of costs, in which they allege that 
  the trial judge erred in not awarding them their costs of the trial in which 
  they had prevailed. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] To date, the parties have not taken out a formal judgment. This is because 
  they cannot agree on its date and content. Counsel for the respondent CPEA drafted 
  a judgment dated January 22, 2002, which in its recital refers to the action 
  having been heard on certain dates in November, 2001, and in its operative part, 
  orders the dismissal of the action, counterclaim and crossclaim, with the issue 
  of costs being adjourned to March 8, 2002. The appellants' draft judgment is 
  dated April 10, 2002. Its recital refers to the action having been heard with 
  a jury on certain dates in November, 2001, with further attendances by counsel 
  on January 22, 2002, and March 8, 2002 to make submissions with respect to costs; 
  its operative part orders the dismissal of the action without costs. This disagreement 
  concerning the date and the content of the operative part of the formal judgment 
  reflects the positions taken by the parties on this motion. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] It is to be observed that counsel for CPEA raised the issue of an appeal 
  in correspondence to the appellants' counsel. On December 21, 2001, CPEA's counsel, 
  Mr. Zuber, proposed that the claim and the counterclaim be dismissed on the 
  understanding &quot;that no costs will be enforced&quot; and that the appellants 
  undertake not to appeal. When he received no response to his letter, Mr. Zuber 
  wrote again on January 3, 2002: &quot;However, given that more than 30 days 
  has elapsed from November 29, 2001, [sic] the time in which to commence an appeal, 
  has passed obviously your client is not appealing the verdict.&quot; Once again, 
  the appellants' counsel did not respond, resulting in Mr. Zuber writing to him 
  on January 15, 2002, noting that &quot;the 30 days for appeal has passed&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] On January 18, 2002, appellants' counsel wrote to Mr. Zuber: &quot;Further 
  to our recent telephone conversation, I confirm my advice to you that there 
  can be no doubt in my mind in terms of procedure that the 30 day period to serve 
  Notice of Appeal cannot run until Judgment is finalized and dated.&quot; Finally, 
  on April 23, 2002, which was after the trial judge had released her costs judgment, 
  the appellants' counsel wrote to Mr. Zuber to inform him that he had received 
  instructions to appeal the jury verdict on liability, and enclosed a notice 
  of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] The main issue presented by the respondents' motion to quash the appeal 
  is whether the thirty day period in which the appellants are required to serve 
  their notice of appeal from the dismissal of their action, as provided in rule 
  61.04(1), commenced on November 26, 2001, when the jury dismissed the appellants' 
  claim, or on April 10, 2002, when the trial judge delivered her costs judgment. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[9] This issue takes on added significance in light of O. Reg. 284/01 that 
  came into effect on January 1, 2002, and amended the costs provisions of the 
  Rules of Civil Procedure. Rules 57.01 and 57.03 now require the court to fix 
  costs in accordance with a costs grid established by Part I of Tariff A, save 
  in &quot;exceptional&quot; cases when costs may be referred for assessment under 
  Rule 58. After a trial, a motion that disposes of a proceeding or an application 
  is completed, a party who is awarded costs must serve a bill of costs on the 
  other parties and file it. On the basis of the bill of costs, the court will 
  then fix the amount of costs in accordance with the costs grid.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Where the court is able to give its decision at the conclusion of the 
  hearing, it is usually able to fix costs at that time. The result is that it 
  is able to decide the merits of the proceeding and award and fix costs at the 
  same hearing. In other situations, particularly where the court has reserved 
  its decision, or in circumstances like those that occurred in this case, a re-attendance 
  by counsel or written submissions will be required for the court to decide the 
  entitlement to costs, if any, as well as the scale and the amount of costs. 
  When this occurs, of necessity there will be an interval, sometimes lengthy, 
  between the court's decision on the merits and its decision on costs. Similarly, 
  after this court releases a reserved judgment, there is usually a lengthy interval 
  before it is able to consider counsels' submissions on costs and to release 
  its costs judgment. Unfortunately, the interval between the court's merits judgment 
  and its costs judgment is one of the consequences of the amendments of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure that require the court to fix the costs of proceedings on 
  the basis of a costs grid and has resulted in some confusion as to when the 
  time begins to run for serving a notice of appeal from the merits judgment.<br>

</p>
<p>Analysis<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The appropriate starting point is an analysis of the relevant provisions 
  of the Courts of Justice Act (&quot;CJA&quot;) and the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  that apply to appeals to the Court of Appeal from a judgment of a judge of the 
  Superior Court of Justice on the merits of a proceeding (&quot;merits judgment&quot;) 
  and a judgment on the costs of a proceeding (&quot;costs judgment&quot;). I 
  use &quot;proceeding&quot; as a compendious term that includes trial, application, 
  a motion in which a final order has been made and an order of the Divisional 
  Court. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] As I will explain, when read together ss. 6(1)(a) and (b), 131(1) and 
  133(b) of the CJA and rules 61.03.1(1), (16), (17) and (18) and rule 61.04(1), 
  give rise to separate and discrete rights of appeal from a merits judgment and 
  a costs judgment. However, these substantive rights will attract different procedural 
  considerations, depending on the circumstances of particular proceedings. This 
  can best be illustrated by reference to the two most common situations: (1) 
  where the merits judgment and the costs judgment are part of the same proceeding, 
  as when at the conclusion of a proceeding in which the judge determines the 
  entitlement to costs, the scale of costs and the amount of costs after giving 
  a decision on the merits; (2) where judgment has been reserved and the judge 
  renders a costs judgment on the basis of written and/or oral submissions more 
  than thirty days after the release of the merits judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] In considering the first situation, s. 6(1)(b) of the CJA provides for 
  an appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal on the merits in the circumstances 
  described in that subsection, while s. 133(b) provides for an appeal as to costs, 
  with leave of the Court of Appeal. Where the merits judgment and the costs judgment 
  are rendered at the conclusion of the proceeding and an appeal as of right has 
  been commenced, under rule 61.03.1(17) the request for leave to appeal costs 
  must be included in the notice of appeal as part of the relief sought, leave 
  to appeal shall be sought from the panel hearing the appeal and, where leave 
  is granted, the panel may then hear both the merits appeal and the costs appeal. 
  This procedure is explained in Murano v. Bank of Montreal (1998), 163 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 21 at 43-44 (Ont. C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[14] In considering the second situation, where a costs judgment is rendered 
  more than thirty days after the rendering or release of the merits judgment 
  and a notice of appeal from the merits judgment has been served and the appellant 
  intends to appeal from the costs judgment, the procedure described in the previous 
  paragraph is inapplicable, and a different procedure applies. Given that the 
  right to appeal the costs judgment to the Court of Appeal with the leave of 
  that court is given by s. 133(b) of the CJA, under rule 61.03.1(1) the appellant 
  is required to move in writing for leave to appeal. Where leave is granted, 
  the notice of appeal must be delivered within seven days after the granting 
  of leave: rule 61.03.1(16). The result is that the appellant then has two appeals 
  - one from the merits judgment and the other form the costs judgment. This, 
  in my view, produces an unsatisfactory situation and could involve expense to 
  litigants and duplication in effort on the part of this court.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] Because many costs judgment will not be rendered until more than thirty 
  days after the rendering of the merits judgment, in my view there is a better 
  procedure available to the appellant under rule 61.08(1) that will enable the 
  appellant to avoid this cumbersome procedure. Rule 61.08(1) permits an appellant 
  to amend a notice of appeal without leave before an appeal is perfected. Where 
  an appellant intends to appeal from the costs judgment in addition to the merits 
  judgment, the notice of appeal should be amended to join the costs appeal with 
  the merits appeal, thus enabling the procedure set out in rule 61.03.1(17) to 
  apply. This would permit the panel of this court hearing the merits appeal to 
  determine the request for leave to appeal from the costs judgment, and, if leave 
  is granted, to hear that appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] On the basis of this analysis, the CJA and the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  clearly contemplate that a costs judgment, when the subject of a separate or 
  collateral proceeding as in this case, is a separate determination rather than 
  a part of the main merits proceeding. As such, it is a separate appealable judgment 
  governed by its own procedure. Similarly, a merits judgment, whether rendered 
  by a judge or granted by a judge in accordance with a jury's verdict, is a separate 
  appealable judgment, even though the costs consequences of the case remain to 
  be decided by the trial judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] As I will explain, this analysis finds support in the case law, which 
  underscores that litigants are best served by a rule which accords with the 
  traditional understanding that a decision on the merits is final for the purpose 
  of appeal when it is rendered, notwithstanding the pendency of the determination 
  of the costs attributable to the case. It follows that the plaintiffs' notice 
  of appeal from the merits judgment was not served within thirty days of the 
  jury's verdict as required by rule 61.04(1). Subsequently, I will consider whether 
  leave should be granted to extend the time for service of the notice of appeal 
  to the date of its service.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Before leaving this discussion, I should indicate that there appears to 
  be an anomaly where the court determines the entitlement and scale of costs, 
  but orders that costs be assessed. In this situation, there are two avenues 
  of appeal. An appeal from the entitlement and scale of costs is governed by 
  s. 133(b) of the CJA and lies to the Court of Appeal. However, under s. 17(b) 
  of the CJA an appeal from a certificate of assessment of costs lies to the Superior 
  Court of Justice.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] As I have noted, rule 61.04(1) requires that an appeal to this court shall 
  be commenced &quot;within thirty days after the date of the order appealed from&quot;. 
  Pursuant to rule 1.03, an &quot;order&quot; includes a judgment and &quot; 'judgment' 
  means a decision that finally disposes of an . . . action on its merits&quot;. 
  In this case, it was the verdict of the jury on November 26, 2001, dismissing 
  the appellants' claims that finally disposed of this action. It follows, for 
  the purpose of rule 61.04(1), that the date of the order appealed from by the 
  appellants is November 26, 2001. Therefore, their notice of appeal should have 
  been served within thirty days from November 26, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Counsel for the appellants takes the position that the release of the 
  trial judge's costs decision on April 10, 2002, in effect, extended the time 
  for serving the appellants' notice of appeal from the merits judgment to thirty 
  days following that date. The decision of this court in Re Permanent Investment 
  Corporation Ltd. and Township of Ops and Graham, [1967] 2 O.R. 13 (C.A.) is 
  cited as authority for this position. As I will explain, I do not agree with 
  this submission.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] In Re Permanent Investment an appeal was taken from an order of Brooke 
  J. pronounced on September 1, 1966, and varied by him on November 29, 1966, 
  dismissing an application for an order of mandamus to compel the township to 
  issue certain building permits. The variation made by Brooke J. was the result 
  of a disagreement between the parties about whether the formal order of the 
  court should provide that the dismissal of the application was &quot;without 
  prejudice to any further or other application&quot;. On November 29, 1966, Brooke 
  J. held that these words should be deleted from the formal order on the ground 
  that they were not in conformity with the order that he had pronounced on September 
  1, 1966. The respondents contended that as the appellants' notice of appeal 
  was not delivered until December 6, 1966, it was out of time because it should 
  have been delivered within fifteen days of the date on which the order had been 
  pronounced, as required by the Rules of Practice as they read at that time.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] This court disagreed for the reasons given by Schroeder J.A. at p. 24-25:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, it was contended by counsel for the respondents 
  that the appeal from the order pronounced on September 1, 1966, notice of which 
  was not served until December 6, 1966, was out of time. While under the Rules 
  the time for appealing generally runs from the date of pronouncement of the 
  judgment or order, where any substantial matter remains to be determined on 
  the settlement of a judgment or order the time for appealing will run form the 
  date of entry thereof: O'Sullivan v. Harty (1885), 11 S.C.R. 322; Wallace et 
  al v. Bath (1904), 7 O.L.R. 542, and County of Elgin v. Robert (1905), 36 S.C.R. 
  27 at p. 32. It was contended that on December 6th more than 15 days had expired 
  from the date of entry of the order pronounced on September 1, 1966, and that 
  even if that standard were to be applied the appeal was still out of time. I 
  take the view that the respondents having moved to vary the order as entered, 
  the time for appealing did not commence to run until November 29, 1966, when 
  Brooke, J., made an order directing that the words &quot;without prejudice to 
  any further or other application&quot; be deleted from the formal order dated 
  September 1, 1966. It was only then that there was a final determination of 
  the issue upon which the respondents, despite the earlier consent given by their 
  solicitor, sought an adjudication. It follows that the appeal from the first 
  order is in time and that it is competent to this Court to entertain [emphasis 
  added].<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The appellants contend that as the costs of the trial remained to be determined 
  on the date of the jury's verdict, costs constituted a &quot;substantial matter 
  [remaining] to be determined&quot;, with the result that the time for serving 
  their notice of appeal did not begin to run until the pronouncement of the costs 
  judgment on April 10, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] O'Sullivan v. Harty<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, one of the authorities 
  on which Schroeder J.A. relied, was one of a number of cases decided by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in the late 19th century and the early 20th century 
  in which the Supreme Court considered the event from which the time to serve 
  a notice of appeal was to be calculated. At that time, the relevant legislation 
  provided for the service of a notice of appeal &quot;within thirty days from 
  the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from&quot;: Supreme 
  and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 135, s. 40.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] There is a similarity in the facts of this case and those of O'Sullivan 
  where judgment was pronounced in the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 30, 1884, 
  but was not entered until November 14, 1884. The entry of the judgment was delayed 
  as it became necessary for the parties to return to the Court of Appeal for 
  the purpose of determining which party was to pay the costs of the appeal. The 
  issue before the Supreme Court was whether the time for serving the notice of 
  appeal began to run on June 30, 1884 or November 14, 1884. Sir W.J. Ritchie 
  C.J. resolved the issue as follows as p. 432:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The decision was pronounced in June, but the minutes 
  were not settled and entered until some time in the autumn. The question is 
  whether the time runs from the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, or from 
  the entry of the certificate. I understand the practice in Quebec to be that 
  the judgment is always entered as of the date on which it was pronounced, and 
  therefore no question can arise as to appeals coming from the Province of Quebec; 
  and also in Ontario where there is simply a judgment declaring that the appeal 
  is dismissed or allowed as the case may be, and there is nothing more to be 
  done; but when the decision requires something more to be done at the settlement 
  of the minutes, as in this case whether the plaintiff should be held personally 
  liable for the costs, then I think that until the settlement of the minutes 
  and entry of the certificate a party should not be compelled to take his appeal. 
  I am therefore inclined to think the time ought to run in this case from the 
  date of the entry of the certificate, which was entered on the 14th of November 
  last [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[26] O'Sullivan was explained by the Supreme Court in Walmsley v. Griffith 
  (1886), 13 S.C.R. 434. In Walmsley the issue was whether the time for appealing 
  ran from the date of the pronouncing of the judgment of the Ontario Court of 
  Appeal, October 15, 1884, or from December 16, 1884, when the judgment was entered. 
  Unlike O'Sullivan, nothing remained for the Court of Appeal to do from the time 
  the judgment was pronounced until it was entered. The Court of Appeal, relying 
  on O'Sullivan, concluded that the time to appeal did not begin to run until 
  the judgment was entered. At p. 438, Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J. explained O'Sullivan 
  as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">What we decided in that case was:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">That where any substantial matter remains to be determined 
  before the judgment can be entered the time for appealing runs from the entry 
  of the judgment. Where nothing remains to be settled, as for instance in the 
  case of the simple dismissal of a bill, or where no judgment requires to be 
  entered, the time for appealing runs from the pronouncing of the judgment. The 
  Court of Appeal, however, appears to have been under the impression that this 
  court had laid down a cast-iron rule that the time should run in every case 
  from the entry of the judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>Consequently, in Walmsley the time for appeal began when the judgment was pronounced.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] In Martley v. Carson (1886), 13 S.C.R. 439 the issue was whether the time 
  for appealing commenced when the judgment was pronounced or when it was varied 
  by the court by striking out certain declarations and also with respect to the 
  costs payable by one of the parties. Applying O'Sullivan, the Supreme Court 
  held that as there were substantial questions to be decided before the judgment 
  could be entered, the time for appealing ran from the date of the entry of the 
  judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] In Winnipeg (City) v. Wright (1887), 13 S.C.R. 441, in which the issue 
  was whether the Supreme Court ought to interfere with an order made in chambers 
  by Taschereau J. dismissing an appeal on the ground that it was brought out 
  of time, Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J. referred to three English cases which considered 
  the rights of parties arising from judgments pronounced in their favour. After 
  stating that the cases had a &quot;bearing&quot; on O'Sullivan and Walmsley, 
  he quoted at length from the reasons for judgment delivered in International 
  Financial Society v.. City of Moscow Gas Company (1877), 7 Ch. Div. 244, Craig 
  v. Phillips (1887), 7 Ch. Div. 250 and Ex parte Hinton, In re Hinton (1875), 
  L.R. 19 Eq. 266, where the court considered the circumstances in which it could 
  exercise its discretion to extend the time for commencing an appeal. The propositions 
  derived from these cases are:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) a judgment takes effect from the time when it is 
  actually pronounced;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a judgment on the merits is final and appealable 
  when it finally disposes of the proceeding, there is nothing to be done and 
  the litigation is at an end; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) it is at that time that the unsuccessful party is 
  able to see from what he or she is appealing, and the successful party knows 
  that if an appeal is not brought within the period permitted by the procedural 
  rules that he or she can rely upon the judgment or order in their favour.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] In Elgin (County) v. Robert (1905), 36 S.C.R. 27, at pp. 32-33 the Chief 
  Justice approved the following passages from the reasons of the Registrar refusing 
  to extend the time in which to commence an appeal:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In O'Sullivan v. Harty (13 Can. S.C.R. 431), and Martley 
  v. Carson (13 Can. S.C.R. 439) where the court held that the time ran from the 
  date of the entry of the judgment, we find that questions arose upon settlement 
  of the minutes by the Registrar which were brought before the court appealed 
  from for determination, and this, it seems to me, was the factor which, in the 
  view of the Supreme Court, determined in these cases the date from which the 
  time should begin to run.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, according to the jurisprudence of the 
  Supreme Court, the date from which time begins to run in appeals under sec. 
  40 of the Act is always the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, unless 
  an application is made to the court appealed from to review some decision made 
  by the Registrar on the settlement of the minutes, or some substantial question 
  affecting the rights of the parties has not been clearly disposed of by the 
  judgment as pronounced, and the determination of this has delayed the settlement 
  of the minutes [emphasis added].
</p>
<p>[30] Elgin was referred to by Schroeder J.A. in Re Permanent Investment, as 
  was the decision of Osler J.A. in Wallace v. Bath (1904), 7 O.L.R. 542 (High 
  Ct.). In Wallace, as in O'Sullivan, the issue was whether the time to appeal 
  commenced from the date when the Master released his reasons for judgment in 
  a mechanic's lien action, or from the later time when costs of the action were 
  decided on the entry of the judgment. Osler J.A. resolved the issue in this 
  way at p. 543:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am of opinion that the month within which, by Rule 
  799, notice of appeal is to be given, ran in this case, under the circumstances, 
  from the signing of the judgment on the 12th March, and not the 24th February, 
  the day on which the Master signed his findings and decision, or the 26th February 
  when the parties received the copy thereof. The findings and decision do not 
  represent the judgment as signed and entered, as it is by the latter alone that 
  any order or judgment has been pronounced or awarded as to the costs. The case 
  stood as if the question of costs had been reserved, and the judgment was incomplete 
  until they had been awarded. The date of signing the judgment is, therefore, 
  the only date which can be looked to. O'Sullivan v. Harty (1885), 13 S.C.R. 
  431, and Walmsley v. Griffith (1886), ib. 434, may be cited for the principle[emphasis 
  added].<br>
</p>
<p>[31] Given that no formal judgment has been signed or entered in this case 
  in respect to either the merits judgment or the costs judgment, reference should 
  be made to two early Ontario decisions, Hickey v. Stover (1885), 11 P.R. 88 
  (Ont. Div. Ct.) and Fawkes v. Swayzie (1899), 31 O.R. 256 (Div. Ct.). These 
  cases stand for the proposition that the time for appealing runs from the date 
  that a judgment is pronounced and not from the date that it is signed and entered. 
  This proposition is based on the settled principle that the binding effect of 
  a judgment or order commences on the date of its pronouncement. This principle 
  has been given effect by rule 59.01 which provides that an order (which includes 
  a judgment) is effective from the date on which it is made, unless it provides 
  otherwise, and by rule 59.03(3)(b) which requires that every formal order shall 
  contain the date on which it was made. The formal judgment must be signed and 
  entered, however, before the appellant's appeal can be perfected.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] A relatively early decision of this court which anticipated the holding 
  in Re Permanent Investment, but was not referred to by Schroeder J.A. in that 
  case, is Hyman v. Kinkel, [1938] O.W.N. 135 (C.A.). In that case the issue was 
  whether the time to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada commenced on the date 
  that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was pronounced, or from the date on 
  which the court clarified certain aspects of its judgment that were uncertain 
  and upon which the court had not adjudicated. In resolving the issue, Middleton 
  J.A. held at pp. 135-136:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It was determined by the Supreme Court in three cases 
  reported in 13 Supreme Court Reports, O'Sullivan v. Harty (1883), 13 S.C.R. 
  431; Walmsley v. Griffith, ib. 434; Martley v. Carson, ib. 439, that where a 
  judgment was uncertain and required something to be done on the settlement of 
  the minutes, time did not start to run until after the Court had finally settled 
  the judgment. In such a case the time runs from the entry of the judgment and 
  not from the date of its original pronouncement.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Here the Court did not determine either of the two matters 
  concerning which the minutes were spoken to until the 10th of November, and 
  the judgment was finally settled and issued on the 9th of December. Time commenced 
  to run for the purpose of an appeal on that date.
</p>
<p>[33] A similar conclusion was reached by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Re 
  Ferguson, Ferguson v. Ferguson and National Trust Co., [1944] 4 D.L.R. 28 (Man. 
  C.A.). After reviewing the Supreme Court decisions, as well as Hyman, McPherson 
  C.J.M. reached this conclusion at p. 31:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In view of the above decisions, I am of the opinion 
  that the time begins to run under the section from the date judgment is pronounced, 
  unless it can be shown that further application to the Court has to be made 
  on the settlement of the minutes on some substantial question affecting the 
  rights of the parties which had not been clearly disposed of in the judgment. 
  No such difficulty arose in this case, and I would hold that the time within 
  which an appeal could be brought had expired[emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[34] The decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Texaco Canada 
  Ltd. v. Corporation of Oak Bay (1970), 72 W.W.R. 557 (B.C.C.A.) is helpful because 
  its circumstances were similar to those in this appeal. Following the judgment 
  of Wilson C.J.S.C. refusing a motion for a writ of mandamus, a supplementary 
  motion was made asking that he adjudicate the costs of the original motion. 
  The issue was whether the time for appealing the merits judgment commenced from 
  the date of its pronouncement or from the date on which the costs judgment was 
  delivered. In holding that the costs judgment did not have the effect of extending 
  the time for appealing the merits judgment, Nemetz J.A. stated at p. 559:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The only question that troubled me at an earlier stage 
  was whether the supplementary motion made to the learned chief justice in regard 
  to costs would vary the requirement set out in the time provision. Having examined 
  Frumento v. Shortt, Hill &amp; Duncan Ltd. (1916), 22 B.C.R. 427 (especially 
  what was said by Macdonald, C.J.A. at p. 430) I now have no doubt on this matter 
  at all. In dealing with the question of a supplementary matter that arose in 
  that case, Martin J.A. (at p. 431) said this: &quot; * * * it is impossible 
  to support the contention that the implementing order regarding costs had any 
  effect on the finality of a judgment.&quot; In this case, it seems to me that 
  the question of costs had no effect on the finality of the judgment, which was, 
  of course, the refusal of the motion for the mandamus.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] In Frumento, to which reference was made by Nemetz J.A., in rejecting 
  the contention that a costs order extended the time for appealing from the merits 
  judgment, Martin J.A. stated at p. 431:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that the final judgment was submitted to 
  the counsel on the other side on the 4th and 9th, I think, and nothing was done 
  for over a month. That disposes of the whole matter, in view of the fact that 
  it is impossible to support the contention that the implementing order regarding 
  costs had any effect on the finality of the judgment; it was something that 
  had really no bearing on that aspect of the case.
</p>
<p>[36] It is necessary to recognize that the conclusion in Texaco Canada Ltd. 
  that the subsequent decision on costs did not extend the time for appealing 
  from the merits judgment to when the costs judgment was rendered is at odds 
  with the result of the early cases of O'Sullivan v. Harty and Wallace v. Bath 
  in which the opposite conclusion was reached. In each case the view of the court 
  was that the judgment was incomplete until costs had been awarded, with the 
  result that the time to appeal did not begin to run until that time. Subsequent 
  cases have reached the same result as Texaco Canada Ltd. As I will explain, 
  this is the correct result where the court determines cost issues by way of 
  a discrete proceeding subsequent to rendering its decision on the merits of 
  the original proceeding.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] A similar issue was considered by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Blundon 
  v. Storm (1970), 10 D.L.R. (3d) 576 (N.S.C.A.) where the appellants unsuccessfully 
  contended that the time for appealing the merits judgment did not commence until 
  the court appealed from had settled the outstanding question of the distribution 
  of costs. In the view of Coffin J.A., the resolution of a question concerning 
  costs did not constitute a substantial question affecting the rights of the 
  parties that would extend the time for appealing from a judgment on the merits.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] Finally, I will refer to several recent Ontario trial court decisions 
  that considered whether a costs award constitutes a &quot;substantial matter 
  [remaining] to be determined&quot; within the contemplation of Re Permanent 
  Investment and, thus, extends the time from which to appeal a merits judgment 
  to the date of the costs judgment. Although these decisions are merely conclusory, 
  they are uniform in holding that a costs judgment does not have that effect. 
  See: Atkinson v. Ault Foods Ltd., [1997] O.J. No. 5222 (Gen. Div.); Hilltop 
  Group Ltd. v. Katana (1998), 117 O.A.C. 384 (Div. Ct.); Lancer Partners v. Handleman 
  Co. of Canada, [1999] O.J. No. 4033 (Sup. Ct.); Baksh v. Sun Media (Toronto) 
  Corp., [2002] O.J. No. 2272 (Sup. Ct.).<br>
</p>
<p>[39] It is instructive to note that the Supreme Court of the United States 
  has considered this issue, albeit in the context of attorney's fees which, for 
  the purposes of my analysis, may be considered as the equivalent of costs in 
  Ontario. The Supreme Court has determined that a decision on the merits is final 
  and appealable prior to when the court that rendered the decision makes a determination 
  on the payment of attorney's fees.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] In White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U.S. 445 (1982), 
  the Supreme Court held that an attorney's fees award is independently appealable 
  as it is not inherent in, or necessarily assumed by, the decision on the merits. 
  In Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., 486 U.S. 196 (1988), the Supreme 
  Court considered White and other cases in the following analysis from the opinion 
  of Justice Scalia at pp. 199-201:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The question before us, therefore, is whether a decision 
  on the merits is a &quot;final decision&quot; as a matter of federal law under 
  &sect; 1291 when the recoverability or amount of attorney's fees for the litigation 
  remains to be determined. &quot;A 'final decision' generally is one which ends 
  the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute 
  the judgment.&quot; Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 299, 233 (1945). A question 
  remaining to be decided after an order ending litigation on the merits does 
  not prevent finality if its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise 
  decisions embodied in the order. See, e.g., Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 
  370 U.S. 294, 308-309 (1962); Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 
  507, 513-516 (1950). We have all but held that an attorney's fees determination 
  fits this description. In White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 
  455 U.S. 445 (1982), we held that a request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 
  &sect; 1988 is not a motion &quot;to alter or amend the judgment&quot; within 
  the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) because it does not seek 
  &quot;reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.&quot; 
  455 U.S., at 451. This holding was based on our conclusion that &quot;a request 
  for attorney's fees under &sect; 1988 raises legal issues collateral to&quot; 
  and &quot;separate from&quot; the decision on the merits. Id., at 451-452. We 
  went so far as to observe in dicta that &quot;[t]he collateral character of 
  the fee issue establishes that an outstanding fee question does not bar recognition 
  of a merits judgment as 'final' and 'appealable.'&quot; Id., at 452-453, n. 
  14. See also Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 170 (1939) (observing 
  that a petition for attorney's fees in equity is &quot;an independent proceeding 
  supplemental to the original proceeding and not a request for a modification 
  of the original decree&quot;).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The foregoing discussion is ultimately question-begging, 
  however, since it assumes that the order to which the fee issue was collateral 
  was an order ending litigation on the merits. If one were to regard the demand 
  for attorney's fees as itself part of the merits, the analysis would not apply. 
  The merits would then not have been concluded, and &sect; 1291 finality would 
  not exist. See Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 740-742 
  (1976). As a general matter, at least, we think it indisputable that a claim 
  for attorney's fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees 
  pertain. Such an award does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action, 
  and indeed is often available to the party defending against the action. At 
  common law, attorney's fees were regarded as an element of &quot;costs&quot; 
  awarded to the prevailing party, see 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, 
  Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil &sect; 2665 (1983), which are not generally 
  treated as part of the merits judgment, cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 58 (&quot;Entry 
  of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs&quot;). Many federal 
  statutes providing for attorney's fees continue to specify that they are to 
  be taxed and collected as &quot;costs,&quot; see Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 
  43-48 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (citing 63 such statutes) - as does, 
  in fact, the Colorado statute at issue here.
</p>
<p>Conclusion<br>
</p>
<p>[41] I find the reasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States, together 
  with the authorities that I have reviewed, helpful in formulating my response 
  to the appellants' contention that in the circumstances of this case Re Permanent 
  Investment extended the commencement of time for appealing from the dismissal 
  of their claim until the date the trial judge pronounced her judgment on costs. 
  In Re Permanent Investment, this court held that &quot;where any substantial 
  matter remains to be determined on the settlement of a judgment or order the 
  time for appealing will run from the date of entry thereof&quot;. Earlier cases, 
  such as Elgin (County) v. Roberts in 1905 and Re Ferguson in 1944, stated this 
  proposition somewhat differently, in terms of a &quot;further application to 
  the Court . . . on some substantial question affecting the rights of the parties 
  which had not been clearly disposed of in the judgment&quot;. Thus, in my view, 
  the substantial matter that remains to be determined is one that affects the 
  rights of the parties. What these cases, and others, recognize is that the court 
  possesses the power to alter, modify or amend its judgment, or to rectify its 
  own mistake, following the release of its decision and before it has been signed 
  as the formal judgment of court and entered. In other words, the court may reconsider 
  matters properly encompassed in its decision on the merits before it is entered. 
  When the court does so, and alters or modifies its merits judgment, the time 
  for service of the notice of appeal from that judgment commences when that judgment 
  has been altered or modified and entered.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] By contrast, a request for costs, including the scale and the amount of 
  costs, raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action. Generally, 
  costs are awarded to the successful party and provide that party with partial 
  or substantial indemnity for the expenses of the litigation, to be paid by the 
  unsuccessful party. In my view, costs cannot fairly be characterized as an element 
  of the relief sought in the main proceeding. Unlike other judicial relief, costs 
  are not compensation for the injury (in the broad sense of that word) giving 
  rise to a proceeding in which damages or other monetary relief, is claimed. 
  In many proceedings no monetary relief is claimed. Thus, an award of costs is 
  uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial, or by way 
  of application, or from the decision of an appellate court.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] It follows that a request for costs is unlike a motion to alter, modify 
  or amend a judgment within the contemplation of Re Permanent Investment. A request 
  for costs does not imply a change in the judgment, but merely seeks what is 
  due because of the judgment. A decision on costs requires an inquiry separate 
  from the decision on the merits, an inquiry that cannot commence until one party 
  has prevailed on the merits. This is most obvious in a case such as this where 
  the decision on the merits follows the verdict of a jury. Thus, an unresolved 
  issue of the costs of a proceeding at the time the proceeding is decided on 
  its merits does not prevent the judgment on the merits from taking effect and 
  becoming final and appealable from the date that it is rendered. Under rule 
  61.04(1), a notice of appeal must be served within thirty days from that date. 
  The subsequent resolution of costs does not extend the time for appealing the 
  decision on merits to when the court has pronounced its costs judgment, from 
  which a separate appeal lies under s. 133(b) of the CJA. It follows that the 
  appellants' notice of appeal was served out of time.<br>
</p>
<p>[44] What emerges from the foregoing analysis is that it is the procedure by 
  which a costs determination is made that will determine whether the costs award 
  is a separately appealable judgment, or whether it is appealable as an element 
  of an appeal on the merits. In a proceeding where costs are determined by the 
  court at the conclusion of the hearing, and where an appeal is taken from the 
  merits judgment and leave to appeal costs is sought, as discussed in Murano 
  v. Bank of Montreal and provided for by rule 61.03.1(17), the request for leave 
  to appeal must be included in the notice of appeal as part of the relief sought. 
  Where costs are awarded in a proceeding subsequent to the judgment on the merits, 
  this is a separately appealable judgment governed by s. 133(b) of the CJA. If 
  the party that has appealed the merits judgment also intends to appeal from 
  the costs judgment, as a practical matter, as I have described in paragraph 
  15, that party should amend its notice of appeal from the merits judgment to 
  add a motion for leave to appeal from the costs judgment to enable the panel 
  hearing the merits appeal to consider the costs appeal as well. Such a case-by-case 
  approach seems inevitable given the amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  that require the court to fix the costs of a proceeding.<br>
</p>
<p>Extension of time to serve the plaintiffs' notice of appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[45] In response to the motion to quash their appeal, the appellants neglected 
  to request that the court exercise its discretion pursuant to rule 3.02(1) to 
  extend the time for service of their notice of appeal in the event that we should 
  find that it was not served within the time stipulated by rule 61.04(1). While 
  the court was considering the merits of the motion to quash the appeal, it asked 
  counsel to present written submissions on this issue. Having reviewed the submissions 
  of the parties, it is my opinion that the time to serve the notice of appeal 
  should be extended to April 23, 2002, the date on which it was in fact served.<br>
</p>
<p>[46] On a number of occasions, this court has reviewed the factors that it 
  will consider in the exercise of its discretion under rule 3.02(1). Most recently, 
  relying on Frey v. MacDonald (1989), 33 C.P.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.), Simmons 
  J.A. referred to the following factors in Kefeli v. Centennial College of Applied 
  Arts and Technology, [2002] O.J. No. 3023 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 14:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In determining whether to extend the time for filing 
  a notice of appeal the court will generally consider whether the appellant formed 
  an intention to appeal within the relevant time period, the length of the delay, 
  any prejudice to the respondent, and the merits of the appeal. The general rule 
  that the appellant must have formed an intention to appeal within the relevant 
  time period and must provide a reasonable explanation for any subsequent delay 
  is subject to a broader principle that an extension should be granted if the 
  justice of the case requires it.<br>
</p>
<p>[47] In an earlier case, Bratti v. Wabco Standard Trane Inc. (c.o.b. Trane 
  Canada) (1994), 25 C.B.R. (3d) 1 at 3 (Ont. C.A.), Laskin J.A. expressed the 
  test somewhat more broadly:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">While appellate courts have considered a number of different 
  factors in determining whether to grant leave to extend the time for appealing, 
  the governing principle is simply whether the &quot;justice of the case&quot; 
  requires that an extension be given. See Frey v. MacDonald (1989), 33 C.P.C. 
  (2d) 13 (per Blair J.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>In my view, this analysis imports an overriding objective on a motion to extend 
  the time to appeal, as reflected in rule 1.04(1), to deal with cases justly 
  and if fairness demands, an extension of time should be granted. See also Duca 
  Community Credit Union Ltd. v. Giovannoli (2001), 4 C.P.C. (5th) 189 (Ont. C.A.) 
  per MacPherson J.A. at 192.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] Although I confess that it is a close call, I am persuaded that the appellants 
  have satisfied the first two factors referred to by Simmons J.A. As well, in 
  my view &quot;the justice of the case&quot; requires that an extension of the 
  time for service of the notice of appeal should be granted. Moreover, the respondents 
  have conceded that they have not been prejudiced by the appellants' delay in 
  serving their notice of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] As for the first two factors, I discern from the correspondence between 
  counsel for the appellants and CPEA that the appellants had always intended 
  to appeal from the jury's verdict dismissing their action. Their intention to 
  appeal is supported by their counsel's mistaken beliefs that the time to appeal 
  from the merits decision did not begin to run until the trial judge delivered 
  her costs decision and that a notice of appeal could not be served until the 
  formal judgment had been &quot;finalized and dated&quot;. As I have explained 
  in paragraph 5, counsel for the parties have been unable to agree on the form 
  and content of the formal judgment. Consistent with the appellants' intention 
  to appeal from the merits judgment and their counsel's belief that time to appeal 
  did not begin to run until after the release of the trial judge's costs judgment 
  is the service of their notice of appeal within two weeks of the release of 
  the costs judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] The failure to comply with rule 61.04(1) was certainly not intentional. 
  There is an explanation for the failure which, even if it cannot be characterized 
  as &quot;good&quot;, is not unreasonable and is one which ought to incline this 
  court in the relatively early days of the new costs regime to be generous, everything 
  else being equal.<br>
</p>
<p>[51] The &quot;justice of the case&quot; requires a consideration of the merits 
  of the appeal. It appears that this was a complex liability and catastrophic 
  damage action which required four weeks to be tried. The trial judge required 
  almost an entire day to instruct the jury. In their notice of appeal, the appellants 
  allege that the trial judge made a number of erroneous rulings in respect to 
  evidentiary issues and that she committed several reversible errors in instructing 
  the jury. Indeed, it is alleged that the trial judge further erred in permitting 
  the jury to commence deliberating before the appellants' counsel had completed 
  his objections to her instructions and in accepting the jury's verdict before 
  counsel had completed his objections. In the circumstances, I cannot say that 
  there is so little merit in the appeal that the appellants should be denied 
  their important right of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>Result<br>
</p>
<p>[52] Although the respondents are correct in submitting that the appellants 
  failed to serve their notice of appeal from the dismissal of their action within 
  the thirty days stipulated by rule 61.04(1), consequent to my decision to extend 
  the time to serve the notice of appeal to the date on which it was in fact served 
  I would dismiss the respondents' motion to quash the appeal. As counsel have 
  not had an opportunity to address the costs of this motion, if the parties are 
  unable to reach an agreement on costs the appellants are to file written submissions 
  within 14 days from the release of these reasons and the respondents are to 
  file their responding submissions within 10 days from their receipt of the appellants' 
  submissions.<br>
</p>
<p>[53] There is one final matter to address. In addition to seeking an order 
  quashing the appellants' appeal, the respondents Pentex and Black seek an order 
  permitting them &quot;to continue&quot; their cross-appeal, served on May 1, 
  2002, from the trial judge's costs judgment. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary 
  to make such an order. As I explained in paragraphs 12 - 15, the respondents' 
  costs cross-appeal is governed by s. 133(b) of the CJA and rule 61.03.1(1) and 
  (18).<br>
