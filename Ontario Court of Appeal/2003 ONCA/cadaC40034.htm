<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally October 6, 2003</p>
<p>[1] We agree that the appeal from the order relating to directions for the 
  sale of the matrimonial home and exclusive possession is moot. The matrimonial 
  home has now been sold and the proceeds of sale have been paid into court.</p>
<p>[2] On a practical level, there are no outstanding issues to be dealt with 
  on appeal as the issue of division of the proceeds of sale has not yet been 
  dealt with by the trial court and the issue of the application of the Divorce 
  Act to Mr. Cada was not raised at the time the order under appeal was made. 
  It remains open to Mr. Cada to raise the latter issue in the court below along 
  with the issue of legal representation. </p>
<p>[3] The remaining aspects of the order under appeal are interlocutory on their 
  face. Therefore an appeal lies to the Divisional Court and is subject to leave.</p>
<p>[4] In the circumstances, the appeal from the order dated April 22, 2003 is 
  quashed and there shall be no order as to costs.</p>
<p>&quot;R.R. McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;<br>
  &quot;S.T. Goudge J.A.&quot;<br>
