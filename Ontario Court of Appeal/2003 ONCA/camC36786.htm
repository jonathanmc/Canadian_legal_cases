<p>On appeal from the order of Justice D. Roger Timms of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated July 4, 2001, reported at [2001] O.J. No. 1859.</p>

<p> ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] This is an appeal from the judgment of Timms J. in a child custody case. 
  Following a nine and a half day trial, the trial judge ordered that the respondent 
  father have sole custody of the appellant and respondent's daughter, who is 
  now seven years old. The appellant does not now contest that part of the order. 
  She does, however, argue that the trial judge erred with respect to the access 
  provisions of the order. The impugned provisions are terms two and three of 
  the order: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. that as per the Order of The Honourable Madam Justice Benotto 
  dated March 8, 2001, the mother CAM's access to the child, BPM, born April 27, 
  1996, will remain supervised at the Supervised Access Facility until she, CAM, 
  has been given a clean bill of health by a properly qualified psychiatrist;</p>
<p class="indent">3. that the child, BPM, born April 27, 1996, shall continue 
  to see Dr. Russell, and that Dr. Russell will be involved in any decision to 
  grant unsupervised access to the [Applicant], CAM;</p>
<p> [2] The appellant submits that the order represents an improper delegation 
  of the court's power to determine access, and that the condition "until she, 
  CAM, has been given a clean bill of health by a properly qualified psychiatrist" 
  is, in any event, vague and unworkable and constitutes an unlawful fetter on 
  the appellant's ability to gain access to the courts.</p>
<p> [3] The appellant also appeals the costs award of $45,000 plus $4,405 for 
  disbursements. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle 
  in his application of Rules 18 and 24 of the Family Law Rules.</p>
<p> [4] I agree in part with the appellant. In my view, parts of the order were 
  improper and I would vary the order accordingly. The appellant submits that 
  in the event this court were to find that the order was improper, we should 
  order instead that the mother be allowed unsupervised access to her child. That 
  submission is based on reports prepared by a Clinical Investigator for the Office 
  of the Children's Lawyer ("OCL"). Those reports were prepared as part of an 
  attempt at mediation of the appeal. That mediation attempt failed. In my view, 
  those reports are not admissible in this court. In any event, on the state of 
  this record, this court is not in a position to determine that the mother should 
  have unsupervised access. That is a matter that will have to be determined by 
  the Superior Court if the mother seeks to vary the order. </p>
<p> [5] Accordingly, subject to deleting a part of paragraph 2 and all of paragraph 
  3 of the order, I would dismiss the appeal. I would also dismiss the appeal 
  from the costs order.</p>
<p> THE FACTS</p>
<p> [6] The parties met when they were both students and by 1993 were living together. 
  The parties separated on several occasions and in 1995 during one of those separations 
  the mother became pregnant. The child's biological father has never played any 
  role in the child's life. The respondent has always treated the child as his 
  own and in these reasons I will refer to him as the father. I will likewise 
  refer to the appellant as the mother.</p>
<p> [7] The parties separated in 2000 and since then the father has had the care 
  and custody of the child. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the circumstances 
  surrounding the separation or the ensuing events. There is no contest that the 
  trial judge was right to award sole custody of the child to the father. The 
  appellant also does not contest the trial judge's factual findings that led 
  him to order that the mother only have supervised access to the child. I intend 
  to refer to some of the facts, mostly by reference to the trial judge's reasons, 
  as they bear on the question of the access order.</p>
<p> [8] The evidence at trial showed that even before the parties finally separated, 
  the father was the child's primary parent. The evidence of the father, confirmed 
  by several independent sources including an investigator from the OCL, showed 
  that the mother had difficulties parenting. Around Christmas of 1999 the mother 
  indicated that she wanted the father and the child to move out of the home. 
  At the time, the parties and the child were living in a semi-detached home linked 
  to the mother's parents' home. Throughout the first half of 2000, the mother 
  continued to make statements that led the child to believe that her mother wanted 
  her and her father to leave. The mother, however, kept changing her mind and 
  at one point told the father that she would "destroy" him by making allegations 
  to the Children's Aid Society and to his employer (the father is a primary school 
  teacher). Things came to a head on August 30, 2000 when the mother told the 
  father that she wanted him out that night. He refused to leave without the child. 
  Finally, he left with the child and went to his sister's home. </p>
<p> [9] After the father and child left, the mother called the police and alleged 
  that the father was sexually abusing the child. The mother had previously made 
  allegations of inappropriate behaviour by the father but this was the first 
  complaint to a state agency. On August 31, 2000, the mother obtained an ex parte 
  order for custody. This order was changed to joint and shared custody in early 
  October 2000. At the same time, the OCL was asked to become involved.</p>
<p> [10] In the meantime the CAS and the police began an investigation of the 
  allegations of sexual abuse and the father was suspended from teaching. The 
  Society and the police ultimately completely cleared the father and the father's 
  employment was reinstated. However, the false allegations of abuse by the mother 
  continued. She also attempted to convince the child that the father was abusing 
  her. Finally, this led to the order of Benotto J. in March 2001 providing that 
  the child was to live with the father and the mother was to have access only 
  at the supervised access centre. This order was in place when the matter came 
  for trial before Timms J. later that year.</p>
<p> [11] As I have indicated, the OCL became involved with this case some time 
  in October 2000. At the request of the OCL investigator a psychologist, Dr. 
  Alex Russell, was retained to assess and counsel the child. His findings were 
  troubling. The child had become very withdrawn and was regressing to a baby-like 
  state. Dr. Russell saw the child with both the mother and the father. The child 
  was much more relaxed with the father and the father interacted well with her. 
  The mother, however, did not appear able to respond in an emotionally appropriate 
  manner to the child. The child tended to be frightened and extremely wary in 
  her mother's presence. The mother ultimately sabotaged Dr. Russell's sessions 
  with the child by trying to get the child to make a false allegation of sexual 
  abuse against the father. When the child arrived at the fourth session with 
  her mother, she was screaming and punching her mother. Dr. Russell could not 
  re-engage with the child and his involvement ceased. He concluded his report 
  to the court with a recommendation that the mother receive a psychiatric assessment.</p>
<p> [12] The mother also disrupted the child's day care and school with threats 
  to various staff and teachers. She also went to the father's school and disrupted 
  the class he was teaching by yelling and threatening him. She has stated that 
  she intends to launch lawsuits against the director of the day care centre and 
  the director of the York Toy Library.</p>
<p> [13] During her testimony, the mother continued to make false allegations 
  of sexual impropriety against the father. The trial judge found that the appellant 
  repeatedly lied at the trial and attempted to fabricate evidence. He found her 
  to be "almost without credibility" and "to be among the least credible persons 
  that have ever appeared in front of [him]".</p>
<p> THE TRIAL JUDGE'S ORDER AND REASONS</p>
<p> [14] As I have said, the appellant does not now argue that the trial judge 
  was wrong to award sole custody of the child to the father and that the mother 
  only have access. For convenience I will again set out the parts of the order 
  that are in issue in this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. that as per the Order of The Honourable Madam Justice Benotto 
  dated March 8, 2001, the mother CAM's access to the child, BPM, born April 27, 
  1996, will remain supervised at the Supervised Access Facility until she, CAM, 
  has been given a clean bill of health by a properly qualified psychiatrist;</p>
<p class="indent">3. that the child, BPM, born April 27, 1996, shall continue 
  to see Dr. Russell, and that Dr. Russell will be involved in any decision to 
  grant unsupervised access to the Respondent, CAM;</p>
<p class="indent">[emphasis added] </p>
<p> [15] To understand the basis for these parts of the order, I need to set out 
  part of the trial judge's reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> [63] As a lay person, I lack the expertise to conclude that 
  the applicant is, or is not, suffering from some sort of mental health problem. 
  Dr. Russell believes she is. Mr. Barnett [a counsellor] and Dr. Evans [the family 
  doctor] believe otherwise. I tend to believe that she simply says whatever she 
  thinks will assist her, without realizing how it will appear to third parties 
  and how it might impact upon her relationship with others, including BPM. Once 
  she says things, then she is stuck with what she said and so she just forges 
  ahead. If she is just a grand confabulator, as opposed to having a major psychological 
  problem, then Mr. Barnett and Dr. Evans could be correct. Perhaps Dr. Russell 
  is not used to dealing with persons who lie in such a bald-faced manner. On 
  the other hand, perhaps that is in itself a psychological disorder.</p>
<p class="indent">[64] Accordingly, I don't see that it makes much difference 
  whether the applicant deliberately made up her stories about sexual impropriety/abuse 
  using a few innocent things or whether she took those things and twisted them 
  all around because she has significant psychological problems. The fact remains 
  that she now appears unable to stop with her accusations. She cannot, or will 
  not, listen to others who disagree with her position. </p>
<p class="center"> . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> [69] I agree with Justice Benotto that the applicant's access 
  must be supervised for the time being. By now, her access at the Supervised 
  Access Centre should have started. Her access will remain supervised until she 
  has been given a clean bill of health by a properly qualified psychiatrist. 
  In addition, since BPM will be going back to see Dr. Russell (that is a term 
  of my order) he must be involved in any decision to grant unsupervised access. 
  Dr. Russell is to be given a copy of my judgment.</p>
<p> THE COSTS ORDER</p>
<p> [16] The mother also appeals from the costs order. The father made an offer 
  to settle on February 28, 2001. The trial judge found that this offer was "spot 
  on" as it related to the issues of custody and access, the only live issues 
  at the trial. The trial judge held that the father was entitled to costs generally 
  and to full recovery of costs after the date of the offer in accordance with 
  Rule 18(14) of the Family Law Rules. He held that the line of decisions going 
  back to Talsky v. Talsky [1973], 3 O.R. 827 (C.A.) [reversed on other grounds 
  [1976] 2 S.C.R. 292] that costs should not be awarded in custody actions except 
  in exceptional circumstances had been overtaken by the Family Law Rules. He 
  also held that financial hardship was not a factor in making the costs order. 
  He therefore made the costs order for $49,405.</p>
<p>THE PROPOSED FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p> [17] The trial judge's decision at trial was delivered on May 7, 2001 and 
  his decision on costs was given on July 4, 2001. Thus over two years have passed. 
  The reasons for the delay were not fully developed at the hearing of the appeal. 
  Part of the delay seems to be attributable to the mother's delay in perfecting 
  the appeal. Following the trial, the mother exercised access to the child at 
  a provincial Supervised Access Facility. However, the access facility discontinued 
  offering its services to the mother after the mother made a further false allegation 
  against the father. It is the policy of the facility not to offer its services 
  to parties while there is an open CAS file. As a result, the parties were able 
  to agree on the mother having supervised access through a private agency, Bartimaeus 
  Inc. Another problem was that Dr. Russell was no longer involved because the 
  mother made a complaint against him to his professional discipline body.</p>
<p> [18] On May 3, 2002, Feldman J.A. made an order allowing the supervised access 
  to continue through Bartimaeus Inc. once every two weeks. The mother was to 
  continue to pay the costs of the supervisor. Feldman J.A. also arranged for 
  the appeal to be heard in July 2002. However, before the appeal could be heard 
  the parties agreed to take advantage of this court's settlement conference pilot 
  project. As a result of that process, an investigator for the OCL made two reports. 
  After the first report, the parties agreed to somewhat more liberal, but still 
  supervised, access by the mother. In the second report, the investigator recommended 
  that the mother have unsupervised access. The father disputes the findings of 
  the investigator and does not accept her recommendations. As is apparent, the 
  parties did not settle the appeal. The mother seeks to introduce the investigator's 
  reports. The father objects to their admission. He submits that the mediation 
  process is to be confidential and that he has not had the opportunity to cross-examine 
  the investigator.</p>
<p> ANALYSIS</p>
<p> The Order</p>
<p> [19] The mother was not represented by counsel at the trial. I think that 
  the trial judge made his order in the way that he did to assist the mother in 
  understanding what she had to do to get unsupervised access to her daughter. 
  It was apparent to the trial judge that the mother's mental health was in some 
  way interfering with her ability to parent the child. As he said, he was not 
  an expert and was making the obvious point that until the court had some expert 
  assistance it would not be possible to make a different access order. The trial 
  judge also probably hoped that his order would lead to the mother seeking expert 
  psychiatric assistance. Once she had obtained this assistance and a favourable 
  report she would be in a position to go to court to make a realistic application 
  to vary the access.</p>
<p> [20] That said, in my view there are several problems with the order. First, 
  it seems to me that it is too vague. I do not see how the mother or even a treating 
  psychiatrist would know what the trial judge meant by "a clean bill of health". 
  For example, there was some suggestion from Dr. Russell that the mother might 
  be psychotic. As a psychologist, he did not have the expertise to make that 
  judgment. The question is whether it would have been sufficient for the mother 
  to show the father that a qualified psychiatrist did not find her to be psychotic. 
  What if, the mother suffers from serious depression? Would that disentitle her 
  to a "clean bill of health"? </p>
<p> [21] Second, even if the mother did not find a psychiatrist to give her a 
  clean bill of health, that would not disentitle her to access to the child, 
  even unsupervised access, if such access would be in the best interests of the 
  child. Conversely, a clean bill of health would not entitle her to unsupervised 
  access, if that access would not be in the best interests of the child. Put 
  another way, the mother's mental health, while not an irrelevant consideration 
  in this case, was not the only consideration as to whether the mother should 
  have access to this child.</p>
<p> [22] Third, the trial judge appears to have delegated decision making regarding 
  access to two other parties, an unnamed "properly qualified psychiatrist" and 
  Dr. Russell. It may be that the trial judge expected that the mother would apply 
  to the court to vary the access. However, that is not how the order reads. It 
  appears to leave decision making in the hands of third parties. There is no 
  authority that would permit this type of delegation. See Strobridge v. Strobridge 
  (1994), 4 R.F.L. (4th) 169 (Ont. C.A.) at 181. I also note that the trial judge 
  did not obtain Dr. Russell's consent to remain involved in the case. As it happens, 
  he did briefly remain involved until the mother's complaint against him made 
  that impossible.</p>
<p> [23] Finally, it may be that the order represents an improper fetter on the 
  mother's access to the courts. It was not open to the trial judge, in these 
  circumstances, to delegate to third parties the right to determine if and when 
  the mother could apply to the court for unsupervised access. See Williams v. 
  Ellul (1996), 19 R.F.L. (4th) 40 (Ont. C.A.) at 43.</p>
<p> [24] Counsel for the mother makes one further argument. He submits that the 
  order was improper because it resulted in supervised access over the long term 
  and such access is not in the best interests of the child. See M. (B.P.) v. 
  M. (B.L.D.E.) (1992), 42 R.F.L. (3d) 349 (Ont. C.A.) at 361. The difficulty 
  with this submission is that there did not seem to be any other practical solution 
  at the time. It is apparent that if there was going to be any access by the 
  mother it would have to be supervised. The alternative was no access. See R.S.-C. 
  v. T.C., [1992] O.J. No. 1860 (S.C.J.) at pp. 13-4. The trial judge obviously 
  was of the view that denying access altogether would not have been in the best 
  interests of the child. Probably, the trial judge expected that the mother would 
  heed his words, seek expert help, and in a relatively short time be able to 
  return to the trial court to vary the order. Regrettably, that did not happen. 
  I do not see how the trial judge can be faulted on this basis.</p>
<p> [25] Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge's order cannot stand in full. 
  Paragraph 3 relating to Dr. Russell must be deleted. I would also remove the 
  clean bill of health condition. However, the condition that the access be supervised 
  is valid and fully supported by the evidence. I will deal with the question 
  of the method of access after I consider the proposed fresh evidence.</p>
<p> The Fresh Evidence</p>
<p> [26] This court has started a pilot mediation project as an attempt to assist 
  parties to family law appeals. This court recognized that parties would likely 
  not agree to be involved in mediation at the appeal level without a strict policy 
  of confidentiality. We therefore offer a promise to the parties. That promise 
  is set out in the Practice Direction for Pre-Hearing Settlement Conferences 
  in Family Law Appeals Pilot Project. If there is a successful resolution, the 
  resulting agreement and draft order are disclosed to the panel when the appeal 
  is to be heard. Otherwise, "the fact of the settlement conference, the memoranda 
  filed and all deliberations in the process, will remain strictly confidential 
  and without prejudice to the parties' legal positions". </p>
<p> [27] In my view, that part of the mother's proposed fresh evidence that sets 
  out the fact of the conference, the involvement by the OCL, and the parties' 
  interim agreement to vary access in accordance with the first set of recommendations 
  of the OCL's investigator is not in accordance with the Practice Direction. 
  Those matters clearly should not be accepted as fresh evidence by this court. 
</p>
<p> [28] I am also of the view that the investigator's reports are not admissible 
  as fresh evidence. I understand that the OCL was acting under its statutory 
  mandate in accordance with s. 112 of the Courts of Justice Act. However, its 
  involvement was only because of the settlement conference process. To allow 
  one party to this appeal to place the reports before the court could prejudice 
  the other party's legal position on the appeal and thus undermine the legitimacy 
  of the settlement conference process. The facts of this case could not provide 
  a clearer example. Counsel for the mother argued that even if this court found 
  the trial judge's order to be completely valid, the appeal should still be allowed 
  and an order made giving the mother unsupervised access in accordance with the 
  recommendations of the investigator's second report. This is incompatible with 
  the promise made by this court that the settlement conference process is without 
  prejudice to the parties' legal position. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p> [29] I appreciate, of course, the force of the submissions by counsel for 
  the mother that the best interests of the child weigh very heavily in determining 
  whether fresh evidence should be admitted. Thus, this court takes a more liberal 
  approach to admission of fresh evidence in child custody cases than in other 
  civil cases. However, that very important concern does not outweigh the very 
  strong public interest in preserving the confidence of litigants in the integrity 
  of this court's process. </p>
<p> [30] Moreover, the mother was not without other means of supplementing the 
  record, if so advised. In fact, when the appeal was originally to be argued, 
  the mother had offered fresh evidence from several experts. She later withdrew 
  that evidence in favour of the investigator's reports.</p>
<p> [31] Finally, even if I had held that the investigator's reports should be 
  admitted, they would not affect what I consider to be the proper result of this 
  appeal. As I have said, the father disputes the findings, and has not had an 
  opportunity to cross-examine the investigator. These are reasonable concerns 
  and I would have attached little or no weight to the investigator's recommendations.</p>
<p> [32] The only admissible evidence concerning the mother's access is as set 
  out in the reasons of Feldman J.A. and in that part of the mother's affidavit 
  where she states that she has been exercising supervised access three of four 
  weekends for one day up to eight hours. Pending any variation application that 
  the mother or father may choose to bring in the Superior Court, the mother's 
  access should continue to be on those terms. The issue of whether or not the 
  OCL's investigator's reports would be admissible at such an application is not 
  before this court. That is a matter that the application judge will have to 
  determine having regard to the circumstances at that time and the context in 
  which the attempt, if any, is made to tender those reports.</p>
<p> THE COSTS AWARD AT TRIAL</p>
<p> [33] The mother submits that the trial judge erred in principle in holding 
  that he had no discretion but to award costs to the father on a full recovery 
  basis from the date of the offer. In his reasons, the trial judge considered 
  it "unfortunate" that the Family Law Rules had reversed the effect of this court's 
  decision in Talsky. In Talsky at p. 833, Jessup J.A. held, speaking for the 
  court, that "since the paramount consideration in a custody matter is that of 
  the children, the participation of the adversaries is not that in ordinary litigation 
  so that, except in very exceptional cases, costs should not follow the event". 
</p>
<p> [34] The trial judge also held that in family law cases the courts previously 
  would consider "the ability of a party to pay costs and likewise the impact 
  of a costs award upon a party's ability to comply with the judgment". He found 
  that under Rule 24, "hardship is not a component under the new rules" and that 
  custody and access cases are "not to be treated differently than any other type 
  of litigation". As I have indicated, the trial judge also held that the father 
  was entitled to full recovery of his costs from the date of his offer to settle.</p>
<p> [35] Counsel for the appellant submits that there is an emerging line of authority 
  in the jurisdictions where the Family Law Rules apply giving the trial courts 
  greater discretion than would appear to have been the case when the rules were 
  initially enacted. As examples, he referred to the decisions in Taylor v. Branconnier, 
  [2003] O.J. No. 924 (S.C.J.), Lord v. Haner-Lord, [2003] O.J. No. 1440 (S.C.J.), 
  Biant v. Sagoo (2001), 20 R.F.L. (5th) 284 (Ont. S.C.J.), Sims-Howarth v. Bilcliffe 
  (2000), 6 R.F.L. (5th) 430 (Ont. S.C.J.) and Ramsay v. Ramsay, [1999] O.J. No. 
  4835 (S.C.J.).</p>
<p> [36] To appreciate counsel's argument it is necessary to set out the relevant 
  parts of the rules. The starting point is Rule 24(1): </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) There is a presumption that a successful party is entitled 
  to the costs of a motion, enforcement, case or appeal.</p>
<p> [37] Subrules (2) to (10) then deal with matters such as awarding costs against 
  an agency, when the successful party may be deprived of his or her costs or 
  required to pay the costs of the unsuccessful party, and the awarding of costs 
  against the lawyer personally. Under subrule (4) a successful party who has 
  behaved unreasonably may be deprived of all or part of the party's costs; however, 
  the father did not act unreasonably in this case. Subrule (11) speaks to the 
  factors in awarding the "amount" of costs. It does not have an impact upon whether 
  a party should be awarded costs: </p>
<p class="indent"> (11) A person setting the amount of costs shall consider,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the importance, complexity or difficulty of the issues;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the reasonableness or unreasonableness of each party's 
  behaviour in the case;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the lawyer's rates;</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) the time properly spent on the case, including conversations 
  between the lawyer and the party or witnesses, drafting documents and correspondence, 
  attempts to settle, preparation, hearing, argument, and preparation and signature 
  of the order;</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) expenses properly paid or payable; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (e) any other relevant matter.</p>
<p> [38] The balance of Rule 24 deals with matters such as security for costs 
  that are not germane to this case. Rule 18 deals with offers to settle. The 
  relevant part for this case is subrule (14), which deals with the costs consequences 
  of an offer: </p>
<p class="indent"> (14) A party who makes an offer is, unless the court orders 
  otherwise, entitled to costs to the date the offer was served and full recovery 
  of costs from that date, if the following conditions are met: </p>
<p class="indent"> [39] The subrule then sets out five conditions. It is common 
  ground in this appeal that the father met those conditions, in particular condition 
  5, as he obtained an order that is as favourable as or more favourable than 
  the offer he made.</p>
<p> [40] Reference should also be made to s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, 
  which provides that subject to the provisions of an Act "or rules of court, 
  the costs of and incidental to a proceeding &#8230; are in the discretion of 
  the court". It is apparent that the Family Law Rules have circumscribed the 
  broad discretion granted by s. 131(1). See Biant v. Sagoo at para. 15. They 
  have not, however, completely removed the trial judge's discretion. Thus, the 
  general provision, Rule 24(1), enacts a "presumption" that the successful party 
  is entitled to costs of the case but does not require that the successful party 
  is always entitled to costs. </p>
<p> [41] While it is not necessary to decide the issue in this case, I think it 
  is arguable that a successful party may not obtain a costs award in his or her 
  favour even in circumstances not falling within subrule 24(4). There may be 
  circumstances aside from the unreasonableness of the successful party's conduct 
  that rebut the presumption. See Ramsay v. Ramsay at para. 10.</p>
<p> [42] I am also of the view that the financial situation of the parties can 
  be taken into account in setting the amount of the costs award either under 
  Rule 24 or Rule 18. Thus, while subrule 24(11) enumerates a number of factors 
  that must be taken into account, the person setting the amount of the costs 
  is directed to take into account "any other relevant matter". I agree with Aston 
  J. in Sims-Howarth at para. 4, that the "Family Law Rules demand flexibility 
  in examining the list of factors in subrule 24(11) without any assumptions about 
  categories of costs". In my view, a consideration of particular relevance may 
  be the financial position of the parties, especially of an unsuccessful custodial 
  parent. See Biant at para. 17 and Brennan v. Brennan, [2002] O.J. No. 4743 (S.C.J.) 
  at para. 11. In fixing costs the courts cannot ignore the best interests of 
  the child and thus cannot ignore the impact of a costs award against a custodial 
  parent that would seriously affect the interests of the child. That, however, 
  was not a consideration in this case. The mother is not the custodial parent.</p>
<p> [43] I am also of the view that the court has a discretion not to make an 
  award of full recovery even where the party has met the conditions in Rule 18(14). 
  The rule makes that clear since it provides that "unless the court orders otherwise" 
  the party is entitled to full recovery. Again, a relevant consideration would 
  be the financial condition of the parties, especially an unsuccessful custodial 
  parent. See Church v. Church, [2003] O.J. No. 2811 (S.C.J.) at paras. 14 - 18. 
  Finally, I am of the view that even when making an award of full recovery the 
  trial judge must ensure that the costs sought by the successful party are reasonable.</p>
<p> [44] The mother's counsel agrees that the father was entitled to the costs 
  of the trial in accordance with Rule 24(1). He submits, however, that the trial 
  judge erred in principle because he did not recognize that he had a discretion 
  not to make an order for full recovery of costs from the date of the offer. 
  He particularly relies upon this part of the reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> I feel compelled to apply rule 24, as it stands, to the facts 
  of this case. Perhaps one day, the Court of Appeal or the Family Rules Committee 
  will restore greater discretion to Judges when it comes to cases of this nature.</p>
<p> [45] If the trial judge was of the view that he had no discretion or that 
  the financial position of the parties could not be a relevant consideration 
  then he erred in principle. That said, I see no circumstances in this case that 
  would lead me to interfere with the costs award in this case. The mother's conduct 
  before and during the trial was unreasonable. As I have said, the trial judge 
  found that she lied during the trial and attempted to fabricate evidence. She 
  put the father through a nine and a half day trial and was completely unsuccessful. 
  According to the trial judge, the father made an offer that was "spot on". This 
  was a case for the costs consequences in Rule 18(14). In the circumstances, 
  I do not see that the mother's financial circumstances are a reason to deprive 
  the father of his costs. This was money he had to pay to defend this litigation 
  that would otherwise have been available, at least in part, for the care of 
  the child. Counsel for the mother did not suggest that the costs sought by the 
  father were unreasonable. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from the costs 
  order.</p>
<p> DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [46] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part and delete term 3 from 
  the order. I would also delete term 4 (that Dr. Russell receive a copy of the 
  trial judge's judgment) since that term is now spent. I would delete term 2 
  of the order and replace it with the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> that the mother CAM's access to the child, BPM, born April 
  27, 1996, be for three of four weekends for one day up to eight hours supervised 
  as provided for in the Order of The Honourable Madam Justice Feldman dated May 
  3, 2002. </p>
<p> [47] In all other respects I would dismiss the appeal. The parties will have 
  ten days from the release of these reasons to provide brief written submissions 
  concerning costs of the appeal. They may file a brief reply to each other's 
  submissions within ten days of receiving the other party's submissions.</p>
