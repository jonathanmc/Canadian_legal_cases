<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Of the numerous issues raised by the appellant, we only found it necessary 
  to call upon the respondent in respect of three.</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) As to GST, we are satisfied that the issue was raised during 
  the trial and that the appellant had notice of that issue. We cannot say that 
  the trial judge erred in exercising her discretion to permit the amendment of 
  the claim. Further, on this record, the appellant has failed to show entitlement 
  to credit for any rebate.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) As to tender, we agree with the trial judge&#8217;s interpretation 
  of clause 37 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and that it was open to her 
  to find that the respondent was ready, willing and able to close and that formal 
  tender was not required.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) As to costs, we have not been persuaded that there was 
  any error in principle. It was open to the trial judge to take into account 
  the various matters referred to in her reasons on the costs issue. </p>
<p> [2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at 
  $6,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
