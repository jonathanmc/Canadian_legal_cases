<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice J. Stephen O'Neill of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated February 21, 2000 and 
  from the sentence imposed by Justice O'Neill dated April 26, 2000.</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:</p> <p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from his conviction on one count of aggravated assault 
  and if not successful, seeks leave to appeal his sentence. He submits firstly 
  that the verdict was unreasonable and seeks an acquittal. Alternatively, he 
  seeks a new trial based on a number of grounds of appeal. Crown counsel opposes 
  the request for an acquittal but concedes that there must be a new trial. At 
  the conclusion of the hearing, we agreed with Crown counsel's position. In our 
  view, the evidence could reasonably support the verdict. However, the conviction 
  cannot stand in light of a number of errors committed during the course of the 
  trial. We therefore allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and ordered 
  a new trial for reasons to follow. These are those reasons. </p> <p>
  [2] Since there will be a new trial, we do not propose to relate the evidence 
  in any detail. The facts that are relevant to the various grounds of appeal 
  can be briefly stated as follows. </p> <p>
  [3] The sole issue at trial was identification. On the evening of December 10, 
  1997, Menelek Kenneth Belcher, the complainant, went from Toronto to Parry Sound 
  with his acquaintance, Lam Van Nguyen. They arrived at a cottage around midnight. 
  There were a number of adult males in the cottage, some of whom neither Mr. 
  Nguyen nor Mr. Belcher knew. Shortly after their arrival, Mr. Belcher was unexpectedly 
  attacked as he bent over to inspect the cord to a video game machine. He was 
  hit in the head, and then stabbed on the left wrist as he raised his arms to 
  defend himself. Once the attacker left the cabin, Mr. Nguyen and the victim 
  attempted to leave the scene in Mr. Nguyen's car. During their attempt to drive 
  away, Mr. Belcher was again attacked when the same perpetrator broke the car 
  window and reached in with his knife. Mr. Belcher was able to escape from the 
  car and run to a nearby apartment to seek help and call the police.</p> <p>
  [4] The police attended at the scene shortly thereafter. Mr. Belcher provided 
  the police with an immediate description of his attacker, that being a white 
  male in a black &quot;rocker&quot; leather jacket, older than the people Mr. 
  Belcher was with. Shortly afterwards, a police officer stopped Mr. Nguyen's 
  car as it was leaving the area. At that time, there were several occupants in 
  the car, including the driver, Mr. Nguyen, and the appellant. All the occupants 
  except for Mr. Nguyen exited the vehicle. Another officer, Sgt. Digby, observed 
  the appellant who appeared older than the rest of the others there and who was 
  wearing a black bomber jacket. There appeared to be blood on his cap, on the 
  arm of his jacket, and on one of his hands. Sgt. Digby also spoke to Mr. Nguyen. 
  Two of the others fled the scene. The appellant was then arrested and brought 
  to the police station. Upon arrival, he asked to use the washroom and was brought 
  to a cell without a wash basin. A police officer observed him washing his hands 
  in the toilet. </p> <p>
  [5] Ten days later, Mr. Belcher gave another statement to the police, this time 
  adding that the attacker had his hair in a ponytail, was wearing black leather 
  gloves, and was shorter than Mr. Belcher. All these features were consistent 
  with the police officers' observation of the appellant's appearance on December 
  10, except for the gloves. Mr. Belcher testified and made an in-court identification 
  of the appellant.</p> <p>
  [6] Mr. Nguyen testified and stated that he had very little memory of the events 
  in question. At the outset of his examination-in-chief, Crown counsel sought 
  and was granted leave to show the witness a previous statement he had given 
  to the police in an attempt to refresh his memory. Certain parts of his statement 
  were read out including a description of the attacker. While Mr. Nguyen acknowledged 
  that he had given the statement to the police and that it &quot;could be true&quot;, 
  he denied remembering much about the incident. He did not adopt his statement 
  as true and did not identify the appellant at trial. </p> <p>
  [7] Sergeant Digby testified and gave details of his investigation on the evening 
  in question. He testified that he received a description of the assailant from 
  the victim. He also testified that he spoke to Mr. Nguyen after his car was 
  stopped. He testified that the appellant was then arrested. While he did not 
  testify as to the contents of the conversation with Mr. Nguyen, he did comment 
  that as a result of the conversation, he was &quot;100% confident&quot; they 
  had arrested the right man. </p> <p>
  [8] As indicated at the outset of these reasons, we do not agree that the verdict 
  was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. Despite the frailties of the 
  identification evidence and other items of evidence relied upon by the appellant, 
  it is our view on the totality of the evidence that the verdict is one that 
  a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered. 
  It is particularly noteworthy that the case against the appellant was not entirely 
  dependent on the complainant's identification of his assailant. Several items 
  of circumstantial evidence were capable of providing support to this identification. 
  Hence, we did not find it necessary to hear from Crown counsel on this ground 
  of appeal and we rejected it at the conclusion of counsel's argument. </p> <p>
  [9] It is our view, however, that Crown counsel properly conceded that a new 
  trial should be ordered in light of the cumulative effect of the errors that 
  were committed. These errors are as follows: </p> 
<ul>
  <li> Although the trial judge provided general instructions to the jury on the 
    frailties of eyewitness identification evidence, it is our view that these 
    instructions were inadequate. In particular, he gave no limiting instruction 
    with respect to the complainant's in dock identification. This error was aggravated 
    by the fact that Crown counsel, in his closing submissions, placed significant 
    weight on Mr. Belcher's demeanour when he made the in-dock identification. 
    The invitation to place weight on the act of the in court identification was 
    not corrected or minimized by the trial judge in his charge. Rather, he repeated 
    Crown counsel's invitation in reviewing the Crown's theory of the case. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The charge to the jury left the erroneous impression that Mr. Nguyen had 
    identified the appellant as the perpetrator. Mr. Nguyen neither identified 
    the appellant at trial nor adopted the contents of his statement to the police. 
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The trial judge erred in allowing the contents of Mr. Nguyen's prior written 
    statement to the police, never adopted for its truth, to be considered as 
    evidence going to identification. The Crown concedes that, on this record, 
    the evidence was not admissible as present memory revived, past recollection 
    recorded, or under the principled approach to hearsay. Whether the evidence 
    could be admitted on the basis of a proper evidentiary foundation is a question 
    that can only be determined at the new trial. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The trial judge erred in allowing Sgt. Digby to give inadmissible opinion 
    evidence as to the correctness of the identification of the appellant as the 
    assailant. This error was exacerbated by Crown counsel's strong emphasis upon 
    Sgt. Digby's 100% level of confidence in the correctness of the appellant's 
    arrest during his closing submissions. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [10] In our view, the cumulative effect of these errors seriously prejudiced 
  the fairness of the appellant's trial. It is for these reasons that we allowed 
  the appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial. In light of that 
  disposition, there is no need to deal with the sentence appeal.</p>
