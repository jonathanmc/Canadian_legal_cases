<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting a young foster 
  girl in his care over about a 2 year period when the girl was eight or nine 
  years old. According to the complainant, the appellant regularly came to her 
  bedroom shortly after she went to bed and fondled her breasts and vagina. The 
  molestation escalated to digital penetration of the vagina. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant testified and denied the assaults. His wife and brother-in-law 
  gave evidence in support of his defence. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] This was a straightforward case. The Crown's case rested entirely on the 
  complainant's evidence. There were difficulties with her credibility, including 
  her failure to disclose the alleged assaults for a considerable period of time 
  during which she was attending sexual abuse educational classes. These difficulties 
  with the complainant's credibility were fully canvassed in the closing addresses 
  of counsel and the charge to the jury. The appellant does not take issue with 
  the charge. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] Counsel framed various grounds of appeal in his factum, however, they all 
  come down to the submission that the verdict is unreasonable. The limited scope 
  of appellate review when it is alleged that the verdict is unreasonable is well 
  established. Appellate courts must be particularly careful in assessing credibility 
  from the far off distance of the Court of Appeal. Bearing in mind the limited 
  scope of our review, we see no basis upon which to interfere with the jury's 
  verdict.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The appellant also appeals the sentence imposed of 15 months. We see no 
  error in principle in the sentence imposed. Given the nature of the offence 
  for which the appellant was convicted, we cannot say that the trial judge erred 
  in exercising his discretion in favour of incarceration. He did consider a conditional 
  sentence, but determined that it was not appropriate in the circumstances.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal the sentence is 
  granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
