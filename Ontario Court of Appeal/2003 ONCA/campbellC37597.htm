<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Hugh Roderick McLean of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated January 8, 2001 and from 
  the sentence imposed on April 10, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to a term 
  of nine years imprisonment. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The issue 
  at trial was whether the appellant was guilty of attempted murder, as charged, 
  or aggravated assault, which was conceded.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant raises two issues. First, he submits that the trial judge 
  erred in the first step of the W.D. instruction to the jury. Second, he argues 
  that the trial judge gave an unnecessary instruction distinguishing an attempt 
  from mere preparation under s. 24 of the Criminal Code with the result that 
  he obscured the simple issue of whether the appellant intended to kill the complainant. 
  </p>    <P>
  The W.D. Charge</p>    <P>
  [3] The impugned statement in the trial judge's charge is:</p>    
<P class="indent"> First, if you accept the evidence favouring the accused, including 
  his testimony on this matter, and find it to be factually true when weighed 
  against the contradictory evidence, if so, you must acquit the accused.</p>    
<P>
  [4] In our view, this charge does not contravene W.D. It is not reversible error 
  to describe the first W.D. step in terms of believing the accused's evidence 
  when &quot;weighed against&quot; the contradictory evidence. See R. v. DLM, 
  [1996] O.J. No. 3596 (C.A.).</p>    <P>
  [5] Assessment of the accused's evidence cannot be done in isolation. As the 
  Crown concedes, it would have been preferable to describe this step in terms 
  of considering the accused's evidence in the context of the entirety of the 
  evidence, since this steers more clearly away from the risk of simply choosing 
  between the accused's evidence and the complainant's evidence.</p>    <P>
  [6] Nonetheless, the language used here is not fatal. It does not invite the 
  jury to choose between two versions of the event; rather, it recognizes the 
  reality that the context in which the appellant's evidence had to be considered 
  was contradictory evidence from the complainant.</p>    <P>
  The s. 24 Charge</p>    <P>
  [7] There is no doubt that the charge unnecessarily referred to s. 24(2) of 
  the Code. However, the charge made it clear that the key task for the jury was 
  to determine if the Crown had proven the necessary intent for attempt murder. 
  Having left the jury so squarely with this task, we do not think that the jury 
  would have been tempted to conclude from the s. 24(2) instruction that the trial 
  judge was answering this question for them. Rather, they would have understood 
  that the trial judge was describing for them the distinction between an attempt 
  to commit an offence and mere preparation.</p>    <P>
  The Sentence Appeal</p>    <P>
  [8] The appellant argues that the sentencing judge erred in giving prominence 
  to denunciation and deterrence despite the fact that the appellant was a first 
  offender. </p>    <P>
  [9] We do not agree. The sentence is within the appropriate range for attempt 
  murder in a domestic situation. This court has repeatedly stated that the principle 
  of deterrence is of paramount importance in determining the appropriate sentence 
  for crimes of domestic violence. See, for example, R. v. Edwards (1996), 28 
  O.R. (3rd) 54 (C.A.).</p>    <P>
  Disposition</p>    <P>
  [10] Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal against 
  sentence is granted and the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
