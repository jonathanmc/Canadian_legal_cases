<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 4, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The Superintendent of Bankruptcy appeals against the order of Ground J. 
  dated October 4, 2002 insofar as that order approves on a final basis the fees 
  and disbursements of the Trustee in Bankruptcy PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. (the 
  &quot;Trustee&quot;) for the period February 1, 2002 to May 15, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Superintendent contends that the motion judge lacked jurisdiction to 
  approve the Trustee's fees and disbursements on a final basis prior to the conclusion 
  of the bankruptcy and prior to the submission, under s. 152 of the Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (&quot;the Act&quot;), of the Trustee's 
  Final Statement of Fees and Disbursements. Further, the Superintendent contends 
  that to hold otherwise would nullify several mandatory provisions of the Act, 
  including, the inspectors' duty, under s. 120 of the Act, to review and approve 
  the Trustee's Final Statement of Fees and Disbursements; the Superintendent's 
  entitlement, under s. 152 of the Act, to comment on the Trustee's Final Statement 
  of Fees and Disbursements; and the entitlement of interested parties, under 
  s. 152 of the Act, to comment on the Trustee's Final Statement of Fees and Disbursements. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Put another way, the Superintendent contends that the Act establishes a 
  three step approval process for the Trustee's fees and disbursements, namely, 
  approval by the inspectors, approval by the Superintendent, and approval by 
  the court; that the process does not commence until the conclusion of the bankruptcy, 
  and that the court's jurisdiction to fix the Trustee's fees and disbursements 
  is not engaged until the first two steps have been completed in the manner contemplated 
  by the Act.</p>
<p>
  [4] We do not accept the Superintendent's submissions. </p>
<p>
  [5] Section 192(1)(i) of the Act confers jurisdiction on the registrars of the 
  court &quot;to tax or fix costs and to pass accounts [emphasis added]&quot;. 
  The jurisdiction to pass accounts encompasses the jurisdiction to set the Trustee's 
  fees and disbursements. There is no requirement in s. 192 that that jurisdiction 
  be exercised at a particular time. Moreover, s. 192 (2) provides that the jurisdiction 
  conferred by s. 192 &quot;may&#133;be exercised by a judge&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [6] We agree that the scheme of the Act is such that, in ordinary circumstances, 
  a judicial officer should exercise his discretion under s. 192 to fix the remuneration 
  of a trustee after the conclusion of a bankruptcy and after the completion of 
  the various steps enumerated by Superintendent. However, in our view, ss. 120 
  and 152 of the Act do not derogate from the broad jurisdiction conferred by 
  s. 192 to pass accounts in such manner and at such time as may be appropriate 
  in the circumstances of a particular case. </p>
<p> [7] In the unique circumstances of this case, we see no error on the part 
  of the motion judge in the exercise of his jurisdiction. In particular, we note 
  the following circumstances that justified the exercise of the judge's jurisdiction 
  to fix a portion of the Trustee's remuneration prior to the conclusion of the 
  bankruptcy and prior to completion of the various steps enumerated by the Superintendent: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Canada 3000 Inc. (&quot;Inc.&quot;), Canada 3000 Airlines Limited/Lignes 
    A&eacute;riennes Canada 3000 Limit&eacute;e (&quot;3000&quot;) and Royal Aviation 
    Inc. (&quot;Royal&quot;) (together referred to as the &quot;Canada 3000 Group&quot;) 
    ceased operations on November 9, 2001 and filed assignments in bankruptcy 
    on November 11, 2001;</li>
  <li>because of the large number of unsecured creditors of the Canada 3000 Group<a href="#1">[1]</a>,<a name="r1"></a> 
    and the fact that the Canada 3000 Group's records did not include the names 
    or addresses of many of the unsecured creditors, the motion judge suspended 
    the requirement of holding a first meeting of creditors for the Canada 3000 
    Group for several months and established a special claims process for unsecured 
    creditors;</li>
  <li>the first meetings of creditors for the Canada 3000 Group were held on May 
    15, 2002; the inspectors for 3000 and Royal were appointed on that date, however, 
    no one agreed to act as an inspector for Inc.;</li>
  <li>between November 11, 2001 and May 15, 2002, the Trustee prepared five reports 
    to the Court and sought approval from the Court for various activities that 
    normally would have been undertaken with the approval of the inspectors;</li>
  <li>the fees and disbursements in issue on this appeal related to the Trustee's 
    activities during the period between February 1, 2002 and May 15, 2002;</li>
  <li>the inspectors were afforded an opportunity to review the material relating 
    to the Trustee's fees and disbursements, to ask questions of the Trustee, 
    and to make submissions to the court; they asked no questions and made no 
    submissions; and </li>
  <li>the Superintendent was served with the motion seeking approval of the Trustee's 
    fees and disbursements and therefore was afforded the opportunity to comment 
    on the fees and disbursements claimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [8] In summary, given that the fees and disbursements approved by the motion 
  judge related to a period during which there were no inspectors of the bankrupts' 
  estates and during which the activities of the Trustee were approved directly 
  by the Court, and given that the Superintendent and the inspectors had the opportunity 
  to review the material relating to the Trustee's claim and make submissions, 
  we see no error in the motion judge's exercise of the jurisdiction conferred 
  by s. 192(1)(i) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed at $3,000 inclusive of 
  disbursements and applicable G.S.T.</p>
