<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice George P. Smith of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 13, 2002 and from the decision on costs dated October 
  10, 2002. </p>

<p>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  [1] In 1875, and pursuant to Treaty 3, the Crown created an Indian reserve &quot;not 
  to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the Saulteaux Tribe, generally&quot; 
  for the purpose of maintaining an Indian agency. </p>
<p>
  [2] In 2002, the Attorney General of Canada brought an application in the Superior 
  Court of Justice asking the court to identify the Indian Bands for which the 
  reserve had been set apart.</p>
<p>
  [3] Two groups of bands, the Rainy River Bands and the Rainy Lake Bands, responded 
  to the application and claimed an entitlement to the reserve lands. The applications 
  judge, George P. Smith J., found that the reserve was set apart solely for the 
  use and benefit of the Rainy Lake Bands. The Rainy River Bands appeal that decision.</p>
<p>
  [4] The applications judge's conclusion was fact-driven and was supported by 
  the evidence. I see no basis to interfere. I would, however, set aside his order 
  denying costs to the two band groups and require the government to pay their 
  costs on the application.</p>
<p>
  History of Proceeding</p>
<p> [5] The proceeding was instituted by an application made by the Attorney General 
  of Canada seeking a ruling as to which bands are the beneficial owners of a 
  reserve commonly known as the Agency One Reserve. The only parties who responded 
  to the application were four bands known collectively as the Rainy Lake Bands 
  and<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> seven bands known collectively as the 
  Rainy River Bands.</p>
<p>
  [6] It was accepted by all the parties that the Rainy Lake Bands were entitled 
  to a beneficial interest in the Agency One Reserve. The primary issue for determination 
  was whether the Rainy River Bands were similarly entitled.</p>
<p>
  [7] In reply to the government's application, the parties filed extensive material, 
  including two agreed statements of fact, affidavits, many historical documents 
  and opinions of experts addressing the authenticity and other aspects of the 
  historical documents. The bands also called oral evidence of elders. </p>
<p>
  [8] The hearing lasted six days and, after reserving judgment, the applications 
  judge delivered written reasons concluding that only the Rainy Lake Bands were 
  entitled to benefit from the Agency One Reserve. He declined to make any award 
  of costs.</p>
<p>
  The Facts</p>
<p>
  [9] In his reasons, the applications judge referred to the evidence in some 
  detail. Here, I provide the following abbreviated summary of the facts only 
  insofar as is necessary to properly contextualize the discussion that follows.</p>
<p>
  [10] On October 3, 1873, the Crown in Right of Canada and the Saulteaux Tribe 
  of Ojibway Indians entered into Treaty 3. Treaty 3 did not set apart reserves, 
  but did create a process for doing so. Accordingly, on January 28, 1975, Simon 
  Dawson, one of the Treaty Commissioners, submitted a report to the government 
  describing a number of reserves, including seven on Rainy River, four on Rainy 
  Lake, and the Agency One Reserve that is the subject of this litigation.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Agency One Reserve is located at the west end of Rainy Lake between 
  the lake and the Town of Fort Frances. Consisting of approximately 170 acres, 
  the reserve is more precisely located where the Rainy River flows from Rainy 
  Lake at a point in land commonly referred to as Pither's Point. Dawson's report 
  described the Agency One Reserve in the following language: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Indian Reserve, not to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the 
  Saulteaux Tribe, generally, and for the purpose of maintaining thereon an Indian 
  agency and the necessary grounds and buildings.</p>
<p>
  [12] On February 27, 1875, an Order-in-Council provisionally approved the reserves 
  described in Dawson's report and set out that the reserves were subject to such 
  future surveys as may be necessary as well as final confirmation by the Governor 
  General in Council.</p>
<p>
  [13] Later in 1875, the reserves set apart for the Rainy Lake and the Rainy 
  River Bands were surveyed. As I describe below, the amount of land allotted 
  to the Rainy River Bands was increased by the Surveyor General.</p>
<p>
  [14] From 1875 until 1882, the Rainy Lake and the Rainy River Bands received 
  Treaty annuities at the Agency One Reserve. In 1882, a change in government 
  policy required annuities to be paid at individual band reserves. </p>
<p>
  [15] In 1908, the Town of Fort Frances, which was located adjacent to the Agency 
  One Reserve, wanted to acquire a portion of the reserve for purpose of creating 
  a municipal park. On October 1 that year, the local Indian agent for the Government 
  of Canada obtained a surrender of approximately 114 acres of land from representatives 
  of the four Rainy Lake Bands. </p>
<p>
  [16] By Order-in-Council dated November 14, 1908, the Government of Canada approved 
  and accepted the surrender of the lands. The evidence reveals that after 1908, 
  the Government of Canada consistently treated the four Rainy Lake Bands as the 
  beneficiaries of the Agency One Reserve. There were two further surrenders of 
  land, in 1961 and 1976, which were also signed only by the four Rainy Lake Bands.</p>
<p>
  [17] Throughout the 20th century, the appellant Rainy River Bands made no claims 
  to the Agency One Reserve or to monies received on the surrender of portions 
  of it. It was only when the Government of Canada instituted the application 
  that underlies this appeal that the Rainy River Band came forward and claimed 
  a beneficial entitlement in the Agency One Reserve.</p>
<p>
  The Decision of the Applications Judge</p>
<p> [18] The applications judge found the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Notwithstanding its provisional nature, the 1875 Order-in-Council created 
    the Agency One Reserve;</li>
  <li>The wording and language of the Order-in-Council do not clarify which Indians 
    or Bands were entitled to the benefit of the Agency One Reserve;</li>
  <li>As a whole, the evidence of events from 1875 until 1908 is &quot;inconclusive, 
    frequently vague and often conflicting&quot; as to the Crown's intention concerning 
    entitlement;</li>
  <li>The 1908 surrender was &quot;a distinct unequivocal act&quot; indicating 
    the Crown's intention that the Rainy Lake Bands were the only beneficial owners 
    of the Agency One Reserve;</li>
  <li>Subsequent to 1908, the intention of the Crown remained clear. There was 
    no evidence of any interest or claim by the Rainy River Bands prior to the 
    institution of this proceeding; and</li>
  <li>As such, the Agency One Reserve was set apart only for the Rainy Lake Bands.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Issue</p>
<p>
  [19] The primary issue in this appeal is whether the applications judge erred 
  in concluding that the Crown intended that only the Rainy Lake Bands were to 
  benefit from the Agency One Reserve.</p>
<p>
  [20] The secondary issue in this appeal regards the costs of the application. 
  The Rainy River Bands seek leave to appeal the applications judge's failure 
  to award costs in the proceeding below; the Rainy Lake Bands seek leave to bring 
  a cross-appeal to the same effect.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [21] In Ross River Dena Council Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 54, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada set out the basic principles relating to the creation of reserves. 
  The determination of whether a reserve has been created and, if so, for whose 
  benefit, is a fact-driven process. There is no single method for creating a 
  reserve, although the Order-in-Council has been the most common and the clearest 
  procedure for doing so. Whatever method is used, the Crown's intention to create 
  a reserve is essential. Further, steps must be taken to set apart the reserve 
  for the benefit of Indians. Finally, the Band or Bands concerned must have accepted 
  the setting apart and have started to make use of these lands.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge concluded that notwithstanding its provisional nature, 
  the 1875 Order-in-Council created the Agency One Reserve. This conclusion is 
  not challenged by the appellant. Therefore, the sole question that remained 
  was for whose benefit that reserve was created.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge approached the issue of entitlement by looking to three 
  bodies of evidence: the Order-in-Council; the historical context, including 
  the circumstances contemporaneous with and immediately following the Order-in-Council; 
  and the actions of the parties in 1908 and following years. </p>
<p>
  [24] I turn first to the Order-in-Council. For convenience, I repeat the wording 
  in Simon Dawson's report relating to the Agency One Reserve that was adopted 
  by the 1875 Order-in-Council. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Indian Reserve, not to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the 
  Saulteaux Tribe, generally, and for the purpose of maintaining thereon an Indian 
  Agency and the necessary grounds and buildings.</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge considered the intent of the words &quot;for the Saulteaux 
  Tribe generally&quot; in light of the historical and expert evidence. He concluded 
  that the words taken by themselves were vague and inconclusive as to the intent 
  of the government. In their broadest reach, those words could refer to the entire 
  Indian population in the Treaty 3 area as well as bands covered by other treaties 
  outside the Treaty 3 area. This is not an interpretation urged upon us by any 
  of the parties nor is it one that makes any sense given that a large majority 
  of those bands would have had no use for the Agency One Reserve and no connection 
  to it.</p>
<p>
  [26] I agree with the applications judge's interpretation that the words &quot;for 
  the Saulteaux Tribe generally&quot; were intended to refer to specific bands 
  living in the general area of the Agency One Reserve. Accepting that, the only 
  question that remains is which bands in that general area did the Crown intend 
  to benefit?</p>
<p>
  [27] Correctly, in my view, the applications judge considered evidence other 
  than the wording of the Order-in-Council in order to discern the Crown's intention 
  as to entitlement. He reviewed the events in the historical record and made 
  two findings of fact that are central to his ultimate conclusion as to the Crown's 
  intention. </p>
<p>
  [28] First, the applications judge found that the evidence from 1875 until 1908 
  was &quot;inconclusive, frequently vague and often conflicting.&quot; Implicit 
  in this finding was the conclusion that the historical record for that period 
  did not demonstrate that the government intended to set apart the Agency One 
  Reserve for the benefit of the Rainy River Bands. </p>
<p>
  [29] I agree with this interpretation of the historical record. There is, as 
  the appellant points out, some evidence that would support a conclusion that 
  the Crown intended that both the Rainy River Bands and the Rainy Lake Bands 
  were to benefit from the reserve. The strongest evidence is the fact that, from 
  1875 to 1882, both the Rainy River Bands and the Rainy Lake Bands attended at 
  the reserve to receive their annual Treaty entitlements. It is worth noting, 
  however, that during this period, two other bands, the Eagle Lake and the Wabigoon 
  Bands also attended at the Agency One Reserve for the same purpose. Those bands 
  did not respond to the government's application to determine entitlement to 
  the reserve and apparently claim no interest.</p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant's argument is also bolstered by the fact that the two band 
  groups were administratively grouped by the Hudson Bay Company from 1821 to 
  1874. Similarly, after Treaty 3, they were included in the same administrative 
  agency by the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>
  [31] There is, however, other evidence relating to the period immediately after 
  the enactment of the Order-in-Council in 1875 that creates significant uncertainty 
  about which bands the Crown intended to be the beneficiaries of the Agency One 
  Reserve.</p>
<p>
  [32] As mentioned above, the 1875 Order-in-Council was provisional in nature 
  and the lands it referred to were subject to further survey. Soon after the 
  Order-in-Council, the Surveyor General of Canada, J.S. Dennis, was appointed 
  to finish the work selecting the reserves approved in the Order-in-Council. 
  The Surveyor at Fort Frances, E.C. Caddy, advised Dennis that the Indians at 
  Rainy River &quot;are dissatisfied with the quantity of land contained in Reserve 
  No's 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.&quot; Dennis set about to address those concerns. The 
  Rainy River Bands told Dennis that Dawson had misunderstood their reserve selection. 
  Dennis found their complaints to be warranted. </p>
<p>
  [33] On October 1, 1875, Dennis entered into an agreement with the Rainy River 
  Bands by which the reserves listed in Dawson's report were increased, in some 
  instances substantially. Significantly, Dennis also changed the nature of the 
  entitlement to some reserves. In Dawson's report, some reserves on the Rainy 
  River were described as being &quot;for the Indians generally.&quot; The entitlements 
  to these reserves were changed to be directed to particular Rainy River Bands 
  with only fishing to be open to the &quot;Indians generally.&quot; There was 
  no mention of the Agency One Reserve in any of Dennis' dealings with the Rainy 
  River Bands nor is the Agency One Reserve referred to in the agreement by which 
  Dennis settled the Rainy River Bands' complaints. In a subsequent speech, Dennis 
  said that the Rainy River Chiefs were perfectly satisfied with the new reserve 
  scheme.</p>
<p>
  [34] The fact that the Agency One Reserve is more accessible to the Rainy Lakes 
  Bands than to the Rainy River Bands lends further support to the notion that 
  the Rainy Lake Bands were the intended beneficiaries.</p>
<p>
  [35] I do not propose to review the remaining evidence relating to events for 
  the period from 1875 to 1908. Suffice it to say that I agree with the applications 
  judge that the evidence for this period is not conclusive as to what the Crown's 
  intention was with respect to the beneficial entitlement to the Agency One Reserve.</p>
<p>
  [36] This then brings me to the second critical finding of fact made by the 
  applications judge. He found as follows: &quot;It was only in 1908 that a distinct 
  unequivocal act takes place to clearly establish the intention of the Crown.&quot; 
  Indeed, the applications judge considered the evidence relating to the 1908 
  surrender as the best evidence available, showing that it was the Crown's intention 
  to set the Agency One Reserve apart only for the benefit of the Rainy Lake Bands.</p>
<p>
  [37] Around 1904, the Town of Fort Frances, which is located adjacent to the 
  Agency One Reserve, indicated its interest in creating a municipal park on the 
  reserve. To do so, it was necessary to obtain a surrender of interests from 
  the Indian bands with an entitlement to the reserve.</p>
<p>
  [38] The Department of Indian Affairs instructed the local Indian Agent, John 
  Wright, to obtain a surrender from those Indian bands &quot;for whom the reserve 
  had been set aside.&quot; Wright was an experienced Indian Agent, having worked 
  with the Department of Indian Affairs for 33 years. He had been the Indian Agent 
  at Fort Frances for eight years and would have been very familiar with the Rainy 
  Lake and Rainy River Bands, both of which fell within the administrative agency 
  for which he was responsible.</p>
<p>
  [39] Wright reported back to the Department that the Rainy Lake Bands were &quot;the 
  only bands for whom this reserve was set aside.&quot; As a result, he obtained 
  a surrender from the Rainy Lake Bands and forwarded it to Ottawa. The surrender 
  was accepted by Order-in-Council on November 14, 1908.</p>
<p>
  [40] There is no evidence of exactly what investigations Wright carried out 
  in reaching the conclusion that the Agency One Reserve was set apart only for 
  the Rainy Lake Bands. However, it is reasonable to infer that because he was 
  the Indian Agent in the region, he would have had regular contact with both 
  the Rainy Lake and the Rainy River Bands. There was no reason for Wright not 
  to obtain a surrender from all of the bands whom he concluded had an interest 
  in the Agency One Reserve. The surrender was obtained only 33 years after the 
  creation of the Agency One Reserve; if the Rainy River Bands considered themselves 
  entitled to a beneficial interest in the reserve, it seems likely that they 
  would have made their views known to him.</p>
<p>
  [41] Wright's conclusion that the Rainy Lake Bands were the only beneficiaries 
  of the reserve is supported by subsequent events. The fact of the 1908 surrender 
  and the subsequent creation of the municipal park on the Agency One Reserve 
  would have been a matter of public notice. The Rainy River Bands did not at 
  that time, or subsequently, object to the fact that they were not involved in 
  granting the surrender or that the Town was occupying a significant part of 
  the reserve. Moreover, the federal government obtained further surrenders from 
  the Rainy Lake Bands of additional Agency One Reserve lands in 1961 and in 1976. 
  Again, there was no objection from the Rainy River Bands.</p>
<p>
  [42] At no time from 1908 until the government instituted this proceeding in 
  2000 did the Rainy River Bands assert a claim or an interest to the Agency One 
  Reserve.</p>
<p>
  [43] I am satisfied that it was open to the applications judge to rely upon 
  the evidence relating to the events in 1908 and after in reaching the conclusion 
  that the Agency One Reserve was set aside only for the Rainy Lake Bands.</p>
<p>
  [44] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [45] The application seeking clarification as to entitlement to the Agency One 
  Reserve was instituted by the Attorney General of Canada. The applications judge 
  ordered that there be no costs awarded for the application, reasoning that &quot;an 
  award of costs is not appropriate when the question before the court was novel, 
  unsettled or where it involves the interpretation of a statute.&quot; In addition, 
  he found that his decision as to entitlement would assist the other outstanding 
  proceedings that were before the Superior Court and the Federal Court and that 
  had been stayed pending the outcome of the application. The applications judge 
  concluded that, in these circumstances, to penalize the Crown by making an order 
  for costs against the government would be unjust and unfair.</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant Rainy River Bands and the respondent Rainy Lake Bands (by 
  way of cross-appeal) both seek leave to appeal the order denying their costs 
  and, if leave is granted, appeal that order.</p>
<p>
  [47] I am satisfied that leave should be granted and the appeals with respect 
  to costs be allowed. In my view, the applications judge erred by failing to 
  attach sufficient weight to the relationship between the Crown and the bands 
  and to the circumstances that gave rise to the application.</p>
<p>
  [48] The federal Crown holds reserve lands as a fiduciary for the beneficiary 
  bands. This application was instituted by the Crown in order to clarify its 
  obligations in its fiduciary role. In some senses, the application was similar 
  to an executor of an estate seeking directions. Typically, in such a case, the 
  beneficiaries responding to such a proceeding would be indemnified for their 
  costs.</p>
<p>
  [49] Moreover, the need for the application resulted directly from the Crown's 
  failure in 1875 and after to clearly specify which bands were the intended beneficiaries 
  of the reserve grant. The Crown must have perceived there to be uncertainty 
  or it would not have found it necessary to bring the application.</p>
<p>
  [50] There is nothing in the conduct of either of the Rainy River or Rainy Lake 
  Bands that contributed to the uncertainty. Equally, there is nothing in the 
  conduct of the bands during the application that should disentitle them to their 
  costs.</p>
<p>
  [51] The Rainy Lake Bands were ultimately successful and should be entitled 
  to their costs on a substantial-indemnity basis.</p>
<p>
  [52] Given the uncertainty of the historical record, it was reasonable for the 
  Rainy River Bands to respond to the application and to take the positions that 
  they did before the applications judge. I note that the positions adopted by 
  the Rainy River Bands, while ultimately unsuccessful, were not unreasonable. 
  I am satisfied that it is fair that the Rainy River Bands should also be awarded 
  their legal costs on a substantial-indemnity basis for the proceeding below.</p>
<p>
  [53] This court is not in a position to fix the costs of the application. I 
  would direct that the issue of costs be remitted to the applications judge to 
  be fixed on a substantial-indemnity basis. The costs award should include only 
  those amounts that were reasonably incurred in responding to the Crown's application.</p>
<p>
  Costs of this Appeal</p>
<p>
  [54] The Rainy Lake Bands have been successful on the appeal. They seek an order 
  of costs against the unsuccessful appellant, the Rainy River Bands, with respect 
  to the entitlement issue. I am satisfied that costs should follow the event 
  and would award costs on a partial-indemnity scale. I would fix those costs 
  in the amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
<p>
  [55] In addition, the Rainy Lake Bands were successful on their cross-appeal 
  against the denial of costs of the application. The cross-appeal succeeded against 
  the Crown. I would order the Attorney General of Canada to pay those costs and 
  would fix them in the amount of $3,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
<p>
  [56] The Attorney General of Canada was successful in opposing the main appeal. 
  I am satisfied that the Rainy River Bands should make some payment towards the 
  Government's costs of the appeal and I would fix those costs in the amount of 
  $5,000, all inclusive. I would deny the Rainy River Bands' request for costs 
  against the Government in the main appeal. </p>
<p>
  [57] The Rainy River Bands were successful in that portion of their appeal relating 
  to the costs of the proceeding below. I would order the Government to pay those 
  costs and would fix them in the amount of $3,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
