<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Blair J. gave careful consideration to the Plan as a whole and to how the 
  specific provisions at issue on this appeal fit into the overall scheme of the 
  Plan. He recognized and applied the correct principles of law governing the 
  interpretation of Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act plans. His interpretation 
  of Arts. 5 and 8.09 was entirely reasonable. Moreover, we are persuaded by the 
  policy considerations he relied on, specifically, his observation that a single, 
  uniform standard for all claimants would foster a fair, equitable and efficient 
  administration of the Plan. </p>
<p>
  [2] The negotiating process that led to this Plan was complex and lengthy. It 
  was, significantly, a process that Blair J. monitored. His familiarity with 
  the Plan, coupled with his cogent analysis, is entitled to deference from this 
  court. (See Molson Canada v. O-I Canada Corp., [2003] O.J. No. 2328, at para. 
  15.) </p>
<p>
  [3] There is no evidentiary basis for the claim for rectification advanced for 
  the first time on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [4] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs from the Fund on a substantial 
  indemnity basis to the respondents represented by Mr. Strosberg and Ms. Joel, 
  and on a partial indemnity basis to the appellants and to the respondents represented 
  by Mr. Arenson, both to be fixed by the Referee.</p>
