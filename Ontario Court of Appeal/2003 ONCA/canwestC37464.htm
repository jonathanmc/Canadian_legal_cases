<p><strong>On appeal from the order of Justice Gordon P. Killeen of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated November 27, 2001.</strong></p>
<p><strong> ROSENBERG J.A.:</strong></p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from an order of Killeen J. staying an action concerning 
  the affairs of CanWest Broadcasting Ltd. (&quot;Broadcasting&quot;). The motions 
  judge held that the Ontario courts have no jurisdiction to try the action. He 
  held, in the alternative, that Manitoba was the convenient forum for trial of 
  the action. Finally, he set aside service of the statement of claim on the respondent 
  Israel Asper. In my view, the motions judge erred in holding that the Ontario 
  courts had no jurisdiction. However, I would not interfere with the motions 
  judge's conclusion concerning convenient forum and, accordingly, I would dismiss 
  the appeal with costs. In view of that conclusion, it is unnecessary to finally 
  determine the question of service upon Mr. Asper.</p><p>
  [2] The appellants applied to introduce fresh evidence at the hearing of the 
  appeal. The respondents opposed the admission of this evidence. In accordance 
  with its usual practice, the court reserved judgment on the admission of the 
  fresh evidence. On December 11, 2002, counsel for the respondents wrote to the 
  court to provide additional information concerning the proposed fresh evidence. 
  The respondents wish this court to consider this new information, should it 
  admit the fresh evidence. For the reasons that follow, I would not admit the 
  fresh evidence.</p>
<p> <strong>THE FACTS</strong></p>
<p><strong> Introduction</strong></p>
<p> [3] The relationships among the various parties to this lawsuit dates back 
  to 1973 when Mr. Asper led the efforts to establish Broadcasting, a Manitoba 
  corporation designed to operate an independent television station in Winnipeg 
  called CKND. The background facts concerning this relationship are set out in 
  the reasons of Morse J. in Morton v. Asper (1989), 62 Man. R. (2d) 1 (Q.B.) 
  when he dealt with earlier litigation between many of these same parties and 
  in the reasons of Killeen J., which are reported at (2001), 20 B.L.R. (3d) 289 
  (Ont. S.C.J.). I intend to give only a very brief summary of those earlier facts 
  since the case for or against the Ontario courts assuming jurisdiction in this 
  case must be found in the appellants' statement of claim and the evidence presented 
  on the motion. The corporate structure of the various parties is somewhat complex. 
  I have therefore attached as Appendix &quot;A&quot; three charts prepared by 
  the appellants.</p>
<p> <strong>The Background Facts</strong></p>
<p>
  [4] In 1973, the individual parties, the respondent Asper, and the appellants 
  Morton and Epstein, along with two others, became the founding shareholders 
  of Broadcasting. In 1974, Broadcasting obtained its television licence from 
  the Canadian Radio and Television Commission and CKND went on the air. As mentioned, 
  Broadcasting is a Manitoba corporation. </p><p>
  [5] Around the same time that Broadcasting was becoming established, Global 
  Television Network Inc. (&quot;Global Television&quot;)was running into financial 
  difficulties and Mr. Epstein, who resides in Ontario, convinced Mr. Asper and 
  Mr. Morton, who resided in Winnipeg, to invest in Global Television. The Winnipeg 
  group invested in Global Television through Global Ventures Western Limited 
  (&quot;Ventures&quot;). Mr. Epstein also invested, as did another company. In 
  1977, this other company triggered a buy-sell agreement that resulted in Ventures 
  owning a majority of the voting shares of Global Television. After several transactions, 
  Ventures ended up with control of 100% of Global Television shares. The individual 
  parties held their stakes in Global Television through Ventures. Mr. Morton 
  moved to Toronto and became president of Global Television. A Unanimous Shareholders 
  Agreement governed the relationship between the parties. This agreement was 
  governed by the laws of Manitoba. During this period, Morton and Epstein focused 
  most of their attention on Global Television.</p><p>
  [6] By the mid-1980's, there was growing friction between Asper and the Ontario 
  parties Epstein and Morton that led to the Manitoba litigation presided over 
  by Morse J. This litigation was initiated by Morton and Epstein in Manitoba 
  and sought to implement the terms of a 1985 agreement. Morse J. concluded that 
  the two groups of shareholders were hopelessly deadlocked over the affairs of 
  Ventures and Global Television. He therefore directed an auction that resulted 
  in Morton and Epstein and their companies selling their interest in Global Television 
  to CanWest Global Communications Corp. (&quot;CanWest Global&quot;), a company 
  controlled by Mr. Asper. While this took Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein out of Ventures 
  and Global Television, they remained shareholders in Broadcasting.</p>
<p> <strong>Broadcasting</strong></p>
<p>
  [7] While Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein had been engaged in Global Television, 
  Broadcasting had continued to expand. It continued to operate its Manitoba television 
  station (CKND) and it acquired three other stations in Western Canada including 
  CKVU in Vancouver. Broadcasting did not operate any stations in Ontario. Broadcasting's 
  lands and buildings are owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, CanWest Properties 
  Ltd., a Manitoba corporation. Broadcasting's television licences are held by 
  CanWest Television Inc. (CTI), a federal corporation and wholly owned subsidiary 
  of Broadcasting.</p>
<p> [8] Once divested of their direct connection with Global Television as a result 
  of the 1989 auction, Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein now took a greater interest 
  in Broadcasting. Through their company, the appellant Incorporated Broadcasters 
  Limited (IBL), Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein held 28.96% of the shares of Broadcasting. 
  IBL is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Toronto. As well, 
  Mr. Epstein personally held .36% of the shares of Broadcasting. Mr. Morton and 
  Mr. Epstein were directors of Broadcasting and CTI. The balance of Broadcasting 
  shares were held by Global Television, a federally incorporated corporation 
  with its registered office in Ontario<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. Global Television 
  is, in effect, a wholly owned subsidiary of CanWest Global, a federally incorporated 
  corporation with its registered office in Winnipeg, which is in turn controlled 
  by Mr. Asper.</p>
<p>
  [9] Since the 1989 auction, Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein have voiced concerns 
  about the operations of Broadcasting. Among other things they allege that Asper 
  has used his position as majority shareholder to favour his corporations, to 
  squeeze Morton and Epstein out of Broadcasting's operations and reduce their 
  management fees. The appellant MAE Management Corporation, an Ontario corporation 
  with its registered office in Toronto was the vehicle used by Epstein and Morton 
  to collect their management fees for services provided to Global Television 
  and Broadcasting. I will outline the appellants' concerns in greater detail 
  below when I review the allegations in the statement of claim. </p><p>
  [10] One of the proposals made by Mr. Asper for alleviating the friction was 
  to have Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein sell their holdings in Broadcasting and become 
  shareholders of CanWest Global. In that way, they too would benefit from the 
  way that CanWest Global exercised its control over Broadcasting. Mr. Morton 
  and Mr. Epstein took some steps in that direction and in December 1996 prepared 
  an offer to sell their shares in Broadcasting. Nothing came of this offer, but 
  the friction continued. In January 2000, Broadcasting was considering a merger 
  or amalgamation with a subsidiary of CanWest Global.</p>
<p> <strong>The Lawsuit</strong></p>
<p>
  [11] On March 5, 2001, the appellants launched their lawsuit. The plaintiffs 
  are IBL, Morton, Epstein and MAE. The defendants are Asper, CanWest Global, 
  Global Television and the two wholly owned subsidiaries of Global Television 
  - CanWest Global-Broadcasting Inc. and Global Communications Limited - which 
  as indicated, are both federal corporations. </p><p>
  [12] On March 15, 2001, CanWest Global advised the members of Broadcasting's 
  Board of an amalgamation proposal. This amalgamation was effected on May 1, 
  2001 and a new Manitoba corporation, CanWest Broadcasting (2001) Ltd., was created. 
  It is 100% owned by Global Television. CTI, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary 
  of Broadcasting, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of CanWest (2001). </p>
<p> [13] As a result of the amalgamation, the CRTC required Broadcasting to divest 
  itself of its Vancouver station, CKVU, because Global Television already owned 
  a Vancouver station. Pending the sale, a trustee controlled CKVU. IBL and Mr. 
  Epstein were issued special shares in CanWest Global. Mr. Morton and Mr. Epstein 
  voted against the amalgamation but did not exercise the right of dissent to 
  the amalgamation provided for in the Manitoba Corporations Act, R.S.M. 1987, 
  c. C-225. </p>
<p> [14] Following the amalgamation, the appellants amended their statement of 
  claim. In the amended statement of claim, the appellants seek declarations, 
  an accounting, damages and other relief. The appellants seek a declaration that: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CanWest Global and its affiliates have contravened the Canada Business Corporations 
    Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 by carrying on or conducting their affairs, or by 
    permitting their directors to exercise powers in such a manner as to effect 
    a result that has been oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly 
    disregards the interests of IBL and Epstein as minority shareholders of Broadcasting 
    and the interests of Epstein and Morton as directors and officers of Broadcasting 
    and its subsidiaries;</li>
  <li>CanWest Global and its affiliates have contravened the CBCA by acting or 
    permitting their directors to improperly favour the interests of Asper, CanWest 
    Global and its affiliates over the interests of Broadcasting and its subsidiaries, 
    and IBL and Epstein;</li>
  <li>Asper, CanWest Global and its affiliates owe fiduciary duties to Epstein 
    and Morton regarding the conduct of the business or affairs of Broadcasting 
    and its subsidiaries, that they have breached those fiduciary duties and an 
    accounting by CanWest Global and its affiliates of the profits obtained thereby; 
  </li>
  <li> the defendants have diverted corporate opportunities from Broadcasting 
    and that in respect of the business or affairs of Broadcasting and its subsidiaries, 
    the defendants wrongfully terminated beneficial agreements and replaced them 
    with non-arm's length contracts with CanWest Global and its affiliates that 
    were not reasonable and fair for Broadcasting; and </li>
  <li>the May 2001 amalgamation was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to and 
    unfairly disregards the interests of IBL and Epstein and an order that CanWest 
    Global purchase the special shares held by Epstein and IBL. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [15] The appellants also seek an accounting of the profits from these actions 
  and damages of $355 million from CanWest Global for breach of contracts made 
  with CanWest Global for management services provided to Broadcasting and its 
  subsidiaries and for diversion of certain of Broadcasting's profits. IBL and 
  Epstein also seek an order requiring CanWest Global to direct Broadcasting to 
  declare and pay dividends to its shareholders and an order requiring CanWest 
  Global to purchase the shares of IBL and Epstein in Broadcasting. </p><p>
  [16] The appellants allege that CanWest Global has not adhered to the fiduciary 
  standards of conduct owed to Mr. Epstein and Mr. Morton, and has managed the 
  affairs of Broadcasting and its subsidiaries in a manner that is oppressive 
  or is unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregards the interests of Mr. Epstein 
  and IBL as security holders, directors and officers of Broadcasting. The conduct 
  complained of includes the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) failing or refusing to pay dividends to Broadcasting's 
  shareholders;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) removing Epstein and Morton from management of Broadcasting 
  and replacing them with CanWest Global or Global Television management; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) removing any independent station identification 
  from Broadcasting's televisions stations and replacing it with identification 
  as a member of the Global Television Network;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) diverting profits from Broadcasting through numerous 
  non-arm's length contracts with CanWest Global and its affiliates so that Broadcasting 
  and its subsidiaries pay excessive fees;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) pursuing corporate opportunities through CanWest 
  Global and its affiliates rather than through Broadcasting or its subsidiaries;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) compelling Broadcasting's stations to acquire programming 
  at excessive rates through Global Television;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) purchasing through CanWest Global the Western International 
  Communications Ltd. [WIC] television stations in Vancouver and elsewhere that 
  are in direct competition with Broadcasting's Vancouver station CKVU-TV;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) breaching the duty of good faith performance of 
  contractual and other duties owed to Broadcasting and its minority shareholders; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) placing Broadcasting in the position where it was 
  compelled to sell CKVU-TV in circumstances where CanWest Global has reduced 
  the ability of CKVU-TV to compete with CanWest Global's newly-acquired stations.</p>
<p>
  [17] After setting out this overview of the complaints, the appellants (in almost 
  150 paragraphs) set out in detail the factual basis for these allegations. These 
  allegations are founded on the conduct of Broadcasting's affairs culminating 
  in the amalgamation. A few examples will suffice. I have set out in Appendix 
  &quot;B&quot; other parts of the amended statement of claim that show the various 
  courses of action.</p>
<p class="indent"> 44. Notwithstanding the 1982 management agreement and 
  their partnership in respect of the business or affairs of Broadcasting, Asper 
  has not permitted Epstein and Morton to provide any management services to Broadcasting. 
  Since 1990, Epstein and Morton have not received, directly or indirectly, any 
  distribution of a share of the profits of Broadcasting in the form of management 
  fees from Broadcasting since the unilateral termination by Asper and/or CanWest 
  Global of the 1982 management agreement</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 68. CanWest Global imposed unilaterally the change 
  in allocating programming costs to Broadcasting and its subsidiaries in breach 
  of the fiduciary obligations owed by CanWest Global to them and in breach of 
  the express or implied term of the management agreements by CanWest Global and/or 
  any of its subsidiaries to act in the best interests of Broadcasting and its 
  subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 81. The proposed financial arrangement was patently 
  unfair to Broadcasting. As an example of the unfairness of the proposed formula, 
  unlike the Global Television stations in Ontario whose signals reached virtually 
  all of the English speaking population of that province, the Broadcasting station 
  CKVU-TV (Vancouver) reached only a portion of the English speaking population 
  of British Columbia. Further, the WIC station in Edmonton, Alberta provided 
  its signal to a significant English speaking population in the interior of British 
  Columbia. Accordingly, the proposed formula was based upon statistics that were 
  unrelated to the number of people who actually received the signals of the Global 
  Television and Broadcasting stations affected by the formula.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 106. Through these non-arm's length transactions, CanWest 
  Global has systematically withdrawn funds from Broadcasting. During the same 
  period, CanWest Global has refused to pay any dividends to its minority shareholders, 
  to pay management fees to them or provide any other form of compensation to 
  or for the benefit of the minority shareholders.</p>
<p class="indent"> 107. In purpose and effect, CanWest Global has used 
  these related party transactions to withdraw compensation from Broadcasting 
  in a manner that is oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly 
  disregards the interests of Broadcasting's minority shareholders.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 123. Despite the fact that Broadcasting had the strategic 
  position in the marketplace and, particularly in 1996, that Broadcasting had 
  the available funding to exploit these important business opportunities, Asper, 
  CanWest Global and Global Television directed their nominees on Broadcasting's 
  board of directors to cause Broadcasting not to pursue these opportunities. 
  They instructed the nominees instead to permit Global Television to apply for 
  these Alberta licences without their intervention or opposition. In this way, 
  Asper, CanWest Global and Global Television breached their fiduciary duties 
  to Broadcasting, IBL, Epstein and Morton.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 145. The purpose and the effect of the refusal by Asper, 
  CanWest Global and Global Television to pay dividends to Broadcasting's shareholders 
  have been to oppress, unfairly prejudice and unfairly disregard the interests 
  of Broadcasting's minority shareholders. Coupled with CanWest Global's systematic 
  withdrawal of funds from Broadcasting through the complex series of non-arm's 
  length, related party management, programming, sales and other contracts, the 
  net effect of Broadcasting's refusal to pay dividends is to divert a significant 
  portion of Broadcasting's corporate profits to or for the benefit of CanWest 
  Global.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 160. Broadcasting is a closely-held corporation. IBL 
  and Epstein are the only minority shareholders of Broadcasting whose rights 
  were to be affected by the proposed amalgamation. Moreover, Broadcasting did 
  not benefit from the amalgamation.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 184. The refusal to declare dividends, the instructions 
  given by Asper and CanWest Global and the amalgamation were high-handed, outrageous, 
  mean-spirited, malevolent, oppressive, contumelious and unfairly prejudicial 
  to and unfairly disregarded the interests of IBL and Epstein. In failing to 
  cause the dividends to be paid and in orchestrating the amalgamation, Asper 
  breached his fiduciary duty to Morton and Epstein and their company IBL.</p>
<p class="indent"> [emphasis added].</p>
<p> <strong>THE PROPOSED FRESH EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>
  [18] As a result of the amalgamation, the appellants received special shares 
  in CanWest Global. The evidence before the motions judge was that those special 
  shares would be redeemed by October 31, 2002, one year following the closing 
  of the sale of CKVU to CHUM Limited. The appellants' proposed fresh evidence 
  was that CanWest Global had not redeemed the special shares by the time of the 
  hearing of the appeal on November 7, 2002. The further evidence filed by the 
  respondents, following the argument of this appeal, is that on December 10, 
  2002, the Directors of CanWest Global resolved to redeem the appellants' special 
  shares. This redemption was deemed to have taken place on December 18, 2002 
  with deposits into separate accounts established for IBL and for Mr. Epstein. 
  IBL has tendered its shares and received the money. As of December 19, 2002, 
  Mr. Epstein has not yet tendered his shares and so the money remained in the 
  special account. As I have indicated, the respondents wish the court to consider 
  this additional information, should it admit the appellant's fresh evidence.</p>
<p> <strong>THE REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</strong></p>
<p><strong> Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>
  [19] The motions judge held that Ontario courts could only have jurisdiction 
  to hear the claims if there is a real and substantial connection between the 
  subject matter of the claims and Ontario. He held that there is no such connection. 
  His principal reason for that conclusion was that the claims are in the nature 
  of an oppression action in respect of the affairs of Broadcasting, a Manitoba 
  corporation. The various decisions about which the appellants complain concern 
  decisions that were for the most part made in Manitoba by Broadcasting's board 
  of directors. </p><p>
  [20] The motions judge rejected the appellants' position that Ontario courts 
  had jurisdiction under s. 241 of the CBCA to grant an oppression remedy even 
  though CanWest Global and Global Television are federal corporations, the latter 
  having its registered office in Ontario. He held that although s. 241 allows 
  a complainant to apply to a &quot;court&quot;, which is defined as any provincial 
  superior court, s. 241 does not itself confer subject-matter jurisdiction.</p><p>
  [21] The motions judge also held that the oppression remedy under s. 241 of 
  the CBCA was not available to the appellants. He held that the complainant asserting 
  the claim must be a shareholder of a CBCA corporation or the activities complained 
  of must be in respect of the business and affairs of a CBCA corporation. That 
  was not the case in respect of most of the claims since &quot;at any relevant 
  time&quot; the appellants were only shareholders of Broadcasting, a Manitoba 
  corporation. </p><p>
  [22] In addition to Manitoba having &quot;the closest and most natural connection 
  to the conduct complained of and the expectation of the parties that their disputes 
  would be governed by Manitoba law&quot;, the motions judge held that only the 
  Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction, under the Manitoba Corporations 
  Act, to deal with the appellants' claims of oppression. He held that while there 
  were &quot;points of connection&quot; between Ontario and the appellants' action 
  because of CanWest Global's and Global Television's activities in Ontario, they 
  were &quot;peripheral and tangential to the real substance of the dispute&quot;.</p><p>
  [23] The motions judge also saw this lawsuit as very much an extension of the 
  earlier Manitoba litigation that had ended in the 1989 auction whereby Asper 
  gained control of Global Television.</p><p>
  [24] Since the action had no real and substantial connection with Ontario and 
  the CBCA did not confer jurisdiction, the Ontario courts had no jurisdiction 
  and the action should be stayed.</p>
<p> <strong>Convenient Forum</strong></p>
<p>
  [25] Alternatively, the motions judge held that Ontario is not the convenient 
  forum for the trial of this case. He set out the various factors courts have 
  looked to in determining convenient forum and applied the facts to those factors. 
  An important factor, as in his consideration of jurisdiction, was that the subject 
  matter of the dispute concerned the conduct of a Manitoba corporation. Another 
  important factor was that the conduct complained of took place in Manitoba or 
  in the western provinces where Broadcasting had its various television stations. 
  The motions judge also looked at the status of the various corporations involved 
  and where most of the evidence and the witnesses were situated. He therefore 
  concluded that the respondents had shown that Manitoba was clearly the convenient 
  forum.</p>
<p> <strong>Service ex juris</strong></p>
<p>
  [26] Mr. Asper sought to set aside service of the statement of claim and amended 
  statement of claim on the basis that the claims did not come within rule 17.02 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Ontario was not a convenient forum. Rule 
  17.02 provides that a party may, without a court order, be served outside Ontario 
  if the claim falls within certain categories. The motions judge held that the 
  oppression claim asserted by the appellants does not fall within any of those 
  categories. He also held that Asper was not a resident of Ontario in any meaningful 
  sense. Further, Ontario was clearly not the convenient forum. He therefore set 
  aside service of the statement of claim.</p>
<p> <strong>ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p><strong> Fresh Evidence</strong></p>
<p>
  [27] As I have indicated, the proposed fresh evidence concerns events following 
  the amalgamation and the appellants' allegation that CanWest Global did not 
  redeem the special shares on October 31, 2002, contrary to the representations 
  that had been made to the motions judge. In my view, this issue played no part 
  in the reasoning of the motions judge and I do not see its relevance to the 
  issues on the appeal. For similar reasons, I would not admit the fresh evidence 
  tendered by the respondents that CanWest Global has in fact now taken steps 
  to redeem the shares. Even if, as a result, the appellants Epstein and IBL are 
  no longer shareholders of any CBCA corporation and Morton is no longer a beneficial 
  owner of shares, they would still have standing as complainants to seek an oppression 
  remedy under s. 241, since s. 238 of the Act defines &quot;complainant&quot; 
  to include a former director, officer, registered holder or beneficial owner 
  of securities of a CBCA corporation or any of its affiliates.</p><p>
  [28] I would therefore dismiss the application to admit fresh evidence.</p>
<p> <strong>Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p> [29] In my view, the motions judge erred in applying the real and substantial 
  connection test to determine jurisdiction in this case, except jurisdiction 
  over Mr. Asper. The real and substantial connection test applies where a court 
  seeks to assume jurisdiction over defendants that have no presence in the jurisdiction. 
  The real and substantial connection test serves to extend jurisdiction of the 
  domestic courts over out-of-province defendants. It is not a pre-requisite for 
  the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants, even out-of-province defendants, 
  that may be present in the jurisdiction. That test is concerned with what Sharpe 
  J.A. referred to in Muscutt v. Courcelles (2002), 213 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont. 
  C.A.) as &quot;assumed jurisdiction&quot; not &quot;presence-based jurisdiction&quot;. 
  In Muscutt, Sharpe J.A. speaking for the court at para. 19 explained that there 
  are &quot;three ways in which jurisdiction may be asserted against an out-of-province 
  defendant: (1) presence-based jurisdiction; (2) consent-based jurisdiction; 
  and (3) assumed jurisdiction. Presence-based jurisdiction permits jurisdiction 
  over an extra-provincial defendant who is physically present within the territory 
  of the court.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [30] Earlier decisions of the Supreme Court concerning jurisdiction also indicate 
  that the real and substantial connection test is limited to cases where the 
  courts seek to assert jurisdiction over out-of-province defendants. In Morguard 
  Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077 the court considered when 
  a court in one province should recognize the judgment of another province. The 
  court held that provinces should recognize each other's judgments when it was 
  appropriate for the court that gave the judgment to have assumed jurisdiction. 
  At pages 1103-4 La Forest J. explained the traditional limits of jurisdiction. 
  As he said, the question of appropriate jurisdiction &quot;poses no difficulty 
  where the court has acted on the basis of some ground traditionally accepted 
  by courts as permitting the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments 
  - in the case of judgments in personam where the defendant was within the jurisdiction 
  at the time of the action or when he submitted to its judgment whether by agreement 
  or attornment&quot;. Where the defendant is within the jurisdiction, the court 
  has jurisdiction over the person. The difficulty arises where the defendant 
  is outside the jurisdiction of the court. The question then is to what extent 
  a court of one province may properly exercise jurisdiction over a defendant 
  in another province?&quot; In Morguard, La Forest J. answered that question 
  by adopting the real and substantial test for assuming jurisdiction over extra-provincial 
  defendants. </p><p>
  [31] As I will explain below, the only person who may not have a presence in 
  Ontario for the purposes of jurisdiction is Mr. Asper. It is only with respect 
  to him that the real and substantial connection test applies. But, as I will 
  explain, the test is easily satisfied in this case. Before turning to that part 
  of the analysis I need to deal with one argument made by the respondents. </p><p>
  [32] The respondents contend that irrespective of whether the defendant is present 
  in the jurisdiction, as a matter of constitutional law, there must be a real 
  and substantial connection between the subject matter of the litigation and 
  the province. In Morguard, La Forest J. held at p. 1109 that, &quot;[t]he private 
  international law rule requiring substantial connection with the jurisdiction 
  where the action took place is supported by the constitutional restriction of 
  legislative power 'in the province'.&quot; At p. 1109, he quoted with approval 
  a comment by Professor Hogg on the earlier decision in Moran v. Pyle National 
  (Canada) Ltd., [1975] 1 S.C.R. 393, which strongly suggests that the constitutional 
  issue is relevant only where the courts seeks to assert jurisdiction over out-of-province 
  defendants:</p>
<p class="indent"> In Moran v. Pyle, Dickson J. emphasized that the &quot;sole 
  issue&quot; was whether Saskatchewan's rules regarding jurisdiction based on 
  service ex juris had been complied with. He did not consider whether there were 
  constitutional limits on the jurisdiction which could be conferred by the Saskatchewan 
  Legislature on the Saskatchewan courts. But the rule which he announced could 
  serve satisfactorily as a statement of the constitutional limits of provincial-court 
  jurisdiction over defendants outside the province, requiring as it does a substantial 
  connection between the defendant and the forum province of a kind which makes 
  it reasonable to infer that the defendant has voluntarily submitted himself 
  to the risk of litigation in the courts of the forum province&quot; [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [33] There is no constitutional impediment to a court asserting jurisdiction 
  over a person having a presence in the province. </p><p>
  [34] The respondents also relied on the following passage from Professor Castel's 
  treatise, Canadian Conflict of Laws, 4th ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1997), 
  at p. 54:</p>
<p class="indent"> In Hunt v. T. &amp; N. plc, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  gave constitutional status to the principles expounded in Morguard. Therefore, 
  the requirement of &quot;a real and substantial connection&quot; has become 
  the absolute constitutional limit on the power of each province to confer judicial 
  jurisdiction on its courts. Whenever a defendant is served in juris or ex juris 
  with the process of a court of a Canadian province, he or she may challenge 
  the proceeding on constitutional grounds if the forum province lacks a real 
  and substantial connection with the subject matter of the proceeding or the 
  defendant. The requirement of a real and substantial connection places a limit 
  on the provincial rules of procedure since the provincial power to legislate 
  with respect to service in juris or ex juris requires some serious contacts 
  with the province [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [35] But, it seems to me that in the part of the passage that I have emphasized, 
  Professor Castel was careful to distinguish between defendants in the province 
  and extra-provincial defendants since he refers to a need for a connection to 
  the subject matter of the proceeding &quot;or the defendant&quot;. Further, 
  earlier in his text at p. 53, Professor Castel indicates that the discussion 
  concerns the &quot;constitutional limits to the exercise of jurisdiction against 
  persons outside the province&quot;.</p><p>
  [36] As I have said, it is my view that, with the exception of Mr. Asper, all 
  of the defendants have a presence in Ontario that makes them subject to the 
  jurisdiction of the Ontario courts. CanWest Global is a federally incorporated 
  corporation with its registered office in Winnipeg. However, it carries on business 
  in Ontario in television, newspapers, and radio, specialty cable channels and 
  Internet websites. By choosing to carry on business in Ontario, CanWest Global 
  is subject to the jurisdiction of Ontario courts. See Hunt v. T&amp;N PLC, [1993] 
  4 S.C.R. 289 at 323. The defendants Global Television and Global Communications 
  Limited are federally incorporated corporations with registered offices in Ontario 
  carrying on business in Ontario. By virtue of their place of registered office 
  and where they carry on business they are resident in Ontario and therefore 
  subject to the jurisdiction of the Ontario courts. See K.P. McGuinness, The 
  Law and Practice of Canadian Business Corporations (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) 
  at pp. 266-69. The defendant CanVideo Television Sales (1983) Limited was originally 
  an Ontario corporation and is now a federally incorporated corporation and carries 
  on business from offices in Toronto and is subject to the jurisdiction of the 
  Ontario courts. The defendant CanWest Global Broadcasting Inc. is a federal 
  corporation with its registered office in Quebec but with offices in Toronto. 
  It too is subject to the jurisdiction of Ontario courts.</p><p>
  [37] This leaves only Mr. Asper. Mr. Asper resides in Manitoba. For the purposes 
  of this discussion I will assume that he was properly served in Ontario. Whether 
  served in or out of Ontario, since he is an extra-provincial defendant, Ontario 
  courts only have jurisdiction over him if the real and substantial connection 
  test is met.</p><p>
  [38] I would make two preliminary comments about the application of that test. 
  First, &quot;the real and substantial connection test requires only a real and 
  substantial connection, not the most real and substantial connection&quot; (Muscutt 
  at para. 44). Second, in my view, the dominant consideration in applying that 
  test is that the other defendants are present in Ontario and, subject to the 
  convenient forum argument, their trial will take place here. Goudge J.A. discussed 
  the proper approach in such a case in McNichol Estate v. Woldnik (2001), 13 
  C.P.C. (5th) 61 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 13 where he explained that if it serves 
  the requirements of order and fairness to try the foreign claim together with 
  the claims that are clearly rooted in Ontario, the foreign claim meets the real 
  and substantial connection test. This is so even if the foreign claim would 
  fail the test if it were constituted as a separate action. Goudge J.A. states: 
  &quot;[t]his approach goes beyond showing that the foreign defendant is a proper 
  party to the litigation. It rests on those values, namely order and fairness, 
  that properly inform the real and substantial connection test and allows the 
  court the flexibility to balance the globalization of litigation against the 
  problems for a defendant who is sued in a foreign jurisdiction&quot; [at para. 
  13]. Mr. Asper is the operating mind behind the various CanWest and Global corporations. 
  It would make little sense to try the claims against him separately. </p><p>
  [39] With that background I will now apply the real and substantial connection 
  test to Mr. Asper. In Muscutt, Sharpe J.A. set out a number of factors for the 
  courts to consider in applying the real and substantial connection test. I will 
  briefly discuss each of them as they apply to Mr. Asper:</p><p>
  (1) The connection between the forum and the plaintiff's claim.</p><p>
  [40] As Sharpe J.A. points out at para. 77, &quot;[t]he forum has an interest 
  in protecting the legal rights of its residents and affording injured plaintiffs 
  generous access for litigating claims against tortfeasors&quot;. This is not 
  a tort claim but similar considerations apply. The appellants are all residents 
  of Ontario and claim to have been injured by the conduct of the various defendants. 
  They rely upon the statutory cause of action in s. 241 of the CBCA that gives 
  a complainant access to the courts for a remedy against oppressive conduct by 
  a CBCA corporation or its affiliates. Section 2 of that Act defines &quot;court&quot; 
  to include the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario.</p><p>
  (2) The connection between the forum and the defendant.</p><p>
  [41] At para. 82 of Muscutt, Sharpe J.A. held that if the defendant &quot;has 
  done anything within the jurisdiction that bears upon the claim advanced by 
  the plaintiff, the case for assuming jurisdiction is strengthened&quot;. Mr. 
  Asper carries on business through various corporations, many of which carry 
  on business in Ontario. The trial judge found that he comes to Ontario six times 
  a year for business purposes. The Broadcasting board of directors has met in 
  Ontario in the past. Asper thus has some connection with Ontario as it bears 
  upon the appellants' claim.</p><p>
  (3) Unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction.</p><p>
  [42] It is not apparent that there would be any unfairness to Asper if the Ontario 
  courts were to assume jurisdiction. He is engaged in an activity with Canada-wide 
  connections. It cannot be totally unexpected that he might find himself in an 
  Ontario court because of those activities.</p><p>
  (4) Unfairness to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction.</p><p>
  [43] If jurisdiction were refused, the appellants would be required to litigate 
  in Manitoba. Given that Broadcasting is a Manitoba corporation and that they 
  have litigated in Manitoba before, there is no apparent unfairness in refusing 
  to assume jurisdiction.</p><p>
  (5) The involvement of other parties to the suit.</p><p>
  [44] I have already discussed this factor above. As indicated, it is a very 
  important consideration favouring a finding of a real and substantial connection 
  in this case.</p><p>
  (6) The court's willingness to recognize and enforce an extraprovincial judgment 
  rendered on the same jurisdictional basis.</p>
<p> [45] The appellants seek a remedy under the CBCA, a federal statute, for oppression 
  allegedly caused by federal corporations and their affiliates at the direction 
  of Mr. Asper. I think it appropriate that Ontario courts recognize and enforce 
  judgments from the other provinces rendered on the same jurisdictional basis 
  as in this case. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p>
  (7) Whether the case is interprovincial or international in nature.</p><p>
  [46] As Sharpe J.A. pointed out in Muscutt, at para. 95, &quot;the assumption 
  of jurisdiction is more easily justified in interprovincial cases than in international 
  cases&quot;. Since this is an interprovincial case, this factor also favours 
  the finding of a real and substantial connection.</p><p>
  (8) Comity and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing 
  elsewhere.</p><p>
  [47] As this is an interprovincial case, this factor has no application: Muscutt 
  at para. 102.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion on real and substantial connection as applied to Mr. Asper</strong></p>
<p>
  [48] As held in Muscutt, no single factor is determinative. Rather, &quot;all 
  relevant factors should be considered and weighed together&quot; (at para. 76). 
  In my view, the various factors, but particularly the involvement of other parties 
  to the lawsuit and his business connections to Ontario, favour assuming jurisdiction 
  over Mr. Asper, the extraprovincial defendant.</p>
<p> <strong>Convenient Forum</strong></p>
<p>
  [49] As it was put by Arbour J.A. in Frymer v. Brettschneider (1994), 19 O.R. 
  (3d) 60 (C.A.) at 79, when an issue of convenient forum is raised, the &quot;choice 
  of the appropriate forum is designed to ensure that the action is tried in the 
  jurisdiction that has the closest connection with the action and the parties&quot;. 
  In this case, the appellants have chosen Ontario. The new corporation Broadcasting 
  (2001) and the respondent CanWest Global have brought an application in the 
  Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench for declarations to determine the rights of 
  the appellants to any relief in respect of the conduct of the affairs of Broadcasting. 
  That application has been held in abeyance pending this appeal.</p><p>
  [50] Before I apply the various factors identified in the cases for determining 
  convenient forum, I think it is necessary to characterize the nature of the 
  appellants' lawsuit. The motions judge characterized the lawsuit as &quot;an 
  oppression action relating to the affairs of Broadcasting&quot;. He elaborated 
  on that theme, for example, as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> The real source of the alleged oppression must, if 
  anywhere, be within the conduct of affairs in Broadcasting. The allegations 
  of oppression are inescapably &quot;in respect of&quot; Broadcasting [at para. 
  76].</p>
<p class="indent">and </p>
<p class="indent">While the plaintiffs have artfully pleaded allegations 
  of corporate wrongdoing on the part of CanWest Global and its group of other 
  corporations as federal companies, at bottom and in substance, those complaints 
  are simply allegations of wrongful conduct by Broadcastings' Board or management 
  such as (1) a failure to pay dividends, (2) a failure to involve Morton and 
  Epstein in Broadcasting's management, (3) the application for the Victoria licence 
  and, ultimately, (4) the Amalgamation in 2001 [at para 80].</p>
<p>
  [51] The motions judge concluded that since the lawsuit was about the internal 
  management of Broadcasting, any questions about that management should be governed 
  by the Manitoba Corporations Act in Manitoba by the Manitoba Court of Queen's 
  Bench. He pointed out that only the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench could give 
  an oppression remedy under the Manitoba Corporations Act. He also reviewed the 
  history of the relationship between the parties and found that their reasonable 
  expectations were that any litigation about Broadcasting would be conducted 
  in Manitoba in accordance with the law of that province.</p><p>
  [52] The motions judge concluded that the appellants could not obtain the remedies 
  they seek under the CBCA. He held that s. 241 of that Act &quot;cannot reasonably 
  be construed to permit the prosecution of an oppression claim by a complainant 
  in his capacity as a shareholder of a non-CBCA corporation brought in respect 
  of the business and affairs of that non-CBCA corporation merely because that 
  non-CBCA corporation happens to be affiliated with a CBCA corporation&quot; 
  [at para. 123].</p><p>
  [53] If the availability of the s. 241 remedy was before the motions judge and 
  if he was correct in his conclusion that the remedy was not available to these 
  appellants then his conclusion on convenient forum is unassailable. In fact, 
  if he is correct, it is not a question of choosing the forum with the closest 
  connection to the action and the parties, since only Manitoba is the appropriate 
  forum. My concern with the motion judge's approach is that the availability 
  of the s. 241 remedy was probably not before him. In effect, it seems to me 
  that the motions judge turned the jurisdiction/convenient forum motion into 
  a motion under Rule 20 for summary judgment or under Rule 21 to strike out the 
  statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.</p>
<p> [54] The appellants do not seek an oppression remedy under the Manitoba Corporations 
  Act. They seek remedies under the CBCA. In my view, the appellants are entitled 
  to have the jurisdiction and convenient forum issues determined on that basis. 
  The motions judge may be right in his interpretation of the Manitoba and federal 
  legislation, in which case the appellants' action will fail, but it seems to 
  me that is a question to be determined at another time either under a Rule 20 
  or 21<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> motion or at trial. The merits of the claim should 
  not, in my view, be decided at this preliminary stage. </p>
<p>
  [55] That is not to say that the motions judge's characterization of the nature 
  of this action is immaterial. To the contrary, I accept that this lawsuit is 
  about the internal management of Broadcasting. There is really no other way 
  to read the amended statement of claim. It is all about how Mr. Asper and his 
  corporations used their control of Broadcasting's board of directors and management 
  to oppress the appellants as minority shareholders. The appellants allege, however, 
  that in so managing Broadcasting the various CBCA corporations have violated 
  that Act. Further, the appellants allege that many of those violations took 
  place in Ontario. The case ought to be approached on that basis.</p>
<p> [56] The appellants submit that they are entitled to a remedy under the CBCA 
  on the following theory. Section 241(2) provides that on an application by a 
  &quot;complainant&quot;, if the court is satisfied that &quot;in respect of 
  a corporation or any of its affiliates&quot; that (for example) any act or omission 
  of the corporation or any of its affiliates effects a result that is oppressive 
  or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregards the interests of any security 
  holder or director, the court may make an order to rectify the matters complained 
  of. &quot;Corporation&quot; is defined in s. 2(1) of the Act to mean a body 
  corporate incorporated or continued under the CBCA and would thus include CanWest 
  Global and Global Television. &quot;Affiliate&quot; is defined to mean an affiliated 
  body corporate, and &quot;body corporate&quot; is defined to include a company 
  or other body corporate &quot;wherever or however incorporated&quot; and thus 
  need not be a CBCA corporation. Under s. 2(2)(a) one body corporate is affiliated 
  with another body corporate if one of them is the subsidiary of the other or 
  both are subsidiaries of the same body corporate or each of them is controlled 
  by the same person. &quot;Complainant&quot; is defined in s. 238 to mean &quot;a 
  registered holder or beneficial owner, and a former registered holder or beneficial 
  owner, of a security of a corporation or any of its affiliates&quot; or &quot;a 
  director or an officer or a former director or officer of a corporation or any 
  of its affiliates&quot;.</p>
<p> [57] Thus, prior to the amalgamation, the appellants qualified as complainants, 
  being registered holders or beneficial owners of the securities of Broadcasting 
  and directors of Broadcasting, an affiliate of CanWest Global. They say that 
  a court could find that in respect of Broadcasting (an affiliate of Global Television) 
  the acts of CanWest Global and its affiliates such as Global Television, CanVideo 
  and the other defendants effected a result that was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial 
  to the interests &quot;of any security holder&quot; or &quot;director&quot;. 
  A frailty in the argument is that the appellants must argue that &quot;any&quot; 
  security holder or director includes a security holder or director of an affiliate 
  that is not a CBCA corporation, in this case, Broadcasting. Case law under the 
  Ontario Business Corporations Act tends to be against this proposition but, 
  as the appellants point out, the OBCA is worded differently. See PMSM Investments 
  Ltd. v. Bureau (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 586 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.))<a href="#4">[4]</a>.<a name="r4"></a> 
  In any event, as I have said, it is my view that the court should not decide 
  the merits of the claim for the purposes of determining jurisdiction or convenient 
  forum. I will therefore apply the convenient forum test, taking the appellants' 
  claim at face value.</p>
<p>
  [58] The starting place for considering convenient forum is &quot;whether there 
  clearly is a more appropriate jurisdiction than the domestic forum chosen by 
  the plaintiff in which the case should be tried&quot; (Frymer at p. 79). Also 
  see Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78 at para. 
  69 and 70 and Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers' Compensation 
  Board), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 at 921.</p>
<p> [59] The convenient forum test is discretionary and thus the motions judge's 
  decision is entitled to considerable deference. However, in this case for the 
  reasons that I have set out it is my view that the motions judge erred in principle 
  by resolving the merits of the claim. In my view, he also misapprehended certain 
  facts. For example, he found that this lawsuit &quot;is nothing more nor less 
  than an extension of the prior action of the 1980s on another battlefield&quot;. 
  I do not think that is an entirely accurate characterization. The 1989 decision 
  of Morse J. resolved the issues concerning Ventures and Global Television. The 
  question of the management of Broadcasting was not an issue in that lawsuit. 
  Broadcasting is mentioned in the reasons of Morse J., but as background to the 
  litigation. Further, many of the complaints made by the appellants about Asper's 
  running of Broadcasting echo complaints made by Asper about the way that Epstein 
  and Morton ran Global Television. However, this present litigation is not simply 
  an extension of the earlier Manitoba litigation.</p>
<p>
  [60] The motions judge also failed to take into account the many allegations 
  in the statement of claim concerning the role of CanWest Television Inc. (CTI), 
  which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcasting and a CBCA corporation with 
  its registered office in Ontario. CTI holds the television licences of the Broadcasting 
  television stations. Many of the appellants' complaints concern agreements between 
  CTI and Global or CanWest companies that unfairly impact on Broadcasting and 
  that are governed by Ontario law.</p><p>
  [61] I will now turn to the factors to be considered under the convenient forum 
  test. The cases identify a number of factors. See Muscutt at para. 41; Amchem 
  Products Inc.; Eastern Power Ltd. v. Azienda Comunale Energia &amp; Ambiente 
  (2000), 178 D.L.R. (4th) 409 (Ont. C.A.); SDI Simulation Group Inc. v. Chameleon 
  Technologies Inc. (1994), 34 C.P.C. (3d) 346 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) and Spar 
  Aerospace Ltd. at para. 71. In Eastern Power Ltd. at paras. 19 and 20, MacPherson 
  J.A. identified the following factors:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the location where the contract in dispute was 
  signed,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the applicable law of the contract, </p>
<p class="indent">(c) the location in which the majority of witnesses 
  reside,</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the location of key witnesses,</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the location where the bulk of the evidence will 
  come from,</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the jurisdiction in which the factual matters arose, 
</p>
<p class="indent">(g) the residence or place of business of the parties, 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(h) loss of juridical advantage.</p>
<p>
  [62] Taking into consideration that this case is not simply about contracts, 
  I would apply the above framework for analysis to the convenient forum issue.</p><p>
  (a) The location of the dispute.</p><p>
  [63] The respondents say that this dispute is over the internal management of 
  Broadcasting and that most of the decisions in issue were made in Manitoba. 
  The motions judge adopted that position and went so far as to characterize the 
  statement of claim as &quot;legal casuistry [that] does not successfully camouflage 
  the real nature of the action&quot;. I think this is too narrow a view of the 
  dispute and in particular fails to credit the appellants' allegations concerning 
  CTI, the holder of the television licences, whose registered office is in Ontario. 
  It also fails to take into account that the appellants' allegations concern 
  the impact of decisions involving Global Television, which is also centred in 
  Ontario. On the other hand, it is fair to point out, as does the motions judge, 
  that this case concerns revenue from television stations that are all located 
  in Manitoba and the western provinces and do not carry on business in Ontario. 
  On balance, this factor favours Manitoba as the appropriate forum, but I would 
  not attach the same overwhelming weight to this factor that the motions judge 
  did. In my view, he erred in principle by failing to take into account the significance 
  of CTI and the contracts with CTI that are important elements of the dispute.</p><p>
  (b) The applicable law.</p><p>
  [64] The motions judge noted that the law governing the conduct of Broadcasting's 
  affairs is that of Manitoba and that Manitoba law governs the amalgamation agreement. 
  Because of the view he took about the merits of the claim, he attached no weight 
  to the fact that the appellants alleged violations of the CBCA. In my view, 
  since the appellants, rightly or wrongly, have chosen to sue for a remedy under 
  the CBCA, it is that law and not the Manitoba Corporations Act that is the applicable 
  law. The motions judge also failed to take into account that the contracts about 
  which the appellants complain were made in Ontario and would be construed in 
  accordance with the laws of Ontario. The fact that the appellants have sought 
  a remedy under the federal statute favours neither Ontario nor Manitoba. Since 
  the court would be required to apply the laws of Manitoba and Ontario, depending 
  on the agreement, this factor would seem to be neutral, or at best, slightly 
  favour Ontario because more of the relevant agreements were made in Ontario.</p><p>
  (c) The location in which the majority of witnesses reside.</p><p>
  [65] The motions judge found that any harm allegedly suffered by Broadcasting 
  occurred in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, where it owns and operates 
  its television stations. He noted that the appellants claimed to have suffered 
  damages in Ontario through diminution in the value of their shareholdings, although 
  the legal situs of those shares is Manitoba. He concluded that the substantial 
  majority of potential witnesses would seem to be in Winnipeg &quot;at the true 
  seat of power and through the chain of Broadcasting stations in the west.&quot; 
  I would not quarrel with this conclusion, except that I would attach little 
  weight to possible witnesses from the television stations. There is nothing 
  in the material that would indicate that local management would have any relevant 
  evidence to give. That said, this factor favours Manitoba as the place of trial.</p><p>
  (d) The location of key witnesses.</p><p>
  [66] The key witnesses are Asper, Morton and Epstein and the senior management 
  of Broadcasting, CTI and CanWest Global. These witnesses are found in Ontario 
  and Manitoba. This factor is neutral.</p><p>
  (e) The location where the bulk of the evidence will come from.</p><p>
  [67] The motions judge found that the &quot;substantial majority of relevant 
  documents seem to be located in Winnipeg and Western Canada&quot;. The appellants 
  forcefully attack this finding, which they say is not founded on the record. 
  I have examined the statement of claim and the affidavits that were filed before 
  the motions judge. Respectfully, I must agree with the appellants. The books 
  and records of Broadcasting and CanWest Global may be located in Manitoba. However, 
  the books and records of the appellants, of CTI and Global Television are in 
  Ontario. This factor is, in my view, neutral.</p><p>
  (f) The jurisdiction in which the factual matters arose.</p><p>
  [68] The factual matters arose in Manitoba and involve the internal management 
  of Broadcasting. Over the years some Broadcasting board meetings have been held 
  in Toronto, but most of the board meetings have been held in Manitoba. CanWest 
  Global and Mr. Asper, the appellants allege, were instrumental in the oppression, 
  are also located in Manitoba and many of the acts complained arose from decisions 
  made in Manitoba. The amalgamation was effected in Manitoba. The various agreements 
  that were the instruments used by the appellants to carry out the oppression 
  were made and largely executed in Ontario. On balance, this factor favours Manitoba.</p><p>
  (g) The residence or place of business of the parties.</p><p>
  [69] The residence and place of business of the four appellants is Ontario. 
  Mr. Asper resides in Manitoba. CanWest Global's registered office is in Manitoba 
  but it carries on business in Ontario. Global Television's registered office 
  is in Ontario. CanWest Global Broadcasting Inc.'s registered office is in Quebec. 
  The registered office of Global Communications Limited is in Ontario. This factor 
  favours Ontario.</p>
<p> (h) Juridical advantage.</p>
<p>
  [70] Juridical advantage is not said to be an issue in this case.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion on Convenient Forum</strong></p>
<p>
  [71] Of the eight factors, three are neutral, three favour Manitoba, and two 
  favour Ontario, one only slightly. However, determining convenient forum is 
  not merely an exercise in mathematics. For example, the majority of witnesses 
  would appear to come from Manitoba or the West, while most of the parties are 
  in Ontario. But neither factor is of overwhelming significance in this case 
  given the sophistication of the parties and the financial resources available 
  to them. See Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. v. Gulf Canada Resources 
  Ltd. (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 548 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 558. </p><p>
  [72] It would seem to me that looking at all the factors, they slightly favour 
  Manitoba as the more convenient forum. But is that enough to displace the plaintiffs' 
  right to choose the forum? While the burden was on the defendants to show that 
  Manitoba was &quot;clearly&quot; a more convenient forum, as held in Frymer 
  at p. 79, the &quot;choice of the appropriate forum is designed to ensure that 
  the action is tried in the jurisdiction that has the closest connection with 
  the action and the parties&quot;. The underlying principle is, as La Forest 
  J. said in Morguard at p. 1098, rooted in &quot;reasons of justice, necessity 
  and convenience&quot; or as he said in Hunt at p. 326, &quot;the discretion 
  not to exercise jurisdiction must ultimately be guided by the requirements of 
  order and fairness, not a mechanical counting of contacts or connections&quot;. 
  Viewed in this way, Manitoba is clearly the more convenient forum. The factors 
  concerning the location of the dispute and the jurisdiction in which the factual 
  matters arose, which both favour Manitoba, are considerably more important than 
  factors such as location of the parties. After all the counting of contacts 
  and connections is done, this case is about the dissatisfaction of minority 
  shareholders with the way they were and are treated by two companies based in 
  Manitoba. One company, Broadcasting, is a Manitoba corporation governed by the 
  Manitoba Corporations Act. The other, CanWest Global, although a federal corporation 
  carrying on business throughout Canada, is resident in Manitoba. Reasons of 
  justice, necessity and convenience not to mention the requirements of order 
  and fairness call for this matter to be sorted out by the Manitoba Court of 
  Queen's Bench.</p><p>
  [73] Accordingly, while I have found certain errors by the motions judge, I 
  am of the view that he came to the correct conclusion concerning the convenient 
  forum.</p><p>
  [74] In view of that conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the motions 
  judge was right to set aside service on Mr. Asper.</p>
<p> <strong>DISPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>
  [75] Accordingly, since the motions judge properly stayed the proceedings on 
  the basis that Manitoba is the convenient forum I would dismiss the appeal with 
  costs on a partial indemnity basis. </p><p>
  [76] Following the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the parties exchanged 
  bills of costs and then provided written submissions to the court. The appellants 
  do not quarrel with the amount sought by the respondents and in fact had they 
  been successful would have sought even higher costs. This was a complex matter 
  and entailed considerable preparation by counsel on both sides. There was a 
  vast amount of material involved. I can see no reason for substantially departing 
  from the amount claimed by the respondents, except that I do not think the appellants 
  should be required to pay the costs of three counsel on the appeal. Accordingly, 
  I would fix the costs of the appeal payable by the appellants to the respondents 
  at $56,200 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>

<p class="center">APPENDIX &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> 47. At the same time as CanWest Global's executives 
  were retained to provide exclusive management services to Broadcasting, CanWest 
  Global was also the exclusive provider of management services to its wholly-owned 
  subsidiary, Global Television. With the systematic elimination of Epstein and 
  Morton and independent senior management of Broadcasting, CanWest Global thus 
  became the sole directing mind not only of its own interests and those of its 
  wholly-owned subsidiaries but also of Broadcasting's interests.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 51. As an example, over the protests of Epstein and 
  Morton, the CanWest Global and Global Television nominees to Broadcasting's 
  board of directors have continuously refused to permit Broadcasting to apply 
  for any of the lucrative CRTC speciality channel licences. Asper, CanWest Global 
  and Global Television have determined that speciality channel licences would 
  be sought through CanWest Global or one of its subsidiaries and that Broadcasting 
  and its subsidiaries would be excluded from the profits and other benefits of 
  such licences.</p>
<p class="indent"> 52. The business plan of exploiting the benefits of 
  speciality channel licences through CanWest Global or one of its subsidiaries 
  without regard to the interests of Broadcasting had the effect of oppressing, 
  unfairly prejudicing or unfairly disregarding the interests of Broadcasting's 
  minority shareholders. The exploitation of these business opportunities through 
  CanWest Global or other of its affiliates has resulted in all profits and other 
  benefits therefrom being directed exclusively to CanWest Global. Since CanWest 
  Global's management continues to act as the sole directing mind of Broadcasting, 
  Broadcasting is powerless to act independently to advance or protect its own 
  interests. </p>
<p class="indent">53. Broadcasting has also paid, over the protests of 
  Epstein and Morton, ever-increasing fees for the services of CanWest Global's 
  management. The majority of Broadcasting's board of directors appointed by CanWest 
  Global has approved on an ongoing basis the non-arm's length contracts for the 
  provision of management services by CanWest Global, without any consideration, 
  or without any proper consideration, of the needs of the Broadcasting stations 
  for any of these services or of the value of these services provided by CanWest 
  Global or any of its affiliates. Such non-arm's length services include the 
  following: management, programming, sales, corporate, legal, regulatory, financial, 
  human resources, marketing, management information, promotions, graphics, media 
  relations, administration, news, traffic, operations and engineering.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 63. As confirmed by Asper's letter to Epstein and Morton 
  dated December 20, 1990, written in Asper's capacity as Broadcasting's Chairman 
  of the Board, CanWest Global agreed that Epstein and Morton would be permitted 
  to question any program cost allocation arrangements directed by CanWest Global 
  if these arrangements were not considered scrupulously fair or equitable to 
  Broadcasting and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="indent"> 64. The arrangements remained in place until 1995 when 
  CanWest Global's management unilaterally imposed a further revised method for 
  allocating programming costs to each of the Global Television and Broadcasting 
  stations. In the 1995 formula, CanWest Global's management proposed an allocation 
  of programming costs, net of recoveries for outside third party sales, to each 
  of the stations based upon the net air time revenue per station.</p>
<p class="indent"> 65. CanWest Global's management proposed this revision 
  to the cost allocation arrangements in circumstances where </p>
<p class="indent"> the net air time revenue for the Broadcasting stations 
  had increased. In purpose and effect, the change was imposed to increase the 
  proportionate amount payable by the Broadcasting stations in relation to the 
  amounts payable by the Global Television stations. With the change in formula, 
  Broadcasting's portion of programming costs increased from approximately 19% 
  to over 25% of the total costs of national programming rights.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 80. The new formula for programming charges imposed 
  by CanWest Global's management required Broadcasting or its subsidiaries to 
  pay for programming based on a formula that was later described in the Programming 
  Services Agreement as the portion that (i) the acquisition costs of the programming 
  that the English speaking population of the provinces where any Broadcasting 
  station holds CRTC licence rights, is to (ii) the English speaking populations 
  of the provinces where all Global Television and Broadcasting stations hold 
  CRTC licence rights.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 95. By correspondence dated November 24, 1997 to Peter 
  Viner, the President and CEO of CanWest Global, Epstein protested the significant 
  increase in programming costs charged to Broadcasting by its majority shareholder, 
  particularly in light of the fact that the promised independent review of the 
  sharing of programming costs between Broadcasting and Global Television had 
  not yet taken place. Epstein protested the unilateral actions of the majority 
  shareholder of Broadcasting in its apparent disregard of the July 14, 1997 commitment 
  made by CanWest Global to abide by the decision of an independent valuator selected 
  by Epstein and Morton.</p>
<p class="indent"> 96. Over the protests of Epstein and Morton, CanWest 
  Global's nominees to the board of directors of Broadcasting later selected KPMG 
  to review and evaluate the program charges already being paid by CTI to Global 
  Broadcasting. </p>
<p class="indent"> The actual retainer of KPMG did not take place for 
  a year or more after CanWest Global's management unilaterally adjusted the program 
  cost allocation formula and significantly increased the cost of program charges 
  paid by Broadcasting stations effective September 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 100. Under the arrangements unilaterally imposed by 
  CanWest Global, Broadcasting was foreclosed from the possibility of acquiring 
  programs on a more favourable basis relative to its own needs and circumstances. 
  At the same time, the compulsory sharing of all programming acquired provided 
  significant benefits to Global Television by allowing it to compete with and 
  outbid other competitors in acquiring national programming rights. This access 
  to the finances of Broadcasting has been and continues to be a critical factor 
  in CanWest Global's and Global Television's growth and expansion in their existing 
  markets and through acquisitions.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 108. In purpose and effect, the related party transactions 
  made directly or indirectly between CanWest Global and Broadcasting have brought 
  about a corresponding reduction in CanWest Global's programming costs and a 
  resultant increase in its profits. By permitting these increases in the cost 
  of the related party transactions, CanWest Global's management failed in its 
  fiduciary obligations to manage the business or affairs of Broadcasting in Broadcasting's 
  best interests and in the best interests of all of its security holders.</p>
<p class="indent"> 109. Throughout the history of the dealings between 
  Broadcasting and CanWest Global -- Broadcasting largely carries on business 
  for all intents and purposes through related party transactions made with CanWest 
  Global -- the nominees of CanWest Global to Broadcasting's board of directors 
  did not disclose in writing their conflicts of interest or refrain from voting 
  on the resolutions approving the numerous related party transactions with CanWest 
  Global and </p>
<p class="indent"> its other affiliates. Rather, the CanWest Global nominees 
  to Broadcasting's board of directors have used their majority position to approve 
  each of these non-arm's length contracts.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 112. In circumstances where the common management of 
  CanWest Global, Global Television and Broadcasting had a choice to favour the 
  interests of CanWest Global and Global Television or the interests of Broadcasting, 
  it always acted in the interests of CanWest Global and Global Television and 
  to the detriment of Broadcasting.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 124. Over the objections of Epstein and Morton, the 
  CanWest Global management decided to prevent Broadcasting from using any Global 
  programming or station identification if it sought and obtained a CRTC licence 
  to operate a television station in Alberta. CanWest Global's management and 
  its nominee directors to Broadcasting's board of directors thus subordinated 
  the interests of Broadcasting, IBL, Epstein and Morton to the interests of CanWest 
  Global and Global Television. They also permitted Broadcasting's majority shareholder 
  to divert business or corporate opportunities from Broadcasting to itself or 
  one or more of its affiliates. By engaging in such conduct, for which Asper, 
  CanWest Global and Global Television are in law responsible, the nominee directors 
  failed in their duties to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the 
  best interests of Broadcasting or failed to exercise the care, diligence and 
  skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 142. In purpose and effect, CanWest Global is continuing 
  to pursue a business plan that advances the interests of the stations operated 
  through its wholly-owned subsidiary, </p>
<p class="indent"> Global Television, in preference to the interests of 
  Broadcasting's stations. By failing to maintain an even hand in considering 
  the interests of these affiliated corporations under their common control, CanWest 
  Global has breached its duty of good faith in the performance of its contractual 
  obligations and breached its contractual commitments to manage Broadcasting 
  in the best interests of all of its stakeholders. By causing CanWest Global 
  to act in this manner, Asper has breached the fiduciary duties owed to his partners, 
  Epstein and Morton, in respect of the business or affairs of Broadcasting and 
  has acted in a manner that has oppressed, unfairly prejudiced or unfairly disregarded 
  their interests within the meaning of section 248 of the CBCA.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 149. Epstein, Morton, IBL and MAE have sustained significant 
  losses or damages as a result of the conduct of the defendants set out in this 
  claim. CanWest Global and its other affiliates have also been unjustly enriched 
  as the result of their oppressive conduct, breach of fiduciary duties, misappropriation 
  of Broadcasting's corporate opportunities, diversion of Broadcasting's profits 
  and the other acts of misconduct set out in this claim. In addition to their 
  claim for damages, the plaintiffs ask this Honourable Court to direct an accounting 
  and payment of all profits to the plaintiffs made by Asper, CanWest Global, 
  Global Television or other of their affiliates that are profits that should 
  have been realized by Broadcasting.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 150. Provided that Broadcasting remains under the exclusive 
  management and control of CanWest Global, there is no reasonable prospect that 
  the business or affairs of Broadcasting will be conducted in a manner that recognizes 
  and deals fairly with the interests of Epstein, Morton and IBL in their capacities 
  as directors, officers and minority shareholders of CanWest Global's affiliate, 
  Broadcasting. It is just and equitable that this Honourable Court direct CanWest 
  Global to purchase the Broadcasting shareholdings of the </p>
<p class="indent"> plaintiffs at such price and under such terms as are 
  determined [by] this Honourable Court after proper adjustments and payment by 
  CanWest Global for such matters as are hereinbefore pleaded.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 151. On April 13, 2001, CanWest Global announced in 
  a press release that Broadcasting's most valuable asset, CKVU-TV (Vancouver), 
  had been sold to CHUM Limited for approximately $125 million in cash. The plaintiffs 
  first learned about this sale by means of this press release.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 155. CanWest Global effectively appropriated to itself 
  and transferred to its station CHAN-TV the goodwill and much of the value properly 
  attributable to CKVU-TV. This is an act of oppression and CanWest Global is 
  liable in damages to IBL and Epstein.</p>
<p class="indent"> 156. In response to the delivery of this Claim, CanWest 
  Global and Asper caused Broadcasting to amalgamate with a newly-formed CanWest 
  Global subsidiary, CanWest Broadcasting (2001) Ltd. and to force IBL and Epstein 
  to become shareholders of CanWest Global.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 161. On March 26, 2001, Broadcasting's board of directors 
  held a meeting pursuant to CanWest Global's requisition. At this director's 
  meeting, Epstein and Morton stated that they opposed the amalgamation. They 
  voted against the resolution authorizing the amalgamation. But, the directors 
  of Broadcasting, other than Morton and Epstein, followed CanWest Global's and 
  Asper's directions and voted to approve the amalgamation, subject to shareholder 
  approval. </p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 170. In completing the amalgamation, CanWest Global 
  has unfairly advanced its own interests as the controlling shareholder of Broadcasting 
  in preference to the minority interests of IBL and Epstein. By eliminating the 
  shareholdings of IBL and Epstein in Broadcasting, CanWest Global, and its affiliates 
  and Asper continue to act in a manner that oppresses, unfairly prejudices or 
  unfairly disregards the interests of IBL and Epstein within the meaning of section 
  248 of the CBCA.</p>
