<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Mr. Adam Mati, appeals from the judgment of Justice Hoy, 
  finding that Mr. Mati had no estate or interest in the basement premises of 
  2-4 Satterly Road, Toronto, except non-exclusive access to the washroom and 
  to the electrical panel and directed that the tenant remove all of his chattels 
  from the basement premises. </p>
<p>[2] The issue on this appeal is whether the motions judge erred in finding 
  that the lease did not include the basement.</p>
<p>[3] In our opinion, the motion judge ignored two pieces of relevant evidence 
  indicating that the basement was included in the demised premises. The first 
  is the reference on Schedule B attached to the lease agreement that reads, &quot;Note 
  Actual Basement.&quot; The second is the affidavit of Michael Polensky, who 
  is the original landlord on the lease in issue. He states at paragraph 3 of 
  his affidavit that &quot;The basement was included in the leased premises.&quot; 
  It is therefore open to this court to review the motion judge's determination 
  of the application and to come to our own conclusion on the proper interpretation 
  of the lease.</p>
<p>[4] The lease describes the demised premises as &quot;consisting of approximately 
  1545 square feet and all the lands outlined in red on Schedule 'B' attached 
  to this lease.&quot; The wording of this recital, in particular the word &quot;and&quot; 
  that follows the reference to 1545 square feet is significant. Having regard 
  to this recital; to the reference on Schedule B to the &quot;actual basement&quot;, 
  to the affidavit of Mr. Polensky, and to the affidavit of Mr. Mati the other 
  party to the lease, we are satisfied that the basement was included in the demise 
  to the appellant.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is allowed, the decision of Hoy J. is set aside and an order 
  will go dismissing the application of Mr. Carranza. </p>
<p>[6] Costs of the motion below in the amount of $1,750 are to be paid to the 
  appellant In addition, costs of the appeal fixed in the amount of $3,500, inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST, are awarded to the appellant.</p>
