<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice D. McWilliam of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 11, 2001.</p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal and cross-appeal arise out of serious injuries suffered by 
  Franklin Carwardine, a developmentally challenged young man. At the relevant 
  times, Franklin was twenty years of age; however, he functioned at the level 
  of a five to seven year old. Due to his special needs, he lived in a group home 
  near Campbellford, Ontario and attended a special education class at a nearby 
  high school.</p>
<p>
  [2] During the fall of 1996, Franklin developed a friendship with one of his 
  developmentally challenged classmates - a fifteen year old girl who also resided 
  in a group home. On January 6, 1997, Franklin and his friend left school together, 
  without supervision or the prior knowledge of any adult. When they were found 
  four days later, they were suffering from severe frostbite. Tragically, Franklin's 
  injuries required several operations and the amputation of his legs.</p>
<p>
  [3] Thereafter, Franklin, his biological father, and his sister commenced a 
  civil action against the parties to this appeal, claiming damages for negligence. 
  Before this court, the appellants seek to overturn the jury's findings of negligence 
  and apportionment of liability as among the defendants in the action, on the 
  basis that those findings are unjust and unreasonable based on the evidence 
  at trial. One of the respondents, The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa-Carleton 
  (the &quot;Society&quot;), cross-appeals against the possibility that its percentage 
  liability, as assessed by the jury, may be increased if the appeal is successful.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the jury's disputed findings 
  are supported by the evidence in this case, examined as a whole, and that the 
  jury's verdict is not plainly unreasonable or unjust. Accordingly, I would dismiss 
  both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  A. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Parties and Background</p>
<p>
  [5] In 1991, Franklin's biological parents, Winston and Marie Carwardine, entered 
  into a special needs agreement with the Society, whereby the Society agreed 
  to place Franklin in a residential setting and to provide various other services 
  for him. Consequently, as acknowledged by the Society, at all material times 
  Franklin was in the care and control of the Society.</p>
<p> [6] The Society placed Franklin in a group home owned by Connor Group Homes, 
  a business owned and operated by the appellants, Robert and Elaine Connor, through 
  the corporate appellant, 511825 Ontario Inc. The group home was operated by 
  the appellants, David and Beverly Naulls, under the supervision of Elaine Connor.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  The Naulls served as Franklin's group home parents.</p>
<p>
  [7] The placement agreement between the Society and Connor Group Homes required 
  preparation of a plan of care for Franklin. After 1991, the plan was to be reviewed 
  every ninety days. The agreement also obliged Connor Group Homes to provide 
  the Society </p>
<p>
  with written reports concerning Franklin's social and emotional adjustment, 
  and his school progress, once every three months. Importantly, the agreement 
  also addressed the issue of absences without leave (&quot;AWOLs&quot;) by Franklin 
  from the group home. Connor Group Homes was required to notify the Society within 
  four hours if Franklin went AWOL.</p>
<p>
  [8] In 1991, Franklin began attending Campbellford District High School (the 
  &quot;High School&quot;), which is operated under the auspices of The Northumberland 
  Clarington Board of Education (the &quot;Board&quot;). He was a member of a 
  class for developmentally challenged students (the &quot;DC Class&quot;), which 
  was designed to assist the students in achieving their academic potential, while 
  also teaching them those basic life skills necessary to function on a daily 
  basis in the general community. In the fall of 1996, there were fourteen students 
  in the DC Class. It was taught by Victor Conte, an employee of the Board.</p>
<p>
  [9] Heather Stratton joined the DC Class in September 1996. Her older sister, 
  April Stratton, was also a DC Class student. They resided in a group home operated 
  by Daryl and Linda Thomson. Heather was fifteen years of age. She functioned 
  at a higher level than Franklin and the other students in the DC Class. But 
  for her behaviour, she was considered by school authorities to be a borderline 
  candidate for moving from a self-contained classroom to a regular class. April 
  Stratton functioned at a lower level than her sister, and had additional special 
  needs.</p>
<p>
  (2) Transportation and Supervisory Arrangements</p>
<p>
  [10] The Board utilized a transportation manual which outlined the respective 
  responsibilities of school principals, parents/guardians, students, and school 
  bus drivers concerning the transportation of students to and from schools within 
  the Board's jurisdiction. Under the manual, the school principal was responsible 
  for the arrival and departure procedures at the High School, and for the supervision 
  of loading and unloading procedures, among other matters. The terms of the manual 
  recognized that students with disabilities &quot;may require special attention&quot;. 
  However, the manual provisions relating to such exceptional students did not 
  provide for additional supervision at the time of bus loading; rather, according 
  to the principal, they were concerned with student behaviour on school buses 
  and not with loading arrangements.</p>
<p>
  [11] The manual also provided that parents could expect transportation for their 
  children from a designated bus stop to school, and return to the bus stop. Parents 
  were responsible for their children's safety and conduct at bus stops prior 
  to pick up and after leaving the bus at the end of the school day. As well, 
  they were obliged to report any problems &quot;about late arrivals, departures 
  etc.&quot; to the principal, or to the Board's transportation department. </p>
<p>
  [12] Both Franklin and Heather were provided by the Board with transportation 
  to and from school. Franklin was transported in a school bus with other students 
  from the High School, including some students from the DC Class and two other 
  residents from his group home. Heather and April were transported in a station 
  wagon, described as a &quot;taxi&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [13] The classroom for DC Class students was located directly across from the 
  students' assigned lockers, and adjacent to the door leading to the busing area. 
  At the end of each school day, the departure of the students was overseen by 
  Mr. Conte, who was usually present in the classroom or the adjacent hallway 
  to assist the students, and an educational assistant, who assisted the students 
  with their locker combinations and coats. Classes concluded at 3:06 p.m. and 
  the school buses left the High School at about 3:15 p.m. Heather's departure 
  taxi usually arrived at the High School at about 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>
  [14] When the DC Class students were ready to leave, they crossed from their 
  lockers to the nearby door leading to the busing area. They were permitted to 
  board their departing transportation vehicles without an escort. Consistent 
  with the practices followed by other high schools at the time, the Board did 
  not provide a bus monitor in the busing area to confirm which students took 
  departing buses, or to take attendance on the transportation vehicles provided 
  by the Board.</p>
<p>
  [15] The progress and needs of DC Class students were assessed annually by the 
  Board, in advance of each new school year and in consultation with parents, 
  including group home parents. Early in 1996, Elaine Connor and Beverly Naulls 
  attended an annual review meeting for Franklin. No special or new transportation 
  or supervisory requirements for Franklin were identified at that meeting. </p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, as he had done in prior years without any adverse incident, 
  during the fall of 1996 Franklin was permitted to leave the school building 
  unescorted at the end of the day to board his departing school bus. No difficulties 
  with his transportation arrangements were experienced prior to November 1996. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] At the end of the school day, Heather left the school building alone or 
  with her sister to board her taxi. No difficulties were experienced with her 
  transportation arrangements prior to November 1996.</p>
<p>
  [18] Apart from a two week period in 1995 when Franklin had lunch on school 
  days at a group home situated away from the High School, no special supervisory 
  arrangements applied to him at lunch or at other school break times.</p>
<p>
  [19] In contrast, shortly after commencement of the school year in September 
  1996 and because of their concern regarding Heather's provocative behaviour 
  towards boys, the Thomsons made their own arrangements to hire two senior students 
  at the High School to supervise Heather at lunch time. The supervisory students 
  were responsible to the Thomsons, not to the High School. </p>
<p>
  (3) The AWOLs from the High School </p>
<p>
  [20] After Heather joined the DC Class, Franklin and Heather developed a caring 
  friendship and mutual attraction. Prior to January 1997, they were involved 
  in four AWOLs from the High School. The incidents occurred on November 1, 8 
  and 25 and December 4, 1996, respectively. In summary, the circumstances surrounding 
  the AWOLs were as follows.</p>
<p>
  [21] On November 1, 1996, Victor Conte observed Franklin, Heather and another 
  DC Class student walking in town at approximately 4:00 p.m. The students had 
  failed to take their arranged transportation at the end of the school day. Mr. 
  Conte called their group home parents to inform them that he had seen the students 
  in town. The students were then returned to their group homes. They were not 
  injured in any way. </p>
<p>
  [22] As a result of that AWOL, several steps were taken. The Naulls spoke to 
  Franklin about his inappropriate behaviour and about the need not to leave school 
  without permission. They also took away Franklin's group home privileges for 
  two days, started monitoring his telephone calls, and routinely forwarded reporting 
  documents concerning his behaviour, and the measures taken at the group home 
  in relation to his behaviour, to Elaine Connor for approval. </p>
<p>
  [23] The Thomsons again made their own arrangements for additional supervision 
  for Heather. They hired the same two senior students who supervised Heather 
  at lunch time to escort her, on a rotational basis, to her taxi at the end of 
  each school day. </p>
<p>
  [24] For his part, Mr. Conte began to initiate casual conversations with Franklin 
  at the end of the school day for the purposes of depriving him of social contact 
  with Heather in the locker area of the DC Class, and distracting him while Heather 
  got into her taxi. In essence, he attempted to delay Franklin, or hold him back, 
  for several minutes to permit Heather to leave the building first. At trial, 
  Mr. Conte could not recall how many days he held Franklin back in that fashion. 
  As well, on the next school day following the November 1st AWOL, Mr. Conte spoke 
  to Heather and Franklin about their behaviour, and dealt with the incident as 
  a life skills learning experience. </p>
<p>
  [25] None of the Naulls Group, the Society or the School Board arranged extra 
  or additional supervision for Franklin following the November 1st AWOL.</p>
<p>
  [26] The November 8th AWOL also occurred at the end of the school day. Franklin 
  and Heather again left the High School property without supervision or the prior 
  knowledge of any adult. At approximately 7:00 p.m., Franklin made a collect 
  call to the Naulls from a telephone booth close to Heather's home. The Naulls 
  picked him up. They again spoke with Franklin about his conduct and reinforced 
  with him the need to know his whereabouts. They also deprived him of his privileges 
  at the group home for two days. Importantly, they failed to notify the High 
  School, the Board or the Society of the AWOL.</p>
<p>
  [27] On November 25, 1996, Franklin and Heather again went AWOL by leaving the 
  High School at the end of the day without supervision or the prior knowledge 
  of any adult. On this occasion, they were picked up in the evening while attempting 
  to hitchhike to Ottawa. They were taken to the police station and ultimately 
  returned to their group home parents.</p>
<p>
  [28] This time, in addition to speaking with Franklin about his behaviour, the 
  Naulls decided to keep Franklin back from school the next day. Beverly Naulls 
  testified that she spoke to Mr. Conte on November 26th to explain that Franklin 
  would not be at school because of the AWOL on the previous day. She claimed 
  that, during that call or perhaps in an earlier discussion that month with Mr. 
  Conte, Mr. Conte told her that he was unable to engage in activities with the 
  DC Class students after school because of his involvement with the High School's 
  hockey team. She also said that she understood that, going forward, the High 
  School would hold Franklin back at dismissal time until Heather was escorted 
  to her taxi. Mrs. Naulls was unclear as to how she obtained that information. 
  Although Mrs. Naulls also believed that Elaine Connor had contacted the High 
  School after the November 25th AWOL to request support for Franklin, Mrs. Connor 
  did not confirm that communication in her testimony. Mr. Conte testified that 
  he did not recall the suggested discussions with Mrs. Naulls in November 1996 
  and that he did not learn of the November 25th AWOL until January 1997. </p>
<p>
  [29] The fourth AWOL occurred nine days later, on December 4th. At about 3:00 
  p.m., when the DC Class students were leaving a computer skills class enroute 
  to their usual classroom, Franklin and Heather ran from their classmates and 
  the educational assistant, and exited the school through the gymnasium. A search 
  for them was undertaken, and Mr. Conte called their group home parents to inform 
  them of the missing students. This time, Franklin and Heather stayed out overnight. 
  They were found the next day and returned to their group homes.</p>
<p>
  [30] As a result of that AWOL, the Naulls held Franklin back from school on 
  December 5, 1996, spoke to him about his inappropriate behaviour and peer pressure, 
  and contacted Mr. Conte. According to Mrs. Naulls, Mr. Conte confirmed that 
  Heather was to be escorted to her taxi at the end of the school day, and indicated 
  that the school would be watching James Franski, a third student in the DC Class 
  who allegedly had conceived the runaway plan, &quot;very carefully&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [31] When the school principal learned of the December 4th AWOL, she met separately 
  with each of Mr. Conte, the computer skills teacher and the educational assistant 
  for the DC Class. She testified that she instructed her staff, including Mr. 
  Conte, to be &quot;extreme[ly] vigilant&quot; to ensure that Heather and Franklin 
  were always kept in eyesight of the educational assistant when they were travelling 
  between classrooms and that they were monitored in class. Consequently, it was 
  her understanding that, in the future and for as long as Mr. Conte thought appropriate, 
  Mr. Conte would hold Franklin back for a short time at the end of the school 
  day until Heather was in her taxi.</p>
<p>
  [32] Although Mr. Conte indicated that he did not recall meeting with the principal 
  following the December 4th AWOL, he testified that, during the balance of December, 
  he held Franklin back at the end of the school day on two or three occasions. 
  He also spoke with Franklin again to explain to him that his actions were inappropriate, 
  and to impress upon him the need to inform his parents and guardians of where 
  he was going and what he was doing.</p>
<p>
  [33] Connor Group Homes prepared an incident report for Elaine Connor in December 
  concerning the December 4th AWOL. The report recorded Franklin's suggestion 
  that his classmate, James Franski, had planned the AWOLs. Mrs. Connor testified 
  that the report would have been forwarded promptly to the Society. However, 
  no copy of the report was found in the Society's files. Further, the report 
  was not provided to the High School or the Board and, according to the Board's 
  witnesses, no one reported to the High School or the Board before January 1997 
  that James Franski may have been involved in the AWOLs.</p>
<p>
  [34] On December 17, 1996, a regularly scheduled plan of care meeting was held 
  concerning Franklin. It was attended by Beverly Naulls, Elaine Connor, Franklin, 
  Winston Carwardine, and James Sargent (Franklin's case worker at the Society). 
  The four AWOLs were discussed in detail and Mr. Sargent learned of them for 
  the first time.</p>
<p>
  [35] According to the Naulls Group, at the time of the December 17th meeting 
  they understood that an effective plan was in place at the High School to prevent 
  AWOLs involving Franklin and Heather. They believed that the plan consisted 
  of escorting Heather to her taxi at the end of the school day, holding Franklin 
  back until Heather had left for or boarded her taxi, supervising the two students 
  between classes, and watching James Franski. They believed that the plan was 
  working, and had failed on December 4th only because the students had left the 
  High School prior to dismissal time. Mr. Sargent understood that Heather was 
  to leave school in her taxi before Franklin would be allowed to go to his school 
  bus. He was satisfied that the plan was reasonable, straightforward, and likely 
  to be effective.</p>
<p>
  [36] Unfortunately, no one from the Board or the High School was informed of, 
  or invited to attend, the December 17th plan of care meeting. Further, neither 
  the appellants or the Society communicated with the Board or the High School 
  before, at, or after that meeting to confirm the elements of the plan and that 
  they were in place.</p>
<p>
  [37] From December 5, 1996 to January 6, 1997, no extra or special supervisory 
  arrangements for Franklin were arranged by any of the Naulls Group, the Board 
  or the Society. The end-of-the-day student escort arrangement for Heather continued 
  during that period. </p>
<p>
  [38] On January 6, 1997, the first day of school after the Christmas holidays, 
  Mr. Conte saw and spoke to Heather's student escort when she arrived at the 
  end of the school day to accompany Heather to her taxi. Mr. Conte saw them walk 
  towards the school exit to the busing area, but did not see Heather get into 
  her taxi. Subsequently, it was suggested by other students that Heather was 
  persuaded by James Franski to leave her taxi, and that she and Franklin then 
  left the High School property, leading to the calamitous results which precipitated 
  this action.</p>
<p>
  (4) The Proceedings Below</p>
<p>
  [39] In the ensuing litigation, Franklin, his biological father, and his sister 
  sought damages for negligence from the Naulls Group, the Board, and the Society. 
  The quantum of damages was agreed upon by all the parties. Liability was the 
  only live issue.</p>
<p>
  [40] After a four day trial in December 2001, the jury concluded that the Board 
  had not been negligent. It found the Naulls Group negligent for:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) failing to communicate the AWOL incident of November 8, 
  and likely the November 25, 1996 AWOL incident, to the [High School];</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) failing to maintain proper records of communications with 
  the [High School] and the Society; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) failing to take the proactive measure of using one of 
  their other resident children at the [High School] to help ensure that Franklin 
  came home with him on the bus (or [putting some] similar arrangement [in place]).</p>
<p>
  [41] In addition, the jury found that the Society was negligent in the following 
  respects: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) having been made aware of all four AWOL incidents at the 
  plan of care meeting on December 17, 1996, James Sargent's concern should have 
  been raised for not having heard of them earlier; and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Mr. Sargent should not have taken the &quot;plan&quot; 
  [to deal with the AWOLs] at face value, but should have verified it with the 
  [High School] directly.</p>
<p>
  [42] The jury attributed 80% liability to the Naulls Group, and 20% to the Society. 
  On December 11, 2001, McWilliam J. granted judgment against the Naulls Group 
  and the Society in accordance with the jury's verdict. The action as against 
  the Board was dismissed. </p>
<p>
  B. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellants argue that it was unjust and unreasonable for the jury to 
  find that the Board was not negligent, and to assign 80% liability to them. 
  Their challenge of those findings gives rise to the Society's cross-appeal only 
  if the appeal succeeds, such that the percentage liability of the parties must 
  be reapportioned. In that event, the Society submits that a further issue arises, 
  namely, whether the jury's verdict resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice, requiring a new trial.</p>
<p>
  C. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Applicable Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [44] The verdict of a jury in a civil case will not be set aside as against 
  the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to 
  satisfy the appellate court that no jury, reviewing the evidence as a whole 
  and acting judicially, could have reached it: McCannell v. McLean, [1937] S.C.R. 
  341 at 343; Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 593 (S.C.C.); 
  Toneguzzo-Norvell (Guardian ad litem of) v. Burnaby Hospital (1994), 110 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 289 at 292-93 (S.C.C.); Woelk v. Halvorson (1980), 114 D.L.R. (3d) 385 
  at 388-89 (S.C.C.); Vancouver-Fraser Park District v. Olmstead (1974), 51 D.L.R. 
  (3d) 416 at 419-21 (S.C.C.); and Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 
  299 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellants candidly acknowledge the heavy burden on them in this appeal, 
  given the considerable deference accorded to a jury's findings in a civil negligence 
  proceeding. As made clear by the Supreme Court of Canada in Housen, a standard 
  of palpable and overriding error applies to appellate review of findings of 
  negligence made by either a trial judge or a jury, unless the challenged findings 
  rest on an incorrect statement of the applicable standard of care, a failure 
  to consider a required element of a legal test or a similar error in principle, 
  thereby amounting to an error of law and attracting the less deferential standard 
  of correctness for appellate review. As stated by Iacobucci and Major JJ. in 
  Housen at pp. 595-96: </p>
<p class="indent"> The general rule&#133;is that, where the issue on appeal involves 
  the trial judge's interpretation of the evidence as a whole, it should not be 
  overturned absent palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  [46] In addition, the appellants properly concede that the apportionment of 
  liability in a negligence case is primarily the function of the trier of fact. 
  As observed by Bastarache J. on behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ingles 
  v. Tutkaluk Construction Ltd. (2000), 183 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 223: &quot;Appellate 
  courts should not interfere with the trial judge's apportionment [of liability] 
  unless there is demonstrable error in the trial judge's appreciation of the 
  facts or the applicable legal principles&quot; [citations omitted]: see also 
  Levesque v. Levesque (2001), 151 O.A.C. 227 (C.A.). As a general rule, when 
  the findings of fact made by the trier of fact are accepted, a very strong and 
  exceptional case is required to support appellate interference with the apportionment 
  of liability made by the trier of fact: Sparks v. Thompson (1974), 46 D.L.R. 
  (3d) 225 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  (2) The Jury's Findings Concerning the Board</p>
<p>
  [47] It is common ground that the Board owed a duty of care to Franklin and 
  that school authorities are bound by the standard of a reasonably careful or 
  prudent parent in providing for the supervision and protection of students in 
  their care: Thomas v. Hamilton (City) Board of Education (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 
  598 (C.A.); and Myers v. Peel County Board of Education (1981), 123 D.L.R. (3d) 
  1 (S.C.C.). On the facts here, however, the appellants argue that the standard 
  of care owed by the Board to Franklin was higher than the degree of care and 
  prudence owed to a secondary school student who was not developmentally challenged.</p>
<p>
  [48] It is clear on the developed jurisprudence that the reasonably prudent 
  parent standard of care cannot be applied in the same manner and to the same 
  extent in every case. The application of the standard varies from case to case 
  depending upon a host of factors, including the age, skills, competency, and 
  capacity of the student involved, and the nature of the activity at issue: Myers 
  at 10, per McIntyre J.</p>
<p>
  [49] In this case, Franklin's competency and capacity were less than those enjoyed 
  by non-DC Class students and by some other DC Class students, including Heather. 
  The Naulls Group, in addition to the Board, had parental obligations to Franklin 
  in consequence of his care arrangements. In turn, the Society owed a duty to 
  Franklin to ensure that he was placed in a safe group home that was capable 
  of meeting his special needs. In many important respects, therefore, a shared 
  parenting arrangement existed for Franklin. In my view, the standard of care 
  to which the Board was bound must be applied in the context of those factors.</p>
<p>
  [50] However, the fact that the standard of care must be adjusted to conform 
  with the particular circumstances of this case does not result in a different 
  legal characterization of the standard. As applied in the Thomas case, the issue 
  is not one of the proper definition of the standard of care, or of its characterization 
  as a &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; standard compared to the normal 
  standard for school authorities; rather, the important questions here are how 
  the standard is to be applied in this case, given Franklin's particular circumstances, 
  and whether the Board exercised the care that would be expected of a reasonably 
  prudent parent in like circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [51] The appellants argue that it was unjust and unreasonable, given the evidence 
  at trial, for the jury to find that the Board was not negligent in causing or 
  contributing to Franklin's injuries. The appellants assert and rely on the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) under the Board's transportation manual, it was responsible 
  for the safety and security of students from the time they got on the school 
  bus in the morning until they got off the school bus at the end of the day; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the Board was aware: (a) that Franklin was a special needs 
  student with a mental age of 5 to 7 years; (b) of Franklin's relationship with 
  Heather, a sexually aggressive 15 year-old girl with a much higher level of 
  mental functioning; (c) of at least two AWOLs involving Heather and Franklin 
  prior to January 1997; and (d) that Heather was the &quot;problem&quot; in terms 
  of Franklin running away;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the Board agreed at trial that holding Franklin back for 
  just a few minutes at the end of classes, until Heather was in her taxi, would 
  effectively prevent the possibility of the two students running away together. 
  Further, after the December 4, 1996 AWOL, the Board believed that extreme vigilance 
  was required to ensure that Heather and Franklin would not run away again, and 
  that Franklin ought to be detained after class until Heather got into her taxi. 
  Yet, the Board failed to continue the hold back arrangement; </p>
<p class="indent">(iv) on January 6, 1997, the two students were under the care, 
  control and supervision of the Board; </p>
<p class="indent">(v) the Board acknowledged that if Franklin had been held back 
  at the end of the day on January 6, 1997, as was done on other days following 
  the November 1 and December 4, 1996 AWOLs, the January 6th AWOL would not have 
  occurred; </p>
<p class="indent">(vi) the Board did not communicate to Franklin's bus driver, 
  or to the bus company, any difficulty or concern regarding Franklin's transportation 
  arrangements or runaway activities; and </p>
<p class="indent">(vii) the Board failed to adequately monitor James Franski.</p>
<p>
  [52] Those factual assertions, some of which are disputed, put the appellants' 
  case against the Board at its highest. In my view, however, when the evidence 
  at trial is considered as a whole, it was open to the jury, acting judicially, 
  to conclude that the Board was not negligent. I reach that conclusion for several 
  reasons.</p>
<p>
  [53] First, although the appellants were aware of the November 1996 AWOLs, the 
  jury found that they failed to communicate the November 8th AWOL, and &quot;likely&quot; 
  failed to communicate the November 25th AWOL, to the High School and, hence, 
  to the Board. Those critical findings of fact required an assessment by the 
  jury of the credibility of Mrs. Naulls and the reliability of her claim that 
  she reported the November 25th AWOL to Mr. Conte, and the credibility of Mr. 
  Conte, who testified that he did not know of the November AWOLs prior to January 
  1997. The appellants do not argue that those findings of fact by the jury were 
  based upon a misapprehension of the evidence or other overriding and palpable 
  error justifying appellate intervention. The jury's findings indicate that it 
  rejected the appellants' evidence on the important issue of whether the Board 
  knew of the November AWOLs.</p>
<p>
  [54] Second, the appellants failed to inform the Board or its representatives 
  of the plan of care meeting for Franklin held on December 17, 1996 or the matters 
  discussed at it. Although Mrs. Naulls and Mrs. Connor described their understanding, 
  at that meeting, of what they termed the &quot;school's plan&quot; to prevent 
  future AWOLs, I am at a loss to understand how prospective reliance reasonably 
  could be placed by the Naulls Group - or the Society - on a preventative plan 
  of action which was neither discussed or confirmed with the Board or the High 
  School at or after the December 17, 1996 meeting. Moreover, had the Board or 
  its representatives been included in or told afterwards of the matters discussed 
  at the plan of care meeting, they would have learned of the November AWOLs.</p>
<p>
  [55] As a consequence of the non-disclosure of the November AWOLs to the Board 
  or its representatives, the Board was unaware of an emerging, and significant, 
  pattern of runaway activities by Franklin and Heather. Both the principal and 
  Mr. Conte stressed in their trial testimony that, had they known of all four 
  AWOLs before January 1997, immediate and additional action would have been taken 
  by them.</p>
<p>
  [56] Instead, prior to January 1997, the Board's knowledge of the AWOLs was 
  confined to knowledge of the November 1st and December 4th AWOLs. After the 
  November 1st AWOL, Heather's after-school student escort was arranged. The December 
  4th AWOL occurred before - albeit only shortly before - the end of the school 
  day, at a time when Heather and Franklin were in transit between classrooms. 
  Thus, as argued by the Board on this appeal, that AWOL did not involve a failure 
  of the transportation arrangements for Heather and Franklin. </p>
<p>
  [57] The principal testified that her post-December 4, 1996 direction for &quot;extreme 
  vigilance&quot; relating to Franklin and Heather was concerned with their travel 
  with other members of the DC Class between classrooms. Thus, the direction was 
  responsive to the events of December 4, 1996. It was not intended to ensure 
  that the two students did not run away from the school busing area; nor did 
  it address end-of-day transportation arrangements. Insofar as the principal 
  and the DC Class teacher were aware prior to January 1997, the transportation 
  arrangements for Franklin and Heather were working, and had worked since November 
  1, 1996. </p>
<p>
  [58] In my view, on that evidence, it was open to the jury to conclude, as it 
  implicitly did, that the Board's belief in the effectiveness of the transportation 
  arrangements was one which a reasonably prudent parent would hold in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [59] Third, the appellants were aware before January 1997 of the supervisory 
  escort arrangements for Heather. They also knew that they were free to apply 
  for additional supervision for Franklin, either to the Board or the Society, 
  or to make such an arrangement on their own. They pursued none of those options. 
  They also failed, before or after the December 4th AWOL, to discuss with the 
  Board or the High School the merits of such an arrangement. As found by the 
  jury, they chose not to effect a supervisory measure on their own, whether by 
  enlisting the assistance of another group home resident or otherwise.</p>
<p>
  [60] Finally, the actions taken by the High School to guard against unsafe incidents, 
  and to supervise DC Class students at the end of the school day, including Franklin 
  and Heather, were established at trial by the Board. In that connection, the 
  principal testified that instruction of the DC Class emphasized student awareness 
  of safe practices, including the loading of buses. In addition, a staff supervisory 
  presence was evident in the DC Class classroom and the adjacent hallway at the 
  end of the day.</p>
<p>
  [61] Accordingly, while a different conclusion might well have been reached 
  by the jury on this record given the vulnerability of Franklin, there was evidence 
  at trial which, if accepted by the jury, supported the finding that the Board 
  was not negligent in the circumstances. I do not believe that it can be said 
  that no jury, reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably and acting judicially, 
  could have made that finding. No error by the jury in its appreciation of the 
  evidence or the applicable legal principles has been demonstrated. It follows 
  that the jury's findings of no negligence by the Board and no percentage liability 
  on its part are unassailable. </p>
<p> (3) The Jury's Apportionment of Liability between the Appellants and the Society</p>
<p>
  [62] Before this court, the appellants do not dispute the jury's findings of 
  negligence concerning the Society. The Society concedes that those findings 
  are just and reasonable, based on the evidence. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [63] In addition, neither the appellants or the Board submit that the evidence 
  supports any increase in the percentage liability of the Society, as determined 
  by the jury. The appellants' challenge of the jury's apportionment of liability 
  is premised on an alleged error by the jury in assigning no liability to the 
  Board. I have already rejected that proposition. Finally, no palpable and overriding 
  error by the jury has been established in connection with the Society's conduct. 
  In the absence of such error, there is no justification for interfering with 
  the jury's apportionment of liability as between the appellants and the Society.</p>
<p>
  D. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [64] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed. As a result, 
  the Society's cross-appeal is not engaged, and it is also dismissed. The Board 
  is entitled to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in 
  the amount of $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. 
  The Society is also entitled to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity 
  basis, fixed in the amount of $3,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and 
  Services Tax. This is not a proper case for an award of costs in respect of 
  the cross-appeal.</p>
