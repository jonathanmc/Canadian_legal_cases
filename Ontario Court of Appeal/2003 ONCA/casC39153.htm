<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice A. Donald K. MacKenzie dated October 
  25, 2002 made at Owen Sound, Ontario.</p>
<p>ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by R.D., the biological father of R.O.D., from the judgment 
  of MacKenzie J. dismissing an appeal from a Crown wardship order of Andrews 
  J. following a child protection hearing pursuant to s. 37 of the Child &amp; 
  Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11. At the hearing, the Children's Aid 
  Society of Owen Sound and the County of Grey had sought an order of Crown wardship. 
  Andrews J. found that the child's mother was incapable of parenting the child 
  and that it was &quot;unrealistic to accept that [R.D.] is capable of performing 
  responsibly [the role of parent] day in and day out over several years&quot;. 
  Consequently, he concluded that the only way to secure the child's best interests 
  was to order that he be made a ward of the Crown.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] R.O.D., born on May 29, 2001, was apprehended by the Children's Aid Society 
  after his birth at the Bruce Grey Regional Health Unit. His mother was B.H. 
  and his father was R.D. Two older children of the mother had previously been 
  made Crown wards without access and were placed for adoption. Of her three children, 
  R.O.D. is the only child whose father is R.D. </p>
<p>
  [3] In October 2000, there was a Crown wardship hearing before Dunn J., involving 
  B.H.'s second child A.H. At that time, R.D. had been living with the mother 
  for a period of eight months. The issue at that hearing was her parenting capacity 
  and whether R.D. was able to assist her in parenting A.H. Their relationship 
  and his parenting capacity were therefore central in a parenting capacity assessment 
  dated July 11, 2000 completed by a team led by Dr. Wayne Richardson for the 
  Bruce Grey Children's Services in anticipation of the wardship proceedings concerning 
  that child. The assessment concluded that the mother was unable to parent, and 
  that R.D., while able to parent a child, was not able to be of sufficient assistance 
  to warrant A.H. remaining in the mother's care. Dunn J. relied on this assessment 
  in ordering that this child be made a Crown ward.</p>
<p> [4] Dr. Richardson, who met with both B.H. and R.D., was of the view that 
  R.D. had no psychological or historical problems which would disqualify him 
  as an effective father for this child. In particular, he observed that:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>[R.D.] appears as if he would be a good role model for traditional male 
      values for his child; for example, being a hard working, even tempered individual 
      who provides for his family. He appears to be honest and willing to disclose 
      his past failings.</li>
    <li>[R.D.]'s responses to the parenting questions on the PASS were quite acceptable, 
      indicating he has a basic knowledge about how to deal with many issues facing 
      parents.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p> [5] Dr. Richardson, however, identified the following concerns as relevant: 
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>[R.D.] has conventional male values. One of those is the value of paid 
      employment. He has a long history of employment and he has gone to the extent 
      of travelling between Owen Sound and Alberta to maintain consistent employment. 
      Many, and perhaps most of his social relationships are related to his employment. 
      Paid work is very important to [R.D.]. It is central to his identity. It 
      would be very, very difficult for him not to have paid employment.</li>
    <li>[R.D.]'s employment takes him from the home from 4 am to 4 pm. This means, 
      unless he quits his present employment, he will be out of the house or asleep 
      for much of the day and unavailable to be a support, let alone the primary 
      caregiver.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="indent"> Summary</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, being the primary caregiver for this child would 
  be going against most of the basic values that are central to [R.D.]'s identity 
  and that he has lived his life by for 38 years. Furthermore, we believe [R.D.] 
  would find it impossible to make such an about face and be the primary caregiver 
  [Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [6] It is important to note that this assessment involved a child of whom R.D. 
  was not the biological parent. Crown wardship of A.H. was ordered not because 
  of any perceived parental incapacities on R.D.'s part, but because he would 
  not likely be the main caregiver, and the child could not be left alone with 
  the mother. </p>
<p>
  [7] When R.D.'s child, R.O.D., was apprehended on May 30, 2001, the Children's 
  Aid Society immediately brought an application for Crown wardship without access. 
  The child was placed in the temporary care and custody of the Children's Aid 
  Society, with the frequency of access to be at the discretion of the Children's 
  Aid Society. The father exercised access to the child for an hour twice weekly 
  until the Crown wardship hearing took place on December 7, 2001, when the child 
  was six months old. At that time, Andrews J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, 
  based in large part on Dr. Richardson's assessment of July 11, 2000, ordered 
  that the child be made a Crown ward without access by either parent. The mother 
  did not appeal this decision. </p>
<p>
  [8] The father appealed and brought an application to stay Andrews J.'s order. 
  That application was heard and dismissed in February 2002. The father's appeal 
  of the Crown wardship order was heard by MacKenzie J. on October 17, 2002. He 
  rejected an application by the father to introduce fresh evidence, dismissed 
  the appeal, and confirmed the Crown wardship order. </p>
<p>
  [9] The main aspect of the proposed fresh evidence consisted of the fact that 
  subsequent to the order of Andrews J., the father and the mother had separated, 
  with the result that the father was seeking the return of his biological child 
  whom he intended to care for as a single parent.</p>
<p>
  [10] Dr. Richardson was asked by the Children's Aid Society in September, 2002 
  to prepare an updated report for the appeal of the Crown wardship order, giving 
  his opinion about the father's change in circumstances since he had separated 
  permanently from the mother of the child, was currently unemployed, and proposed 
  to stay home with the child. He was not asked by either party to again interview 
  the father. </p>
<p>
  [11] Dr. Richardson's key findings about this change were that while the father's 
  separation from the mother was undoubtedly a material change, and while he had 
  the capacity to parent a child, it would be unwise to move the child given his 
  close bond with his new family: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I do think that under the changed circumstances there would be no reason to 
  disqualify [R.D.] from being the primary caretaker for a normal child. Being 
  a male with such traditional values and with little experience being a direct 
  caregiver he will probably have more difficulties and challenges than most people. 
  However, I do not see any substantive reason that would mean he should not be 
  permitted to be a primary caregiver for a normal child. For example, if [R.D.] 
  were in a relationship in which his partner was pregnant and if the partner 
  were to die in childbirth, I do not see any reason to apprehend that newborn 
  child.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> This does not necessarily mean that I think [R.O.D.] should 
  be returned to [R.D.'s] care since we must be concerned about the best interests 
  of [R.O.D.]. I am unable to form a definite opinion about that, in part because 
  I have not assessed [R.O.D.] and do not know if he has any special needs, nor 
  do I know his degree of attachment to his adoptive parents. Also, I have not 
  assessed [R.O.D.'s] adoptive parents, and do not know their abilities and attachment 
  to [R.O.D.]. As a general rule, changing placements or parents is not a good 
  thing for children. Whether the benefits of being cared for by his biological 
  father would be enough to overcome the problems associated with a transfer of 
  custody is a matter of some debate. However, I am inclined to think that if 
  [R.O.D.] is well-integrated into his foster home, if those parents and [R.O.D.] 
  and any siblings have bonded well, and if those parents are meeting his needs, 
  that it would probably be in [R.O.D.'s] best interest to remain in that home, 
  especially in view of the fact that by the time a decision is made he will have 
  lived in that home for all of his 17 months [Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [12] The central issue in this appeal is whether the appeal judge erred in refusing 
  to admit the fresh evidence of the father that he and the child's mother had 
  separated in January 2002 after the decision of Andrews J., and that, therefore, 
  there was a sufficient change in circumstances that he should be permitted to 
  parent the child. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] Section 69(6) of the Child &amp; Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 
  permits the appellate court &quot;to receive further evidence relating to events 
  after the appealed decision&quot;. The test for determining whether further 
  evidence should be admitted was set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 
  case of Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. C. M., [1994] 
  2 S.C.R. 165 at 190 where Justice L'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, in considering s. 69(6), 
  set out the factors to be considered in determining whether further evidence 
  should be admitted on appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) could the evidence have been previously adduced;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) is the evidence highly relevant;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) is the evidence potentially decisive to a best interest 
  determination; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) is the evidence credible.</p>
<p>
  [14] In C.M., the new evidence sought to be admitted concerned the consistent 
  assertions of the child, S.M., that she regarded her foster family as her real 
  family and her refusal to see her birth mother. The child was seven years old 
  at the time of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision. The Children's Aid Society 
  (CAS) had become involved in October 24, 1986, when S.M. was one month old, 
  and for the next few years she alternated between being under CAS supervision 
  while residing with her mother, and being in the custody of the CAS. Despite 
  repeated attempts, the bonding between S.M. and her mother was minimal. </p>
<p>
  [15] On December 14, 1989, the CAS brought an application seeking an order of 
  Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. The mother opposed 
  the application and was successful in both Provincial and Divisional Court. 
  On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed a motion for fresh evidence made on behalf 
  of the child, the respondent CAS, and the appellant. Ultimately, the CAS was 
  successful at the Court of Appeal and the mother appealed to the Supreme Court 
  of Canada from the Crown wardship order. </p>
<p>
  [16] In C.M., the fresh evidence illuminated the quality of the mother's relationship 
  with her daughter and, in particular, the fact &quot;that S.M. consistently 
  and repeatedly made it clear to anyone who would listen that she felt that her 
  foster family was her real family and that she did not want to return to her 
  birth mother.&quot; The child had injured herself and made herself ill in order 
  to avoid the access visits. Justice L'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, at p. 190, found 
  that this evidence met the test for fresh evidence as &quot;it could not have 
  been adduced before, is highly relevant in that it enables the Court to make 
  determinations on an accurate picture of the situation at hand, is potentially 
  decisive as to S.M.'s best interests and is credible.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [17] In this case, the appeal judge gave oral reasons for refusing to admit 
  the appellant's fresh evidence. At the time of the hearing, the child was one 
  year and five months old and in the same foster home as his sister A.H., his 
  mother's second child who had been made a Crown ward by Dunn J. The appeal judge 
  described the fresh evidence at p. 3 of his reasons as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidence in question consists of the appellant's affidavit and seeks to 
  set out a material change in circumstances that has occurred subsequent to the 
  order under appeal&#133;The gist of the material change, the change in circumstances, 
  is that the appellant since the date of the hearing no longer cohabits with 
  the biological mother and has sought by virtue of that change in his lifestyle 
  and circumstances to put forward, in essence, a change in the parenting plan, 
  which is relevant for purposes of the appeal in the submission of counsel for 
  the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [18] It is unclear from his reasons which threshold the appeal judge applied 
  in refusing to admit the fresh evidence, but he appeared to come to the decision 
  to refuse the fresh evidence for two reasons: the failure of the appellant to 
  adduce the fresh evidence at trial and the fact that the fresh evidence was 
  a new parenting plan. With respect, I think the appeal judge erred in his approach 
  to the admissibility of the fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  [19] It is clear that the fresh evidence could not have been adduced at the 
  trial before Andrews J. in December 2001, since the separation from the child's 
  mother did not occur until a month later. Nor is there any doubt that the evidence 
  is highly relevant or credible. The real issue in this case is whether the evidence 
  that the child's parents had separated was &quot;potentially decisive&quot; 
  to a determination of the child's best interests and, if it was, whether the 
  appeal judge therefore erred in refusing to admit and rely on it. </p>
<p>
  [20] It is important to review the findings Andrews J. made in December 2001 
  before determining whether the evidence of the parents' separation was, in fact, 
  &quot;potentially decisive&quot;. His observations about the father were, simply 
  put, not encouraging. In particular, he noted the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Both [B.H.] and [R.D.] have a dislike of the C.A.S., do not like to be supervised 
  and appear to tolerate it only for the purpose of getting the child placed with 
  them. [R.D.] was normally quiet but on occasion he became hostile, rude and 
  threatening. On one occasion the C.A.S. worker was compelled to speak to him 
  about his offensive body odour. His reaction was to become angry and swear&#133;[R.D.'s] 
  last job was driving a taxi. He stated he quit because he wanted to parent the 
  baby 24 hours a day, in anticipation that the baby would be more likely returned 
  if he was fully available. Under cross-examination, he acknowledged that he 
  had lost his licence to drive because of unpaid fines and while under suspension 
  he had been stopped again for driving.</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> [D]r. Richardson testified [at the trial before Justice Dunn] 
  that &quot;it would be psychologically impossible for [R.D.] to stay home and 
  parent, despite his wanting to do so, and despite his commitment to [B.H.].&quot; 
  Dr. Richardson also testified at this trial. He saw no reason to believe that 
  [R.D.] had changed. He acknowledged that [R.D.] was capable of parenting the 
  child. But he believed that [R.D.] and [B.H.] do not appreciate the gravity 
  of [B.H.'s] deficiencies; they both believe in their hearts that [B.H.] can 
  parent the child. It is Dr. Richardson's opinion that [R.D.] will trust the 
  child to [B.H.] alone as time passes, thereby putting the child at risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Justice Dunn [the trial judge at the time of the Crown wardship 
  hearing in October 2000 relating to A.H.] outlined a number of positive factors 
  about [R.D.] and I accept those. At the same time, I find a real want of responsibility 
  and sense of reality in him. For example, his outbursts of temper before the 
  C.A.S. workers; his failure to pay fines of over $900.00; his driving under 
  suspension.</p>
<p class="indent">[R.D.] made mention in his testimony of local relatives and 
  friends who would help in the care of [R.O.D.]. Unfortunately, none came forward 
  to testify on his behalf and I am unconvinced, on the evidence before this trial 
  and the statement in the judgment of Justice Dunn, that they have the ability 
  or commitment to provide the care that would be required.</p>
<p>
  [21] Given the inevitable fluidity in a child's development, in most cases it 
  would be beneficial for a reviewing court to have the most current information 
  possible to assist in evaluating whether a change in the factual matrix of a 
  previous best interests determination warrants interference with that finding. 
  Indeed, that is the purpose of s. 69(6) of the Act. In my view, the threshold 
  of &quot;potential decisiveness&quot; has been met in these circumstances. The 
  fact of the father's separation from the child's mother is highly relevant and 
  worthy of consideration by the court in assessing the child's best interest.</p>
<p>
  [22] However, the separation, while relevant, is not decisive in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [23] The chronology is important. The father has not seen the child since December 
  2001. The child has been in care in the same foster home where his sister lives, 
  and the foster parents propose to adopt him. He had been in the foster home 
  for about seventeen months at the time of the appeal before MacKenzie J. Almost 
  one year later, he remains with his foster family. The father and mother separated 
  in January 2002. Notwithstanding that the father had a pending application for 
  a stay which was heard in February 2002, he did not mention at that time that 
  he and the mother were no longer living together. He did not do so until he 
  swore his affidavit in July 2002 in support of his fresh evidence motion.</p>
<p>
  [24] The key paragraphs of the father's affidavit state the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Prior to the trial of this matter I had been unemployed. I 
  have been aware of Dr. Richardson's assessment which indicates that I am psychologically 
  unable to not work. I believe that I have a strong motivation to be a contributing 
  productive member of society. I strongly believe that staying home with my son 
  provides me with that sense of accomplishment and would be even more fulfilling 
  than paid employment. I see no conflict between working full time in the paid 
  workforce and staying at home to care for my son.</p>
<p class="indent">I have made efforts to improve my level of education since the 
  trial in order that when I return to work I have a better chance of earning 
  more income. Obtaining my GED and completing the program to become certified 
  as a Bartender are examples of what I am working to achieve and have achieved 
  in the past year.</p>
<p class="indent">While I am employed part time with Red Line Taxi this work is 
  only one day per week. Should [R.O.D.] be placed in my care I am fully prepared 
  to give up this employment.</p>
<p>
  [25] He made no reference to any proposed arrangements for the care of the child 
  and, singularly, did not respond to any of the concerns expressed by Andrews 
  J. in his December, 2001 reasons, or in the assessments by Dr. Richardson that 
  there was little likelihood that he would ever be able to remain at home in 
  the long term. </p>
<p>
  [26] Justice MacKenzie also had an affidavit, submitted on consent, from the 
  adoption worker assigned to the child, Ms. Janet Furniss. Ms. Furniss noted 
  that the child was outgoing, interacted well with other children, seeks out 
  his foster parents for security when approached by unfamiliar adults, can be 
  easily comforted and settled by his foster parents when he is frustrated or 
  upset, and enjoys a very close relationship with his sister who resides in the 
  same foster home. In her words &quot;they are always together and most often 
  participate in the same events. Both children play well with one another and 
  appear protective and caring towards each other.&quot; Her concluding paragraphs 
  about the child make the following observation: </p>
<p class="indent"> [R.O.D.] appears well settled and bonded within his foster 
  family. He readily gives and receives affection from all the family members, 
  and [R.O.D.] will seek out his foster parents when he is in need of comfort 
  or support. Teething has been difficult for [R.O.D.], and he enjoys being held 
  by one or the other of his foster parents to deal with his discomfort.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, [R.O.D.] presents as a happy, healthy, well cared for 
  child who is responding well to the routines, stimulation and nurturing provided 
  to him by his foster parents. He appears secure and comfortable in his familial 
  relationships, and he interacts positively with both foster parents and his 
  sister.</p>
<p>
  [27] This uncontradicted evidence of the child's secure and healthy environment 
  is most significant in considering whether his best interests are best served 
  by continuing the Crown wardship. </p>
<p>
  [28] In C.M. L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. at p. 201, stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> The wide focus of the best interests test encompasses an examination 
  of the entirety of the situation and thus includes concerns arising from emotional 
  harm, psychological bonding and the child's desires, which the Act contemplates 
  as well. </p>
<p class="indent">Within the realm of best interests perhaps the most important 
  factor in the present case, as probably in many others, is regard to the psychological 
  bonding of a child to her or his foster family. Section 37 (3) imports such 
  considerations as the relevance of a child's emotional needs, the significance 
  of continuity of care and the child's views. In C.C.A.S. of Metro. Toronto v. 
  H. (K.) (1987), 6 R.F.L. (3d) 1 (Ont. Prov. Ct. (Fam. Div.)), reversed (1988), 
  21 R.F.L. (3d) 115 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), affirmed (sub nom. G. (C.) v. H.(J.) (1989), 
  23 R.F.L. (3d) 300 (Ont. C.A.)), in reversing the trial judge's finding, the 
  District Court concluded that the judge of first instance had failed to give 
  sufficient weight to the evidence of the potential for long-term psychological 
  harm that may arise from the child's being separated from his psychological 
  parents [Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [29] Similarly, at p. 203 she re-emphasized the importance of the child's emotional 
  tie to a foster family: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Among the factors in evaluating the best interests of a child, the emotional 
  well-being of a child is of the utmost importance, particularly where the evidence 
  points to possible long-tem adverse consequences resulting from the removal 
  of the child from his or her foster family and the return to his or her birth 
  parents.</p>
<p>[30] When applying these principles to the facts in C.M. L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. stated at p. 203: </p>
<p class="indent">
  According to the fresh evidence, as well as the whole of the evidence, there 
  has been an early bonding with S.M.'s foster family which has been cemented 
  in time. Finally her expressed desire to remain with this family cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>[31] Like the circumstances in C.M., R.O.D. is living in a foster home with 
  his sister and the uncontroverted evidence is that he has adjusted well and 
  is happy living in that home. </p>
<p>
  [32] I recognize that in C.M. the child was seven years old and able to express 
  her wishes and desires. However, the length of time R.O.D. has been with, and 
  bonded to his foster family, is not insignificant. The father separated from 
  the child's mother when the child was seven months old. The child has never 
  been in the care of the appellant, having lived in the foster home practically 
  since his birth on May 29, 2001.</p>
<p>
  [33] By the time of the appeal before MacKenzie J., the child was seventeen 
  months old and fully integrated in his new home. It is impossible to see how 
  it would be in the child's best interests to be disrupted from this very positive 
  environment at this time. As a result, even though the fresh evidence should 
  have been admitted, I am not persuaded that the appeal judge would have reached 
  a different result. </p>
<p>
  [34] Although I appreciate that one of the purposes of the Act is to restrict 
  state intervention in favour of preserving the family unit, ultimately it is 
  the best interests of the child that is paramount. As L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. stated in C.M. at p. 204, &quot;furtherance and protection of the child's 
  best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.&quot; 
  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [35] I see no reason, however, for the appeal judge to have awarded costs against 
  the father in these circumstances. I would therefore grant leave to appeal the 
  costs order, allow the appeal with respect to costs, and set aside the costs 
  order in the amount of $3,500 against the father. The appeal is otherwise dismissed 
  without costs.</p>
