<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appeal against conviction is dismissed. There is no basis on the evidence 
  to find the Crown guilty of abusive conduct. The matters complained of were 
  all screened through experienced defence counsel. We would not interfere with 
  the trial judge's ruling.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The sentence was 16 months plus three years probation and in our view was 
  fit when issued. However, the passage of time and the appellant's current pregnancy 
  with twins, expected in November, has caused us to look at the circumstances 
  anew. We agree with the Crown that this offence calls for a period of custody. 
  The Crown at the same time agrees that we should be concerned that under the 
  Provincial system her babies will be taken from her if born in prison. With 
  her encouragement we feel justice will be done by varying the sentence to one 
  of six months custody plus three years probation on the terms imposed by the 
  trial judge except for the term as to seeking out employment. We so order.</p>
