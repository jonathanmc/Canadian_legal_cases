<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released orally: June 13, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The Appellant (&quot;City Wide&quot;) appeals from the Order of the Justice 
  C. Marchand of the Superior Court of Justice dated the December 24, 2002 wherein 
  he found the Appellant in contempt of the Award of arbitrator Paul Craven dated 
  February 5, 2002. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] In order for there to be a finding of contempt the misconduct alleged must 
  be established beyond a reasonable doubt and the order or agreement sought to 
  be enforced must be clear and unequivocal. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appellant submits that the agreement reached between the parties was 
  ambiguous and that it should not have been found in contempt. We disagree. The 
  parties agreed to the divisor and to a numerator calculated by reference only 
  to dispatch tags. The appellant acknowledges that it has been calculating the 
  numerator by going beyond just the dispatch tags. To this extent there is no 
  doubt that both the order is clear and the violation is clear. Therefore to 
  this extent the company is in contempt. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed with costs payable to the respondent fixed at $7500.</p>
