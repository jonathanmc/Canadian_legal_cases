<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Robert P. Boissonneault, sitting with 
  a jury, dated November 19, 2001.</p>
<p>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent, Louanne Caza, sued the appellant, Dr. Charles Casselman, 
  for negligently administering a spinal anaesthesic causing sensory loss and 
  pain in her buttock and right thigh. After a trial presided over by Boissonneault 
  J., a jury found Dr. Casselman liable and awarded Ms. Caza damages. </p>
<p>
  [2] This appeal is against the finding of liability only. The grounds of appeal 
  addressed in these reasons relate to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting 
  the finding of causation, the adequacy of the trial judge's charge and his answer 
  to a question from the jury. In my view, the jury's verdict was reasonable and 
  the errors alleged did not result in an unfair trial or a miscarriage of justice. 
  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [3] Ms. Caza was scheduled to undergo an abdominal hysterectomy and Dr. Casselman 
  was to be the anaesthetist. He met Ms. Caza the evening prior to the scheduled 
  surgery. Following a discussion, Ms. Caza agreed to have the hysterectomy under 
  a spinal rather than a general anaesthesic. </p>
<p>
  [4] On the following morning, May 27, 1996, the appellant administered a spinal 
  anaesthetic and the operation was completed. </p>
<p>
  [5] There were several significant conflicts between the evidence of Ms. Caza 
  and Dr. Casselman about what happened with respect to the administration of 
  the spinal anaesthetic. </p>
<p>
  [6] Ms. Caza testified that Dr. Casselman did not say anything to her about 
  the risks of nerve damage during the pre-operative discussion. Dr. Casselman 
  said that he did, but that although it was his standard practice to chart such 
  a discussion, he did not do so on this occasion.</p>
<p>
  [7] Both Ms. Caza and Dr. Casselman agreed that Dr. Casselman started the procedure 
  by having Ms. Caza lie on her side and that Dr. Casselman's first three attempts 
  at inserting the spinal needle in the subarachnoid space of Ms. Caza's spine 
  were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
  [8] Ms. Caza testified that on the third attempt, she complained to Dr. Casselman 
  that her leg was sore and that it hurt down the side of her right thigh. She 
  said Dr. Casselman did not question her about the nature of the pain.</p>
<p>
  [9] Ms. Caza testified that after the third attempt, Dr. Casselman had her sit 
  up and lean forward over a pillow. He tried to insert the needle a fourth time 
  and she told him that her leg was getting very sore. Again, he did not inquire 
  about the nature of the pain, but did tell her that if he didn't get the needle 
  in soon, he would have to give her a general anaesthetic. </p>
<p>
  [10] Ms. Caza testified that when he inserted the needle on the fifth attempt, 
  &quot;I could feel it and my leg just caught on fire. It burned, it hurt, it 
  did everything and I told him that&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [11] Nevertheless, Dr. Casselman persisted and eventually he did inject the 
  anaesthetic. Her leg went numb and the surgery followed.</p>
<p>
  [12] Dr. Casselman's evidence about what happened from the third attempt onward 
  differed significantly. He testified that after he asked Ms. Caza to sit up, 
  he was successful in inserting the spinal needle in the subarachnoid space on 
  the first attempt in that position and the fourth overall. He testified that 
  he had no recollection of Ms. Caza complaining about pain, nor did he chart 
  any complaint. He testified that he would have noted a pain that sounded like 
  paresthesia, which is a tingling pain that could signify nerve damage. He was 
  confident that paresthesia did not happen.</p>
<p>
  [13] Dr. Casselman testified that if a patient said that he or she felt a pain 
  that seemed like paresthesia, he would stop injecting and assess the situation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] At trial, which was five and a half years after the surgery, it was accepted 
  that Ms. Caza suffered from continuing pain and a loss of sensitivity in her 
  buttock and right thigh. There was no evidence to suggest that Ms. Caza suffered 
  from this condition before the surgery. An important factual issue at trial 
  was when this condition first arose. </p>
<p>
  [15] Ms. Caza testified that she began experiencing the pain and loss of sensitivity 
  immediately after the surgery. She said that following the ebbing of the anaesthetic, 
  she had pain everywhere and that she complained to the hospital staff. However, 
  there was no record that she complained of the specific injury that gave rise 
  to the litigation. Ms. Caza also testified that she told her family doctor about 
  the pain in her buttock, hip and thigh during a visit three weeks after the 
  surgery. Again, there was no record of this complaint. The first documented 
  complaint that Ms. Caza was experiencing sensory problems and pain in her buttock 
  and right leg was not made until she visited her family doctor on August 27, 
  1996, three months after the surgery. In the interim, she had made several visits 
  to doctors. </p>
<p>
  [16] Ms. Caza's position throughout has been that her injury is the result of 
  damage to a nerve root which was inflicted when Dr. Casselman continued the 
  anaesthetic procedure after she complained of pain. Dr. Casselman, on the other 
  hand, asserts that Ms. Caza's injury is caused by a condition known as meralgia 
  paresthica, which is an entrapment or compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous 
  nerve that is completely unrelated to the spinal anaesthetic procedure. </p>
<p>
  [17] Ms. Caza's position was supported in varying degrees of certainty by the 
  evidence of a doctor and by reports from three doctors. </p>
<p>
  [18] In support of his position, Dr. Casselman relied on the evidence of three 
  doctors and one report from a doctor who had treated Ms. Caza. Dr. Casselman 
  attached particular importance to the evidence of Dr. Richard Moulton, a neurologist 
  who testified that it was not anatomically possible that Ms. Caza's complaints 
  could have been caused by the spinal injection. </p>
<p>
  [19] The first question left with the jury was: &quot;Was there any negligence 
  on the part of the defendant which caused injury to the plaintiff?&quot; The 
  jury answered, &quot;We the jury feel that on the balance of probabilities, 
  the plaintiff's injuries were caused by Dr. Casselman's negligence in failing 
  to investigate and document the complaint of pain by Louanne Caza and/or abandon 
  the procedure.&quot;</p>
<p>
  The Issues</p>
<p>
  [20] It is useful to begin by pointing out what is not at issue on this appeal. 
  The appellant does not challenge the way that the trial judge described the 
  standard of care to the jury, nor does he argue that there was not sufficient 
  evidence, which if accepted, could support a finding that the standard was breached.</p>
<p>
  [21] The parties were ad idem as to the standard of care required of the appellant 
  in administering a spinal anaesthetic. In his factum on this appeal, the respondent's 
  counsel summarized that standard as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a patient undergoing a spinal anaesthetic experiences paresthesia or unusual 
  pain, which is not transient in nature, that pain warns of risk of neural injury. 
  The doctor must question the patient and investigate the source of the pain, 
  document the pain and reassess the procedure undertaken. In the event that the 
  pain remains, the doctor must consider ending the procedure, consulting a more 
  experienced anaesthesiologist, switching to a general anaesthetic or canceling 
  the surgery altogether. The doctor does not persist with the procedure in the 
  face of such pain. </p>
<p>
  [22] The respondent's evidence, if accepted, disclosed a breach of the above 
  standard and the jury's finding of negligence came squarely within it.</p>
<p>
  [23] There are three issues that I address in these reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) Was there sufficient evidence to support a finding that 
  the appellant's negligence caused the respondent's injury?; </p>
<p class="indent">b) Was the trial judge's charge so defective as to necessitate 
  a new trial; and</p>
<p class="indent">c) Did the trial judge err in answering a question from the 
  jury?</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant challenged certain evidentiary rulings made by the trial 
  judge during the trial. However, the appellant's arguments in this area were 
  not pursued with vigour and were such that, even if accepted, would not warrant 
  interference by this court.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>
  (a) Causation</p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence upon which a 
  properly instructed jury could reasonably have found that the spinal anaesthetic 
  administered by the appellant caused the respondent's injury.</p>
<p>
  [26] In support of his argument, the appellant relies on his own evidence that 
  the appellant did not complain of pain at the time of the surgery and on what 
  he alleges are the weaknesses in the respondent's evidence that the onset of 
  her condition was at the time of the surgery. The appellant points to the fact 
  that there is no record of a complaint until three months later and suggests 
  that if the respondent had suffered the significant and painful injuries she 
  alleges, she would have complained much sooner and there would have been a record 
  of the complaint.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellant also relies heavily on the evidence of Dr. Moulton, the Head 
  of Neurosurgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. Dr. Moulton testified 
  that the respondent's theory of neural root damage having occurred during the 
  respondent's spinal anaesthetic was not anatomically possible because the respondent's 
  physical symptoms were inconsistent with such an injury. The respondent did 
  not experience motor loss or weakness as he would have expected if the spinal 
  injection had caused the injury. Moreover, the location of the respondent's 
  sensory loss did not conform with that which would result from a neural root 
  injury. Dr. Moulton testified that the respondent's injury was entirely consistent 
  with the condition known as meralgia paresthica, a condition unrelated to the 
  spinal injection administered by the appellant. The appellant emphasizes that 
  Dr. Moulton's evidence was not seriously challenged on cross-examination nor 
  was it rebutted by other evidence.</p>
<p>
  [28] There was, however, evidence to support the respondent's theory of neural 
  damage. First, there is the respondent's evidence concerning her complaints 
  of serious pain at the time of the spinal injection and immediately after the 
  operation. This evidence, if accepted, connected the onset of the respondent's 
  condition to the administration of the spinal anaesthetic. There was no suggestion 
  that the respondent had a pre-existing condition that could have caused the 
  pain.</p>
<p>
  [29] In finding that the appellant was negligent, the jury obviously accepted 
  the respondent's evidence about what happened at the time the spinal anaesthetic 
  was administered. It was also open to the jury to accept her evidence about 
  the onset of pain which linked her injury to the spinal injection. </p>
<p>
  [30] Moreover, there was medical evidence that the nature of the respondent's 
  condition - chronic rather than temporal - pointed to neural injury rather than 
  meralgia paresthica.</p>
<p>
  [31] In addition, the medical evidence relied upon by the respondent supported 
  the theory of neural injury. Dr. Bodley an anaesthetist, testified that the 
  pain in the respondent's right thigh had characteristics suggesting that it 
  developed from nerves that had been injured. Dr. Meloff, a neurologist, opined 
  that the persistent pain probably was due to nerve root irritation and it likely 
  was caused by the spinal anaesthetic. The weight of his opinion, however, was 
  diminished because he referred to the source of the sensory impairment as conforming 
  to the S-2, S-3 nerve root source rather than the L-2, L-3, which is the location 
  where the appellant injected the spinal anaesthetic. Whether this reference 
  by Dr. Meloff was due to inadvertence is not clear. Finally, the respondent 
  relied on letters from two other doctors, Dr. Schneider and Dr. O'Connor, who 
  at different times had seen the respondent, and whose diagnoses tended to support 
  the theory of nerve root damage. </p>
<p>
  [32] In my view, there was sufficient evidence upon which a properly instructed 
  jury could reasonably conclude that the appellant's negligence caused the respondent's 
  injury and, accordingly, I would not interfere with the jury's finding on causation. 
  </p>
<p>
  (b) The Trial Judge's Charge to the Jury</p>
<p>
  [33] The appellant raises a number of complaints about the trial judge's charge. 
  The first is general in nature and relates to the overall adequacy of the charge. 
  The appellant says that the charge was unbalanced, unfairly favouring the respondent, 
  that it was confusing and that it failed to properly set out the issues and 
  the evidence. Read as a whole, the appellant says that the charge did not provide 
  an adequate basis to enable the jury to reach a fair and just decision.</p>
<p>
  [34] A new trial in a civil jury case should not be ordered unless the interest 
  of justice plainly requires that to be done. See Brochu v. Pond (2002), 62 O.R. 
  (3d) 722 (C.A.); Mizzi v. Hopkins, [2003] O.J. No. 1671 (C.A.). Not all errors 
  made by a trial judge in charging a jury will lead to a new trial. The question 
  is whether the errors, which may include omissions, deprived the party of a 
  fair trial. In determining whether the trial has been fair, an appeal court 
  should look at the charge in the context of the entire trial and ask if the 
  jury would have understood the issues of fact, the relevant legal principles, 
  how the facts related to the law and the positions of the parties. A new trial 
  will only be ordered when the appeal court is satisfied that the trial judge's 
  errors have caused a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. </p>
<p>
  [35] This was not a particularly difficult trial. The issues on liability were 
  straightforward: did the defendant's conduct fall below the standard of care 
  and, if so, did that conduct cause the plaintiff's injury?</p>
<p>
  [36] In addition, the evidence was not complicated. The conflict between the 
  respondent's and the appellant's evidence was apparent and easily understood. 
  The difference in the parties' positions as to what caused the respondent's 
  injury was also clear. There were two choices - neural damage caused by the 
  spinal injection or meralgia paresthica. There was evidence that pointed to 
  each. </p>
<p>
  [37] At trial, both parties were represented by experienced counsel who in their 
  closing addresses, clearly set out the issues, their positions and the evidence 
  relied upon in support of those positions.</p>
<p>
  [38] The trial judge's charge properly identified the issues, and the question 
  left with the jury correctly addressed the issues of negligence and causation. 
  The jury's answer to that question indicates that they understood the issues.</p>
<p>
  [39] The trial judge's charge contained some errors. On a few occasions, he 
  misstated the evidence and on one instance he misstated a legal principle. I 
  will deal with these misstatements below. In addition, I think it is fair to 
  say that the trial judge's review of the evidence may have led the jury to believe 
  that he was sympathetic to the respondent's version of events, although he does 
  not specifically say that was the case. That said, the trial judge was careful 
  to repeat on several occasions, that it was the jury's view of the facts, not 
  his, that should govern their decision.</p>
<p>
  [40] I have read the charge carefully and I am not satisfied that the overall 
  tenor of the trial judge's charge was unfair or that it resulted in a miscarriage 
  of justice. As I have said above, there was an evidentiary base to support the 
  jury's verdict.</p>
<p>
  [41] Although I am not sure much turns on it, it is interesting to note that 
  at the conclusion of the charge, both counsel raised objections. Indeed, respondent's 
  counsel (not Mr. Pape) took strong, albeit somewhat overstated, exception to 
  the charge saying that it was fatally flawed. His primary concerns related to 
  matters not in issue on this appeal, the standard of care and damages. The appellant's 
  counsel also objected raising many of the same specific issues that are now 
  raised on this appeal. After hearing the objections, the trial judge did not 
  recharge the jury.</p>
<p>
  [42] Let me then turn to the more significant, specific complaints raised by 
  the appellant about the trial judge's charge. </p>
<p>
  [43] The first relates to three misstatements of the evidence. In summarizing 
  the appellant's evidence, the trial judge incorrectly said that the appellant 
  testified that when administering an anaesthetic, he is always talking to the 
  patient in order to avoid meralgia paresthica. In fact, the appellant's evidence 
  was that his concern was paresthesia. Indeed, it was the appellant's position 
  that the condition of meralgia paresthica cannot be caused by a spinal anaesthetic. 
  </p>
<p>
  [44] I am satisfied that the jury would not have been misled by this slip by 
  the trial judge. The appellant's position that the respondent suffered from 
  meralgia paresthica and that that condition was unrelated to a spinal anaesthetic 
  was perfectly clear from the evidence, the addresses and indeed, from the charge 
  read as a whole.</p>
<p>
  [45] Next, when describing the surgery in his charge, the trial judge said, 
  &quot;Ms. Caza, you will recall, complained&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [46] Of course, there was a dispute whether she did complain or not. The appellant 
  argued that this statement could have misled the jury. I disagree. The evidence, 
  the addresses and the balance of the charge made it plain that the jury had 
  to decide whether the respondent complained as she testified or whether she 
  did not as the appellant testified.</p>
<p>
  [47] Finally, the trial judge said to the jury when referring to the spinal 
  anaesthetic: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You may ask yourselves why the fourth insertion then, while she was sitting, 
  was not noted.</p>
<p>
  [48] In fact, the appellant had made a note of the fourth attempt. Earlier in 
  his charge, the trial judge had flagged the issue of the appellant's note, directed 
  the jury to look at it and to draw their own conclusion about it. Again, I am 
  satisfied that the jury would not have been misled.</p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge's factual misstatements set out above were, in my view, 
  minor in nature and were adequately addressed by the trial judge's direction 
  to the jury that they rely on their own recollections and assessment of the 
  evidence, not his. </p>
<p>
  [50] Next, the appellant argues the trial judge improperly communicated to the 
  jury that the appellant was insured. In his charge, the trial judge referred 
  to Dr. Skjenna, a defence witness, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  He provides medical evaluations and functional capacity evaluations for business 
  and industry and insurance companies.</p>
<p>
  [51] When being qualified as an expert, in his examination-in-chief, Dr. Skjenna 
  made reference to his insurance work and was cross-examined about it. There 
  was no objection to this evidence. The reference in the charge merely repeated 
  what he had said about his qualifications and did not highlight the insurance 
  aspect. There was no objection to this part of the charge. I see no merit to 
  this complaint.</p>
<p>
  [52] Next, the appellant complains about the trial judge's direction on the 
  law of causation. At one point in his charge, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If you find that the conduct of Dr. Casselman was negligent, and that the negligent 
  conduct more likely than not increased the risk of harm to Louanne, then I suggest 
  that you can - you may infer that the spinal caused the injury.</p>
<p>
  [53] The reference to increasing the risk of harm was an error. However, immediately 
  after this error, the trial judge correctly set out the need to show that the 
  spinal anaesthetic caused the injury. Indeed, at several points throughout the 
  charge, the trial judge instructed the jury correctly on the law of causation, 
  clearly setting out the requirement that the plaintiff prove that the defendant's 
  negligence was the cause of the injury. On one occasion, he referred to the 
  need to prove proximate cause and pointed out that proximate cause is the cause 
  that produces the injury and without which the result would not have happened. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] Read as a whole, the charge fairly set out the law on causation. In my 
  view, the impugned passage does not warrant interference by this court.</p>
<p>
  [55] Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge erroneously referred 
  to opinions contained in the reports of two doctors relied upon by the respondent 
  for proof of the truth of those opinions.</p>
<p>
  [56] The manner in which those reports were treated at trial is important to 
  a discussion of this issue. The respondent did not serve any notices under the 
  Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 23 prior to trial. The respondent prepared 
  a brief containing her medical records which included the two reports in question. 
  At the beginning of the trial, submissions were made about the evidentiary basis 
  upon which these reports were being tendered. The respondent's counsel indicated 
  that they were being tendered as business records under s. 35 of the Evidence 
  Act.</p>
<p>
  [57] The appellant's counsel pointed out the two reports in issue contained 
  medical opinions and that the respondent was attempting to treat these reports 
  as expert reports under s. 52 of the Evidence Act. He further submitted that 
  if they were being tendered as such, the doctors must be produced for cross-examination 
  at least with respect to the opinions in the reports.</p>
<p>
  [58] It was agreed that the brief of documents would be entered and that the 
  two reports would be treated as business records. It seems to be implicit in 
  this agreement that the two reports would be used only to prove the history 
  of treatment and not as proof of the truth of the opinions. The two doctors 
  in question were not called as witnesses. However, as the trial progressed, 
  the parties did not treat the reports of these two doctors as had been agreed 
  upon at the outset. For example, the appellant called Dr. Kroneberg, an expert 
  in anaesthesiology, who testified that he relied upon these reports in forming 
  the opinions that he expressed at trial. The respondent's counsel cross-examined 
  Dr. Kroneberg at length about these reports. There was no objection. </p>
<p>
  [59] Moreover, in his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant implicitly 
  accepted that the opinions in the reports were in evidence. He referred to the 
  diagnoses in the reports which supported the respondent's theory on causation 
  and attempted to distinguish them. Finally, appellant's counsel did not object 
  to the trial judge's references in his charge to the opinions in the two reports. 
  </p>
<p>
  [60] I am satisfied that the arrangement made at the beginning of trial, with 
  respect to how these reports would be treated, changed and that the trial judge 
  made no error in referring to the opinions in the reports in his charge.</p>
<p>
  [61] The appellant's remaining objections to the trial judge's charge are not 
  such that, even if valid, would warrant interference by this court. </p>
<p>
  (c) The Jury's Question</p>
<p>
  [62] During the course of its deliberations, the jury asked the following question: 
  &quot;Can there be causation without negligence?&quot; </p>
<p>
  [63] After hearing submissions, the trial judge answered the question by saying: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now in the context of negligence cases, the plaintiff must prove, number one, 
  that there was negligence on the part of the defendant, that there was an injury 
  and that the negligence caused that injury. Like, there's a cause and effect 
  for everything, but we're talking about the law of negligence now, so the simple 
  answer, &quot;Can there be causation without negligence?&quot; The answer is 
  no. In the context of the law of negligence, first, there must be negligence 
  proven, so you just have it upside down here.</p>
<p>
  [64] The appellant argues that the question did not make sense and that it showed 
  that the jury did not understand the relationship between negligence and causation. 
  Further, the appellant says that the trial judge should have answered by saying, 
  &quot;Yes, this injury could be caused without negligence&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [65] In my view, it is not a useful exercise to speculate what lay behind the 
  jury's question. The trial judge's answer was proper. He accurately set out 
  the framework for analyzing the issues in a negligence case. Even if the jury 
  had been confused about how to approach those issues, the trial judge's answer 
  made it clear how they should go about their task. Moreover, when the jury did 
  deliver its verdict, their answer to the first question demonstrated that they 
  understood the requirement that the negligence of the appellant must have caused 
  the respondent's injuries.</p>
<p>
  [66] I see no merit to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>Disposition</p>
<p>
  [67] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs. I would fix the respondent's 
  costs on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $25,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
