<p>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice D. S. Ferguson of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated February 19, 2001 and from the 
  sentence imposed dated October 12, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted after trial by judge and jury of one count 
  of indecent assault involving his daughter, D.L., and one count of sexual assault 
  against his granddaughter, J.H. He was sentenced to two consecutive six-month 
  conditional sentences, with conditions that he attend counselling, that he not 
  leave his residence except for certain limited purposes, and that he not receive 
  visitors, except blood relatives and his minister. He appeals against his conviction 
  and sentence.</p>
<p>CONVICTION APPEAL<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Of the various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant, we are satisfied 
  that the trial judge's instructions to the jury on the rules governing the use 
  and application of similar fact evidence were deficient. In particular, we believe 
  that the trial judge failed to give an adequate limiting instruction on the 
  use the jury could make of the similar fact evidence and he further failed to 
  instruct the jury on the issue of collusion. In view of this, the convictions 
  cannot stand and a new trial must be ordered. For this reason, we do not intend 
  to recite the facts in detail.<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appellant was charged in 1999 with one count of indecent assault against 
  his daughter D.L., and one count of sexual assault against his granddaughter 
  J.H. J.H. is D.L.'s daughter.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The charge relating to D.L. was historical in nature, dating back to 1969 
  when D.L. was thirteen years old. According to D.L., from 1969 to 1973, when 
  she was in her teens, the appellant repeatedly massaged her in a sexual fashion. 
  In her testimony, she was able to recall four specific incidents in which the 
  appellant, while purporting to massage her, engaged in various forms of sexual 
  misconduct such as lifting her top, touching her bare back, sides, and stomach, 
  pulling her bra straps down, and on one occasion, pressing his erect penis against 
  her back.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The charge of sexual assault involving J.H. is much more recent. It relates 
  to an incident in 1999 when J.H., who was then nineteen years old, slept over 
  at the appellant's home one night.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] According to J.H., on the night in question, the sexual activity commenced 
  when the appellant knelt down in front of her while she was watching television 
  and began massaging her legs and upper thighs. Later that evening, after she 
  had gone to bed, she stated that the appellant entered her room, got into bed 
  beside her, rubbed her bare back, upper thighs, and buttocks, and kissed her 
  several times on the back of her neck.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] While that incident forms the basis of the sexual assault charge, J.H. 
  was permitted to give similar fact evidence about two earlier incidents, one 
  when she was age nine and the other age thirteen, in which the appellant rubbed 
  her stomach and legs and pressed his erect penis against her back.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] In addition to the similar fact evidence presented by J.H., two of the 
  appellant's other daughters, J.S. and S.S., were also permitted to give similar 
  fact evidence. Both daughters testified about receiving massages of a sexual 
  nature from the appellant and both related incidents in which the appellant 
  placed his erect penis against their backs. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] The appellant testified on his own behalf. He readily admitted to massaging 
  his daughters and his granddaughter but claimed that the massages were friendly, 
  given out of love, and non-sexual in nature.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Apart from the similar fact evidence, which, if believed, portrayed the 
  appellant as a person of bad character, the Crown led additional evidence from 
  D.L. and J.H. which also placed him in a bad light. That evidence, which the 
  trial judge accurately recognized as extrinsic evidence of bad character, related 
  in part to the appellant's conduct towards D.L. and J.H. after he had been charged. 
  In relation to D.L., the appellant (on the advice of counsel) terminated her 
  from her senior position at his company; in J.H.'s case, the appellant stopped 
  paying her university tuition. As a result of the appellant's alleged sexual 
  misconduct towards D.L. and J.H., as well as his termination of D.L. from the 
  business, D.L. and J.H. commenced a civil action against him seeking substantial 
  damages. That action was outstanding at the time of the criminal trial. <br>
</p>
<p>[11] Against this backdrop, we turn to the trial judge's instructions on the 
  similar fact evidence adduced by the Crown.<br>
</p>
<p>FAILURE TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE LIMITING INSTRUCTION<br>
</p>
<p>Opening Remarks to the Jury<br>
</p>
<p>[12] In his opening remarks to the jury, the trial judge explained a number 
  of legal principles. In doing so, he indicated that &quot;during the trial and 
  again at the end of the trial&quot;, he would provide &quot;more specific and 
  detailed instructions about the rules of law that apply to this case.&quot; 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[13] With respect to the similar fact evidence that had been ruled admissible 
  prior to the selection of the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury in some 
  detail about the rules governing its use and misuse. Those instructions are 
  reproduced in full below:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes our law allows jurors to consider evidence 
  only for a specific purpose in deciding a case. If that happens here I will 
  tell you how you may use the evidence in deciding this case. I may tell you 
  when you hear the evidence but I will certainly tell you at the end of the evidence 
  before you go out to deliberate. You must consider such evidence only for the 
  purpose that I describe. You must not consider or use it for any other purpose.<br>
  In this case the Crown is going to call some women witnesses in addition to 
  the two women named in the charges you are trying. Those other witnesses are 
  relatives of the two alleged victims in this case and are expected to say that 
  [C.B.] also touched them in a sexual manner.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to telling about the incidents which are 
  the subject of the charge it's anticipated that the two alleged victims named 
  in the charges may tell you about other incidents which you may think are similar 
  to those included in the charges.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is important at the outset that you understand how 
  you may use this evidence and how you may not use it. First, the other incidents 
  related by the witnesses are not matters with which [C.B.] is charged with. 
  If you conclude he did the other acts you must not punish him for it by finding 
  him guilty of the offenses before the court. You may not use this evidence as 
  a basis to conclude that [C.B.] is a bad person and therefore reason that that 
  makes it likely he committed the offenses in the charges before the court. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">If you find the incidents as described by the witnesses 
  did happen and if you find that they have a significant similarity to the incidents 
  which are charged in the two charges before the court then you may but are not 
  required to use the evidence of the other incidents for these purposes as evidence 
  which may tend to show that the alleged victims named in the two charges are 
  telling the truth. Secondly, as evidence that the touching alleged in the two 
  charges was done for a sexual purpose. <br>
</p>
<p>[14] Pausing here, to the extent that the trial judge chose to provide this 
  type of instruction to the jury in his opening remarks, we find nothing objectionable 
  in what was said.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The trial judge did not restate these instructions or provide any further 
  instructions at the time the similar fact evidence was admitted into evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>The Charge<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The trial judge devoted almost one-quarter of his sixty-page charge to 
  the similar fact evidence. He began his instructions on this subject by reminding 
  the jury that the appellant was on trial only for the offences in the indictment 
  and he summarized the key issues that the jury would need to consider in determining 
  whether those offences had been made out. He then referred to the similar fact 
  evidence and, after cautioning the jury that the appellant was not on trial 
  for &quot;that other conduct&quot;, he continued as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; Be careful not to jump to the conclusion that 
  just because the acts appear similar the offenses charged must have taken place.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can consider other similar conduct for two purposes. 
  First, to assess the credibility of [D.L.] and [J.H.] as to what they say happened. 
  Second, to determine whether the touching was indecent or of a sexual nature.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">You may but do not have to find that there is a pattern 
  of similar behaviour that confirms the testimony of [D.L.] or of [J.H.] that 
  the offenses took place. It is for you to say. In considering this evidence 
  bear in mind the relationship between [C.B.], [D.L.], [J.H.] and the witnesses 
  who testified about the other conduct, as well as the circumstances of each 
  situation.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The trial judge then devoted the next ten pages of his charge to a thorough 
  review of the similar fact evidence, following which, he directed the jury to 
  look for similarities in the incidents in deciding whether &quot;a pattern of 
  similar behaviour exists.&quot; After reviewing some of the similar features 
  in the evidence given by the various witnesses, he ended his instructions with 
  the following admonitions to the jury:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">You must be careful not to jump to the conclusion that 
  because one complainant is telling the truth the person named as the victim 
  in the charge is telling the truth. Nor must you jump to the conclusion that 
  because all of the complaints allege similar conduct they must have all occurred. 
  It is up to the Crown to prove each charge independently.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Whether or not you use the evidence of the other conduct 
  to help you decide this case, you must not find [C.B.] guilty of any offence 
  unless the Crown counsel has satisfied you of all the essential elements of 
  that offence beyond a reasonable doubt.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Later in the charge, the trial judge dealt separately with the evidence 
  surrounding D.L.'s termination from the appellant's business and the appellant's 
  refusal to pay J.H's university tuition. Recognizing that that evidence might 
  cause the jury to view the appellant in a bad light, the trial judge cautioned 
  the jury about its use in these terms:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">During the trial both sides introduced evidence about 
  conduct of [C.B.] which might be considered by you to be misconduct. For instance, 
  you heard evidence of how [C.B.] and his wife separated, how the children came 
  to live with [C.B.] and the grandparents, what happened at C.C. Marine involving 
  pranks, the disputes at work among the daughters and how [C.B.] fired one or 
  more of them, the dispute that arose about [D.L.'s] absence and her termination, 
  the evidence about not paying for [J.H.'s] university.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This evidence can be used by you in assessing the credibility 
  of the women and [C.B.]. You must not consider this evidence as showing that 
  [C.B.] was of bad character and from that, reason that he was more likely to 
  have committed the offenses as charged in this case [emphasis added].</p>
<p>Objections to the Charge<br>
</p>
<p>[19] Both defence and Crown counsel objected to the instructions on similar 
  fact evidence. Each maintained that the trial judge had failed to warn the jury 
  that they must not use the similar fact evidence to show that the appellant 
  was a person of general bad character and for that reason, more likely to have 
  committed the offences for which he was charged. <br>
</p>
<p>[20] The trial judge refused to give effect to the joint objection. In his 
  view, once it was accepted that the similar fact evidence was admissible to 
  show a pattern of behaviour which the jury could use to infer that the appellant's 
  conduct was both intentional and committed for an improper purpose, the bad 
  character instruction would make it &quot;hard [for the jury] to distinguish 
  that from the permissible use.&quot; The trial judge further indicated that 
  in deciding to leave matters as they stood, he had used the wording of the model 
  instructions recently released by &quot;a team of judges and counsel from across 
  Canada.&quot; <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a><br>
</p>
<p>Analysis <br>
</p>
<p>[21] In order to assess the adequacy of the instructions given by the trial 
  judge, it is necessary to step back and consider the dangers associated with 
  the admission of similar fact evidence where, as in this case, that evidence 
  takes the form of prior bad acts. The dangers in question were summarized succinctly 
  by Cory J. in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 339 (S.C.C.) as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As Sopinka J. noted in R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 
  111 at pp. 127-28, 50 C.C.C. (3d) 142, there are three potential dangers associated 
  with evidence of prior bad acts: (1) the jury may find that the accused is a 
  &quot;bad person&quot; who is likely to be guilty of the offence charged; (2) 
  they may punish the accused for past misconduct by finding the accused guilty 
  of the offence charged; or (3) they may simply become confused by having their 
  attention deflected from the main purpose of their deliberations, and substitute 
  their verdict on another matter for their verdict on the charge being tried. 
  &#133;<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Of particular concern in the case at hand are the prohibited lines of 
  reasoning identified in the above passage as the first and second dangers.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] With respect to the first danger, the concern is that the jury might rely 
  on the similar fact evidence to convict the appellant on the basis that he is 
  a man of general bad character and therefore more likely to be guilty of the 
  offences charged. With respect to the second, the concern is that the jury might 
  convict the appellant for the offences charged out of a desire to punish him 
  for prior misconduct, especially as here, where the earlier misconduct has gone 
  unpunished.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] In Arp, supra, at p. 353, Cory J. pointed out that the danger that a jury 
  will engage in the prohibited lines of reasoning &quot;is avoided by the strict 
  test for admissibility which ensures that the evidence is sufficiently probative 
  to outweigh the risk of prejudicial misuse, coupled with a cautionary instruction 
  against making improper use of the evidence&quot; [emphasis added]. At p. 356, 
  Cory J. identified the type of cautionary instruction that should be included 
  in &quot;a proper charge&quot; where, as in Arp, the similar fact evidence is 
  admitted to prove identity on a multi-count indictment. The instruction is fifth 
  in a list of seven factors to be included in the charge and reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The jury must be warned that they are not to use 
  the evidence on one count to infer that the accused is a person whose character 
  or disposition is such that he or she is likely to have committed the offence 
  or offences charged in the other count or counts.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="judgmentindent">[</span>25] Manifestly, the cautionary instruction 
  envisaged by Cory J. is not limited to cases in which the similar fact evidence 
  is introduced to prove identity in a multi-count indictment. On the contrary, 
  this court and the Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly stated that this 
  type of cautionary instruction must be given to the jury in all cases where 
  the dangers associated with &quot;bad personhood&quot; reasoning exist. (See 
  for example R. v. Shearing (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 249 (S.C.C.); R. v. 
  D.(L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111 at 127-28; R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697 
  at 733-34; R. v. M. (B.) (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 370-71 (Ont. C.A.); 
  R. v. W. (L.K.) (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 471-72 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. 
  McDonald (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 273 at 291-92 (Ont. C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[26] With respect, we are of the view that the impugned instruction (which 
  is reproduced below for convenience) falls short of the mark:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">You must be careful not to jump to the conclusion that 
  because one complainant is telling the truth the person named as the victim 
  in the charge is telling the truth. Nor must you jump to the conclusion that 
  because all of the complaints allege similar conduct they must have all occurred. 
  It is up to the Crown to prove each charge independently. </p>
<p class="indent">Whether or not you use the evidence of the other conduct to 
  help you decide this case, you must not find [C.B.] guilty of any offence unless 
  the Crown counsel has satisfied you of all the essential elements of that offence 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a><br>
</p>
[27] Commencing with the first danger, that the jury will reason to guilt through 
general disposition, we do not think that the impugned instruction addresses that 
concern. This part of the instruction is important for another purpose. It reinforces 
for the jury the fact that even if they accept and rely upon the similar fact 
evidence, it is only one piece of evidence and it must be weighed, with the other 
evidence, in assessing guilt or innocence. They must not use it to &quot;jump 
to&quot; a conclusion of guilt. As for the second danger, that the jury will convict 
to punish the appellant for prior bad acts, especially acts which have gone unpunished, 
the instruction is silent.<br>
  <br>
  [28] The concern expressed by the trial judge about the cautionary instruction 
  is that the jury could view it as contradictory of the permissible use the jury 
  was entitled to make of the similar fact evidence (a pattern of behaviour which 
  the jury could use to infer that the appellant's conduct was both intentional 
  and committed for an improper purpose, see paragraph 20 above). While we appreciate 
  the trial judge's concern, we are respectfully of the view that it fails to 
  take into account the difference between specific and general propensity reasoning, 
  as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 401 (S.C.C.), and in R. v. Shearing, supra. In those cases, the Supreme 
  Court explained that propensity reasoning, in and of itself, is not prohibited. 
  What the jury is not entitled to do is engage in general propensity reasoning, 
  that is, to conclude from the accused's past conduct that the accused is a disreputable 
  or generally bad person, and for that reason, is more likely to have committed 
  the offence or offences charged. In fairness, we note that the trial judge did 
  not have the benefit of those decisions at the time of trial.<br>
<p>[29] In addition to the problem identified, we note that nowhere in the instruction 
  is the jury told that they must first be satisfied that the similar acts occurred 
  before any use can be made of them. In our view, that too is a serious deficiency.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] Before this court, Crown counsel took the position that to the extent 
  the instructions in the charge were found to be deficient, the error should 
  be treated as harmless because of the instructions given to the jury by the 
  trial judge in his opening remarks.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] With respect, we disagree. The opening remarks, given in the course of 
  twenty-four pages of opening instructions without an evidentiary context, had 
  little chance of being remembered by the jury seven days later when they began 
  their deliberations.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Apart from the time lag between the opening remarks and the jury deliberations, 
  there is another reason for rejecting the Crown's &quot;no harm&quot; submission. 
  As pointed out earlier, in his charge, the trial judge directed the jury to 
  other evidence that portrayed the appellant as a person of bad character (terminating 
  D.L. from his place of business and refusing the pay J.H.'s university tuition) 
  and he instructed the jury, in clear terms, that they could &quot;not consider 
  this evidence as showing that [C.B.] was of bad character and from that, reason 
  that he was more likely to have committed the offences as charged in this case.&quot; 
  In our view, that instruction, while correct, only served to exacerbate the 
  failure to give a similar warning in relation to the similar fact evidence, 
  especially in these circumstances where the similar fact evidence was far more 
  extensive and potentially prejudicial to the appellant. (See R. v. N. (R.K.) 
  (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 40 at 47 (Ont. C.A.)).<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Before leaving this issue, we think it might be helpful to comment briefly 
  on the nature and extent of the cautionary instruction that should be given 
  to best address the two dangers of concern outlined above.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] To date, the cautionary instruction given to juries has generally taken 
  the form suggested by Cory J. in R. v. Arp, supra, at p. 356 (see paragraph 
  24 above). That instruction, which essentially tells the jury that they must 
  not use the similar fact evidence to infer that the accused is a person likely, 
  by reason of his or her general bad character, to have committed the offence 
  or offences charged, is clearly acceptable. In our view, however, it tends to 
  focus more on the first danger (reasoning to guilt through general disposition) 
  than on the second danger (convicting on the offences charged to punish the 
  accused for prior misdeeds). <br>
</p>
<p>[35] Accordingly, in the future, when cautioning the jury about the misuse 
  of similar fact evidence, we think it would be preferable for trial judges to 
  give the jury the double warning: (1) that they may not use the similar fact 
  evidence to reason from general disposition or character to guilt, and (2) nor 
  may they use it to punish the accused for past misconduct by finding the accused 
  guilty of the offence or offences charged.<br>
</p>
<p>COLLUSION<br>
</p>
<p>[36] There was evidence that the witnesses had had some discussions and opportunities 
  for communication with each other regarding the events complained of. J.H., 
  the granddaughter of the appellant, told her mother, D.L., about the events 
  of August 16, 1999 on the following day, whereupon D.L. told her, for the first 
  time, about her experiences with the appellant. At that time, J.H. also told 
  her mother about her prior experiences with her grandfather. Although D.L. did 
  not believe she had told anyone else about the incidents with her father, her 
  sister J.S. thought that she had discussed the matter with her sisters D.L. 
  and S.S. when they were growing up. J.S. also said she spoke with J.H. and S.S. 
  before she spoke to the police. S.S. also testified that she discussed the incidents 
  with her sisters J.S. and K.W. <br>
</p>
<p>[37] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct 
  the jury that, as part of their assessment of whether they would put any weight 
  on the similar fact evidence, they must consider the possibility of collusion 
  among the witnesses and the effect of any collusion on the similarity and coincidence 
  of the details of the similar fact evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] In R. v. Handy, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified how a trial 
  judge is to deal with the problem of collusion when assessing the admissibility 
  of similar fact evidence, and after deciding to admit the evidence, instructing 
  the jury. Binnie J. first explained the importance of collusion as a factor 
  to be considered by the trial judge in deciding whether to admit the similar 
  fact evidence. He stated at para. 110:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; Cogency is derived from the improbability of 
  coincidence. Collusion is a factor, yes, but more than that it is a crucial 
  factor because the existence of collusion rebuts the premise on which admissibility 
  depends.<br>
</p>
<p>[39] As part of the gatekeeping function, the trial judge must be satisfied, 
  on a balance of probabilities, that the similar fact evidence is reliable. Therefore, 
  &quot;where &#133; there is some evidence of actual collusion, or at least an 
  'air of reality' to the allegations, the Crown is required to satisfy the trial 
  judge, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence of similar facts is 
  not tainted with collusion. That much would gain admission. It would then be 
  for the jury to make the ultimate determination of its worth&quot; (para. 112).<br>
</p>
<p>[40] Collusion can arise both from a deliberate agreement to concoct evidence 
  as well as from communication among witnesses that can have the effect, whether 
  consciously or unconsciously, of colouring and tailoring their descriptions 
  of the impugned events. In this case there was evidence of, or at least the 
  opportunity for collusion in the various discussions regarding the incidents 
  reported by the complainants. Furthermore, taken together with the anger regarding 
  the dismissal and pay issues between one complainant and the appellant and the 
  joint lawsuit by the complainants for damages, there was clearly an air of reality 
  to the possibility of collusion in this case. <br>
</p>
<p>[41] It was therefore incumbent on the trial judge, in considering the admissibility 
  of the similar fact evidence, to determine whether he was satisfied on a balance 
  of probabilities that the evidence was not tainted by collusion. In his ruling 
  admitting the similar fact evidence, the trial judge did specifically refer 
  to the fact that the witnesses had discussed some of the evidence with each 
  other.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] However, having admitted the evidence, the trial judge gave the jury no 
  assistance as to its role in considering the possibility of collusion when assessing 
  the similar fact evidence. The problem was compounded by Crown counsel's jury 
  address in which she suggested that there had been no collusion among the witnesses 
  and therefore their allegations about the appellant must be true.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] In R. v. Shearing, supra, the facts regarding the possibility of collusion 
  were remarkably similar to those in the case at bar. Some of the complainants 
  in respect of the alleged sexual assaults had been in touch with each other 
  prior to the trial and, as in this case, civil proceedings had been commenced. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada referred with approval to the trial judge's instructions 
  to the jury on the collusion issue in that case as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; [the trial judge] instructed the jury to consider 
  &quot;all of the circumstances which affect the reliability of that evidence 
  including the possibility of collusion or collaboration between the complainants&quot;. 
  He defined collusion as the possibility that the complainants in sharing their 
  stories with one another, intentionally or accidentally allowed themselves to 
  change or modify their stories in order that their testimony would seem more 
  similar and more convincing. It was for the jury to make the ultimate determination 
  whether the evidence was &quot;reliable despite the opportunity for collaboration&quot; 
  or that &quot;less weight or no weight should be given to evidence which may 
  have been influenced by the sharing of information&quot; (para. 44).<br>
</p>
<p>[44] In this case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to alert the jury in 
  a similar way to their duty to consider the possibility of collusion when assessing 
  what effect to give to the similar fact evidence that they had heard.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] We are of the view that the trial judge was in error in failing to instruct 
  the jury on the issue of collusion. <a href="#1">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a><br>
</p>
<p>OTHER GROUNDS OF APPEAL<br>
</p>
<p>[46] The appellant raised a number of other issues which we do not propose 
  to address. Suffice it to say that in our view, none amounted to reversible 
  error. <br>
</p>
<p>[47] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is allowed, the convictions are 
  set aside and a new trial is ordered. In view of this conclusion, we make no 
  comment about the sentence.</p>
