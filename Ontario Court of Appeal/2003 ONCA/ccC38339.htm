<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The male appellants are brothers and are married to the female appellants. 
  The brothers operated Payrite Petroleums (Payrite) which was in the business 
  of supplying gasoline to retailers. Their wives owned all of the shares of Payrite 
  and were also secured creditors of the company.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent (Budget) supplied gasoline to Payrite on terms which required 
  Payrite to pay Budget some seven or eight days after delivery of the gas. Payrite 
  was constantly indebted to Budget in varying, but always, large amounts. Although 
  Budget had security for this indebtedness at one time, it had no security in 
  the fall of 1996.</p>
<p>
  [3] By September 1996, Payrite was in serious financial difficulty and was in 
  all likelihood insolvent. The brothers began to &quot;kite&quot; cheques among 
  the various Payrite bank accounts, thereby increasing the apparent cash flow 
  and camouflaging to some extent the financial difficulties of Payrite. Between 
  September 1996 and early January 1997, Payrite continued to purchase gasoline 
  from Budget and pay for it in accordance with the arrangement described above.</p>
<p>
  [4] On January 2, 1997, the female appellants wrote to Payrite acknowledging 
  the Payrite's dire financial straits and demanding immediate payment of the 
  money owed to them by Payrite. The demand was served on the male appellants 
  on January 9, 1997. </p>
<p>
  [5] The male appellants continued to order gasoline from Budget for about two 
  weeks after receiving the demand letter. They gave Budget three cheques to cover 
  some of the deliveries, but those cheques were not honoured. No cheques were 
  provided for other deliveries made after January 9. The total value of the gasoline 
  delivered by Budget after January 9, 1997 less provincial and federal taxes 
  was $539,658.41. This was the amount awarded in damages by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [6] The cheque &quot;kiting&quot; was discontinued on about January 20,1997. 
  Instead of continuing to circulate cash among the various accounts, the brothers 
  caused about $400,000 to be paid out to themselves, their wives and their lawyers. 
  Most of that money came from Payrite's sale of the gasoline it acquired, but 
  did not pay for, from Budget after January 9, 1997.</p>
<p>
  [7] In late January 1997, on motion by the female appellants, a private receiver 
  was installed over the affairs of Payrite. A month later, Budget brought proceedings 
  to petition Payrite into bankruptcy. Payrite was eventually petitioned into 
  bankruptcy in July of 1997. This action has proceeded pursuant to an assignment 
  to Budget by the trustee in bankruptcy of Payrite.</p>
<p>
  [8] At trial Budget alleged fraud and sought relief under the oppression provisions 
  of the Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. B.16.</p>
<p>
  [9] In finding that Budget had established fraud, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Here, the plaintiff had suffered grave economic loss as the 
  result of the kiting operation&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">From September 1996 to the end of January 1997, the defendants 
  caused Payrite to purchase petroleum products from the plaintiff and Brown Fuels 
  Ltd. knowing that Payrite was insolvent and with intent not to pay and with 
  the intent of using the funds generated to pay themselves or others.</p>
<p>[10] The &quot;kiting&quot; of the cheques did not constitute a misrepresentation 
  made by the appellants to Budget. Nor did the &quot;kiting&quot; cause Budget 
  any economic loss. If anything, the &quot;kiting&quot; allowed Payrite to continue 
  to pay its suppliers, including Budget, at the risk of economic loss to the 
  banks. The &quot;kiting&quot; activity was properly part of the case, in that 
  it demonstrated Payrite's dire financial condition and served as a prelude to 
  the events of January 1997. It did not however establish any fraud by the appellants 
  against Budget.</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge also made a factual error when he found that there was 
  no intention to pay Budget for its product from September 1996 to the end of 
  January 1997. Budget was paid for all of its products until January 9, 1997. 
  It was only after January 9 that the payments ceased.</p>
<p>
  [12] Despite the errors referred to above, we would uphold the trial judge's 
  finding of fraud and the damages awarded by him. It was common ground that Payrite 
  received gasoline from Budget, sold it, and did not pay Budget for the gasoline. 
  The detriment to Budget is obvious. There can also be no doubt that the gasoline 
  was acquired from Budget on the basis of an implied representation by Payrite 
  that it would pay for the gas in accordance with the established arrangement 
  between Payrite and Budget. The crucial question insofar as the allegation of 
  fraud was concerned was whether some, or all, of the appellants knew when the 
  orders were placed that Payrite would not pay for the gasoline in due course 
  and in accordance with the established arrangement. </p>
<p>
  [13] The evidence establishes beyond any question that all of the appellants 
  knew that Payrite could not continue as a going concern after January 2, 1997, 
  unless the female appellants were prepared to forego repayment of their debt. 
  The evidence is equally clear that all appellants knew that the female appellants 
  were not prepared to forego payment. The evidence also establishes beyond any 
  doubt that the brothers continued to order gasoline from Budget as if it was 
  business as usual, knowing full well that Payrite could not continue to operate. 
  Finally, the evidence demonstrates that the brothers used money generated by 
  the sale of the unpaid for gasoline to pay themselves, to repay debts owed to 
  the female appellants, and to pay legal fees knowing full well that Budget would 
  not be paid.</p>
<p>
  [14] The evidence also demonstrates that when the female appellants made their 
  formal demand for repayment on Payrite they had no expectation that Payrite 
  could repay its debt. Nonetheless, the female appellants did not act on their 
  demand for some three weeks and instead allowed their husbands to continue to 
  operate Payrite as if it was business as usual. During this period, the husbands 
  accumulated significant cash through the sale of Budget's gasoline and used 
  that money for the benefit of themselves, their wives and their lawyer.</p>
<p>
  [15] On the totality of the evidence, the only reasonable conclusion is that 
  the appellants had jointly decided to continue to order gasoline from Budget 
  knowing full well that it would not be paid for, with the intention of using 
  the funds generated by the sale of the gasoline to improve their own financial 
  situation. On the evidence, a finding of fraud based on the gasoline purchases 
  after January 9, 1997, was virtually unavoidable. The damages awarded by the 
  trial judge are the appropriate measure of that fraud. </p>
<p>
  [16] As a creditor Budget did not have automatic standing to bring an oppression 
  remedy under the Business Corporations Act. It could do so only at the discretion 
  of the court. Given that the fraud claim provided an avenue for full vindication 
  of Budget's claim, we see no reason to have granted Budget standing under the 
  Business Corporations Act. The trial judge made no order under that Act except 
  to declare the conduct oppressive. That paragraph of the judgment should be 
  struck.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge awarded punitive damages against the appellants in the 
  amount of $300,000. The propriety of that award is questionable on the facts 
  as found by the trial judge. There is, however, no basis for an award of punitive 
  damages when the fraud against Budget is limited to the events after January 
  9, 1997 and, in particular, to Payrite's failure to pay for the gasoline delivered 
  to it by Budget after January 9, 1997: see Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan 
  Golf &amp; Tennis Club Ltd., [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678 at 710-714.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge also ordered that the secured claim of the female appellants 
  against Payrite should be subordinated to the unsecured claim of Budget. It 
  is an open question whether the trial judge had jurisdiction to subordinate 
  the female appellants' secured claims to the unsecured claims of Budget. We 
  were advised, in the course of argument that the female appellants were paid 
  by the trustee in bankruptcy long ago. The subordination order made by the trial 
  judge is, therefore, of no consequence. Given the uncertain state of the law 
  on this point, that portion of the judgment should be deleted as it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appeal is allowed in part, the trial judgment is varied by deleting 
  paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>
  [20] As success on the appeal is divided, there will be no order of costs on 
  the appeal.</p>
