<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:normal;'>On appeal from the Judgment of 
  the Divisional Court (Somers and Thomson JJ., O'Driscoll J. dissenting), (2001), 
  54 O.R. (3d) 920, allowing the appeal from the Order of Sharpe J. (1999), 45 
  O.R. (3d) 29.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellants are representative plaintiffs in a class action. The respondents 
  were the major manufacturers and suppliers to the Canadian market of iron oxide 
  pigments used to colour concrete bricks and paving stones which were incorporated 
  into the construction of homes, buildings and landscaping. The bulk of their 
  sales were for the construction of new homes. It is alleged that during the 
  period between 1985 to 1991, the respondents engaged in a price-fixing scheme, 
  thereby illegally increasing the price of concrete bricks and paving stones 
  coloured by iron oxide pigment. </p>
<p>[2] The appellants purchased a new home during that period from a new home 
  developer. Their home contains some coloured concrete bricks and paving stones. 
  They believe that they were indirect purchasers of bricks and stones containing 
  the respondents' iron oxide pigments. The appellants allege that they suffered 
  damage by overpaying for their home. </p>
<p>[3] The issue under appeal is the propriety of certification of the class action. 
  The issue turns on the efficacy and method of proof of whether all indirect 
  purchasers of the respondents' product overpaid for their homes as a result, 
  and thereby suffered damage. The majority of the Divisional Court held that 
  damage, a necessary component of the cause of action of each plaintiff, could 
  not be proved on a class-wide basis; rather, damage must be proved individually 
  for each plaintiff, making the class action process not the preferable process. 
  The dissenting judge essentially adopted the reasons of the motion judge. For 
  the reasons which follow, I would uphold the conclusion reached by the majority 
  of the Divisional Court and dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>I. FACTS AND HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDING</p>
<p>[4] The motion for certification is based on s. 5(1) of the Class Proceedings 
  Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c.6 which provides:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">5. (1) The Court shall certify a class proceeding on a motion 
  under section 2, 3 or 4 if,<br>
  (a) the pleadings or the notice of application discloses a cause of action;<br>
  (b) there is an identifiable class of two or more persons that would be represented 
  by the representative plaintiff or defendant;<br>
  (c) the claims or defences of the class members raise common issues;<br>
  (d) a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the resolution 
  of the common issues; and<br>
  (e) there is a representative plaintiff or defendant who,<br>
  (i) would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class,<br>
  (ii) has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable method 
  of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class and of notifying class members 
  of the proceeding, and<br>
  (iii) does not have, on the common issues for the class, an interest in conflict 
  with the interests of other class members.</p>
<p>[5] The Statement of Claim of the appellants describes the details of a conspiracy 
  by the respondents who were manufacturers and distributors of iron oxide pigments 
  for use in making bricks, paving stones and other building materials, and who, 
  between 1984 and 1992, held between 90% and 100% of the Canadian market for 
  iron oxide. The alleged conspiracy to fix and thereby raise the price of iron 
  oxide pigments in Canada was carried out between 1985 and 1991. The appellants 
  plead that they purchased a new house in Ontario which was built in 1988 with 
  bricks containing iron oxide pigment supplied by the defendants. The pleading 
  alleges that as a result of the respondents' price-fixing conspiracy, the purchase 
  price of products containing pigments was increased over what it would have 
  been had there been an open competitive market, and that the appellants and 
  the rest of the members of the class suffered damages as a result by overpaying 
  for their homes. There is no dispute by the appellants that their cause of action 
  includes proof of damage. Under the heading &quot;Effects of the Illegal Activities,&quot; 
  para. 28 of the Statement of Claim reads:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">The Plaintiffs plead that as a result of the Defendants' illegal 
  actions, the Plaintiffs and class were harmed by having to pay higher prices 
  and were deprived of the benefits of a free and open competition for the purchase 
  of products containing pigments.</p>
<p>[6] The members of the class are described in the Statement of Claim as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">[ All persons in Canada who have suffered loss or damage as 
  a result of the Defendants' agreement to wrongfully increase or maintain the 
  price of iron oxide and black pigment and otherwise unduly lessen competition, 
  and in general restrict and inhibit competition in the pigment market; in particular 
  all persons who purchased either directly or indirectly, bricks or other construction 
  products containing iron oxide pigment or black pigment manufactured or distributed 
  by one or more of the Defendants (or, where applicable, their corporate predecessors), 
  between 1985 and 1992 [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [7] The appellants subsequently revised the definition of the proposed class 
  to exclude direct purchasers of the respondents' products, and to include only 
  the ultimate end-users of the products after they had been incorporated into 
  construction, particularly home owners. In his Order, the motion judge certified 
  the class with the following description:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent"> All homeowners or other end users in Canada who have suffered 
  loss or damage as a result of the Defendants' agreement to wrongfully increase 
  or maintain the price of iron oxide and black pigment and otherwise unduly lessen 
  competition, and in general restrict and inhibit competition in the pigment 
  market; in particular, all home owners or other end users of bricks, interlocking 
  or other construction products containing iron oxide pigment or black pigment 
  manufactured or distributed by Bayer Canada and Northern Pigment Company or 
  where applicable, their corporate predecessors between 1985 and 1992.</p>
<p>[8] The respondents first moved before Sharpe J. under Rule 21 of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to strike the claim on the basis 
  that the pleading disclosed no cause of action. Because the appellants, as indirect 
  purchasers, did not buy any iron oxide pigment directly from the respondents, 
  but only purchased an end-product that incorporated bricks made with the respondents' 
  product, it was argued that the appellants could not be the object of an unlawful 
  conspiracy by the respondents to affect the price of their product. The Rule 
  21 motion was dismissed on the basis that, although the cause of action was 
  a novel one, it was not plain and obvious that it could not succeed.</p>
<p>II. THE CERTIFICATION MOTION</p>
<p>[9] The appellants then brought their motion for certification of the action 
  as a class proceeding. On that motion, affidavit material was filed by both 
  sides. The record disclosed that if the appellants could prove their claims 
  and show that the increased cost of the coloured bricks was passed through to 
  them as homebuyers, the magnitude of each claim would be between $70 and $112 
  on a $150,000 home. </p>
<p>[10] The respondents again raised the issue, this time under s. 5(1)(a) of 
  the Class Proceedings Act, that the appellants' claim raised no cause of action, 
  relying on authority from the United States Supreme Court (Illinois Brick v. 
  Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977)), which precludes class action claims by indirect 
  purchasers for damages for conspiracy to fix prices. The motion judge held, 
  as he had on the earlier motion, that the pleading did disclose a cause of action, 
  rejecting the American authorities as inapplicable in Canada. </p>
<p>[11] The second issue before the motion judge was whether there was an identifiable 
  class. The problem raised by the respondents was that potential members of the 
  class could have great difficulty self-identifying because, as home-owners, 
  they would not know whether their home was built with materials which contained 
  the iron oxide pigments. The motion judge described the problem as follows: 
  &quot;[t]he question is whether the impracticality or inefficiency of applying 
  the definition to actually identify the members of the class on an individual 
  basis renders it unacceptable.&quot; He approached the issue by considering 
  the three important objectives of the Class Proceedings Act: (a) judicial economy; 
  (b) improved access to the courts for actions that may not otherwise be asserted; 
  and (c) behaviour modification for actual or potential wrongdoers. He held that 
  in this case, the primary object of certification was behaviour modification 
  and that because of the small size of any individual award, compensation for 
  the appellants and therefore access to justice for individual claims would be 
  a secondary goal, making the ability of potential plaintiffs to self-identify 
  of less concern to the court.</p>
<p>[12] The third issue addressed by the motion judge was identifying and articulating 
  three common issues. The first common issue was whether the respondents had 
  entered into a price-fixing agreement. He defined the remaining common issues 
  as follows:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">Are the defendants liable to the members of the plaintiff class 
  for conspiracy to fix the price of iron oxide, and if so, what is the appropriate 
  measure of damages?</p>
<p>[13] The fourth matter addressed by the motion judge under s. 5(1) of the Class 
  Proceedings Act was whether a class proceeding was the preferable procedure 
  &quot;for the resolution of the common issues.&quot; The motion judge concluded 
  that it was. It is that conclusion and the basis for that conclusion, combined 
  with the identification of liability as a common issue, that form the main focus 
  of the appeals to the Divisional Court and to this court. The majority of the 
  Divisional Court reversed the decision of the motion judge, concluding that 
  liability could not be a common issue and that a class action was not the preferable 
  procedure for determining the issues between the respondents and the members 
  of the plaintiff class.</p>
<p>[14] Finally, the motion judge held that the appellants were representative 
  plaintiffs. Although the appellants could not confirm that the bricks in their 
  home contained the respondents' iron oxide pigment, or that they had overpaid 
  for their home as a result, the motion judge found that there was a sufficient 
  factual basis to qualify them as representative plaintiffs.</p>
<p>III. THE APPEAL TO THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
<p>[15] The majority of the Divisional Court found that the motion judge had erred 
  in his interpretation of s. 5 (1)(d) of the Class Proceedings Act in the determination 
  of whether a class action is the &quot;preferable procedure.&quot; The motion 
  judge had stated that &quot;…the specific wording of s. 5(1)(d)…requires only 
  that a class action be the preferable procedure for the resolution of the common 
  issues.&quot; Somers J., writing for the majority of the Divisional Court, rejected 
  limiting the preferable procedure analysis to the resolution of the common issues. 
  Instead he took a broader approach, including considering the individual issues 
  and whether a class action is the preferable procedure to advance the interests 
  of all the parties in accordance with the objectives of the Class Proceedings 
  Act.</p>
<p>[16] The Divisional Court then focused on the nature of the causes of action 
  asserted by the appellants and the requirements for establishing those causes 
  of action. The appellants' causes of action are based on a breach of s. 36(1) 
  of the Competition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34, as well as the common law torts 
  of conspiracy and infliction of economic injury by unlawful means. All causes 
  of action require that the appellants establish that they suffered actual loss. 
  In particular, s. 36(1) provides:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">36.(1) Any person who has suffered loss or damage as a result 
  of<br>
  (a) conduct that is contrary to any provision of Part VI, or<br>
  (b) the failure of any person to comply with an order of the Tribunal or another 
  court under this Act,<br>
  may, in any court of competent jurisdiction, sue for and recover from the person 
  who engaged in the conduct or failed to comply with the order an amount equal 
  to the loss or damage proved to have been suffered by him, together with any 
  additional amount that the court may allow not exceeding the full cost to him 
  of any investigation in connection with the matter and of proceedings under 
  this section [emphasis added].</p>
<p>The appellants' claim is that they suffered loss by paying higher prices for 
  their houses, built using bricks containing the respondents' product. </p>
<p>[17] The Divisional Court disagreed with the motion judge that such a loss 
  could be proved on a class-wide basis. The court concluded that proof that the 
  appellants had suffered such loss by overpaying for their houses could only 
  be established on an individual basis. The appellants would have to prove that 
  any overcharge by the respondents to the direct purchasers of the iron oxide 
  pigment was passed on through the chain of manufacture and distribution of the 
  bricks to the ultimate purchaser of a home which was built using those bricks. 
  The majority of the Divisional Court also focused on the multitude of variables 
  that can affect the price of a building, including regional differences and 
  delivery costs, and the fact that &quot;… the product in question, iron oxide, 
  is used merely as a small component in another product or series of products 
  and the alleged overcharge is only a trivial part of the purchase price of residential 
  or commercial buildings, which are highly individualized end products,&quot; 
  (para. 23) as well as many subjective factors, such as the relative bargaining 
  skills of the purchasers and vendors. The court also rejected the concept that 
  statistical evidence could be used to prove the fact of loss, as opposed to 
  the quantum of the loss. As a result, the Divisional Court concluded that the 
  issue of liability could not be a common issue in the proceeding.</p>
<p> [18] The Divisional Court further found that establishing the price-fixing 
  conspiracy would not advance the litigation in a legally material way, because 
  the balance of the action would be an unmanageable series of individual trials 
  of the &quot;pass-on&quot; issue. Therefore, certifying the class action would 
  not further the purposes of the Class Proceedings Act, particularly judicial 
  economy, but also access to justice and behaviour modification, the purpose 
  singled out by the motion judge. The Divisional Court was of the view that the 
  procedures in the Competition Act were better suited to the goal of behaviour 
  modification in this case, and noted that an investigation under the Competition 
  Act had been conducted and discontinued by the Director of Investigation and 
  Research of the Competition Bureau.</p>
<p> [19] The Divisional Court found the following further errors in the Order 
  that had been made below: </p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[ (a) the class definition is circular as it defines the class 
  in terms that depend on the merits of the individual claims; <br>
  (b) the affidavit of a proposed representative plaintiff should have been rejected 
  as it did not state that his home construction included paving stones which 
  actually contain iron oxide manufactured by the defendants, and should have 
  been amended to excise the portion stating his belief that the cost of his home 
  had been artificially inflated when he did not state the basis for his belief 
  as required by Rule 39.01(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure; <br>
  (c) the motion judge erred in concluding that s. 24 of the Class Proceedings 
  Act could be used to assess damages on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p> IV. ISSUES</p>
<p> (1) Was the Divisional Court correct to conclude that the issue of liability, 
  including proof of loss, could not be a common issue?</p>
<p>(2) Was the Divisional Court correct that a class action is not the preferable 
  procedure for the conduct of the action?</p>
<p>(3) Is the class definition, as formulated by the motion judge, in error because 
  it defines the class in terms of those who have suffered damages and not in 
  objective terms, and therefore turns on the outcome of the litigation or the 
  merits of the claim?</p>
<p> V. ANALYSIS</p>
<p> (i) Common Issue</p>
<p> [20] The difference in approach between the motion judge and the appellants 
  on one hand, and the majority of the Divisional Court and the respondents on 
  the other, turns on whether this is a case where all end-purchasers paid a higher 
  price for their homes and therefore the loss can be proved on a class wide basis, 
  or whether each individual end-purchaser of a building that contains, as one 
  component, bricks made with iron oxide pigment from the defendants, may or may 
  not have had the inflated price of the iron oxide pigment passed through as 
  part of the purchase price of the home they bought. </p>
<p> [21] The motion judge concluded that liability was a common issue and that 
  it could be proved on a class-wide basis. Based on that premise, he turned to 
  the issue of preferable procedure.</p>
<p> [22] The motion judge based his decision on preferable procedure on his view 
  of the correct interpretation of s. 5(1)(d), which requires the plaintiff to 
  prove that: &quot;a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the 
  resolution of the common issues.&quot; His interpretation was that the section 
  requires only that the class action be the preferable procedure for resolution 
  of the common issues, not for the remaining individual issues. However, having 
  already concluded that liability was not an individual issue, the spectre of 
  an unmanageable judicial proceeding for determining liability on a plaintiff-by-plaintiff 
  basis was not a concern for him. </p>
<p> [23] The critical finding of the motion judge on preferable procedure is at 
  para. 22 of the reasons where he states: </p>
<p class="indent">[ If the plaintiffs are successful in establishing a price fixing 
  conspiracy and in establishing that damages from such conspiracy flowed through 
  to the ultimate owners of buildings containing the pigments supplied by the 
  defendants, it will be for the trial judge to determine whether it is necessary 
  to have individual hearings to assess and distribute damages. As I have already 
  indicated, the Act contains provisions which contemplate damage assessment and 
  distribution in cases of this kind without such individual hearings. In any 
  event, for the purposes of the preferable procedure test, I have no difficulty 
  in finding that a class proceeding is the preferable procedure for resolution 
  of the common issues. This is not a case like Abdool v. Anaheim Management Ltd. 
  (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 453 (Div. Ct.); Mouhteros v. DeVry Canada Inc., (1998) 
  41 O.R. (3d) 63 (Gen. Div.); or Rosedale Motors Inc. v. Petro-Canada Inc., [1998] 
  O.J. No.5461 (Gen. Div.); where it was simply not possible to resolve the common 
  issues without scrutinizing the individual circumstances of each member of the 
  proposed class. Here, there is an allegation of a general price-fixing agreement 
  which is alleged to have a price impact upon the ultimate consumers of the product 
  in question. If those are to be litigated at all, it seems apparent that a class 
  proceeding is the preferable procedure. It would advance the goal of modification 
  of behaviour as discussed earlier [emphasis added].</p>
<p> And he concluded at para. 24: </p>
<p class="indent">[ While there is no doubt that this will be a complex action 
  involving the claims of a large number of individuals, as the claims have at 
  their core significant common issues which can be readily dealt with on a class 
  action basis, it is my view that the complexity of the proceeding favours rather 
  than detracts from a class proceeding.</p>
<p> [24] In other words, the motion judge contemplated the possibility of individual 
  hearings only for the assessment of damages, but not for proof of loss as a 
  component of liability. On that basis, he concluded that the class action is 
  the preferable procedure.</p>
<p> [25] The difference in the fundamental premises of the two sides is reflected 
  in the way the appellants formulate in their factum the two issues for decision 
  on this appeal. The issues as stated assume, rather than raise for decision, 
  that proof of loss is a common issue which will not require the participation 
  of any class member to prove. The issues are set out in the appellants' factum 
  as follows:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[(1) Should the case be certified where liability and damages 
  can be proven at a trial of the common issues without the participation of any 
  class member? </p>
<p class="indent">(2) Should the case be certified where the damages suffered 
  by each class member can be assessed and distributed to them without the participation 
  of the defendants?</p>
<p>It is clear from this formulation that the appellants assume that the issue 
  of the loss component of liability can be proved on a class-wide basis. The 
  difficulty is that the question of what method of proof could be used to establish 
  loss on a class-wide basis has not been addressed, and it is the major subject 
  of dispute on the certification motion. </p>
<p>[26] Although the appellants recognize and acknowledge that &quot;[l]oss is 
  a critical component of the causes of action pleaded,&quot; they rely on the 
  finding by the motion judge that the loss would be proved at the trial of the 
  common issues through proof of two components: (1) an overall assessment of 
  damages on the basis of the net gain realized by the defendants as a result 
  of their allegedly unlawful agreement; and (2) a measurable price impact upon 
  the ultimate consumer of the building products containing the iron oxide pigments. 
  The appellants argue further that proving these two components of loss would 
  not require the participation of the plaintiff class. Finally, and critically, 
  they state that there was &quot;probative evidence&quot; before the motion judge 
  to support as reasonable the judge's conclusion on proof of loss through the 
  two proposed components.</p>
<p> [27] The motion judge's finding in that regard is at para. 11 of his reasons:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[ Third, the parties filed expert evidence from economists as 
  to the effect of a price increase at the manufacturing stage on the ultimate 
  consumer of the product. The defendants' expert deposed that it is not possible 
  to trace the impact of such prices through to the consumer. The expert retained 
  by the plaintiffs disagreed with the defendants' expert and deposed that there 
  would be a measurable price impact upon the ultimate consumer of the building 
  products containing the iron oxide pigment. The plaintiffs' expert also deposes 
  that it would be possible to determine an over-all assessment of damages on 
  the basis of the net gain realized by the defendants as a result of their allegedly 
  unlawful agreement. While I am not to be taken as holding that it was necessary 
  to adduce such evidence at this stage of the proceedings, the conflict on the 
  evidence only highlights the point that the issue will have to be resolved at 
  trial, rather than on the pleadings [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [28] Although the motion judge expressed reservations about the need for the 
  appellants' expert evidence at this stage of the proceedings, it is only on 
  the basis of that evidence that any determination can be made as to whether 
  loss can be proved on a class-wide or an individual basis, and therefore whether 
  it can be a common issue. In Hollick v. The City of Toronto, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 
  158 at para. 22, McLachlin C.J.C., writing for the court, clarified the role 
  of evidence at the certification stage:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[ The 1990 Report of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee 
  …suggests that &quot;[u]pon a motion for certification…, the representative 
  plaintiff shall and the defendant may serve and file one or more affidavits 
  setting forth the material facts upon which each intends to rely&quot; [emphasis 
  added in Hollick]: see Report of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on 
  Class Action Reform, supra, at p. 33. In my view the Advisory Committee's report 
  appropriately requires the class representative to come forward with sufficient 
  evidence to support certification, and appropriately allows the opposing party 
  an opportunity to respond with evidence of its own.</p>
<p> [29] The Supreme Court also noted that this evidentiary scheme represented 
  the existing practice in Ontario, referring to the case of Caputo v. Imperial 
  Tobacco Ltd. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 314 at 319 (Gen. Div.), where the court held 
  that the adequacy of the record on a certification motion was of &quot;primary 
  concern.&quot; The Supreme Court also quoted with approval from the case of 
  Taub v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 379 (Gen. Div.). 
  The relevant passage in Hollick reads as follows:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[ The court wrote (at pp. 380-1) that 'the CPA requires the 
  representative plaintiff to provide a certain minimum evidentia[ry] basis for 
  a certification order' . While the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 does not require 
  a preliminary merits showing, 'the judge must be satisfied of certain basi[c] 
  facts required by s. 5 of the CPA as the basis for a certification order' (para. 
  24) [emphasis added in Hollick]. </p>
<p>McLachlin C.J.C. concluded: </p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[In my view, the class representative must show some basis in 
  fact for each of the certification requirements set out in s. 5 of the Act, 
  other than the requirement that the pleadings disclose a cause of action (para.25).</p>
<p> [30] In my view, with respect, the motion judge erred by relying on the expert 
  evidence filed by the appellants as the basis for the certification order. That 
  evidence does not address the issue of what method could be used at a trial 
  to prove that all end-purchasers of buildings constructed using some bricks 
  or paving stones that contain the respondents' iron oxide pigment overpaid for 
  the buildings as a result. Rather, the appellants' expert effectively assumes 
  that higher costs of products containing the respondents' iron oxide pigment 
  would have been passed on to end-users, reasoning that they would have been 
  willing to pay the higher cost because the amounts in question were so minimal. 
  He made it clear that he did not know how willing end-purchasers would be to 
  pay higher costs and that he had not had sufficient time to do any analysis 
  to determine the response of the marketplace. He then went on to postulate a 
  conceptual model for calculating the damages &quot;to the extent that buyers 
  of homes or other buildings made of construction materials using iron oxide 
  pigment incur the damages of the conspiracy.&quot; The expert's models are based 
  on the assumption of a full pass-through of the price increase of the iron oxide 
  to the homebuyers. However, it is that assumption that is the very issue that 
  the court must be satisfied is provable by some method on a class-wide basis 
  before the common issue can be certified as such.</p>
<p> [31] The motion judge relied on the opinion of the appellants' expert that 
  &quot;there would be a measurable price impact upon the ultimate consumer of 
  the building products containing the iron oxide pigment.&quot; However, the 
  fact that any price impact may be &quot;measurable&quot; goes only to the issue 
  of how the damages can be calculated and distributed, not whether the inflated 
  price charged to the direct buyers of the product was passed through to all 
  of the ultimate consumers. The issue of whether there would be a price impact 
  on all ultimate consumers of iron oxide coloured products, i.e., a pass-through 
  to the class members of the inflated price charged by the respondents to their 
  direct buyers, was what the expert assumed, but he did not indicate a method 
  for proving, or even testing that assumption.</p>
<p> [32] The critical importance of the issue of whether, and if so, by what method, 
  loss is provable on a common basis in class action anti-trust suits was canvassed 
  in detail in the recent decision of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals Third 
  Circuit in In Re: Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, 305 F.3d 145 (2002). The 
  case involved an alleged conspiracy by linerboard (i.e., corrugated cardboard) 
  manufacturers to reduce the industry inventory of linerboard and then, once 
  supply was limited, to implement price increases. The linerboard manufacturers 
  challenged a lower court ruling that had certified two classes of plaintiffs 
  on the basis that they would be able to prove &quot;common impact&quot;.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  The two classes were both direct purchasers, one of corrugated sheets and one 
  of corrugated boxes. Although the plaintiffs purchased the product directly 
  from the defendants, the issue of whether the conspiracy affected the price 
  of these products on a class-wide basis was a live one because corrugated cardboard 
  was only a component of the finished product. </p>
<p> [33] The manufacturers' challenge to the lower court decision was two-pronged. 
  The main argument was that the lower court should not have relied on a legal 
  presumption of impact, that it failed to apply rigorous scrutiny of the plaintiffs' 
  impact evidence and that the existence of injury required an individualized 
  inquiry. Second, the manufacturers argued that a question of fraudulent concealment 
  also raised individualized issues. The parallel to the case at bar lies in the 
  court's approach to the first prong, and its analysis of the type and strength 
  of evidence required at the certification stage to satisfy the court that there 
  is a method in a price-fixing case by which impact on the plaintiff class can 
  be proved as a common issue.</p>
<p> [34] The lower court in Linerboard based its decision that loss could be proved 
  on a common basis for all members of the class on two types of evidence and 
  analysis. The first was expert evidence that the price-fixing conspiracy can 
  be presumed to have a common impact on all purchasers. The relevant portion 
  of the lower court judgment on the presumption of common impact is approved 
  at p. 152 of the appeal reasons and reads:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[Plaintiffs have shown that they plan to prove common impact 
  by introducing generalized evidence which will not vary among individual class 
  members. For example, plaintiffs contend that even though prices may have varied 
  among regions, the alleged conspiracy caused these prices to rise throughout 
  the country. Although the prices for corrugated sheets and boxes may have increased 
  due to demand, because defendants allegedly conspired to reduce production of 
  linerboard, the price was higher than it would have been under competitive conditions. 
  Such allegations, supported by the evidence presented, are of the kind contemplated 
  by the Third Circuit in [Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F. 2d 434 (3d Cir. 
  1977)] and [Newton v. Merill Lynch, Pierce, Fennerd Smith, Inc., 259 F. 3d 154 
  (3d Cir. 2001)]. See also [Lumco Indus., Inc. v. Jeld-Wen, Inc. 171 F.R.D. 168, 
  173 (E.D. Pa. 1997)].</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[The Court recognizes that defendants dispute plaintiffs' allegations. 
  However, at the class certification stage, &quot;the Court need not concern 
  itself with whether Plaintiffs can prove their allegations regarding common 
  impact; the Court need only assure itself that Plaintiffs' attempt to prove 
  their allegations will predominantly involve common issues of fact and law.&quot; 
  Lumco Indus., 171 F.R.D. at 174. &quot;Plaintiffs need only make a threshold 
  showing that the element of impact will predominantly involve generalized issues 
  of proof, rather than questions which are particular to each member of the plaintiff 
  class.&quot; Id. (citing In re Disposable Contact Lens Antitrust Litig., 170 
  F.R.D. 524 (M.D. Fla. 1996)). Therefore, the Court concludes that plaintiffs' 
  allegations regarding impact, like their allegations regarding conspiracy, will 
  focus the inquiry on defendants' actions, not on individual questions relating 
  to particular plaintiff class members [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [35] According to the court of appeals, the lower court's ruling represented 
  a sound application of the concept of &quot;presumed impact&quot; approved in 
  an earlier decision of the same appeals court in Bogosian. The foundational 
  essence of this approach to determining impact is that the focus of the evidence 
  will be on the actions of the defendants and not on individual questions relating 
  to particular plaintiffs. In applying the concept of presumed impact, the court 
  takes notice of the laws of economics as support for a theory that an individual 
  plaintiff can prove the fact of damage simply by proving that the free market 
  prices would be lower than the prices actually paid by the plaintiff. In the 
  Linerboard case, a deliberate cut in supply was alleged. A reduction in supply 
  will cause prices to rise. The concomitant rise in linerboard prices in the 
  relevant market, on the presumed impact theory, represents the laws of supply 
  and demand at work. </p>
<p> [36] In addition to relying on the presumed impact theory, the lower court 
  in Linerboard relied on the extensive empirical investigations that had been 
  undertaken by the plaintiffs' experts. The plaintiffs' experts' testimony was 
  that advanced economic models could be prepared to establish class-wide impact. 
  In the evidence before the lower court, the experts supported their opinions 
  with charts, studies, company records, industry data and articles from leading 
  trade publications. The key issue on which the experts focused was whether the 
  variations in purchasers, products, regions, etc., precluded common impact. 
  Taking the variations into account, they concluded that all purchasers would 
  have paid a higher price because of the conspiracy. As a result, the fact of 
  loss was common. Only the quantum of loss would vary. One expert stated categorically: 
  &quot;[b]ased on my analysis of the pricing data and company records, I conclude 
  that the alleged unlawful conduct to raise linerboard prices would have impacted 
  all members of the proposed class through higher corrugated sheet prices.&quot; 
  (p.154) The court of appeals noted that this conclusion was supported by relevant 
  data. </p>
<p> [37] The court of appeals in Linerboard approved of what it referred to as 
  the lower court's use of a &quot;belt and suspenders rationale&quot; (p. 153) 
  by relying on both the presumed impact theory together with the expert evidence, 
  to form the evidentiary basis for its conclusion that loss as a component of 
  the cause of action could be proved on a class wide basis.</p>
<p> [38] The defendants in Linerboard also argued that the Linerboard case was 
  exactly comparable to the case of Newton, supra, where the same court of appeals 
  overturned the lower court's decision to certify. In Newton, the complaint was 
  that brokers in stock transactions had not obtained the best price for their 
  clients. The evidence on the certification motion showed that the computer system 
  used by the defendant brokers obtained variable prices, some of which were the 
  best, and some of which were not. Consequently, some stock purchasers suffered 
  loss while others did not. The appeals court rejected the comparison with the 
  Newton case, essentially because in Newton, not all members of the putative 
  class had suffered loss. In Newton, the court of appeals noted that &quot;[w]hether 
  a class member suffered economic loss from a given securities transaction would 
  require proof of the circumstances surrounding each trade, the available alternative 
  process, and the state of mind of each investor at the time the trade was requested&quot; 
  (p. 187). Based on the evidence before the court on the Linerboard motion, no 
  similar individual inquiries were required to prove loss to every member of 
  the class of linerboard purchasers.</p>
<p>[39] A useful comparison can be made between the evidentiary record in the 
  Linerboard certification motion and the record in this case. In Linerboard, 
  the court had both evidence based on economic theory as well as industry evidence 
  that formed the basis for expert opinions of what actually occurred in the market 
  when corrugated cardboard was sold as sheets and boxes. The evidence demonstrated 
  to the certification court that it could be proved at trial that the plaintiffs 
  did in fact suffer loss on a class-wide basis. The certification of the plaintiff 
  class in Linerboard did not, of course, mean that there would not be contrary 
  evidence and substantial opposition to the plaintiffs' position at trial. It 
  did mean that, on a preliminary basis, there was a sufficient record to support 
  a decision to certify based on liability as a common issue.</p>
<p>[40] In this case, the appellants presented no evidence from industry representatives 
  to explain how the manufacturers and distributors of bricks and the developers 
  of new homes price their products, and in particular, whether there is a direct 
  pass-through of the price of every component into the sale price of all homes, 
  the relevance of the value of the land component, and how other factors such 
  as the real estate market and the individual bargaining of the purchaser and 
  vendor affect the price. The evidence on the issue of loss to the members of 
  the plaintiff class came only from the affidavit of an expert economist who 
  did not address those issues. In his affidavit, the expert does not suggest 
  that he consulted any industry records or other data which would substantiate 
  a pass-through analysis.</p>
<p>[41] Finally, in the Linerboard case, the defendants asked the court to apply 
  the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Illinois Brick, supra, which the respondents 
  in this case also seek to rely on. Illinois Brick was an anti-trust treble damages 
  action, brought under s.4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. s.15, by end-purchasers 
  of structures built using concrete blocks. They alleged that the manufacturers 
  of the concrete blocks had engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices in violation 
  of federal antitrust legislation (Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. s.1). The issue was 
  whether indirect purchasers, as opposed to the intermediaries who had purchased 
  directly from the manufacturers, could sue based on the alleged overcharge. 
  In its earlier decision in Hanover Shoe Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp, 
  392 U.S. 481 (1968), the U.S. Supreme Court had held that where the plaintiffs 
  were direct purchasers from the defendants, the defendants could not use the 
  defence that the alleged overcharge had been passed through to the ultimate 
  consumer and therefore that the direct purchaser had suffered no damage. In 
  Illinois Brick, the same bar was applied to indirect purchasers as plaintiffs: 
  they could not sue for treble damages for price fixing because allowing claims 
  by both direct and indirect purchasers would create the risk of double recovery 
  and make the process of determining who had suffered what proportion of the 
  price overcharge too complex, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the remedy.</p>
<p>[42] In the Linerboard litigation, both classes of plaintiffs were direct purchasers 
  from the defendant manufacturers. Because both the sheets and the boxes contained 
  linerboard only as a component, so that the price-fixed product formed only 
  one ingredient of the product purchased, the defendants argued that the class 
  members were akin to indirect purchasers, and that the Illinois Brick prohibition 
  should apply. The appeals court rejected the analogy and held that the class 
  members were direct purchasers and &quot;entitled to recover the full amount 
  of any overcharge&quot; (pp. 159-60).</p>
<p>[43] In his reasons in the case at bar, the motion judge declined to follow 
  Illinois Brick, which, as discussed above, bars actions by indirect purchasers 
  for price fixing as a matter of law in the U.S. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  However, in so doing he did not address the underlying reasoning of the U.S. 
  Supreme Court that led to the result in Illinois Brick and in Hanover Shoe, 
  namely, the complexities of proving the extent to which the different players 
  in the chain of purchase bear the higher price caused by the illegal conspiracy 
  to fix the price of the base product.</p>
<p>[44] The complexity of the &quot;pass-through&quot; problem was recognized 
  by the Divisional Court. The court referred with approval to the following passage 
  from pp. 742-43 of Illinois Brick:</p>
<p> 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>…&quot;in the real economic world rather than an economist's hypothetical 
      model,&quot; the latter's drastic simplifications generally must be abandoned. 
      Overcharged direct purchasers often sell in imperfectly competitive markets. 
      They often compete with other sellers that have not been subject to the 
      overcharge; and their pricing policies often cannot be explained solely 
      by the convenient assumption of profit maximization. As we concluded in 
      Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S., at 492, attention to &quot;sound laws of economics&quot; 
      can only heighten the awareness of the difficulties and uncertainties involved 
      in determining how the relevant market variables would have behaved had 
      there been no overcharge.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> 
<p>[45] The Divisional Court noted the many problems of proof facing the appellants 
  with respect to the pass-on issue, including the number of parties in the chain 
  of distribution and the &quot;multitude of variables&quot; which would affect 
  the end-purchase price of a building. The appellants would have to show that 
  the price increase (or a part of it) was passed through from the respondents 
  to the building materials manufacturer and distributor, to the builder, to the 
  purchaser and on to any subsequent purchaser. If the price increase was absorbed 
  at any point, the chain would be broken. The problem is compounded by the fact 
  that the iron oxide pigment forms such a minimal part of the whole structure 
  and therefore a similarly minimal portion of the purchase price of a building.</p>
<p>[46] As noted above, neither the variables nor the issue of how to prove the 
  flow of the price increase through the distribution chain were addressed by 
  the appellants' expert in his evidence. Nor does he discuss the effect of the 
  market on real estate prices and the relative effects on the purchase price 
  of (a) the market, (b) the value of the land, (c) the value of the building, 
  and (d) how one assesses the value of the component parts of the building at 
  any particular point in time, remembering that the proposed class members are 
  not only purchasers of new homes, but of resale homes as well, and that not 
  all homes were constructed using the impugned materials.</p>
<p>[47] In my view, this latter point - that not all buildings built and sold 
  during the relevant period contained the respondents' materials - highlights 
  a significant aspect of the problem with the appellants' theory and their position. 
  The appellants' expert alludes to the issue of whether the increase in price 
  of iron oxide pigmented materials may have had the effect of causing an increase 
  in all substitute materials as well. In other words, the effect of the increase 
  in price of coloured bricks might have been to cause the price of all bricks 
  to rise, or looking at it another way, the homebuilders may have increased the 
  prices of all houses built with bricks regardless of what bricks they used, 
  in order to accommodate and at the same time to take advantage of the price 
  increase of the iron oxide pigmented bricks. The expert suggests that if that 
  were true, then &quot;all homebuyers or other end-users would have been damaged 
  by the iron oxide conspiracy to a greater or lesser extent&quot;, not just buyers 
  of homes containing the defendants' product. However, he goes on to say that 
  he did no analysis to determine whether this in fact occurred, and opined that 
  there was no practical relevance to the issue. </p>
<p>[48] To the contrary, from the point of view of proof of loss to homebuyers 
  as a class based on a pass-through of the price increase, if it could be shown 
  that all home prices were artificially inflated as a result of the use of both 
  iron oxide pigmented and non-iron oxide pigmented building materials, that could 
  well have formed the basis for concluding that proof of loss could be presented 
  on a class-wide basis as a common issue. </p>
<p>[49] The Divisional Court also rejected several other methods referred to by 
  the motion judge for arriving at class-wide proof of loss. First, the Divisional 
  Court held that s.24 of the Class Proceedings Act, which deals with an aggregate 
  assessment of monetary relief, cannot resolve the problems of proving loss on 
  a class-wide basis. I agree that s. 24 of the Class Proceedings Act is applicable 
  only once liability has been established, and provides a method to assess the 
  quantum of damages on a global basis, but not the fact of damage. </p>
<p>[50] Second, the Divisional Court rejected the suggestion that the variables 
  in circumstances of different plaintiffs could be addressed by the creation 
  of plaintiff sub-classes. Again, the creation of subclasses is an evidentiary 
  matter. I note that the appellants have not relied on this solution before this 
  court, nor is there any evidentiary foundation to suggest that different sub-classes 
  of plaintiffs can be formed which will effectively create a basis for commonality 
  on the issue of proof of loss. </p>
<p>[51] Finally, the Divisional Court concluded that s. 23 of the Class Proceedings 
  Act, which contemplates the use of statistical evidence to determine the amount 
  or distribution of a monetary award, would not allow the issue of liability 
  to be proved through otherwise inadmissible statistical evidence. I do not adopt 
  this comment by the Divisional Court. In the American cases, as discussed above, 
  expert evidence that includes an analysis of statistical data has been used 
  to establish loss on a class-wide basis. The admissibility of any such evidence 
  will have to be considered when the issue arises. </p>
<p>Conclusion on Common Issue</p>
<p>[52] In my view, the motion judge erred in finding that liability could be 
  proved as a common issue in this case. The evidence presented by the appellants 
  on the motion does not satisfy the requirement prescribed by the Supreme Court 
  in Hollick of providing sufficient evidence to support certification. The evidence 
  of the appellants' expert assumes the pass-through of the illegal price increase, 
  but does not suggest a methodology for proving it or for dealing with the variables 
  that affect the end price of real property at any particular point in time. 
  The motion judge focused on the expert's opinion that the loss could be measured, 
  rather than on how any such loss could first be established on a class-wide 
  basis.</p>
<p>(ii) Preferable Procedure</p>
<p> [53] In reaching his conclusion under s. 5(1)(d) of the Class Proceedings 
  Act that &quot;a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the 
  resolution of the common issues,&quot; the motion judge specifically limited 
  his focus to whether the class action procedure was preferable for resolution 
  of the common issues only, and not of any other individual issues that would 
  have to be resolved in the course of the litigation. In so doing, the motion 
  judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in 
  Hollick, supra, where the court specifically dealt with the breadth of the inquiry 
  under s. 5(1)(d) of the Act. After noting that the section only speaks about 
  the preferable procedure for resolving the common issues, McLachlin C.J.C, stated: 
</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[I would not place undue weight, however, on the fact that the 
  Act uses the phrase 'resolution of the common issues' rather than 'resolution 
  of class members' claims (para. 29). </p>
<p> [54] The Chief Justice concluded that &quot;[t]he question of preferability, 
  then, must take into account the importance of the common issues in relation 
  to the claims as a whole&quot;, and quoted with approval the statement of the 
  Chairman of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee that the class representative 
  must </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> &quot;demonstrate that, given all the circumstances of the particular 
      claim, [a class action] would be preferable to other methods of resolving 
      these claims and, in particular, that it would be preferable to the use 
      of individual proceedings&quot; [emphasis added in Hollick] (para. 30).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [55] Regardless of whether the motion judge was correct in concluding that 
  a class action would be the preferable procedure when there were three major 
  common issues, as I have concluded based on the record, that proof of loss as 
  a component of liability cannot be a common issue, the only common issues are 
  the price fixing conspiracy, and possibly, the measure of damages, if the scope 
  of liability can be determined.</p>
<p> [56] I do not believe the motion judge would have certified the action as 
  a class action had he not viewed liability as a common issue. The number of 
  potential plaintiffs in this case is very large, estimated at 1.1 million. Clearly, 
  if individual trials are needed to establish loss and therefore liability, the 
  action will be unmanageable.</p>
<p> [57] Together with the issue of proof of loss is the question whether a home 
  purchased by any plaintiff actually contains bricks or paving stones coloured 
  with the respondents' iron oxide pigment. As part of the proof of loss, a massive 
  record-tracing exercise will be required to establish the inclusion of the respondents' 
  product in any particular structure. The respondents point out that the period 
  over which records must be obtained spans seventeen years. The respondents also 
  point to the many intermediary parties from whom those records, if they exist, 
  must be sought. </p>
<p> [58] In his discussion regarding the class definition and the potential difficulties 
  of identifying class members because of this extensive tracing exercise required, 
  the motion judge discounted apparent problems of self-identification of potential 
  plaintiffs who might have large claims and would therefore want to opt out of 
  the class procedure. He did so because all potential plaintiffs' claims appeared 
  to be very minimal, so that the goal of certification would not be compensation 
  of individual plaintiffs but rather behaviour modification. Consequently, the 
  motion judge concluded that possible under-inclusion of potential plaintiffs 
  was not a serious matter. </p>
<p> [59] The motion judge did not consider how the same problem of identification 
  of class members can also arise in the context of possible over-inclusion of 
  parties in the class. The potential problem was masked by making proof of loss 
  a common issue. However, with liability as an individual rather than a common 
  issue, identification and proof of those actually affected is required, with 
  all of the difficulties referred to above.</p>
<p> [60] The appellants also base their argument on ss. 24 and 26 of the Class 
  Proceedings Act. The expert evidence filed by the appellants opined that the 
  illegal profits gained by the respondents could be calculated on an aggregate 
  basis. The appellants argue that the loss to the class is equal to the gain 
  of the respondents based on their illegal conspiracy. The appellants suggest 
  that by finding that individual trials are needed to prove a loss in each case, 
  the Divisional Court confused the process of assessing damages on an aggregate 
  basis with the process of distributing damages to the class members. Section 
  24(1)(b) of the Class Proceedings Act provides:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[24.(1) The court may determine the aggregate or a part of a 
  defendant's liability to class members and give judgment accordingly where,</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[(b) no questions of fact or law other than those relating to 
  the assessment of monetary relief remain to be determined in order to establish 
  the amount of the defendant's monetary liability; </p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p> [61] It is clear to me that the Divisional Court made no such error. Section 
  24(1)(b) is a mechanism for assessing damages where there is no issue of liability. 
  Section 26 also deals with the distribution of the damage award. The Divisional 
  Court focused its analysis on the mechanism of proving the loss necessary to 
  base liability. By seeking to equate the respondents' gain with the class members' 
  alleged loss, the appellants effectively skip over the process of determining 
  who in the chain, beginning with the direct purchasers from the respondents, 
  absorbed the loss. In the U.S., this problem has been resolved by limiting the 
  civil remedy of treble damages for price fixing to direct purchasers only and 
  attributing the entire loss to them. The effect of the appellants' approach 
  is to attribute the entire loss to the indirect or end-purchasers rather than 
  to determine whether those parties suffered loss as required by s. 36(1) of 
  the Competition Act and as part of the common law causes of action.</p>
<p> [62] The appellants complain that if the action is not certified, this will 
  effectively end the litigation, and thereby defeat the goal of behaviour modification 
  which would be accomplished through the action and which is one of the three 
  goals of the Class Proceedings Act. However, where access to justice through 
  compensation of individual plaintiffs who have suffered a loss is not a significant 
  goal (because the amounts in issue are so minimal, and most plaintiffs do not 
  know if or that they suffered any damage), and where judicial economy would 
  be undermined, not enhanced, by certifying the action, the circumstances requiring 
  behaviour modification would have to be extremely compelling to allow that single 
  goal to overcome the other deficiencies. In this case, the Competition Act provides 
  criminal sanctions to achieve that goal. </p>
<p> [63] The appellants argue further that if certification is not allowed in 
  this case, the effect would be a complete bar on all class actions by consumers 
  in price-fixing cases. They argue that the civil action under the Competition 
  Act, used together with the Class Proceedings Act, is an important tool for 
  preventing and effectively punishing price-fixing activity. It must be able 
  to be used along with the enforcement mechanisms in the Competition Act in order 
  to effectively regulate and discourage anti-competitive behaviour in the marketplace. 
  The appellants point to the limited resources of the Competition Bureau for 
  carrying out comprehensive enforcement and therefore the necessity that class 
  actions exist as an effective threat to potential anti-competitive market behaviour.</p>
<p> [64] Although the civil remedy for anti-competitive behaviour can be an important 
  component of the enforcement of the goals of the Competition Act, it is only 
  one component. In appropriate cases, the Competition Act and Class Proceedings 
  Act can work together as a valuable tool against price-fixing. However, in this 
  case, the obstacles to an effective class proceeding override its potential 
  benefits. </p>
<p> [65] In my view, the question of whether and how consumers will be able to 
  use class actions to obtain relief from price fixing by suppliers and manufacturers 
  remains an open one in this jurisdiction. The appellants were unsuccessful in 
  this case because they did not present the evidentiary basis for a certifying 
  court to be satisfied that loss as a component of liability could be proved 
  on a class-wide basis. Whether such evidence could have been obtained is not 
  clear.</p>
<p> [66] The Divisional Court's approach suggested that it could not: that the 
  variables in house purchase prices were such that the type of evidence that 
  would have been required to show &quot;pass-through&quot; on a class-wide basis 
  would not have been available in this case, in large part because of the nature 
  of real estate and the individualized pricing factors on each sale. The Divisional 
  Court's concerns follow the U.S. approach as defined in the Illinois Brick and 
  Hanover Shoe cases.</p>
<p> [67] The difficulties with proving pass-through of price increases on a class-wide 
  basis are illuminated in an article that discusses Illinois Brick. (William 
  H. Page, &quot;The Limits of State Indirect Purchaser Suits: Class Certification 
  in the Shadow of Illinois Brick&quot; (1999) 67 Antitrust L.J. 1). The author 
  essentially concludes that indirect purchaser litigation for price-fixed goods 
  is not a viable method of achieving behaviour modification against anti-competitive 
  behaviour. At pp. 36-7 the author states:</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[Thus, only a highly artificial subset of indirect purchasers 
  of price-fixed goods will ever be compensated by class actions. Moreover the 
  denial of certification is largely unrelated to the merits of the underlying 
  claim. Most of the factors that preclude certification of classes of indirect 
  purchasers have little to do with whether a price fixing conspiracy actually 
  existed or whether indirect purchasers bore an overcharge. The number of levels 
  of intermediate purchasers between the price fixers and plaintiff class is unrelated 
  to the success of the conspiracy. Similarly, whether plaintiff intermediate 
  purchasers alter or add value to the product, or use it as an ingredient in 
  another product, has nothing to do with whether price fixing has occurred upstream, 
  or even whether the overcharge was passed on. Yet these factors may preclude 
  certification because they make it impossible to establish harm to each class 
  member by any kind of common proof.</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[Thus, in many cases, a price-fixing overcharge will simply 
  dissolve into the currents of the channels of distribution. Eighty years ago, 
  Justice Holmes noted the &quot;endlessness and futility of the effort to follow 
  every transaction to its ultimate result,&quot; even though &quot;in the end 
  the public pays the damages in most cases of compensated torts.&quot; Now, as 
  then, it may well be that an overcharge is passed on but the legal system cannot 
  identify its incidence. Common proof is impossible and individualized proof 
  would be more costly than the amount of the harm. The emerging reality of the 
  indirect purchaser class action offers no realistic mechanism for accomplishing 
  compensation for remote purchasers of price-fixed goods. If the indirect purchaser 
  class action is only available to a small subset of indirect purchaser injuries, 
  even among price-fixing conspiracies that are actually detected, it is not fulfilling 
  its stated purpose [internal citations omitted].</p>
<p> [68] In this jurisdiction it remains to be determined whether in a particular 
  case a sufficient evidentiary record can be brought before a certifying court 
  to satisfy that liability can be proved as a common issue. Whether it can be 
  done is a question left open for future cases.</p>
<p> (iii) Definition of the class</p>
<p> [69] Leave to appeal to the Divisional Court was granted by Lane J. on the 
  basis that the motion judge erred in his definition of the class. As part of 
  its decision, the majority of the Divisional Court held that the class definition 
  was in error because the definition is not objective, but turns on the outcome 
  of the litigation or the merits of the claim. I agree with that conclusion. 
  As Sharpe J. stated in another case, (Robertson v. Thomson Corp. (1999), 43 
  O.R. (3d) 161 at 169 (Gen. Div.)):</p>
<p> 
<p class="indent">[ I agree with Winkler J. in [Bywater v. Toronto Transit Commission, 
  [1998] O.J. No. 4913 (Gen. Div.)] and with [H. Newberg and A. Conte, Newberg 
  on Class Actions, 3d Ed. (West Group, 1992)] at p. 6-61, that the class should 
  be defined in objective terms, and that circular definitions referencing the 
  merits of the claim or subjective characteristics ought to be avoided. Such 
  definitions make it difficult to identify who is a member of the class until 
  the merits have been determined. Definitions based upon the merits of the claim 
  also violate the statutory policy that the merits are not to be decided at the 
  certification stage.</p>
<p> [70] As discussed earlier, when the motion judge was considering the class 
  definition, he rejected the problems of self-identification of potential class 
  members because he did not consider under-inclusion as a problem. However, by 
  defining the class as those who suffered damage, he in effect defined away any 
  potential over-inclusion that could occur if proof of loss is a common issue. 
  In my view, the two errors were linked in this case.</p>
<p> VI. CONCLUSION</p>
<p> [71] In light of my conclusion that the action cannot be certified as a class 
  action because a class action is not the preferable procedure given the limited 
  common issues, it is not necessary to address the propriety of the motion judge's 
  reliance on the appellant's affidavit.</p>
<p> [72] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> [73] The respondents have provided their bill of costs. The appellants shall 
  have ten days from release of these reasons to provide the Senior Legal Officer 
  with their submissions as to costs. The respondents may respond within 7 days 
  thereafter.</p>

  at In Re: Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, 203 F.R.D. 197 (ED Pa. 2001). 
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> The same approach has been followed, 
  for example by Cumming J. in Vitapharm Canada Ltd. v. F. Hoffman-Laroche Ltd. 
  (2000), 4 C.P.C. (5th) 169 (Ont. S.C.J.) where he named lead counsel for the 
  plaintiff classes in a class action involving both direct and indirect purchaser 
  classes of plaintiffs affected by a world-wide conspiracy to increase the price 
  of vitamins to both wholesale and retail users. The ability of the different 
  classes to prove loss did not appear to be a disputed issue in the motion. The 
  issue of concern was the allocation of the global loss among the various groups. 
  The class action procedure did not fail based on the potential difficulty of 
  allocating damages. In the Divisional Court decision in the case at bar, Somers 
  J. specifically left open the possibility that there could be indirect purchaser 
  anti-trust claims advanced by way of class proceeding, and at para. 44, referred 
  to the Vitapharm case.
