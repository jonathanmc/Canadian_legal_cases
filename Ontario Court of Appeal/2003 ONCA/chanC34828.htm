<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice A. M. Gans of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on April 25, 2000 and from the sentence imposed on August 14, 
  2000.</p>
<p>SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p class="indent"> </p>
<p>[1] On April 25, 2000, Gans J. convicted the appellant of possession of heroin 
  for the purpose of trafficking and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal 
  sentence.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge found that the appellant was &#147;an active participant&#148; 
  in a transaction whereby he and others obtained possession of a package containing 
  one gram of heroin together with nine wooden blocks and a transmitting device 
  that were planted by the police. </p>
<p>[4] The transaction was carried out as part of what is generally referred to 
  as a controlled delivery. After intercepting the package and removing over six 
  kilograms of heroin, R.C.M.P. officers inserted the transmitting device and 
  the wooden blocks. They then tracked the package as it continued to its destination. 
</p>
<p>[5] The main issue on appeal is the legal effect of a controlled delivery where 
  the authorities have removed all but one gram of the contraband. </p>
<p>[6] The appellant does not dispute the trial judge&#146;s finding that he was 
  in constructive possession of a single gram of heroin. However, he submits that 
  possession of one gram of heroin is not sufficient to found a conviction for 
  possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[7] Further, although the appellant concedes that there may have been evidence 
  at trial of an attempt to possess heroin for the purpose of trafficking, he 
  contends that there is no such offence known to Canadian criminal law. </p>
<p>[8] Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle 
  in imposing a sentence of ten years imprisonment.</p>
<p>[9] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal against conviction 
  and the appeal against sentence. </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>[10] In April 1997, Canada Customs seized a package that arrived from Hong 
  Kong addressed to a Canadian postal station and turned it over to the R.C.M.P. 
  The package contained nine blocks of heroin weighing over six kilograms that 
  had an estimated street value in excess of two million dollars.</p>
<p>[11] After receiving the package, R.C.M.P. officers removed all of the heroin 
  save for one gram, inserted the wooden blocks and the transmitting device, and 
  then forwarded the package to its intended destination. Mr. Kim Thuran Tran 
  was arrested after he retrieved the package from the postal station. </p>
<p>[12] As a result of his dealings with the police, Mr. Tran informed them of 
  his involvement with the appellant and agreed to assist them in continuing the 
  controlled delivery. The police placed a wiretap on Mr. Tran&#146;s cellular 
  telephone and began surveillance. Between May 26 and May 29, 1997, police taped 
  10 telephone calls from Mr. Tran to the appellant. </p>
<p>[13] On May 24, 1997, police observed Mr. Tran meeting the appellant behind 
  a donut shop at a plaza. The appellant attended the meeting with Mr. Zhong. 
  The meeting was interrupted unexpectedly by a routine police patrol. However, 
  Mr. Tran came away with $3,000, and, within a few hours, he had arranged another 
  meeting with the appellant, two days later, at the same plaza. </p>
<p>[14] On May 26, 1997, the appellant arrived at the plaza as planned. Mr. Zhong 
  and another man met briefly with the appellant inside a restaurant and then 
  returned to their vehicles. Within minutes, Mr. Tran arrived at the plaza in 
  a taxi driven by an R.C.M.P. officer. Mr. Tran was carrying the controlled delivery 
  package in a gym bag. He handed the gym bag to one of the two men who met the 
  appellant in the restaurant and, in return, received a bag containing $7020. 
  Soon after the exchange, the appellant and the two other men left the plaza 
  in their respective vehicles. </p>
<p>[15] Approximately ten minutes later, the appellant telephoned Mr. Tran complaining 
  that the &#147;box was no good&#148;. He instructed Mr. Tran to meet him and 
  made several further telephone calls to Mr. Tran in the interval. After meeting 
  with Mr. Tran again, the appellant was arrested. </p>
<p>[16] Following his arrest, the appellant told the police that a person he knew 
  in Hong Kong telephoned and instructed him to give money to a person named Old 
  Chung. He said that he drove to the plaza as the result of the telephone call 
  and gave the money to Mr. Zhong. </p>
<p>[17] The evidence at trial consisted primarily of wiretap evidence and the 
  testimony of a number of police officers who carried out the surveillance. Mr. 
  Tran did not testify. Counsel informed the trial judge that he was considered 
  &#147;a manifestly unreliable and untrustworthy witness&#148;. In addition, 
  counsel agreed on the following facts: </p>
<p class="indent">1. The R.C.M.P. removed virtually all of the heroin from the 
  original package, save &#133; for one gram which was adhered to the hollow of 
  one of the nine replacement wooden blocks. Its exact location was unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">2. &#133; the heroin placed in the package may or may not have 
  been seen upon opening by those to whom the package was given.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The R.C.M.P. had inserted a transmitting device in the package, 
  as well, which was about the size of a computer mouse &#133; [and] would have 
  been observable by anyone opening the box.</p>

<p>The Trial Judge&#146;s Findings</p>
<p>[18] The trial judge rejected the appellant&#146;s contention that he was a 
  mere delivery person for the actual recipient of the package and that he was 
  unaware of the nature of the transaction. That finding is not in issue on appeal.</p>
<p>[19] Based on findings that the appellant had some measure of control over 
  the package and knew that there was heroin inside it, the trial judge concluded 
  that the appellant was in constructive possession of the heroin. </p>
<p>[20] On the issue of control, the trial judge noted that the appellant was 
  instrumental in arranging the first meeting with Mr. Tran and found that that 
  meeting was &#147;the precursor to the ultimate hand-over on the 26th&#148;. 
  He concluded that the appellant &#147;was an active participant&#148; in the 
  transaction, that he &#147;had an integral rather than a passive involvement&#148;, 
  and therefore that he had &#147;some element or measure of control over the 
  transaction&#148;.</p>
<p>[21] On the issue of knowledge, the trial judge rejected a submission that 
  the Crown had not established possession because it failed to prove that the 
  recipient(s) had discovered the single gram of heroin that was secreted in the 
  package. The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">While this argument has some superficial appeal, it fails to 
  consider the fact that the &#147;recipients&#148; of the package were in possession 
  of the drugs the moment of the hand-over, whether they uncovered its whereabouts 
  or not after the fact. The offence was completed the moment of the transfer, 
  whether they looked inside or not&#133; </p>
<p class="indent">From all the surrounding circumstances, it is fair to conclude 
  that the recipients expected to receive and did receive heroin, albeit in much 
  diminished quantity. This last mentioned fact does not, in my opinion, alter 
  their knowledge of the nature and quality of the drug.</p>

<p>[22] Finally, the trial judge concluded that the appellant&#146;s expectation 
  that he would be receiving a substantial quantity of heroin was sufficient to 
  warrant a conviction for the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking. 
  On this issue, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the mere fact that the accused was in possession of but one gram of 
  heroin does not mandate a conviction for simple possession of that quantity 
  only. Again, the reduced quantity necessitated as part of the controlled [delivery] 
  is irrelevant to that consideration. The accused anticipated a significant quantity 
  of heroin, if not the full six kilos. The actions and activities of the accused 
  described above, culminating with the last payment of money to Tran and the 
  &#147;chase&#148; thereafter, are more consistent than not with the fact that 
  the &#147;recipients&#148; were involved in trafficking than in any other illegal 
  enterprise.</p>

<p>Analysis</p>

<p>i) Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>a) Was it open to the trial judge to convict the appellant of possession of 
  heroin for the purpose of trafficking?</p>

<p>[23] The appellant submits that, because the controlled delivery package contained 
  only a single gram of heroin, it was not open to the trial judge to convict 
  him of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. In particular, the 
  appellant contends that possession of a single gram of heroin is not sufficient 
  to constitute the offence because an element of the actus reus is missing. He 
  relies on the evidence of the officer-in-charge that possession of a gram of 
  heroin is counter-intuitive to the notion of trafficking. Further, he claims 
  that possession of a single gram of heroin is qualitatively different from possession 
  of six kilograms of heroin, and that proof of an intention to traffic the larger 
  quantity is not transferable to a single gram.</p>
<p>[24] Put another way, the appellant contends that one gram of heroin is not 
  a traffickable quantity. Accordingly, proof that he intended to traffic a larger 
  quantity cannot constitute proof that he intended to traffic the single gram 
  that he possessed. Possession of a single gram of heroin therefore is not sufficient 
  to constitute the actus reus of the offence of possession of a controlled substance 
  for the purpose of trafficking. Properly analyzed, the transaction can only 
  be treated as an attempt to possess heroin for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[25] Finally, the appellant contends that it was never part of the Crown&#146;s 
  theory that he was in possession of a single gram of heroin for the purpose 
  of trafficking.</p>
<p>[26] I reject the appellant&#146;s submissions for three reasons. </p>
<p>[27] First, in my view, possession of a particular quantity of a controlled 
  substance is not part of the actus reus of the offence of possession for the 
  purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[28] The offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking is set out in 
  s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act<a href="#1">[1]</a>: <a name="r1"></a></p>
<p class="indent">5(2) No person shall, for the purpose of trafficking, possess 
  a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>

<p>[29] &#147;Traffic&#148; is defined in s. 2(1) of the Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act: </p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Traffic&#148; means, in respect of a substance included 
  in any of Schedules I to IV, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or 
  deliver the substance,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b),</p>
<p class="indent">otherwise than under the authority of the regulations. </p>

<p>[30] Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act sets out two components 
  of the actus reus of the offence that it creates: i) that the accused possess 
  a substance; and ii) that the substance possessed actually be a substance named 
  in one of the schedules to the act. </p>
<p>[31] The relevant authorities establish that the mens rea of the offence includes 
  knowledge of the nature of the substance in the sense that an accused person 
  must believe that it is a controlled substance.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  Further, s. 5(2) specifically requires that the accused person possess the controlled 
  substance for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[32] Notably however, none of s. 5(2), the definition of &#147;traffic&#148;, 
  or the relevant authorities refers to quantity or to knowledge of a particular 
  quantity as an element of the offence or as a component of the actus reus.</p>
<p>[33] That said, the quantity of a controlled substance that an accused person 
  possesses often plays a role in determining whether an inference of possession 
  for the purpose of trafficking should be drawn. However, the fact that quantity 
  can be, and often is, an indicium of purpose, does not make it a part of the 
  actus reus of the offence. </p>
<p>[34] As noted, neither s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act nor 
  the definition of traffic, nor the relevant authorities stipulate that quantity 
  is a part of the actus reus of the offence. Moreover, as a matter of logic, 
  the fact that a person in </p>

<p>possession of illicit drugs would or would not traffic the particular quantity 
  of drug that he possesses should not govern the factual question of purpose. 
  For example, the fact that a retailer or wholesaler of illicit drugs would not 
  generally traffic less than a particular quantity should not preclude a conviction 
  for possession for the purpose of trafficking where it is established that that 
  individual planned to add to the smaller quantity so that he would have a quantity 
  suitable for trafficking. </p>
<p>[35] Accordingly, although relevant to proof of an accused person&#146;s intent, 
  I conclude that the quantity of a controlled substance that an accused person 
  possesses does not form part of the actus reus of the offence of possession 
  for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p>[36] Second, I specifically reject the appellant&#146;s submission that there 
  is any issue concerning whether his intent in relation to the larger quantity 
  he arranged to purchase is transferable to a single gram or that the trial judge 
  made any error in finding that he possessed heroin for the purpose of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>[37] The trial judge based his finding concerning the appellant&#146;s purpose 
  on the quantity of heroin that the appellant anticipated receiving as well as 
  the circumstances surrounding the transaction that the appellant arranged. It 
  is implicit in the trial judge&#146;s reasons that he concluded that the fact 
  that the appellant may have been mistaken about the quantity of heroin that 
  was in the controlled delivery package did not detract from the appellant&#146;s 
  purpose for possessing that heroin at the moment when he acquired it. </p>
<p>[38] I see no error in this approach. </p>
<p>[39] In United States of America v. Dynar<a href="#4">[4]</a>,<a name="r4"></a> 
  the Supreme Court of Canada explained the role of belief and the truth of an 
  actor&#146;s belief in the elements of a criminal offence. In particular, Cory 
  and Iacobucci JJ. noted that because mens rea is the subjective element of a 
  crime, it consists of an actor&#146;s belief, rather than the truth of that 
  belief. On the other hand, the truth of an actor&#146;s belief can be &#147;one 
  of the attendant circumstances that is required if the actus reus [of the particular 
  offence] is to be completed&#148;. This occurs, for example, when knowledge 
  of a particular matter is an element of the offence. Paragraphs 68 to 72 of 
  their reasons warrant full review: </p>
<p class="indent">[68] &#133;Both s. 462.31(1) of the Criminal Code and s. 19.2(1) 
  of the Narcotic Control Act require knowledge that the property being laundered 
  is the proceeds of crime. It is tempting to think that knowledge is therefore 
  the mens rea of these offences. But &#147;mens rea&#148; denotes a mental state. 
  Mens rea is the subjective element of a crime. See Williams&#146; Textbook of 
  Criminal Law &#133; at p. 71. Knowledge is not subjective, or, more accurately, 
  it is not entirely subjective.</p>
<p class="indent">[69] As we have already said, knowledge, for legal purposes, 
  is true belief. Knowledge therefore has two components &#150; truth and belief 
  &#150; and of these, only belief is mental or subjective. Truth is objective, 
  or at least consists in the correspondence of a proposition or mental state 
  to objective reality. Accordingly, truth, which is a state of affairs in the 
  external world that does not vary with the intention of the accused, cannot 
  be a part of mens rea &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">[70] The truth of an actor&#146;s belief that certain monies 
  are the proceeds of crime is something different from the belief itself. That 
  the belief is true is one of the attendant circumstances that is required if 
  the actus reus is to be completed. In other words, the act of converting the 
  proceeds of crime presupposes the existence of some money that is in truth the 
  proceeds of the offence.</p>
<p class="indent">[71] In this, the money-laundering offences are no different 
  from other offences. Murder is the intentional killing of a person. Because 
  a person cannot be killed who is not alive, and because a killing, if it is 
  to be murder must be intentional, it follows that a successful murderer must 
  believe that his victim is alive&#133;thus, the successful commission of the 
  offence of murder presupposes both a belief that the victim is alive just before 
  the deadly act occurs and the actual vitality of the victim at that moment. 
  Both truth and belief are required. Therefore, knowledge is required. But this 
  does not mean that the vitality of the victim is part of the mens rea of the 
  offence of murder. Instead, it is an attendant circumstance that makes possible 
  the completion of the actus reus, which is the killing of a person.</p>
<p class="indent">[72] In general, the successful commission of any offence presupposes 
  a certain coincidence of circumstances. But these circumstances do not enter 
  into the mens rea of the offence. As one author observes, it is important &#147;to 
  keep separate the intention of the accused and the circumstances as they really 
  were&#148; [citation omitted].</p>
<p>[40] Applying the principles set out in Dynar to the facts of this case, because 
  mens rea consists of an actor&#146;s belief rather than the truth of that belief, 
  the trial judge was entitled to rely on the evidence concerning the quantity 
  of heroin the appellant expected to receive to determine the appellant&#146;s 
  purpose for possessing heroin at the moment he received the controlled delivery 
  package. Put another way, the truth of the appellant&#146;s belief about the 
  quantity of heroin in the controlled delivery package when he acquired it was 
  irrelevant in determining his purpose at that moment. </p>
<p>[41] Further, because the specific quantity, or knowledge of the true quantity, 
  of a controlled substance that a person possesses is not &#147;one of the attendant 
  circumstances&#148; required for completion of the actus reus of possession 
  for the purpose of trafficking, the accuracy of the appellant&#146;s belief 
  about the quantity of heroin in the controlled delivery package was also irrelevant 
  to the question of whether the offence was complete.</p>
<p>[42] All of that said, the troubling aspect of this case is the disharmony 
  that seems to arise from drawing an inference about the appellant&#146;s purpose 
  for possessing a single gram of heroin based on his expectation of receiving 
  a larger quantity. However, the apparent disharmony disappears when one recognizes 
  that the appellant obtained part of what he had arranged to purchase and that 
  the appellant&#146;s mistaken belief about the quantity of drugs in the controlled 
  delivery package does not alter mens rea.</p>
<p>[43] In my view, the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking was 
  complete in this case at the moment the appellant obtained possession of the 
  controlled delivery package containing heroin. What the appellant would have 
  done, or did, later, with the single gram of heroin that was in the package, 
  is not only speculative, it is irrelevant. </p>
<p>[44] Further, the fact that the appellant may have attempted unsuccessfully 
  to possess a larger quantity of heroin for the purpose of trafficking does not 
  negate the successful aspect of his conduct; the unsuccessful attempt is subsumed 
  within the fully completed offence.</p>
<p>[45] Third, dealing with the appellant&#146;s submission that it was never 
  part of the Crown&#146;s theory that he was in possession of a single gram of 
  heroin for the purpose of trafficking, the indictment in this case did not particularize 
  a specific quantity of heroin. Moreover, while the Crown may be bound to prove 
  formal particulars (subject to the surplasage rule), it is not obliged to prove 
  a specific theory of its case<a href="#5">[5]</a>. <a name="r5"></a></p>
<p>[46] As I have concluded that it was open to the trial judge to convict the 
  appellant of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, I would dismiss 
  the appeal against conviction.</p>
<p>b) Does the Offence of Attempted Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking 
  Exist in Canadian Law?</p>
<p>[47] Even if I am wrong in concluding that it was open to the trial judge to 
  convict the appellant of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, 
  I would not give effect to the appellant&#146;s submission that an acquittal 
  should be entered. Rather, I would set aside the conviction for the offence 
  as charged and substitute a conviction for the lesser but included offence of 
  attempted possession for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[48] The appellant submits that attempted possession for the purpose of trafficking 
  is not an offence known to Canadian criminal law and that this court should 
  refuse to extend the limits of criminal liability by holding that it exists. 
</p>
<p>[49] There are two main components of the appellant&#146;s position. </p>
<p>[50] First, attempted possession for the purpose of trafficking is not an offence 
  that is properly subject to the law of attempt as set out in s. 24 of the Criminal 
  Code. </p>
<p>[51] Second, criminal law policy does not support the criminalization of conduct 
  that could amount to attempted possession for the purpose of trafficking. If 
  criminalization is necessary to address the specific problem presented by controlled 
  deliveries, that issue should be addressed by specific legislation.</p>
<p>[52] Beginning with the first component of the appellant&#146;s submissions, 
  the appellant contends that the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking 
  as set out in s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is itself an 
  attempt. He says that s. 5(2) seeks to punish the state of being prepared to 
  traffic, and that it is therefore the equivalent of attempting to traffic, which 
  arises by applying s. 24 of the Criminal Code to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs 
  and Substances Act. </p>
<p>[53] Relying on comments by J. Stephen in A History of the Criminal Law of 
  England<a href="#6">[6]</a>,<a name="r6"></a> the appellant contends that it 
  has long been recognized that, because of their inherent character as attempts, 
  there are certain offences that are not subject to the law of attempt. In addition, 
  he relies on R. v. Dungey<a href="#7">[7]</a>,<a name="r7"></a> in which this 
  court held that attempting to conspire to defraud is not an offence because 
  to hold otherwise would be &#147;tantamount to convicting a person of an attempt 
  to attempt to defraud&#148;. </p>
<p>[54] The appellant therefore submits that s. 24 of the Criminal Code should 
  not be applied on what is effectively a second occasion to create an offence 
  of attempting to attempt to traffic. </p>
<p>[55] Further, the appellant submits that there is a conceptual shortcoming 
  in applying the law of attempt to possession offences. In particular, he says 
  that the only acts that are sufficiently proximate to the offence of possession 
  to justify a finding of attempt are the acts of obtaining or acquiring the controlled 
  substance. However, as those are the very acts by which the crime of possession 
  is consummated, they cannot also constitute the act or omission required for 
  an attempt<a href="#8">[8]</a>.<a name="r8"></a></p>
<p>[56] Turning to the second component of his submissions, the appellant contends 
  that, because possession for the purpose of trafficking punishes the state of 
  being prepared to traffic, it is essentially a form of inchoate criminality. 
  He submits that, in the absence of specific legislative direction, reaching 
  back one step further and punishing an attempt to achieve a state of being prepared 
  to attempt to traffic extends the reach of the criminal law too far. Again, 
  the appellant relies on this court&#146;s holding in Dungey that it would extend 
  the criminal law too far to find that there is an offence of attempting to conspire 
  to defraud. </p>
<p>[57] I do not accept the appellant&#146;s submissions for three reasons.</p>
<p>[58] First, as I read s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, Parliament 
  saw fit to express what the appellant characterizes as an attempt in the form 
  of a substantive offence. Moreover, the law of attempt is codified in Canada 
  in s. 24 of the Criminal Code. I see nothing in s. 24 to indicate that it does 
  not apply to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.</p>
<p>[59] I will repeat s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for ease 
  of reference: </p>
<p class="indent">5(2) No person shall, for the purpose of trafficking, possess 
  a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV.<a href="#9">[9]</a><a name="r9"></a></p>

<p>[60] On a plain reading of s. 5(2), possession for the purpose of trafficking 
  appears to have been enacted as a substantive offence. Put another way, the 
  section is not expressed in language indicating that the offence created by 
  the section is attempting to traffic.</p>
<p>[61] Turning to s. 24 of the Criminal Code, it provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">24(1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, 
  does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is 
  guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under 
  the circumstances to commit the offence.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The question whether an act or omission by a person who 
  has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the 
  offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a 
  question of law.</p>
<p>[62] As already stated, I see nothing in s. 24 to indicate that it was not 
  intended to apply to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act <a href="#10">[10]</a>.<a name="r10"></a> 
</p>
<p>[63] Second, I do not accept the appellant&#146;s submission that there is 
  a conceptual shortcoming in applying the law of attempt to possession for the 
  purpose of trafficking. For example, in this case, had the police removed all 
  of the heroin from the controlled delivery package, the appellant&#146;s act 
  of acquiring possession of the package would not have consummated possession 
  of a controlled substance, because there would have been no controlled substance 
  to possess. Accordingly, the fact that the appellant&#146;s act of acquiring 
  the package would have consummated the act of possession had the authorities 
  not intervened should not preclude conviction based on the law of attempt where 
  the authorities&#146; intervention prevented consummation of the complete offence.</p>
<p>[64] Further, although s. 24(2) of the Criminal Code makes it clear that acts 
  that amount to &#147;mere preparation&#148; are &#147;too remote to constitute 
  an attempt&#148;, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which acts 
  or omissions falling short of obtaining possession would be sufficiently proximate 
  to evidence an attempt. Taking this case as an example once again, had the police 
  intervened at a point when Mr. Tran was about to hand the controlled delivery 
  package to Mr. Zhong and Mr. Zhong was about to hand the money to Mr. Tran, 
  I see no impediment to holding that Mr. Zhong&#146;s actions were sufficient 
  to constitute an attempt.</p>
<p>[65] Third, I do not agree that either this court&#146;s decision in Dungey 
  or criminal law policy support the appellant&#146;s position that the offence 
  of attempted possession for the purpose of trafficking does not exist. </p>
<p>[66] In reaching the conclusion in Dungey that it would extend the criminal 
  law too far to find that there is an offence of attempting to conspire to defraud, 
  Dubin J.A. pointed out at p. 95 that conspiracy criminalizes behaviour that 
  may not have reached a preparatory stage equivalent to that of an attempt: </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;if the object of making such agreements punishable is 
  to prevent the commission of the substantive offence before it has even reached 
  the stage of an attempt, there appears to be little justification in attaching 
  penal sanction to an act which falls short of a conspiracy to commit the substantive 
  offence.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the substantive offence was fraud. To hold 
  that there is an offence of attempting to conspire to defraud is tantamount 
  to convicting a person of an attempt to attempt to defraud.</p>
<p>[67] Clearly Dubin J.A. had two issues in mind: 1) the progressive stages of 
  behaviour that culminate in the commission of a crime i.e. thinking about committing 
  a crime, preparing to commit a crime, attempting to commit a crime, and actually 
  committing the crime; and 2) where in that progression the criminal law should 
  intervene. Accordingly, when applying Dungey to other cases, the focus must 
  be on where in the progressive stages leading to the commission of a crime the 
  particular conduct falls and whether the criminal law should intervene at that 
  stage. </p>
<p>[68] In my view, although possession for the purpose of trafficking shares 
  certain characteristics of inchoate offences such as counselling and conspiracy, 
  it also reflects a progression in behaviour that has reached the stage of criminal 
  conduct. </p>
<p>[69] Strictly inchoate crimes are a unique class of criminal offences in the 
  sense that they criminalize acts that precede harmful conduct but do not necessarily 
  inflict harmful consequences in and of themselves. It can thus be appreciated 
  that it could extend the criminal law too far to reach behind those acts and 
  criminalize behaviour that precedes those acts. However, although possession 
  for the purpose of trafficking precedes the substantive offence of trafficking, 
  it can hardly be said that it does not, of itself, inflict harmful consequences. 
  It represents a state of affairs in which preparatory behaviour has crystallized 
  into the acquisition of a controlled substance. This state of affairs is in 
  itself harmful to society and the level of harm is exacerbated by the accompanying 
  purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p>[70] In my view, possession for the purpose of trafficking reflects a progression 
  in behaviour sufficiently advanced to warrant reaching behind it and criminalizing 
  behaviour that amounts to an attempt to achieve that state of affairs. I see 
  no policy justification for refusing to make it subject to the law of attempt. 
  I would not give effect to this alternative ground of appeal.</p>
<p>ii) Did the Trial Judge err in principle in imposing a sentence of ten years 
  imprisonment?</p>
<p>[71] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in principle in two 
  respects in imposing a sentence of ten years imprisonment. </p>
<p>[72] First, taking account of the circumstances of the appellant, his involvement 
  in the offence, the six-year sentence imposed on Mr. Tran, and the fact that 
  the appellant&#146;s actions consisted primarily of an attempt, the trial judge 
  erred by imposing a sentence that is demonstrably unfit. Second, the trial judge 
  erred by relying on two authorities that involved charges of importing heroin 
  rather than possession for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>[73] I do not accept either submission. </p>
<p>[74] It is clear that, but for the intervention of the authorities, the appellant 
  would have succeeded in his efforts to obtain possession of a much larger quantity 
  of heroin than that which he actually received. Because the appellant&#146;s 
  efforts were frustrated only as the result of that intervention, I see no reason 
  for reducing his sentence in any significant way from that which would have 
  been imposed had the appellant succeeded. For the same reason, even if I am 
  wrong in my conclusion that it was open to the trial judge to convict the appellant 
  for the full offence and the appellant should have been convicted only for an 
  attempt, I do not view that as a basis for reducing the sentence that was imposed.</p>
<p>[75] Taking account of the quantity of heroin and the trial judge&#146;s finding 
  that that the appellant was integrally involved in the transaction, in my view, 
  the sentence of ten years imprisonment that the trial judge imposed is not demonstrably 
  unfit. Although Mr. Tran received a substantially lower sentence, that sentence 
  was justified in light of his plea of guilty and the fact that he co-operated 
  with the police. Therefore, the disparity between the sentences does not create 
  an error in principle.</p>
<p>[76] Turning to the appellant&#146;s second submission, in my view, the references 
  the trial judge made to the two decisions involving importing charges did not 
  give rise to an error in principle. The first reference related to the gravity 
  of narcotics importation in the overall drug distribution scheme and the resulting 
  importance of general deterrence in sentencing. However, the trial judge recognized 
  that the reference related to importing and moved from it to the pernicious 
  and devastating effects of heroin. </p>
<p>[77] The second reference related to the gravity of importing heroin but also 
  dealt with the damage heroin causes in the community. </p>
<p>[78] In both instances, the trial judge made it clear by his comments that 
  he was alive to the distinction between the charges. While it may have been 
  preferable had the trial judge confined himself to authorities dealing with 
  like offences, I see no error in principle arising from the two references. 
</p>
<p>Disposition </p>
<p>[79] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction, 
  grant leave to appeal sentence, and dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
