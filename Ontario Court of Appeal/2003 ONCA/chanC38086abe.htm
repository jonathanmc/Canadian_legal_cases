<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We question whether the extradition judge had authority to make the impugned 
  production order. Assuming, however, that she did, we are of the view that there 
  is no basis for it. If the extradition judge was of the opinion that the record 
  did not contain sufficient evidence to satisfy the test for committal under 
  s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act, the proper course would have been to discharge 
  the respondent. (See U.S.A. v. Yang (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at para. 63.)</p>
<p>[2] Given our view that the production order should not have been made, we 
  do not see this as a proper case for ordering the exceptional remedy of a stay 
  because of the appellant's failure to comply with it.</p>
<p>[3] In the result, the appeal is allowed and a new extradition hearing is ordered. 
  We note that Mr. Tang appeared in person and made submissions.</p>
