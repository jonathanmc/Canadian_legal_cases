<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Anne M. Molloy of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on October 9, 1998.</P>  <P>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O. and ARMSTRONG J.A.:</P>  <P>
  OVERVIEW</P>  <P>
  [1] After a trial by Molloy J., sitting without a jury, the appellant, Chang, 
  was convicted of two counts of conspiracy and sentenced to a term of imprisonment 
  of one year. The appellant, Kullman , was convicted of one count of conspiracy 
  and sentenced to a conditional sentence of eighteen months. </P>  <P>
  [2] These appeals are against the convictions only. Both appellants allege that 
  the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of intercepted communications obtained 
  pursuant to two wiretap authorizations issued in Ontario. The appellants allege 
  that these authorizations were unlawful because the evidence that supported 
  the application for the first one was itself obtained illegally. That supporting 
  evidence consisted of communications in Ontario that had earlier been intercepted 
  pursuant to a wiretap authorization issued in Quebec. In particular, the appellants 
  submit that the trial judge erred in ruling: i) that there were no jurisdictional 
  defects underlying the Quebec authorization; ii) that the failure to comply 
  with s. 188.1(2) of the Criminal Code did not render the interceptions in Ontario 
  pursuant to the Quebec authorization unlawful; and iii) that the continued use 
  of the unexpired portion of the Quebec authorization once the Quebec investigation 
  was complete did not violate the minimization requirement in s. 8 of the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</P>  <P>
  [3] In addition, Kullman argues that the trial judge erred in relying on certain 
  hearsay statements of Chang as evidence against Kullman because even if those 
  statements came within the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule, they 
  did not satisfy the necessity and reliability criteria for the admission of 
  hearsay. </P>  <P>
  [4] For the reasons below, we would dismiss the appeals.</P>  <P>
  FACTS</P>  <P>
  (b) Count One</P>  <P>
  [5] The first count in the indictment alleges that Chang conspired with five 
  named individuals (but not the appellant Kullman ) to assist Nithicha Chansiri 
  to enter Canada illegally. </P>  <P>
  [6] Chang was employed as an immigration officer at Toronto International Airport. 
  Chang's cousin, Albert Chu, was a businessman in Toronto who worked part-time 
  as an immigration consultant. Chu was associated with two other Toronto-area 
  businessmen, Eddy Chan and Bill Fong, who were also engaged in various immigration 
  ventures. Chu, Chan and Fong as well as Ms. Chansiri were named in count one 
  as unindicted co-conspirators.</P>  <P>
  [7] Three of the unindicted co-conspirators, including Ms. Chansiri, were called 
  as witnesses by the Crown. In addition, the Crown introduced a number of intercepted 
  telephone communications between several of the individuals named in the indictment, 
  including Chang.</P>  <P>
  [8] In August 1995, the RCMP, while intercepting Ontario-based communications 
  pursuant to an authorization issued in the Province of Quebec, overheard some 
  of the alleged conspirators talking about helping South Asian women to enter 
  Canada for the purpose of working as prostitutes.</P>  <P>
  [9] In September 1995, after the RCMP obtained a wiretap authorization issued 
  in Ontario, Chu was overheard trying to get Chang to participate in this venture. 
  Over the next month, communications between the alleged conspirators, including 
  Chang, indicated that a young woman would be arriving at the Toronto Airport 
  from Thailand and that Chang would assist her in entering Canada by allowing 
  her to pass through his inspection without making any of the requisite inquiries. 
  </P>  <P>
  [10] On October 15, 1995, Ms. Chansiri arrived at the Toronto Airport and was 
  admitted into Canada by Chang. Ms. Chansiri testified that after arriving in 
  Canada, she went to work as a prostitute for one of the individuals named as 
  a co-conspirator in count one.</P>  <P>
  [11] Chu testified that Chang was paid a $1,000 bribe to ensure that Ms. Chansiri 
  was processed without difficulty upon her arrival from Thailand at the airport 
  in Toronto. Chu's evidence about the bribe was confirmed by the intercepted 
  communications between Chu and Chang. After Ms. Chansiri's arrival in Canada, 
  Chang was overheard telling Chu that he had recognized Ms. Chansiri at the airport 
  from the information provided to him and had admitted her on a visitor's visa. 
  Chang made it clear to Chu that, but for his involvement, Ms. Chansiri would 
  likely have been refused entry to Canada.</P>  <P>
  [12] The trial judge found that Ms. Chansiri's visa was void ab initio as it 
  was obtained on the basis of misrepresentations made by her in Thailand. The 
  trial judge also found that Chang knew (or was wilfully blind to the fact) that 
  Ms. Chansiri's visa did not entitle her to lawfully enter Canada. The trial 
  judge relied upon the intercepted conversations to which Chang was a party to 
  conclude that Chang knew that Ms. Chansiri was coming to Canada to work as a 
  prostitute and found that the conversations conclusively proved that Chang was 
  involved in the conspiracy alleged in count one.</P>  <P>
  [13] At trial, the defence objected to the admissibility of the intercepted 
  phone conversations. After a voir dire, the trial judge admitted all of the 
  conversations. Chang's appeal against the conviction on count one relates solely 
  to the admissibility of the intercepted communications.</P>  <P>
  (c) Count Two</P>  <P>
  [14] The second count in the indictment alleges that the appellants, Chang and 
  Kullman , conspired with each other and with three other named but unindicted 
  individuals to assist unnamed persons to enter Canada illegally. The object 
  of the conspiracy alleged in count two was to sell visas to people who in turn 
  would be paid to assist individuals without proper documentation to enter Canada. 
  </P>  <P>
  [15] Like Chang, Kullman was employed as an immigration officer at the Toronto 
  Airport. During the month of October 1995, the police intercepted conversations 
  in which Chang discussed the sale of visas with his cousin, Albert Chu. The 
  visas were ultimately to be sold to Allan Lim, who intended to use them to bring 
  prostitutes into Canada from Thailand. Chu and Eddy Chan met with Chang who 
  showed them a blank visitor's visa. Chang explained that &quot;his colleague&quot; 
  had acquired the visa from an overseas office; Chang showed his potential customers 
  how one could tell the visa was genuine. Subsequent to this meeting, there were 
  further discussions between Chang and Chu regarding the price to be paid for 
  the visas. There was, however, a disagreement with Lim about price and consequently 
  no sales took place.</P>  <P>
  [16] In December 1995, pursuant to a further Ontario wiretap authorization, 
  the police intercepted conversations in which Chang was again overheard talking 
  to Chu about selling visas. Over a series of calls, the two made arrangements 
  for Chang to show a sample visa to potential buyers. During some of his conversations, 
  Chang told Chu that he, Chang, needed to consult with &quot;his partner&quot;, 
  to whom he referred as &quot;George&quot;. Chang also told Chu that George was 
  someone with whom Chang worked as an immigration officer. </P>  <P>
  [17] On the evening of January 2, 1996, the police intercepted a call in which 
  Chu told Chang that the purchasers wanted to see a sample visa. The two discussed 
  requiring the purchasers to pay a deposit before showing them the visa. Later 
  that same evening, Chang was overheard for the first time speaking directly 
  to the appellant Kullman . They discussed the purchasers' request to see the 
  sample visa. Kullman was adamant that the purchasers not have access to the 
  visa because he was concerned that they might try to photocopy it. Kullman was 
  agreeable, however, to the visa being shown to the purchasers provided Chang 
  was present at all times. </P>  <P>
  [18] Immediately after that call, Chang called Chu to tell him that a deposit 
  would not be necessary, but that he could not leave the visa with anyone. On 
  January 4, in response to Chu's suggestion that they use an intermediary to 
  show the sample, Chang again said that his partner would not agree to give up 
  control of the visa for fear that it would be copied.</P>  <P>
  [19] Thereafter, arrangements were made between Chu and Chang to show the visa 
  on two or three occasions, but each time Chang failed to follow through. No 
  sale of visas ever took place. </P>  <P>
  [20] The Crown's case against Chang on the second count came from the direct 
  evidence of the co-conspirators who were called at trial as well from the intercepted 
  phone conversations to which Chang was a party. The trial judge did not use 
  the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule to admit evidence against 
  Chang and Chang's appeal against the conviction on count two is, therefore, 
  based solely on the admissibility of the intercepted conversations.</P>  <P>
  [21] Insofar as Kullman is concerned, there was no evidence that he had contact 
  with any member of the alleged conspiracy other than Chang. All of the evidence 
  against Kullman is found in intercepted phone conversations, some of which involved 
  Kullman himself and, importantly for this appeal, others of which did not. In 
  regard to the latter, the trial judge relied upon the co-conspirators' exception 
  to the hearsay rule and held that certain statements made by Chang to alleged 
  co-conspirators other than Kullman were admissible against Kullman. </P>  <P>
  [22] The trial judge ruled that the following statements of Chang were admissible 
  pursuant to the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule: (i) In October 
  1995, Chang told other co-conspirators that the source of the visas was another 
  immigration officer with whom he worked; (ii) In December 1995, in his discussions 
  with Chu, Chang repeatedly made references to his partner, whom he called George, 
  and at times said that he needed to verify certain terms with his partner; and 
  (iii) In January 1996, Chang told Chu that his partner was concerned about letting 
  the sample visa out his hands. As noted above, one of these conversations immediately 
  followed the conversation in which Kullman expressed concern to Chu about relinquishing 
  control of the sample visa. </P>  <P>
  [23] In this appeal, Kullman joins with Chang in arguing that none of the intercepted 
  phone communications obtained pursuant to the Ontario authorizations should 
  have been admitted. In addition, Kullman argues that the trial judge erred in 
  relying on Chang's statements, which were hearsay as against Kullman, because 
  even if those statements satisfied the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay 
  rule, they did not meet the necessity and reliability criteria for the admission 
  of hearsay.</P>  <P>
  THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS</P>  <P>
  (a) Background</p>
<p>[24] The ruling of the trial judge on the admissibility of the intercepted 
  communications, reported at [1998] O.J. No. 1789, is comprehensive and contains 
  a detailed description of the relevant facts. It is unnecessary to provide the 
  same level of detail here. However, in order to put what follows in context, 
  we set out the facts that are necessary to understand the arguments raised by 
  the appellant. </P>  <P>
  [25] The conversations of the appellants were intercepted pursuant to two Ontario 
  wiretap authorizations: the first granted on September 28, 1995 and the second 
  on November 16, 1995. The two wiretap authorizations have their genesis in an 
  investigation initiated by the Quebec City police force with the assistance 
  of the Quebec RCMP. That investigation concerned the alleged involvement of 
  a city official, Rene Fortin, in the bid-rigging of municipal construction contracts. 
  In the course of the investigation, a justice of the Superior Court of Quebec 
  issued a wiretap authorization on June 2, 1995 to intercept the telephone conversations 
  of Fortin and J. P. Plante, a person alleged to be involved with Fortin in the 
  bid-rigging scheme. </P>  <P>
  [26] The wiretap on Fortin's telephone led the police to believe that he may 
  be involved in another scheme relating to the sale of phony visas for entry 
  into Canada. The investigation revealed that two Ontario residents, Eddy Chan 
  and Bill Fong, referred to above, were involved in discussions with Fortin concerning 
  the visa scam. The discovery of Chan and Fong led the Quebec RCMP to seek the 
  assistance of the Immigration and Passport Section of the Ontario RCMP.</P>  <P>
  [27] The Quebec police obtained two additional wiretap authorizations on July 
  28, 1995. The first of those was mainly a renewal of the June 2nd order relating 
  to the bid- rigging allegation. The second order, described by the trial judge 
  as &quot;the Quebec Immigration Authorization,&quot; approved wiretaps on Fortin, 
  Chan and Fong. It is significant, as pointed out by the trial judge in her reasons 
  at para. 4, that:</P>  
<P class="indent"> [t]he affidavit filed in support of the Quebec Immigration 
  Authorization centred almost exclusively on information received as a result 
  of intercepting telephone calls to which Fortin was a party and which involved 
  Chan and Fong. Those interceptions had been authorized by the June 2, 1995 Quebec 
  Order. Up until this point in time, neither of the two accused (Chang and Kullman 
  ) had been mentioned in any of the intercepted communications and neither of 
  them had any of his own communications intercepted.</p>
<p>[28] On August 10, 1995, the Ontario RCMP, in response to a request from the 
  Quebec RCMP, obtained the co-operation of Bell Canada in wiretapping the telephones 
  of Chan and Fong in Ontario. This was done pursuant to the Quebec Immigration 
  Authorization without a confirmation order from an Ontario judge. The wiretaps 
  obtained pursuant to the Quebec Immigration Authorization revealed discussions 
  concerning various illegal immigration schemes. </P>  <P>
  [29] On September 28, 1995, Keenan J. of the Superior Court of Justice granted 
  a wiretap authorization at the request of the Ontario RCMP in regard to Fortin, 
  Chan, Fong and others. The application for that authorization (referred to by 
  the trial judge as &quot;the September Ontario Authorization&quot;) was supported 
  by the information and affidavit of Corporal Forrest of the Ontario RCMP. Much 
  of the evidence in the Forrest affidavit was obtained from wiretaps executed 
  under the Quebec Immigration Authorization.</P>  <P>
  [30] The wiretaps under the September Ontario Authorization provided further 
  evidence of illegal immigration schemes and, for the first time, included discussions 
  of the appellant Chang. </P>  <P>
  [31] The Ontario RCMP made a further application for a wiretap authorization 
  on November 16, 1995. The ensuing order, granted by Hawkins J. of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, authorized wiretaps on many of the same persons as identified 
  in the September Ontario Authorization, and added Chang and four others. It 
  was under &quot;the November Ontario Authorization,&quot; so described by the 
  trial judge, that telephone calls with the appellant Kullman were intercepted.</P>  <P>
  (b) Analysis</p>
<p>[32] The appellants raise three challenges to the admissibility of the conversations 
  heard pursuant to the two Ontario authorizations. Their first challenge involves 
  an attack on the Quebec Immigration Authorization. This argument is premised 
  on the fact that Corporal Forrest used information obtained from wiretaps under 
  the Quebec Immigration Authorization to support the Ontario applications. They 
  argue that the Quebec Immigration Authorization was not lawful because the Quebec 
  police failed to establish that they had pursued other investigative procedures 
  and that such procedures were unlikely to succeed as required by s. 186(1)(b) 
  of the Criminal Code.</P>  <P>
  [33] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in limiting her review 
  of the lawfulness of the Quebec Immigration Authorization to its so-called &quot;facial 
  validity&quot;. In that regard, they complain that the trial judge satisfied 
  herself only that the Quebec judge had the jurisdiction to make the authorization 
  and that the procedural steps taken to implement it were lawful and that she 
  did not consider the sufficiency of the evidence placed before the Quebec court. 
  The appellants submit that the trial judge ought to have made a determination 
  whether there was sufficient evidence before the issuing judge in Quebec to 
  establish that the statutory prerequisites to the issuance of the authorization 
  had been made out. In short, the appellants sought to have the trial judge conduct 
  the kind of review mandated in R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421 with respect 
  to the Quebec Immigration Authorization.</P>  <P>
  [34] If a Garofoli review of the Quebec Immigration Authorization had been conducted 
  by the trial judge, the appellants submit that she would have concluded that 
  there was no evidence upon which the Quebec judge could have been satisfied 
  that the investigative necessity requirement, mandated by s. 186(1)(b) of the 
  Criminal Code, had been established. Consequently, without the information obtained 
  from the wiretaps under the Quebec Immigration Authorization, there would have 
  been no evidentiary basis upon which the Ontario judge (Keenan J.) could have 
  issued the September Ontario Authorization. Without the wiretap evidence obtained 
  pursuant to the September Ontario Authorization, there would have been an insufficient 
  basis to grant the November Ontario Authorization. </P>  <P>
  [35] The appellants rely upon R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281; R. v. Wiley, 
  [1993] 3 S.C.R. 263 and R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223. The aforementioned 
  trilogy of cases asserts that information obtained as a result of unlawful activity 
  by the police should be excised by a reviewing court in determining the validity 
  of a search warrant. However, each of those cases involved the breach of the 
  applicant's own Charter rights and the court excised the information on that 
  basis. The trilogy is distinguishable from the case at bar in that the alleged 
  unlawful evidence obtained as a result of the Quebec Immigration Authorization 
  was not obtained as a result of a violation of the rights of either of the appellants. 
  Indeed, the appellants do not cite any cases in which a reviewing court excised 
  information from an affidavit in support of a wiretap authorization where the 
  impugned information was obtained as a result of the breach of a third party's 
  rights. </P>  <P>
  [36] The appellants also submit on constitutional policy grounds that the Crown 
  should not be able to benefit from unlawful conduct, whether or not it involves 
  a direct breach of the Charter rights of the appellants. The Crown, on the other 
  hand, argues that that approach is contrary to the fundamental constitutional 
  principle that as a general rule the enforcement of Charter rights must be personal 
  to the accused who makes the challenge. See R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128. 
  </P>  <P>
  [37] In this case, neither of the appellants' communications were intercepted 
  by wiretaps authorized by the order of the Quebec judge. Chang was first intercepted 
  following the September Ontario Authorization and Kullman was first intercepted 
  following the November Ontario Authorization. The Crown, therefore, submits 
  that the appellants do not have the right to attack the Quebec Immigration Authorization 
  since neither had a privacy interest affected by its execution. From this, the 
  Crown submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the appellants to attack 
  the legality of the Quebec Immigration Authorization. </P>  <P>
  [38] While the Crown's submissions before us are to the effect that the appellants 
  were not entitled to make any challenge to the Quebec Immigration Authorization, 
  it appears that before the trial judge it was argued that she was at least entitled 
  to satisfy herself that the authorization was granted by a Quebec superior court 
  judge. Once so satisfied, that would end the inquiry. The trial judge rejected 
  that argument at para. 41:</P>  
<P class="indent"> However, I cannot agree with the submission of the Crown in 
  the case before me that any inquiry with respect to whether the evidence obtained 
  from the Quebec authorization was &quot;authorized by law&quot; is satisfied 
  by the fact that the authorization was granted by a superior court judge. For 
  example, if the judge who granted the authorization had no jurisdiction to do 
  so, then it cannot be said to be &quot;authorized by law&quot;. Similarly, if 
  the extra-territorial aspect of the Quebec authorization required a confirmation 
  order from a judge in Ontario before it could be lawfully executed here, then 
  the evidence obtained as a result of the Authorization without such a confirmation 
  may not have been lawfully intercepted. Accordingly, in my view, the accused 
  have standing to raise both of these points as they relate directly to the legality 
  of the evidence upon which the Ontario Authorizations were based. For the same 
  reason, the accused have standing to challenge the conduct of the police in 
  implementing the Quebec Immigration Authorization, not only as to the alleged 
  requirement for a confirmation order but also with respect to whether the police 
  in Ontario acted lawfully in continuing to intercept communications pursuant 
  to the Quebec Authorization after being advised by the Quebec police that they 
  had essentially completed their investigation.</p>
<p>[39] The trial judge went on to conclude that by permitting the inquiry whether 
  the Quebec judge had jurisdiction to grant the authorization, she was not opening 
  the door to a full Garofoli review. We agree with her.</P>  <P>
  [40] In our view, the trial judge quite properly concluded that once an Ontario 
  judge is satisfied that the Quebec judge had jurisdiction to make the order, 
  and that the steps that were taken to execute it were lawful, then that is the 
  end of the Ontario court's inquiry. We agree that the appellants do not have 
  standing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the Quebec 
  judge made his order. We also agree with the trial judge that to permit such 
  a challenge would not appear to have any principled or logical basis. In our 
  view, the trial judge correctly concluded at para. 42:</P>  
<P class="indent"> To conduct the type of review requested by the accused in this 
  case would be in effect to substitute a &quot;but for&quot; test for the existing 
  rules of standing. Rather than establishing standing by demonstrating that the 
  Quebec Immigration Authorization permitted the interception of their own communications 
  and thereby intruded upon their personal privacy rights, the accused seek to 
  argue that the Ontario Authorizations intruded upon their privacy rights and 
  that &quot;but for&quot; the Quebec Immigration Authorization, the Ontario Authorizations 
  could not have been made. The problem with this approach is that there is no 
  logical cut-off point. One could equally say that but for the first authorization 
  intercepting Mr. Fortin in connection with the municipal corruption charges, 
  his communications with respect to the immigration matter would never have been 
  intercepted and then there would be no basis for the Quebec Immigration Authorization 
  targetting Fong and Chan; or one could move back another step and say that but 
  for the first investigation of Mr. Plante (the contractor dealing with Mr. Fortin) 
  then there would be no evidence of municipal corruption against Mr. Fortin, 
  and then there would be no basis for intercepting Mr. Fortin's calls, and then 
  his involvement in the immigration matter would never have come to light, and 
  then there would be no basis to intercept the calls of Fong and Chan and so 
  on. This process could stretch back into infinity. </p>
<p>[41] The appellants argued at trial that the concern expressed by the trial 
  judge did not arise because they sought to limit the inquiry to only one level 
  back. However, we agree with the trial judge that there needs to be a principled 
  reason for taking the inquiry back even one level and a logical basis for stopping 
  there. In our view, the trial judge articulated a principled and practical approach 
  to the review of another province's wiretap authorizations. In the present circumstances, 
  where there is no evidence of a direct breach of a party's Charter rights under 
  the Quebec Immigration Authorization, the Ontario court should not review the 
  sufficiency of the evidence giving rise to that authorization. We are also of 
  the view that for an Ontario superior court judge in these circumstances to 
  review the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the authorization of another 
  province's superior court would offend the general rule that a court order is 
  immune from collateral attack. See Garofoli, supra at p. 1476. </P>  <P>
  [42] It may well be that if conversations of either Chang or Kullman had been 
  intercepted by wiretaps executed pursuant to the Quebec Immigration Authorization, 
  the trial judge would have been obliged to review the sufficiency of the evidence 
  underlying the Quebec judge's order. However, that is not the case before us. 
  </P>  <P>
  [43] As their second argument, the appellants submit that the combined effect 
  of ss. 188.1 and 487.02 of the Criminal Code should have prevented the police 
  from implementing the Quebec Immigration Authorization in Ontario until an Ontario 
  judge had confirmed the Quebec judge's order. In 1995 those sections provided:</P>  
<P class="indent"> 188.1(1) Subject to subsection (2), the interception of a private 
  communication authorized pursuant to section 184.2, 184.3, 186 or 188 may be 
  carried out anywhere in Canada.</p>
<P class="indent">(2) Where an authorization is given under section 184.2, 184.3, 
  186 or 188 in one province but it may be reasonably expected that it is to be 
  executed in another province and the execution of the authorization would require 
  entry into or upon the property of any person in the other province or would 
  require that an order under section 487.02 be made with respect to any person 
  in that other province, a judge in the other province may, on application, confirm 
  the authorization and when the authorization is so confirmed, it shall have 
  full force and effect in that other province as though it had originally been 
  given in that other province.</p>
<P class="indent">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">487.02 Where an authorization is given under section 184.2, 
  184.3, 186 or 188, a warrant is issued under section 487.01 or 492.1 or subsection 
  492.2(1) or an order is made under subsection 492.2(2), the judge or justice 
  who gives the authorization, issues the warrant or makes the order may order 
  any person to provide assistance where the person's assistance may reasonably 
  be considered to be required to give effect to the authorization, warrant or 
  order.</p>
<p>[44] As already stated, the RCMP in Ontario, with the co-operation of Bell 
  Canada, executed wiretaps on Ontario telephones without a confirmation order 
  from an Ontario judge. In addressing this issue, the trial judge held that &quot;[t]he 
  language of s. 188.1(2) in respect of confirmation orders is permissive, not 
  mandatory.&quot; She pointed out that the section does not require a confirmation 
  order for all wiretap authorizations which are to be executed extra-provincially. 
  Two situations call for a confirmation order. The first is when the implementation 
  of a wiretap involves &quot;entry into or upon the property of any person in 
  the other province&quot;. The second is when implementation involves an assistance 
  order pursuant to s. 487.02. However, even in those situations, a confirmation 
  order is not mandatory. We agree with the trial judge that if Parliament had 
  intended to require a confirmation order in every situation of extra-provincial 
  execution of wiretap authorizations, it could have done so in simple and straightforward 
  language. In fact, as the trial judge observed, Parliament did just that in 
  s. 487(2) of the Criminal Code, which provides that both search warrants and 
  general warrants may be executed in another territorial division but only after 
  they have been endorsed by a justice having jurisdiction in that territorial 
  division.</P>  <P>
  [45] The appellants assert as their third ground of appeal that the trial judge 
  erred in ruling that the police did not violate the minimization requirement 
  under s. 8 of the Charter when they continued to rely upon a wiretap authorization 
  originally obtained for an investigation which had been completed. The appellants 
  submit that the investigation which gave rise to the issuance of the Quebec 
  Immigration Authorization was complete by August 23, 1995. However, they complain 
  that the Ontario RCMP continued to intercept conversations until the expiry 
  of the Quebec Immigration Authorization in late September. </P>  <P>
  [46] The trial judge ruled that she did not need to address the legal submissions 
  advanced in support of that argument, since there was no factual foundation 
  for it. She made findings of fact to the effect that the investigation was multi-faceted 
  and, while the bid-rigging facet of the investigation was virtually complete 
  by the end of August, the immigration fraud facet of the investigation was still 
  in its early stages. There was evidence before the trial judge upon which she 
  could make the above findings of fact. We see no basis upon which to interfere 
  with those findings. </P>  <P>
  [47] In the result, we conclude that there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter, 
  and that the wiretap evidence challenged by the appellants was properly admitted.</P>  <P>
  [48] In the event that we are in error in our conclusion that there was no Charter 
  breach, we would still admit the impugned evidence on the basis that its admission 
  would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute under s. 24(2) 
  of the Charter. The Quebec Immigration Authorization and its supporting affidavit, 
  which are at the centre of the appellants' attack, were fully disclosed to the 
  Ontario judges who granted the Ontario authorizations. In our view, the police 
  acted in good faith in the belief that the wiretaps they executed were obtained 
  pursuant to valid authorizations.</P>  <P>
  THE CO-CONSPIRATORS' HEARSAY DECLARATIONS</P>  <P>
  [49] The appellant, Kullman, argues that the trial judge erred in admitting 
  certain hearsay statements of Chang as evidence to prove Kullman's membership 
  in the conspiracy. In admitting the evidence, the trial judge relied on the 
  co-conspirators' declarations exception to the hearsay rule but did not determine 
  whether the hearsay met the two requirements of the &quot;principled approach&quot; 
  to the admission of hearsay: necessity and reliability.</P>  
<P> [50] The essence of this ground of appeal, therefore, has to do with the relationship 
  between the traditional co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  the current approach to which was established by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in R. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, and the more recently-developed principled 
  approach to the admission of hearsay evidence. </P>
<P>
  [51] In R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, the Supreme Court signalled that the 
  traditional hearsay exceptions would need to be re-evaluated having regard to 
  the principled approach to the admission of hearsay. In this appeal it is therefore 
  necessary to determine first whether the co-conspirators' rule comes within 
  the scope of the re-evaluation requirement discussed in Starr, and if so, whether 
  the Carter approach survives that re-evaluation.</P>  <P>
  [52] We have divided our analysis of this ground of appeal into the following 
  six sections:</P>  
<P> a) The co-conspirators' exception<br>
  b) The principled approach to hearsay evidence<br>
  c) Does Starr apply to the co-conspirators' exception?<br>
  d) The re-evaluation exercise required by Starr<br>
  e) The Carter regime post-Starr<br>
  f) Application to this case</P>
<P>
  (a) The co-conspirators' exception</P>  
<P> [53] The co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule allows the acts and 
  declarations of an accused's alleged co-conspirators, done or made in furtherance 
  of the conspiracy, to be adduced as evidence against the accused.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  As noted above, the current approach to the application of this exception was 
  established in Carter, supra. The Carter approach prescribes three steps to 
  be followed before the trier of fact is permitted to consider such acts or declarations 
  as evidence against the accused. As restated by McIntyre J. in R. v. Barrow, 
  [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694 at para. 73, those steps are as follows:</P>  
<P class="indent"> 1. The trier of fact must first be satisfied beyond reasonable 
  doubt that the alleged conspiracy in fact existed.</P>
<P class="indent">2. If the alleged conspiracy is found to exist then the trier 
  of fact must review all the evidence that is directly admissible against the 
  accused and decide on a balance of probabilities whether or not [the accused] 
  is a member of the conspiracy. </P>
<P class="indent">3. If the trier of fact concludes on a balance of probabilities 
  that the accused is a member of the conspiracy then [the trier] must go on and 
  decide whether the Crown has established such membership beyond reasonable doubt. 
  In this last step only, the trier of fact can apply the hearsay exception and 
  consider evidence of acts and declarations of co-conspirators done in furtherance 
  of the object of the conspiracy as evidence against the accused on the issue 
  of his guilt.</P>
<P>
  [54] This model is the result of a gradual refinement of the law over time in 
  response to certain practical difficulties inherent in the application of the 
  co-conspirators' exception. Those difficulties can best be understood by tracing 
  the exception back to its most often-cited rationale.</P>  
<P> [55] Historically, the rule allowing for the admissibility against an accused 
  of acts or declarations of alleged co-conspirators was commonly grounded in 
  principles relating to the admissibility of admissions and agency. Out-of-court 
  admissions by a party have traditionally been admissible against that party. 
  Admissions by others having a relationship to a party have also long been admissible 
  against that party in certain circumstances: see J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and 
  A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2d ed., (Markham, ON: Butterworths, 
  1999) at 298 ff. In cases of conspiracy, specifically, it was accepted that 
  each party to the conspiracy implicitly authorized the others to act and speak 
  on his or her behalf in furtherance of the conspiracy; acts and declarations 
  of one party could therefore be admitted as evidence against the others: see 
  R. v. Blake and Tye (1844), 6 Q.B. 126 at 135; R. v. Connolly and McGreevy (1894), 
  1 C.C.C. 468 at 491 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Baker and Sowash (1925), [1926] S.C.R. 
  92 at 103-104.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> </P>
<P>
  [56] A preliminary condition of admissibility for co-conspirators' declarations 
  against an accused, then, was that the declarations be made in furtherance of 
  a conspiracy in which the accused was a member. This requirement presented a 
  practical problem for the Crown, in that in order to take advantage of the rule 
  admitting a co-conspirator's declaration, somehow it had to demonstrate through 
  other evidence that the conspiracy existed and that the accused was a member 
  of it: R. v. Savard and Lizotte, [1946] S.C.R. 20 at 29, per Taschereau J.</P>  <P>
  [57] It was established early on as a logistical matter, however, that a trial 
  judge may admit evidence of the acts and declarations of alleged co-conspirators 
  before the conspiracy itself has been proved: Ford v. Elliot (1849), 4 Ex. 77 
  at 81, 154 E.R. 1132; R. v. Paradis, [1934] S.C.R. 165 at 170; R. v. Koufis, 
  [1941] S.C.R. 481 at 488-89, per Taschereau J. Indeed, it was recognized that 
  in order to establish the conspiracy it would often be necessary to rely on 
  the cumulative effect of the evidence of isolated acts and declarations of alleged 
  co-conspirators: Ford, supra; Paradis, supra. The trier of fact was to keep 
  in mind, however, that where, at the end of the trial, the evidence directly 
  admissible against the accused was insufficient to establish his or her membership 
  in the conspiracy, the acts and declarations of co-conspirators could not be 
  considered as evidence against the accused: R. v. Benning, [1947] O.R. 362 (C.A.); 
  R. v. Bird, [1969] 1 O.R. 268 (C.A.).</P>  <P>
  [58] Over time, the courts developed a structured approach to handling this 
  type of evidence that permitted a court to hear the evidence of the acts and 
  declarations of an alleged co-conspirator, but to use that evidence against 
  a particular accused only if there was sufficient evidence linking that accused 
  to the conspiracy. The evolution of the law in this area culminated with the 
  Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Carter. The process set out in that case 
  for handling this type of evidence has remained intact since that time.</P>  <P>
  [59] In Carter, the court divided the decision-making process in a conspiracy 
  case according to two factual elements, each of which must be proved beyond 
  a reasonable doubt to support a conviction; the first is that the alleged conspiracy 
  existed and the second, that the accused was a member of it. The second step, 
  proof of membership, is subdivided into steps two and three outlined in paragraph 
  53 above. Under step two, the trier of fact must be satisfied on a balance of 
  probabilities on evidence directly admissible against an accused that the accused 
  was a member of the alleged conspiracy. Only after the trier of fact is so satisfied 
  can the acts and declarations of an alleged co-conspirator be considered under 
  step 3, and then only if those acts or declarations were made in furtherance 
  of the conspiracy. With this evidence, it is then for the trier of fact to determine 
  whether the accused's membership in the conspiracy that the trier of fact has 
  found to have existed under step one has been established beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</P>  <P>
  [60] Significantly, in Carter, the Supreme Court of Canada directed that it 
  is the trier of fact who determines if there is sufficient evidence directly 
  linking the accused to the conspiracy before the hearsay evidence may be considered. 
  The court rejected an approach in which the trial judge would make this determination 
  in a voir dire and then submit admissible hearsay evidence to the trier of fact 
  on an equal footing with the direct evidence. The court reasoned that there 
  would be less danger that the trier of fact would fail to grasp the need for 
  independent evidence to connect an accused to the conspiracy if the trier of 
  fact must go through the exercise of assessing the sufficiency of the independent 
  evidence linking the accused to the conspiracy.</P>  <P>
  [61] The Carter approach was subsequently tested and confirmed by the Supreme 
  Court in Barrow, supra. Most recently, the co-conspirators' exception was discussed 
  by the Supreme Court in R. v. Sutton, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595. Because the judgment 
  in Starr, supra, was released only the week before the hearing in Sutton, the 
  effect of Starr on the Carter approach was neither argued nor considered by 
  the court in Sutton. Until now, the effect of Starr on the co-conspirators' 
  exception has not been considered by an appellate court. </P>  <P>
  (b) The principled approach to hearsay evidence</p>
<p>[62] In Starr, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the traditional categorical 
  exceptions to the general exclusionary rule for hearsay are to be interpreted 
  in a manner consistent with the principled approach to determining the admissibility 
  of hearsay evidence. The principled approach allows for hearsay evidence to 
  be admitted where it meets the criteria of necessity and reliability.</P>  <P>
  [63] The principled approach was originally a response to the constraints imposed 
  by the rule limiting the admissibility of hearsay to evidence that fell within 
  one of the traditional exceptions. The genesis of the approach was described 
  by McLachlin J. (as she then was) in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531 at para. 
  18:</P>  
<P class="indent"> The hearsay rule has traditionally been regarded as an absolute 
  rule, subject to various categories of exceptions, such as admissions, dying 
  declarations, declarations against interest and spontaneous declarations. While 
  this approach has provided a degree of certainty to the law on hearsay, it has 
  frequently proved unduly inflexible in dealing with new situations and new needs 
  in the law. This has resulted in courts in recent years on occasion adopting 
  a more flexible approach, rooted in the principle and the policy underlying 
  the hearsay rule rather than the strictures of traditional exceptions.</P>  
<P>
  [64] In Khan, the court was called upon to decide whether a mother should be 
  permitted to testify about what her three-year-old daughter told her concerning 
  a sexual assault by a doctor. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the child's 
  statement to her mother did not fall within any of the established exceptions 
  to the hearsay rule. McLachlin J. reiterated the assertion made in the earlier 
  case of Ares v. Venner, [1970] S.C.R. 608, that the law of hearsay was open 
  to reform by the court to accommodate new social circumstances. She went on 
  to note that the principle underlying the judicial exceptions to the exclusion 
  of hearsay boiled down to the general requirements of necessity and reliability. 
  Assessing the child's statement to her mother against those requirements, McLachlin 
  J. concluded that the statement was necessary because the child was too young 
  to testify. She also concluded that the statement was reliable because the child 
  had no motive to falsify her story, which emerged naturally and without prompting, 
  and because the child could not be expected to have knowledge of the sexual 
  act she described. The hearsay statement of the child was, therefore, admissible. 
  </P>  <P>
  [65] This approach was reinforced in R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, where 
  the Supreme Court ruled that two of three phone calls made by a deceased shortly 
  before her death were admissible, even though the statements did not come within 
  a traditional exception to the hearsay rule. Lamer C.J.C. held at para. 32 that 
  Khan had &quot;signalled an end to the old categorical approach to the admission 
  of hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is now admissible on a principled basis, 
  the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence and its necessity&quot;.</P>  <P>
  [66] In R. v. K.G.B., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, the court made use of the principled 
  approach to admit a prior inconsistent statement of a witness for the purpose 
  of proving the truth of its contents. Following Khan and Smith, the court ruled 
  that evidence of prior inconsistent statements of a witness should be admissible 
  on a principled basis. On the question of reliability, Lamer C.J.C. set out 
  a number of considerations that would provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees 
  of trustworthiness for such statements. As for the requisite necessity, Lamer 
  C.J.C. indicated that it may arise not only in the case of an unavailable witness, 
  but also from the inability to elicit evidence of the same value from an available 
  but now recanting witness.</P>  <P>
  [67] Once the principled approach was established, the question inevitably arose 
  as to the impact it had, if any, on the traditional exceptions themselves. The 
  Court had determined in Khan, Smith and K.G.B. that evidence that did not fit 
  into a traditional exception could be admitted if it met the requirements of 
  the principled approach. In Starr, the Court was asked whether the inverse was 
  also true: could evidence that would normally be admissible because it fit within 
  a traditional exception still be admissible if it did not meet the requirements 
  of necessity and reliability?</P>  <P>
  [68] Iacobucci J., writing for the majority, answered the question decisively, 
  concluding at para. 155 that &quot;in the event of a conflict between the two, 
  it is the principled approach that must prevail. The governing principles for 
  hearsay admissibility must be reliability and necessity.&quot; Hearsay that 
  does not meet the criteria of reliability and necessity is not admissible even 
  if it comes within one of the established exceptions to the hearsay rule.</P>  <P>
  [69] In reaching that conclusion, Iacobucci J. noted at para. 193 that, in Khan, 
  the Court had declined to simply modify the spontaneous declarations exception 
  to include all statements made by children to others regarding sexual abuse 
  within a set time after the alleged incident. To do so might have automatically 
  allowed the admission of some evidence that was either unreliable or unnecessary. 
  He noted that it made little sense to permit the exceptions in their traditional 
  form to have that result.</P>  <P>
  [70] It was therefore necessary, Iacobucci J. concluded, to rationalize the 
  existing exceptions to the requirements of reliability and necessity. Such a 
  rationalization was important in order to guarantee trial fairness and to preserve 
  the intellectual coherence of the law of hearsay. Both would be compromised 
  by the admission of unreliable or unnecessary evidence simply because it fell 
  into an established exception.</P>  <P>
  [71] Iacobucci J. cautioned, however, that the complete abolition of the exceptions 
  was not the answer. The existing exceptions, he emphasized, serve a useful purpose. 
  First, he noted, they bring certainty and predictability to the law of hearsay. 
  Second, they serve an explanatory or educative function: they illustrate the 
  &quot;peculiar factors that make it desirable, or undesirable, to admit a particular 
  form of out-of-court statement&quot; (para. 204). Iacobucci J. noted that since 
  most of the exceptions are themselves rooted in the principles of reliability 
  and necessity, they are likely to be a strong indicator that evidence falling 
  within them meets those requirements. Further, the exceptions have the added 
  benefit of being fact-specific and contextually sensitive. &quot;Properly modified 
  to conform to the principled approach,&quot; Iacobucci J. explained at para. 
  205, &quot;the exceptions are practical manifestations of the principled approach 
  in concrete and meaningful form&quot;. Finally, the traditional exceptions are 
  informative about the historical and contemporary rationale for admitting certain 
  forms of hearsay.</P>  <P>
  [72] Because of the important functions served by the traditional hearsay exceptions, 
  Iacobucci J. said at para. 207 that the goal is &quot;to seek to derive the 
  benefits of certainty, efficiency and guidance that the exceptions offer, while 
  adding the benefits of fairness and logic that the principled approach provides. 
  The task is to rid the exceptions of their arbitrary aspects, in order to avoid 
  admitting hearsay evidence that should be excluded.&quot;</P>  <P>
  [73] In Starr, the Court carried out this rationalization exercise in respect 
  of the &quot;state of mind&quot; or &quot;present intentions&quot; exception. 
  Under that exception, statements of intent or of other mental states may be 
  admitted for the truth of their contents, or to support reasonable inferences 
  as to what the declarant subsequently did. Iacobucci J. considered Wigmore's 
  argument that the exception also includes a requirement that the statement &quot;be 
  of a present existing state of mind, and must appear to have been made in a 
  natural manner and not under circumstances of suspicion&quot;. While acknowledging 
  that there was some debate as to whether such a requirement had ever been adopted 
  in Canadian jurisprudence, Iacobucci J. held that the principled approach (specifically, 
  the reliability component) demanded that the present intentions exception incorporate 
  the requirement from that point forward.</P>  <P>
  [74] Iacobucci J. offered that in revisiting the hearsay exceptions in future 
  cases, courts should bear in mind the paramountcy of the principled approach. 
  He noted that evidence falling within a traditional exception is presumptively 
  admissible, as the exceptions typically have an inherent reliability component. 
  He reiterated at para. 213, however, that, in the case of conflict, the principled 
  approach must take precedence: &quot;hearsay evidence may only be admitted if 
  it is necessary and reliable, and the traditional exceptions should be interpreted 
  in a manner consistent with this requirement.&quot;</P>  <P>
  [75] Iacobucci J. also said that in rare cases, even evidence that falls within 
  an otherwise valid exception might still not meet the requirements of necessity 
  and reliability. In such a case, the evidence would have to be excluded, but 
  the onus would be on the party challenging the admissibility of the evidence 
  on that basis to show that it should not be admitted.</P>  <P>
  [76] Finally, Iacobucci J. pointed out that it is important when examining the 
  reliability of a statement under the principled approach to distinguish between 
  threshold and ultimate reliability. Threshold reliability is relevant to admissibility 
  and is concerned with whether the circumstances surrounding the statement provide 
  circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. It is not concerned with whether 
  the statement is true. Ultimate reliability is a matter to be determined by 
  the trier of fact. To this, he added at para. 217 the observation that at the 
  admissibility stage &quot;I would not consider the presence of corroborating 
  or conflicting evidence&quot;. </P>  <P>
  (d) Does Starr apply to the co-conspirators' exception?</P>  <P>
  [77] The first question that arises is whether the co-conspirators' exception 
  needs to be re-evaluated at all in light of the principled approach. Does the 
  direction in Starr to revisit the traditional hearsay exceptions apply to the 
  rule allowing for the admissibility of co-conspirators' declarations?</P>  <P>
  [78] The respondent argues that it is unnecessary to measure the co-conspirators' 
  rule against the Starr approach to hearsay exceptions, as the rule is not hearsay 
  based; rather, it is premised on admission-agency principles. As such, the rule, 
  even though it is commonly called a hearsay exception, should not be treated 
  as a hearsay exception. Accordingly, the respondent contends that the principled 
  approach to the admission or exclusion of hearsay should play no part in determining 
  whether a declaration of a co-conspirator may be used as evidence to link an 
  accused to a conspiracy. </P>  <P>
  [79] We do not accept that argument. Clearly, evidence that becomes admissible 
  under the Carter approach is by definition hearsay. Hearsay is a statement, 
  other than one made by a declarant while testifying at trial, offered to prove 
  the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is characterized by the use to which 
  an out-of-court statement is put, namely, to prove the truth of its contents: 
  see Smith, supra.</P>  <P>
  [80] The declarations of alleged co-conspirators that become admissible under 
  the Carter test are made out of court and are introduced for the purpose of 
  providing evidence that an accused was a member of the conspiracy charged. Once 
  a declaration is admitted, the trier of fact is entitled to use what was said 
  in the co-conspirator's out-of-court statement as affirmative evidence of the 
  accused's membership in the conspiracy, that is, as proof of the truth of the 
  contents of the statement.</P>  <P>
  [81] Often a declaration of a co-conspirator introduced through the Carter process 
  will be admissible in the trial for purposes other than showing membership of 
  a non-declarant accused in the conspiracy. For example, declarations of an alleged 
  co-conspirator will be admissible against the declarant, or they also may be 
  admissible to show background or context. However, the fact that a declaration 
  that comes within the Carter regime is admissible for another purpose does not 
  change the fact that the statement is hearsay against an accused, who was not 
  present when the out-of-court statement was made.</P>  <P>
  [82] There is no question that the Carter process and its counterparts in other 
  jurisdictions were developed historically on the basis of principles not relating 
  to hearsay at all. As noted above, the rationale for the rule in Canada was 
  grounded in principles governing admissions by party litigants and their agents.</P>  <P>
  [83] As to the admissibility of admissions by a party, Sopinka J. in R. v. Evans, 
  [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653 said at p. 664:</P>  
<P class="indent"> [I]t is open to dispute whether [an admission] is hearsay at 
  all &#133; [I]ts admissibility rests on the theory of the adversary system that 
  what a party has previously stated can be admitted against the party in whose 
  mouth it does not lie to complain of the unreliability of his or her own statements.</P>  
<P>
  [84] The co-conspirators' rule is based on the notion that the declarant co-conspirator 
  who speaks in furtherance of a conspiracy to which the accused is shown to be 
  a party should be considered to speak as an agent of the accused. The combination 
  of the principles relating to admissions and agency leads to admissibility.</P>  <P>
  [85] However, the fact that the co-conspirators' rule is grounded in those principles 
  does not alter the fact that a statement that becomes admissible under the Carter 
  process is hearsay and concerns about unreliability are very real. Indeed, the 
  dangers attached to the use of hearsay that give rise to the general exclusionary 
  rule are all present in the case of a statement admitted under the Carter process. 
  The statement is not made under oath, is not subject to contemporaneous cross-examination, 
  and the trier of fact has no opportunity to observe the declarant at the time 
  the statement was made. </P>  <P>
  [86] The question, then, is whether the historical basis for the development 
  of the co-conspirators' rule ought to shield it from the need to conform to 
  the principled approach to the admission of hearsay. In our view, the message 
  from the Supreme Court in Starr is clear: if the hearsay dangers are present, 
  then the evidence must conform to the principled approach - particularly the 
  requirement for reliability. The concern about the admission of unreliable evidence 
  with the resulting impact on trial fairness must take priority.</P>  <P>
  [87] In Starr, the court repeatedly emphasized that a fundamental concern with 
  reliability lies at the heart of the hearsay rule: &quot;It would compromise 
  trial fairness, and raise the spectre of wrongful convictions, if the Crown 
  is allowed to introduce unreliable hearsay &#133;&quot; (para. 200). The court 
  pointed out, with obvious approval, that the most recent definitions of hearsay 
  are focussed on the reliability concerns underlying the exclusionary rule. The 
  central concern revolves around the inability to test the reliability of the 
  declarant's assertions and the possible consequential effect on trial fairness.</P>  <P>
  [88] All of those concerns arise in the case of co-conspirators' declarations 
  that come through the Carter process. As a result, we are satisfied that the 
  re-evaluation exercise discussed by the Supreme Court in Starr should extend 
  to Carter-type declarations, regardless of the fact that the Carter process 
  derives from principles not relating to the admission of hearsay. </P>  <P>
  [89] Consistent with our conclusion, we note that, for more than twenty years, 
  the Supreme Court of Canada has consistently recognized the admission of evidence 
  through the Carter process to be an exception to the hearsay rule. In Carter, 
  McIntyre J. made it clear that the declarations in issue were hearsay and he 
  described the admission of such declarations into evidence as an exception to 
  the hearsay rule.</P>  <P>
  [90] When reiterating the process in Barrow, supra, McIntyre J., speaking for 
  the court, again described it as the application of an exception to the hearsay 
  rule. Finally, in Starr itself, Iacobucci J. specifically referred to the co-conspirators' 
  rule as an example of an exception to the hearsay rule. </P>  <P>
  (e) The re-evaluation exercise required by Starr </P>  <P>
  [91] The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Starr makes it clear that the 
  principled approach to the admission or exclusion of hearsay evidence takes 
  precedence over the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule. The result is 
  that the traditional exceptions need to be re-evaluated. They are to be maintained 
  only if they can be justified on the basis of the governing principles of necessity 
  and reliability. If not, they must be modified to conform with those overriding 
  requirements, or discarded. In carrying out the re-evaluation exercise, it is 
  important to bear in mind that even where a traditional exception is maintained, 
  it will no longer be finally determinative of admissibility. Hearsay that comes 
  within an accepted exception is only presumptively admissible for, in the end, 
  the requirements that the evidence be necessary and reliable must govern the 
  issue of admissibility.</P>  <P>
  [92] The decision in Starr expands the role of the court in excluding evidence 
  that comes within a hearsay exception. Before Starr, evidence that came within 
  an exception was admissible subject only to the overriding discretion of a court 
  to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value. 
  Following Starr, a court is required to exclude evidence that comes within an 
  exception if the party against whom the evidence is offered can rebut the presumption 
  of admissibility by showing that the evidence does not meet the requirements 
  of necessity or reliability. </P>  <P>
  [93] The pre-Starr approach had many advantages. The way in which the exceptions 
  would be applied was predictable and parties approached litigation with a good 
  deal of certainty about what hearsay would be admitted. In addition, the expenditure 
  of court time and judicial resources needed to consider admissibility issues 
  was minimized because the courts were applying well-established and well-understood 
  rules.</P>  <P>
  [94] In requiring a re-evaluation of the hearsay exceptions in Starr, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada was quick to call for caution so that the advantages that flow 
  from the use of the traditional exceptions are preserved to the extent possible 
  and to ensure that the wisdom and the experience that underlie those exceptions 
  is not lost under the new regime. Maintaining hearsay exceptions that are justified 
  on the basis of necessity and reliability, and that will therefore provide presumptive 
  admissibility, should go some distance to ameliorating the concerns that would 
  arise if all issues of hearsay admissibility were simply weighed against the 
  somewhat vague criteria of necessity and reliability. Indeed, if the existing 
  exceptions are not maintained where justified, the courts will inevitably develop 
  precedents for admitting hearsay based on the necessity and reliability criteria. 
  Those precedents, in time, would become established rules - new hearsay exceptions. 
  Accordingly, maintaining the existing exceptions, where justified, is a sensible 
  way to shortcut this process.</P>  <P>
  [95] The Supreme Court in Starr signalled that it will only be &quot;in some 
  rare cases&quot; that hearsay coming within an accepted exception will not pass 
  muster and must, therefore, be excluded. Although the possibility that hearsay 
  that fits within an exception after Starr may still be excluded brings with 
  it the prospect of the need for a voir dire to canvass the issues of necessity 
  and reliability, the presumption that flows from coming within an exception 
  should limit the number of situations in which a voir dire is required and also 
  limit the scope and complexity of the voir dire inquiry.</P>  <P>
  [96] With that background, we turn then to the nature of the exercise of re-evaluating 
  the traditional hearsay exceptions that must be carried out as a result of Starr. 
  Bearing in mind that the legal effect of maintaining a hearsay exception is 
  that it creates only presumptive, not absolute, admissibility, we are of the 
  view that the question to be asked is whether as a general rule, hearsay that 
  comes within an exception meets the necessity and reliability requirements. 
  If so, the exception should be maintained. Put another way, if a traditional 
  exception is maintained it should be the unusual or exceptional situation only, 
  in which evidence that comes within the exception would be excluded because 
  of failure to satisfy the necessity and reliability criteria.</P>  <P>
  [97] In the course of the re-evaluation exercise, it may be necessary to consider 
  whether a traditional exception needs to be modified in order to be justified 
  under the principled approach. As pointed out above, in Starr, Iacobucci J. 
  considered the present intentions exception and determined that, in future, 
  the exception should only apply when there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding 
  the making of the statement. The parameters of some traditional exceptions may 
  evolve as courts are required to consider specific fact situations in light 
  of the principled approach.</P>  <P>
  [98] If, however, it cannot be said that as a general rule evidence that comes 
  within a traditional exception, with modification if necessary, satisfies the 
  principled approach, then there is no further utility in maintaining the exception 
  and it would be unfair to create a legal presumption of admissibility arising 
  from the continued use of the exception.</P>  <P>
  (f) The Carter regime post-Starr </P>  <P>
  [99] We will examine the co-conspirators' rule in Carter against the two requirements, 
  necessity and reliability. Before doing so, we reiterate that some declarations 
  that are screened under Carter may be admissible for purposes other than proving 
  the particular accused's membership in the conspiracy. Our comments are directed 
  solely at the use of the evidence for the purpose permitted by the Carter process.</P>  <P>
  [100] We also point out that the determination of whether declarations may be 
  used by a trier of fact in accordance with Carter is made during the final decision-making 
  stage of a trial. The statements are provisionally admitted into the record 
  as a matter of convenience in order that the trier of fact can make the necessary 
  determination about their ultimate use.</P>  <P>
  [101] The evaluation of the Carter approach against the two requirements of 
  necessity and reliability can be carried out by asking - if the trier of fact 
  concludes that a declaration of an alleged co-conspirator may be used against 
  an accused as a result of the Carter process, does the declaration as a general 
  rule meet the principled requirements of necessity and threshold reliability? 
  In other words, does compliance with Carter bring with it presumptive compliance 
  with the two requirements?</P>  <P>
  (i) Necessity</P>  <P>
  [102] The co-conspirators' rule clearly meets the requirement of necessity in 
  cases where the declarant is not available to testify. In some cases, a declarant 
  may be unavailable because he or she cannot be located or because of other physical 
  reasons such as death. In cases like the present appeal, the declarant may be 
  unavailable to testify because he is a co-accused and cannot be compelled to 
  give evidence by either the Crown or the accused.</P>  <P>
  [103] When a declarant is unavailable to testify because he or she is a co-accused, 
  it is not an answer for an accused against whom the evidence is offered to say 
  that the Crown could have avoided the dilemma by charging the declarant separately. 
  The Crown has a discretion to proceed against alleged co-conspirators jointly. 
  In most cases, there are compelling reasons to do so, not the least of which 
  is the efficient use of judicial resources. It is well-established that the 
  Crown's discretion to proceed against co-accused jointly deserves considerable 
  deference and the Crown should not be restricted in the exercise of that discretion 
  by a concern about the admissibility of co-conspirators' declarations.</P>  <P>
  [104] We recognize that an earlier line of cases resulted in the proposition 
  that in the case of declarations against penal or pecuniary interest, a declarant 
  who elects not to testify because he or she is a co-accused cannot be considered 
  unavailable for the purpose of satisfying the necessity requirement inherent 
  in that exception: see R. v. Agawa and Mallet (1975), 11 O.R. (2d) 176 at 189 
  (C.A.); R. v. Demeter (1977), [1978] 1 S.C.R 538 at 544; R. v. O'Brien (1977), 
  [1978] 1 S.C.R. 591 at 599. Leaving aside the question of whether the effect 
  of that proposition was confined to that particular exception, we conclude that 
  under the fresh approach to the admissibility of hearsay evidence developed 
  later in Khan, Smith and K.G.B., a co-conspirator's declaration may satisfy 
  the necessity requirement where the declarant is a co-accused who does not testify. 
  </P>  <P>
  [105] We reach that conclusion because under the principled approach, necessity 
  can be grounded in more than just the unavailability of the declarant. In Smith, 
  Lamer C.J.C. held at pp. 933-934 that &quot;the criterion of necessity must 
  be given a flexible definition, capable of encompassing diverse situations. 
  What these situations will have in common is that the relevant direct evidence 
  is not, for a variety of reasons, available. Necessity of this nature may arise 
  in a number of situations.&quot; He then cited Wigmore's suggestion that the 
  categories of necessity should include not only instances where the declarant 
  is unavailable for the purpose of testing through cross-examination, but also 
  situations where &quot;we cannot expect&#133; to get evidence of the same value 
  from the same or other sources.&quot; In K.G.B., Lamer C.J.C. reiterated this 
  proposition, and noted at p. 798 that the &quot;precise limits of the necessity 
  criterion remain to be established in the context of specific cases&quot;. In 
  our view, in the case of co-conspirators' declarations, necessity will arise 
  from the combined effect of the non-compellability of a co-accused declarant, 
  the undesirability of trying alleged co-conspirators separately, and the evidentiary 
  value of contemporaneous declarations made in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy.</P>  <P>
  [106] Therefore, in a case where two accused charged with the same conspiracy 
  are jointly tried and one of them is a declarant of hearsay statements, implicating 
  the other in the conspiracy, the necessity requirement for the admission of 
  hearsay evidence, in our view, has been met.</P>  <P>
  [107] The more difficult question arises in the situation where a co-conspirator 
  declarant is available to testify. The respondent argues that the evidentiary 
  value of a declaration of a co-conspirator made in furtherance of the conspiracy 
  cannot be duplicated by viva voce testimony of the declarant. It is superior 
  evidence that is otherwise unavailable to the trier of fact and, therefore, 
  should always meet the necessity requirement for the admission of hearsay.</P>  <P>
  [108] The contrary argument is that if the declarant is available, the Crown 
  should at least start by calling the declarant. If the declarant as a witness 
  recants or gives evidence that is not consistent with the statement that the 
  Crown seeks to have admitted, then the Crown can seek to confront the witness 
  with the earlier statement either under s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. C-5, or by having the witness declared adverse. Depending on how the 
  confrontation plays out, the prior statement may then become admissible for 
  the truth of its contents under the principles laid down in K.G.B.</P>  <P>
  [109] An intermediate position would be to permit the Crown to introduce the 
  statement because of its unique evidentiary value and then to have the Crown 
  make the witness available for cross-examination by the defence on matters relating 
  to the making of the statement in issue.</P>  <P>
  [110] This appeal does not raise the issue of an available declarant (the declarant 
  Chang was tried jointly with Kullman and did not give evidence). This court 
  did not have full argument on the issue of whether the necessity requirement 
  is met when the declarant is available and we will therefore leave the resolution 
  of that question to another case.</P>  <P>
  (ii) Reliability</P>  <P>
  [111] The second criterion against which the co-conspirators' exception must 
  be measured is whether, as a general rule, the process in Carter will result 
  in the use of hearsay that meets the threshold of reliability, that is, evidence 
  about which there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to warrant presumptive 
  admissibility. The question of ultimate reliability under both the Carter process 
  and the principled approach is a matter for the trier of fact. </P>  <P>
  [112] In our view, evidence admitted under the Carter process meets this requirement. 
  We start by noting that the co-conspirators' rule is a long-recognized and well-entrenched 
  feature of criminal conspiracy trials. The rule is steeped in common law history 
  and similar approaches have been a fundamental part of the law of evidence in 
  Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand for many 
  years.</P>  <P>
  [113] The broad acceptance of the rule, of course, cannot validate it under 
  the principled approach. However, it can safely be asserted that for generations 
  courts have proceeded on the basis that hearsay statements of co-conspirators 
  made in furtherance of a conspiracy can be used as affirmative evidence that 
  an accused is a member of the conspiracy. The significance of the history of 
  the rule is simply that one should start the re-evaluation exercise with respect 
  for the experience and wisdom of the ages. The co-conspirators' rule was no 
  doubt developed and applied with a view to assisting the truth-seeking process 
  and to achieving fair and just results in criminal conspiracy cases. Implicit 
  in the rule is the assumption that it is safe to permit a trier of fact to use 
  hearsay that comes within the three-step Carter process. One should discard 
  a rule that has achieved such broad acceptance only with reluctance. </P>  <P>
  [114] The Supreme Court in Starr refers at para. 215 to the test for threshold 
  reliability as being &quot;circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness&quot;. 
  In the case of most hearsay exceptions, the guarantees of trustworthiness are 
  found in the circumstances in which the statements were made. As we point out 
  below, in the case of the co-conspirators' exception, the guarantees of trustworthiness 
  come from both the circumstances in which the declarations are made and the 
  use of the Carter approach. Because of that, we have recast the test for threshold 
  reliability by simply referring to guarantees of trustworthiness.</P>  <P>
  [115] There are several safeguards against the admission of unreliable evidence 
  found in the Carter approach to co-conspirators' declarations. The cumulative 
  effect of the Carter requirements provides safeguards against the dangers traditionally 
  associated with hearsay evidence and, in our view, provides sufficient guarantees 
  of trustworthiness to permit the use of hearsay that satisfies those requirements.</P>  <P>
  [116] The first requirement of the Carter approach is that the trier of fact 
  must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conspiracy in fact 
  existed. Although not a reliability-enhancing requirement itself, this is the 
  web that connects the members. This step points to the commonality of interest 
  among those who may be shown to be connected to the common unlawful object. 
  </P>  <P>
  [117] The second requirement is that it be shown on a balance of probabilities, 
  on the basis of evidence that is directly admissible against the accused, that 
  the accused was a member of the conspiracy found to exist under step one. Notably, 
  the corroborative value of the direct evidence requirement goes beyond the mere 
  fact that it is evidence that supports what is asserted in the hearsay statement. 
  It also lends itself to reasoning based on the unlikelihood of coincidence; 
  the unlikelihood of the coincidence that the direct evidence incorrectly points 
  to the accused and that the statement of the co-conspirator also incorrectly 
  points to the accused becomes a circumstance of some probative force.</P>  <P>
  [118] We recognize that in Starr, the court at para. 217 said that when determining 
  threshold reliability, a court should not consider the presence of corroborating 
  evidence. In relying on the consistency between the finding in step two of the 
  Carter approach and the hearsay statement as an indicium of reliability, we 
  are to some extent doing just that. It is significant, however, that the kind 
  of probability reasoning based on the unlikelihood of coincidence to which we 
  attach importance does not depend so much on the truth of the hearsay as on 
  the fact that it was said. Further, under the Carter approach, the comparator 
  against which the hearsay is measured is more than mere corroborating evidence. 
  It is a finding on a balance of probabilities based on independent evidence 
  that the accused is a member of the conspiracy.</P>  <P>
  [119] We also note that the statement in Starr that a court should not consider 
  corroborating evidence does not appear to be of universal application. In R. 
  v. F.J.U., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 794 at paras. 40-45, Lamer C.J.C. for the majority 
  opined that a court, in some circumstances, when considering the admissibility 
  of prior inconsistent statements, may look to the similarity between the statements 
  of two declarants as an indicator of reliability.</P>  <P>
  [120] The third requirement in Carter provides a further safeguard against the 
  use of unreliable hearsay. Assuming the hurdles in steps one and two are cleared, 
  the trier of fact may rely on hearsay declarations, but importantly only if 
  they are made in furtherance of the conspiracy. This is critical. It is not 
  enough that the hearsay words or acts pertain to the conspiracy. They must be 
  found to further the specific unlawful object which has been found to exist 
  beyond a reasonable doubt under step one and to which the direct evidence links 
  the accused under step two. </P>  <P>
  [121] The rule does not permit the trier of fact to consider idle conversation, 
  or narrative description of past events. Rather, the trier may only rely on 
  acts or declarations that further the common interest, which are the very acts 
  and declarations the parties themselves are likely to have relied upon in seeking 
  to achieve the common goal. </P>  <P>
  [122] Those types of statements have the reliability-enhancing qualities of 
  spontaneity and contemporaneity to the events to which they relate. Other hearsay 
  exceptions recognize that people are more likely to be truthful when speaking 
  spontaneously with less opportunity for contrivance. By way of example, it is 
  presumed, absent circumstances of suspicion, that a statement of future intention 
  refers to what a person intends to do and that a record prepared during the 
  ordinary course of business is likely to be accurate.</P>  <P>
  [123] Indeed, the &quot;in furtherance&quot; requirement imbues co-conspirators' 
  declarations with res gestae type qualities. &quot;In furtherance&quot; declarations 
  are the very acts by which the conspiracy is formulated or implemented and are 
  made in the course of the commission of the offence. See, for example, R. v. 
  Pilarinos (2002), 2 C.R. (6th) 273 (B.C.S.C.); R. v. Keen, [1999] E.W.J. No. 
  5578 (C.A. (Crim. Div.)).</P>  <P>
  [124] These, then, are the safeguards of reliability that flow from the application 
  of the Carter process. The appellant answers by saying that even if the Carter 
  process provides some safeguards, in criminal conspiracies there are commonly 
  circumstances that cast doubt on the reliability of the acts or declarations 
  of members to the conspiracy. The appellant starts by noting that the declarants 
  are criminals, people of unsavoury character who are engaged in illegal activity. 
  Such people are by nature untrustworthy and unreliable. That is no doubt a basis 
  for concern, particularly when such people are testifying. However, the &quot;in 
  furtherance&quot; requirement in step three of the Carter process goes a long 
  way to addressing this concern. That requirement minimizes the motive and opportunity 
  for contrivance. Moreover, the trier of fact, when assessing ultimate reliability, 
  is able to weigh the unsavoury character of the declarant against the context 
  in which the hearsay act or declaration is made. The declarant's general reputation 
  for truthfulness is usually not considered at the stage of hearsay admissibility. 
  See Starr, supra, at para. 217.</P>  <P>
  [125] The appellant also argues that, in some circumstances, an alleged co-conspirator 
  has a motive for lying - for example, a seller of drugs may try to impress the 
  purchaser by describing his or her partners in exaggerated terms or even naming 
  someone as a partner who is not connected to the conspiracy at all. We recognize 
  that there may be occasions when the circumstances surrounding the making of 
  a particular statement raise such serious suspicions about its reliability that 
  the court will exclude the evidence despite the fact it may comply with the 
  Carter process. We expect that those situations will be rare. Most often this 
  type of concern goes to the question of ultimate reliability and can be weighed 
  by the trier of fact in making a final assessment about the use to be made of 
  the evidence. We are not persuaded that the number of situations in which circumstances 
  will require the exclusion of evidence admissible under the Carter process is 
  sufficient to warrant discarding the process altogether and, with it, the resulting 
  presumption of admissibility.</P>  <P>
  [126] The appellant also points out that the admission of hearsay evidence under 
  the Carter process may be determinative of the guilt of the accused by providing 
  the link from a finding of membership in the conspiracy on a balance of probabilities 
  to a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. The importance of the hearsay statements 
  of a co-conspirator, therefore, can be critical to the outcome of the case. 
  For that reason, the appellant argues that extreme care should be exercised 
  before permitting their use. </P>  <P>
  [127] That is true. However, that is always the case with the admission of any 
  hearsay evidence. A particular piece of evidence may prove to be the final link 
  on the way to a finding of guilt. We note that under the post-Starr regime, 
  co-conspirators' declarations, like other hearsay exceptions, will have to clear 
  three hurdles before the trier of fact determines to use them towards a finding 
  of guilt. First, a co-conspirators' declaration will have to meet the Carter 
  requirements with the safeguards present there. In addition, when an accused 
  can point to circumstances in the evidence to rebut the presumption arising 
  from the application of the Carter process, the trial judge will be required 
  to scrutinize the evidence to ensure that it meets the principled approach. 
  Finally, the trier of fact will determine the ultimate reliability of the hearsay 
  before acting upon it.</P>  <P>
  [128] For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the application of the Carter 
  regime brings with it sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to warrant its 
  continued use. We are satisfied that as a general rule hearsay that comes within 
  the Carter approach will meet the threshold reliability requirement.</P>  <P>
  (iii) Conclusion</P>  <P>
  [129] In summary, we conclude that the co-conspirators' exception should be 
  maintained, at least for unavailable declarants.</P>  <P>
  [130] We note that the Carter process leaves the determination whether the co-conspirators' 
  declarations may be used against an accused to the trier of fact. Given that, 
  in future, evidence that comes within a hearsay exception will still be subject 
  to the principled approach, the question arises whether it should be judges 
  or the triers of fact who test co-conspirators' declarations against the necessity 
  and reliability criteria when it is necessary to do so. In our view, this task 
  should fall to the judges for two reasons. First, there will be greater consistency 
  in approach if the judges, rather than juries, make these types of decisions. 
  Second, applying the Carter analysis to co-conspirators' declarations is often 
  a complex task for a jury. Adding to that a further instruction, that in exceptional 
  cases the evidence should be excluded if it does not meet the requirements of 
  necessity and reliability, would be unduly burdensome and confusing. If the 
  trial judge determines that a voir dire is necessary to screen a declaration 
  against the necessity or reliability criteria, the voir dire should be held 
  before the case is left with the trier of fact.</P>  <P>
  [131] We repeat that a declaration may be admissible for purposes other than 
  its hearsay use against an alleged co-conspirator. When a voir dire is required 
  to screen a declaration against the necessity and reliability requirements, 
  the voir dire will be concerned only with the hearsay use of the declaration 
  against an alleged co-conspirator. The stage of the trial at which such a voir 
  dire is held will be a matter for the trial judge to determine having regard 
  to the circumstances of the particular trial. </P>  <P>
  [132] We wish to add a few observations of a practical nature. We are concerned 
  that conspiracy trials, many of which are already complicated, may become more 
  so if every time the Crown seeks to introduce co-conspirators' declarations, 
  the trial judge is required to hold a voir dire to determine if there is compliance 
  with the principled approach. We do not anticipate that will be the case. A 
  voir dire addressing the principled approach should be the exception. It will 
  only be required when an accused is able to point to evidence raising serious 
  and real concerns about reliability emerging from the circumstances in which 
  a declaration was made, which concerns will not be adequately addressed by use 
  of the Carter approach. As a general rule, the presumption that evidence that 
  meets the Carter requirements also meets the principled approach should obviate 
  the need for a voir dire. Moreover, when a court determines that a voir dire 
  is warranted, the voir dire should focus solely on the issue of whether the 
  circumstances emerging from the evidence are sufficient to rebut the presumption 
  that, if the evidence complies with the Carter regime, it will also satisfy 
  the necessity and reliability requirements. </P>  <P>
  [133] Finally, we again emphasize that the Carter process itself is a reliability-discerning 
  exercise that assists the court in separating declarations that are safe to 
  be considered by the trier of fact from those that are not. Although the overlay 
  of the principled approach on top of the Carter regime has the potential to 
  complicate conspiracy trials, we conclude that maintaining the Carter approach, 
  in most cases, should render the principled approach to co-conspirators' declarations 
  more efficient and more predictable than would be the case if their admissibility 
  was left to an application of only the necessity and reliability criteria.</P>  <P>
  (g) Application to this case</P>  <P>
  [134] In convicting the appellant, Kullman, the trial judge properly applied 
  the three-step process in Carter and then relied upon certain statements of 
  the appellant, Chang, as evidence connecting Kullman to the conspiracy.</P>  <P>
  [135] First, she found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a conspiracy 
  with the object of selling visitor's visas for entry into Canada. She found 
  that this was a continuing conspiracy beginning in September or October 1995 
  and continuing until January 1996. The core conspiracy involved two potential 
  transactions: the sale of visas in the fall of 1995 for the use by women from 
  Thailand who were to brought into Canada to work as prostitutes, and the sale 
  of visas in December 1995 and January 1996 for the use by businessmen from the 
  Republic of China. Neither set of transactions was completed.</P>  <P>
  [136] Next, the trial judge found that there was ample direct evidence to establish 
  that Kullman was a member of the conspiracy on a balance of probabilities. Kullman 
  worked as an immigration officer at the airport. In the January 2, 1996 conversation 
  between Kullman and Chang it appeared that Kullman was aware of the impending 
  sale of visas and that he was being consulted about the purchasers' request 
  to see blank visas. He was adamant about not allowing unsupervised access and 
  insisted that Chang be present so that the purchasers could not copy them. There 
  were indications in that conversation that Kullman 's involvement went back 
  to the fall of 1995. Kullman had control of the visas, and he was told that 
  the purchasers this time were a new group, implying he was aware of the earlier 
  attempt to sell. Based on that evidence, the trial judge quite reasonably concluded 
  on a balance of probabilities that Kullman was a member of the conspiracy from 
  the fall of 1995 to January 1996. </P>  <P>
  [137] As to the third step in Carter, the trial judge relied upon a number of 
  statements that Chang, who was clearly shown to be a member of the conspiracy, 
  made to alleged co-conspirators. In October 1995, Chang told the others that 
  the source of the visas was another immigration officer who worked with Chang 
  and who had obtained genuine blank visas when posted overseas. In December, 
  Chang repeatedly referred to his partner, and identified him as &quot;George&quot; 
  and also as someone whose approval he needed in order to show the visas. In 
  January, immediately after Chang spoke to Kullman, he called Chu and, in effect, 
  relayed the substance of what Kullman had told him.</P>  <P>
  [138] The trial judge correctly found that all of those declarations were made 
  by Chang in furtherance of the conspiracy. She therefore considered them in 
  concluding that Kullman 's membership in the conspiracy was established beyond 
  a reasonable doubt. </P>  <P>
  [139] In admitting the hearsay declarations, the trial judge did not weigh them 
  against the criteria of necessity and reliability.</P>  <P>
  [140] At trial, the defence argued that the Carter process needed to be revised 
  as a result of recent changes in the law relating to the admissibility of hearsay 
  evidence. The trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision 
  in Starr. She ruled that the hearsay declarations met the Carter requirements, 
  and that the factors of reliability and necessity played no part in determining 
  if they were admissible. However, she observed that reliability does become 
  a major factor in determining the weight to be given to evidence once admitted.</P>  <P>
  [141] As we conclude above, there is a presumption that co-conspirators' declarations 
  that make it through the Carter process meet the requirements of necessity and 
  reliability. The hearsay evidence in this case falls within that category. </P>  <P>
  [142] In our view, there is nothing in the evidence in this case which could 
  rebut the presumption that the hearsay declarations should have been considered 
  by the trial judge in her role as the trier of the facts. All of the hearsay 
  statements of Chang in issue were made in the course of discussing the sale 
  of visas and appeared to be part of normal conversations that could be expected 
  to take place between individuals contemplating such a venture. Suggestions 
  as to the unreliability of what Chang said to the alleged co-conspirators are 
  based upon speculation, nothing more. There is nothing in those statements, 
  or in the circumstances in which they were made, to raise serious concerns about 
  whether the statements should be considered in determining whether Kullman's 
  membership in the conspiracy had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  Even if the trial judge had approached this issue in the manner we have discussed 
  in these reasons, this is not a case in which she would have been required to 
  hold a voir dire to canvass the issues of necessity and reliability.</P>  <P>
  [143] In the result, we are satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to use 
  the declarations of Chang as she did and we do not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</P>  <P>
  DISPOSITION</P>  <P>
  [144] For the above reasons, we would dismiss the appeals.</p>
