<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice J.M. Bordeleau of the Ontario Court of 
  Justice dated October 1, 2002. </p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal concerns first, the duty of a trial judge to give reasons on 
  a ruling admitting hearsay evidence and second, the admissibility for its truth 
  of a statement made by a recanting witness. The appellant was convicted by Bordeleau 
  J. of assault causing bodily harm on his wife.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> There was 
  a body of circumstantial evidence to support the conviction. However, the appellant's 
  wife testified and denied that the appellant assaulted her. She explained that 
  the significant injuries observed by the police were caused by an accidental 
  fall. The trial judge permitted the Crown to cross-examine the witness on statements 
  she had made to the police and then ruled that the statements were admissible 
  for their truth in accordance with the decision in R. v. B. (K.G.) (1993), 79 
  C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [2] In my view, the trial judge erred in law in failing to give reasons for 
  admitting the statement for its truth. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal 
  and order a new trial.</p> <p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>[3] Just after six o'clock in the morning of July 27, 2002, three police officers 
  came to the appellant's apartment building as a result of a complaint from another 
  resident in the building. The officers heard some noise from within the appellant's 
  apartment that sounded like a bit of a struggle. The officers then entered the 
  building and went to the appellant's apartment. They did not hear anything when 
  they reached the door. The officers knocked on the door but the appellant refused 
  to open it. They then broke through the door with an axe. Two officers placed 
  the appellant under arrest and removed him from the apartment. The appellant 
  appeared to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>[4] The third officer, Constable Hollett, saw a table knocked over, broken 
  glass on the floor and a tire iron lying on the floor of the bathroom. He then 
  located Ms. Chappell curled up in a ball on the bed in the bedroom. While he 
  had earlier drawn his service revolver, he had put it back in the holster before 
  approaching Ms. Chappell. She was crying and had several visible serious injuries, 
  including an apparent fracture on her right hand. Her eyes were swollen and 
  red, and her lips were swollen. According to Constable Hollett, Ms. Chappell 
  said, &quot;He was beating on me for the past two hours. I tried, but I couldn't 
  get out. He used a crowbar to beat me.&quot; She made this statement before 
  the officer had a chance to say anything to her. She was shaking and crying 
  and seemed upset and scared and &quot;terrified as to the ordeal that she just 
  endured&quot;. The bedroom seemed to be in disarray, as if there had been a 
  struggle.</p> <p>
  [5] Constable Hollett tried to speak to Ms. Chappell. She was uncooperative 
  and initially refused to identify herself. She said, &quot;I didn't want anything 
  to happen from this. I didn't want police involvement.&quot; She also told the 
  officer that she was terrified of the appellant and that he would kill her &quot;if 
  she got involved&quot;. At some point, ambulance attendants took Ms. Chappell 
  to the hospital.</p> <p>
  [6] Ms. Chappell is 5'6&quot; and weighs about 120 pounds. The appellant is 
  6'2&quot; and weighs about 180 pounds.</p> <p>
  [7] At trial, Constable Hollett described Ms. Chappell as &quot;may have been 
  drinking, but she did not seem intoxicated&quot;, &quot;a bit intoxicated&quot;, 
  &quot;appeared sober &#133; I knew she was drinking some alcohol&quot;. In his 
  notes, he described her as &quot;intoxicated&quot;.</p> <p>
  [8] Another officer, Constable Burns tried to interview Ms. Chappell at the 
  hospital. She kept saying, &quot;you don't understand, this is the end for me. 
  I didn't do this. You can't do this to me.&quot; Constable Burns told her about 
  the mandatory policy of laying charges in domestic assault cases. Ms. Chappell 
  pleaded with her not to lay charges, that the appellant would kill her. Ms. 
  Chappell also wanted the appellant to know that she did not call the police. 
  Constable Burns asked Ms. Chappell about her injuries. She said that she did 
  it to herself and when asked about the blood on her arm, she said, &quot;I got 
  hungry and took a bite.&quot; She refused to let the police take pictures of 
  her injuries or to authorize the release of her medical records.</p> <p>
  [9] Ms. Chappell testified that the appellant is &quot;loving and caring&quot;. 
  She testified that the night the police came to her apartment she and the appellant 
  had been drinking. They were arguing, shouting and calling each other names. 
  The appellant broke a glass in the kitchen and then went to the living room 
  to sleep. Ms. Chappell tripped over his toolbox, fell down the stairs, and landed 
  on a tire iron from the box. She yelled at the appellant for leaving his tools 
  around and she carried the tire iron up to the bathroom. She rinsed off her 
  hand and was going to sleep in the bedroom when the police broke in.</p> <p>
  [10] Ms. Chappell testified that she was intoxicated. She remembered talking 
  to Constable Hollett. He said, &quot;you took a bad beating&quot; and she said, 
  &quot;you don't understand&quot;. She asked him if she could go to the bathroom, 
  but he said &quot;no&quot;. She admitted telling the officer that the appellant 
  had been beating on her for the past two hours, that she could not get out, 
  and that he had used a crowbar to beat her. However, she testified that she 
  said that only after he refused to let her go to the bathroom. After she told 
  the officer that the appellant had beat her he let her go to the washroom. She 
  testified that she caused the injuries to herself while she was in a state of 
  intoxication.</p> <p>
  [11] She also admitted that she told the officer, &quot;You don't understand, 
  he'll kill me&quot; but testified that she said that because the police had 
  arrested the appellant saying that he had beat her up and she knew he would 
  be &quot;mad&quot;. She was upset, but denied being scared. While the appellant 
  was in jail pending the trial she visited him about twice a week. She apologized 
  to him because he was in jail for something she did to herself.</p> <p>
  [12] Constable Hollett agreed that he originally told Ms. Chappell that she 
  could not go to the bathroom. He said it was out of concern for her safety. 
  However, he later did let her go to the bathroom. He could not recall what changed 
  his mind.</p> <p>
  [13] Although the tenor of Constable Hollett's evidence was that he alone questioned 
  Ms. Chappell at the apartment, another officer, Constable White testified that 
  he also talked to Ms. Chappell. Constable White's evidence was not very specific 
  about the conversation. He only recalled that Ms. Chappell was uncooperative 
  and that she said, &quot;He's going to kill me.&quot; He could not recall whether 
  Constable Hollett had a conversation with Ms. Chappell. When the ambulance arrived 
  about thirty minutes after the police, this officer went with Ms. Chappell. 
  At the hospital, she kept saying, &quot;I can't. He will kill me.&quot; He testified 
  that he did not recall whether she was intoxicated.</p> <p>
  THE SECTION 9(2) CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
<p>[14] The trial judge ruled that Crown counsel could cross-examine Ms. Chappell 
  in accordance with s. 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5. 
  Ms. Chappell did not materially change her testimony during this cross-examination. 
  She agreed that she never told the police that the injuries were caused when 
  she fell down the stairs and landed on the tire iron. She testified that she 
  was scared not of her husband, but because the police had smashed her door down, 
  were in her apartment, had assaulted her husband, and dragged him away. She 
  testified that the injuries occurred 45 minutes to an hour before the police 
  arrived. She claimed that Constable Hollett kept saying that her husband beat 
  her and hit her and asking her what he used. He refused to let her go to the 
  bathroom because it was &quot;a crime scene&quot;.</p> <p>
  [15] Ms. Chappell denied that she concocted her trial testimony while visiting 
  with the appellant at the jail.</p> <p>
  THE HEARSAY RULING</p>
<p>[16] Crown counsel sought to have Ms. Chappell's statements to all three officers 
  admitted for their truth pursuant to R. v. B. (K.G.). The trial judge's ruling 
  was as follows:</p> 
<p class="indent"> It is clear that the statements are not signed, that 
  they are only notes from the officers, that there is an absence in this case 
  of video or audio recording and it is not a formal statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, it is clear, and it has not been argued on that 
  point, and I am satisfied that necessity has been established by the Crown.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, the only issue for this court to decide is as to 
  whether the statements made to the three officers are in fact reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">I have heard the submission of both [counsel] and they 
  have referred to me numerous cases, including the case of Regina v. K.G.B. which 
  is a well known decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, having heard the evidence, having heard the testimony 
  of the police officers, having heard the testimony of the complainant in this 
  case, Maureen Chappell, I have come to the conclusion that, on the totality 
  of the events of the day in question, namely, on the 27th of July of the year 
  2002, that I am persuaded on a balance of probabilities that the statements 
  made by Mrs. Chappell to the officers are in fact reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, the statements made will be admitted in 
  the voir dire as part of the evidence to be considered by the court.</p>
<p>
  THE REASONS FOR CONVICTION</p>
<p>[17] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge reviewed the evidence. He 
  set out verbatim Constable Hollett's testimony of his conversation with Ms. 
  Chappell. He held that &quot;[t]here is no evidence before the court that Mrs. 
  Chappell was intoxicated. There is evidence that she had been drinking.&quot; 
  The trial judge stated that he had the &quot;distinct impression&quot; from 
  what Ms. Chappell testified that she was very scared of the appellant. He then 
  held as follows:</p> 
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied that, in fact, on the day in question, 
  the injuries that she has received, and I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt 
  having regard to all the circumstances, were caused by the actions of Mr. Chappell 
  and that he fact caused the injuries to Mrs. Chappell.</p> 
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p> <p>
  The Sufficiency of Reasons</p>
<p>[18] In R. v. Sheppard (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.), Binnie J. discussed 
  the duty on trial judges to give reasons for convicting or acquitting the accused. 
  At paragraph 55, Binnie J. summarized his conclusions. His points 5, 6 and 8 
  are of importance in this case:</p> 
<p class="indent"> 5. Reasons perform an important function in the appellate 
  process. Where the functional needs are not satisfied, the appellate court may 
  conclude that it is a case of unreasonable verdict, an error of law, or a miscarriage 
  of justice within the scope of s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, depending 
  on the circumstances of the case and the nature and importance of the trial 
  decision being rendered.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Reasons acquire particular importance when a trial 
  judge is called upon to address troublesome principles of unsettled law, or 
  to resolve confused and contradictory evidence on a key issue, unless the basis 
  of the trial judge's conclusion is apparent from the record, even without being 
  articulated.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">8. The trial judge's duty is satisfied by reasons which 
  are sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is imposed, i.e., a decision 
  which, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, is reasonably 
  intelligible to the parties and provides the basis for meaningful appellate 
  review of the correctness of the trial judge's decision.</p>
<p>[19] The functional approach described by Binnie J. is, in my view, applicable 
  to the ruling in this case. The ruling on the admissibility of Ms. Chappell's 
  statements to the police, especially those to Constable Hollett, was a pivotal 
  one. In view of Ms. Chappell's testimony, her statements at the scene were the 
  only direct evidence consistent with the appellant's guilt. The appellant could 
  only understand why he was convicted if he understood why his wife's hearsay 
  statements had been admitted. Further, meaningful appellate review would be 
  difficult if the trial judge did not explain why the hearsay statements should 
  be admitted.</p> <p>
  [20] The trial judge's ruling in this case did not satisfy the functional requirements. 
  After reciting circumstances showing why the statement was not reliable, i.e. 
  &quot;that the statements are not signed, that they are only notes from the 
  officers, that there is an absence in this case of video or audio recording 
  and it is not a formal statement&quot; the trial judge simply concluded &quot;on 
  the totality of the events of the day in question&quot; that the statements 
  were reliable. He gave no explanation for how he could have made that finding 
  in the face of the earlier recited circumstances. The trial judge also failed 
  to resolve crucial factual issues upon which any finding of reliability depended, 
  for example: the degree of Ms. Chappell's intoxication; whether the first statement 
  was made spontaneously before Constable Hollett questioned Ms. Chappell or only 
  after vigorous questioning by the officer; and whether the police arrived shortly 
  after the injuries occurred or, as testified to by Ms. Chappell, some 45 to 
  60 minutes later. </p> <p>
  [21] It seems to me that point 6 quoted above from Sheppard reasons directly 
  applies in this case. For convenience I repeat it:</p> 
<p class="indent"> Reasons acquire particular importance when a trial 
  judge is called upon to address troublesome principles of unsettled law, or 
  to resolve confused and contradictory evidence on a key issue, unless the basis 
  of the trial judge's conclusion is apparent from the record, even without being 
  articulated.</p>
<p>[22] As I will discuss below, the full extent of the B. (K.G.) exception to 
  the hearsay rule is not yet determined. The statements sought to be admitted 
  in this case did not fall within the traditional strictures of that exception 
  as set out in that case. If the trial judge intended to embark on a further 
  expansion of the exception he was confronting &quot;troublesome principles of 
  unsettled law&quot; and was bound to provide reasons for doing so. Further, 
  while the trial evidence was perhaps not confused, it was contradictory on several 
  key issues. Finally, the unarticulated basis of the trial judge's conclusion 
  is certainly not apparent from the record. In the circumstances, I am of the 
  view that the trial judge erred in law in failing to provide adequate reasons.</p> <p>
  The B. (K.G.) Exception</p>
<p>[23] In R. v. B. (K.G.), Lamer C.J.C. explained when a prior inconsistent statement 
  of a Crown witness may be admissible for its truth as an exception to the hearsay 
  rule. In doing so, he applied a variant of the principled approach articulated 
  by the court in R. v. Khan (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Smith 
  (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.). He accepted that the court could admit 
  hearsay evidence if it met the requirements of necessity and reliability. In 
  the case of a prior inconsistent statement the necessity requirement could be 
  met because the witness has recanted his or her prior version of events and 
  thus that version is no longer available to the trier of fact.</p> 
<p> [24] As to reliability, Lamer C.J.C. held in R. v. B. (K.G.) at p. 288 that 
  because &quot;the focus of the inquiry in the case of prior inconsistent statements 
  is on the comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered 
  at trial &#133; additional indicia and guarantees of reliability to those outlined 
  in Khan and Smith must be secured in order to bring the prior statement to a 
  comparable standard of reliability before such statements are admitted as substantive 
  evidence.&quot; Those additional indicia and guarantees of reliability focus 
  on the hearsay dangers of the absence of an oath and presence. The absence of 
  contemporaneous cross-examination, i.e. cross-examination at the time the statement 
  was made is usually<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> adequately compensated for by the fact 
  that, by definition, the declarant is available at the trial for cross-examination.</p>
<p>
  [25] To compensate for the absence of oath, Lamer C.J.C. held that the &quot;best&quot; 
  indicia of reliability is that the statement was taken under oath, solemn affirmation, 
  or solemn declaration and following the administration of a warning of the witness's 
  amenability to prosecution if it were discovered that the witness has lied (p. 
  291). However, there may be situations in which the trial judge concludes that 
  an appropriate substitute for the oath is established and that notwithstanding 
  the absence of an oath the statement is reliable.</p> <p>
  [26] To address the hearsay danger arising from the fact that the trier of fact 
  cannot observe the witness when he or she made the prior inconsistent statement, 
  Lamer C.J.C. held at p. 293 that there should be a complete videotape record 
  of the statement. Again he held that it might be possible that the testimony 
  of an independent third party observing the making of the statement in its entirety 
  &quot;in exceptional circumstances&quot; could also provide the requisite reliability.</p> <p>
  [27] However, Lamer C.J.C. made it clear at p. 294 of R. v. B. (K.G.) that the 
  requirements were not to be applied mechanically and thus, &quot;other circumstantial 
  guarantees of reliability may suffice to render such statements substantively 
  admissible, provided that the judge is satisfied that the circumstances provide 
  adequate assurances of reliability in place of those which the hearsay rule 
  traditionally requires&quot;. An example of these alternative circumstances 
  is provided by R. v. U. (F.J.) (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) where the 
  complainant recanted from an allegation that her father, the accused, had sexually 
  assaulted her. The court held that although the complainant's statement was 
  not taken under circumstances that would have met the R. v. B. (K.G.) requirements 
  it was sufficiently reliable because of the striking similarity between the 
  statement and the accused's own statement to the police, provided that there 
  was neither reason nor opportunity for the declarants to collude and no improper 
  influence by interrogators or other third parties. While R. v. U. (F.J.) illustrates 
  the flexibility of the principled approach as applied to prior inconsistent 
  statements, it also shows the unusual circumstances that must exist before the 
  R. v. B. (K.G.) requirements can be wholly disregarded.</p> <p>
  [28] In this case, the only one of the R. v. B. (K.G.) requirements that was 
  met was the fact that the complainant was available for cross-examination. There 
  was nothing else, as the trial judge seemed to recognize, to bring the case 
  within R. v. B. (K.G.). The statements were not videotaped or even audiotaped. 
  It is not even clear that there was an accurate record of the entire statement-taking 
  process. The three officers involved conceded that they did not purport to take 
  down everything that the uncooperative declarant was saying. There was no warning 
  to the witness of the consequences of lying. There was no independent third 
  party to compensate for the fact that the trier of fact was not present when 
  the statement was made. </p> <p>
  [29] The question then is whether there are other exceptional circumstances 
  as in R. v. U. (F.J.) that would permit the trial court to admit the prior inconsistent 
  statements for their truth. In R. v. U. (F.J.) Lamer C.J.C. held that neither 
  that case nor R. v. B. (K.G.) should be read as foreclosing the possibility 
  that other indicia of reliability might suffice, where the declarant is available 
  for cross-examination. Thus, he said the following at para. 39:</p> 
<p class="indent"> [39] Cross-examination alone, therefore, goes a substantial 
  part of the way to ensuring that the reliability of a prior inconsistent statement 
  can be adequately assessed by the trier of fact. In B. (K.G.), I wrote that 
  prior inconsistent statements subject to cross-examination, made under oath 
  and videotaped would be substantively admissible because each of the hearsay 
  dangers would be addressed. I also, however, indicated that in certain particular 
  circumstances a prior inconsistent statement could be admitted even in the absence 
  of an oath and a video record, although not in the absence of cross-examination. 
  In my assessment, this is one of the cases where there are sufficient circumstantial 
  guarantees of reliability that the statement of the complainant ought to have 
  been admitted for the truth of its contents. [Emphasis added.]</p> 
<p>
  And at para. 45:</p> 
<p class="indent"> [45] I anticipate that instances of statements so strikingly 
  similar as to bolster their reliability will be rare. In keeping with our principled 
  and flexible approach to hearsay, other situations may arise where prior inconsistent 
  statements will be judged substantively admissible, bearing in mind that cross-examination 
  alone provides significant indications of reliability. It is not necessary in 
  this case to decide if cross-examination alone provides an adequate assurance 
  of threshold reliability to allow substantive admission of prior inconsistent 
  statements. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[30] In the absence of findings of fact by the trial judge, this court is in 
  no position to decide whether there are exceptional circumstances as in R. v. 
  U. (F.J.), that would allow the trial judge to make substantive use of any of 
  Ms. Chappell's statements to the police. I therefore offer the following comments 
  to assist the trial judge on the new trial, should the Crown choose to proceed 
  to retry the appellant. </p> <p>
  [31] It seems to me that, at best, only the initial statement to Constable Hollett 
  could possibly meet the threshold reliability requirement. Two factors that 
  the trial judge could take into account in favour of admitting that statement 
  for its truth are: (1) Ms. Chappell was available for cross-examination and 
  it appears that defence counsel was able to effectively cross-examine her; and 
  (2) although she disputes Constable Hollett's evidence about the circumstances 
  under which the first statement was made, she concedes that his recollection 
  of the content of that statement is correct. </p> <p>
  [32] Even so, it seems to me that the statement would only be available for 
  substantive use if certain critical findings of fact were made in favour of 
  the Crown. If contrary to the evidence of Constable Hollett, the statement was 
  not spontaneous or Ms. Chappell was intoxicated, the statement would not be 
  sufficiently reliable. The trial judge would also have to make a determination 
  of how proximate the statement was to the alleged assault and whether Ms. Chappell's 
  state of fear, as observed by Constable Hollett, was the result of the assault 
  or something else, such as the actions of the police in breaking down her front 
  door with an axe and arresting her husband at gunpoint. If the trial judge was 
  satisfied that the statement was made under emotional pressure from the assault 
  and without apparent motive to fabricate, the statement might be admissible 
  for substantive use, provided that Ms. Chappell was available for effective 
  cross-examination.</p> <p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>[33] While there was other circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact 
  might conclude that the appellant assaulted his wife, it cannot be said that 
  the trial judge's error in admitting Ms. Chappell's statements to the police 
  for their truth caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. As I 
  have said, the trial judge quoted verbatim from that part of Constable Hollett's 
  testimony where the officer recounted his conversation with Ms. Chappell. It 
  is apparent that the trial judge relied upon this evidence to find the appellant 
  guilty.</p> <p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[34] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order 
  a new trial for assault causing bodily harm.</p>

  most cases”:R. v. Conway (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 29.</p>
