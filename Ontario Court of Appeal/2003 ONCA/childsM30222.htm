<p>MCMURTRY, C.J.O.: </p>
<p>[1] This is a motion brought by Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada (&quot;MADD 
  Canada&quot;) for leave to intervene as a friend of the court in the appeal 
  brought by the Plaintiffs from the decision of Justice Chadwick rendered on 
  August 30th, 2002: Childs v. Desormeaux [2002] O.J. No. 3289, (2002) 217 DLR. 
  (4th) 217, (2002) 13 CCLT (3rd) 259, [2002] OTC 628.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants support the application while the respondents oppose the 
  intervention of MADD Canada. I am satisfied that MADD Canada should be permitted 
  to intervene as a friend of the court. </p>
<p>
  [3] As I stated in Authorson v. The Attorney General of Canada (2001) 147 OAC 
  355 at paragraph 8 and 9: </p>
<p class="indent"> Intervention of third parties into essentially private disputes 
  should be carefully considered as any intervention can add to the costs and 
  complexity of the litigation, regardless of an agreement to restrict submissions. 
</p>
<p class="indent">Many appeals will fall somewhere in between the constitutional 
  and strictly private litigation continuum, depending on the nature of the case 
  and the issues to be adjudicated. In my view, the burden on the moving party 
  should be a heavier one in cases that are closer to the &quot;private dispute&quot; 
  end of the spectrum. </p>
<p>While this litigation might, at first blush, appear to be one that is private 
  in nature, a review of the decision reveals that the issues to be decided as 
  described briefly below, engage a consideration of public policy.</p>
<p>
  [4] On December 31st, 1998, the defendant Desormeaux was an invited guest at 
  a New Year's Eve party hosted by his friends, the defendants Zimmerman and Courrier. 
  According to the factual findings of the trial judge, Desormeaux became intoxicated 
  during the evening to a level that was apparent to his hosts. As happens all 
  to often, Desormeaux left the party in his motor vehicle and, tragically, was 
  involved in a traffic accident with a vehicle in which the plaintiff, Zoe Childs, 
  was a passenger. As a result of this accident, 17-year-old Zoe Childs was grievously 
  and permanently injured. On the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, the 
  trial judge found, at paragraph 104 of his decision, that the defendants &quot;had 
  a duty not to turn Desmond Desormeaux loose on the highway where he could cause 
  injury or death to others.&quot; The defendants/respondents on appeal may well 
  challenge both the factual and legal underpinnings of this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [5] The plaintiffs argued that the case fell within those categories of cases 
  where a duty of care resulting in tort liability had been previously recognized. 
  Alternatively, the plaintiffs argued that if not within the scope of other recognized 
  duties of care, then a new duty of care ought to be established. </p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge held that the proposed duty of care did not fall within 
  an established category of cases in which a duty of care had been previously 
  recognized. Rather, the trial judge found that liability based on a finding 
  of a duty of care imposed on &quot;social hosts&quot; in favour of third parties 
  such as the plaintiff would be new and novel. </p>
<p>
  [7] As a result he was obliged to consider whether a new duty of care should 
  be imposed in accordance with the decision of the House of Lords in Anns v. 
  Merchant of London Bureau Council [1978] A.C. 728 as explained by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Cooper v. Hobart [2002] 206 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.). At 
  page 203 of the Cooper decision, McLauchlin, C.J.C. and Major, J. on behalf 
  of the court stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;The proximity analysis involved at the first stage of the Anns test focuses 
  on factors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 
  These factors include questions of policy, in the broad sense of that word. 
  If forseeability and proximity are established at the first stage, a prima facie 
  duty of care arises. At the second stage of the Anns test, the question still 
  remains whether there are residual policy considerations outside the relationship 
  of the parties that may negative the imposition of a duty of care. It may be, 
  as the Privy Counsel suggests in R. v. Yuen Kun Yeu, that such considerations 
  will not often prevail. However we think it useful expressly to ask, before 
  imposing a new duty of care, whether despite forseeability and proximity of 
  a relationship there are other policy reasons why the duty should not be imposed.&quot;</p>
<p>[8] Ultimately, however, while the trial judge held that the plaintiffs had 
  satisfied the first branch of the Anns test, he found &quot;there is good policy 
  reason not to expand tort law to include the social host. In my view it should 
  be left to the legislature to determine a social host liability and also to 
  properly compensate the innocent victims. As such the action is dismissed.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] Included in the evidentiary record was the evidence of Andrew Murie, the 
  National Executive director of MADD Canada given in support of the analysis 
  of the policy issues to be considered at the second stage of the Anns test. 
  That this evidence was admitted and considered by the trial judge reflects the 
  reality that the issues in this case involve broad policy considerations. </p>
<p>
  [10] As a result, while this is a dispute between individuals and in that regard 
  private nature, the issue of whether, on the facts, a duty of care arose and 
  if so whether such duty is or should be recognized in tort law, is one that 
  differentiates this case from one that is solely of interest to the affected 
  parties. Whether to recognize that social hosts owe an actionable duty of care 
  to members of the public is an issue that transcends the dispute between the 
  immediate parties to this litigation.</p>
<p>
  [11] MADD Canada is well known as a leading advocate in the struggle to end 
  the carnage arising from drunk driving. One of its public policy activities 
  relates to alcohol related civil liability. MADD Canada proposes to make submissions 
  as to the issue of whether liability of social hosts in a case such as this 
  falls within an existing head of liability or whether such liability is new 
  and novel. If a new head of liability, MADD Canada also proposes to make submissions 
  as to the relevant policy considerations that should inform the decision of 
  whether to recognize such a new tort. </p>
<p>
  [12] It is not disputed that the position of MADD Canada is generally aligned 
  with the position of the plaintiffs. It has an obvious and well known viewpoint 
  from which it approaches the issue of civil liability arising out of alcohol 
  related activities. Indeed, it is its very interest in the subject matter that 
  has caused it to acquire experience and expertise in the area.</p>
<p>
  [13] Today most intervenors who intervene as a friend of the court articulate 
  a position that may generally be aligned with one or another side of the argument. 
  The submission of the respondents that a &quot;friend of the court&quot; must 
  be neutral, abstract and objective refers to a restricted notion of the amicus 
  curiae that has long been rejected. In the United States, the author Samuel 
  Krislov, in &quot;The Amicus Brief: From Friendship to Advocacy&quot; Yale Law 
  Journal 1963 Vol. 72 at page 704, stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;The Supreme Court of the United States makes no pretense of such disinterestedness 
  on the part of &quot;its friends&quot;. The amicus is treated as a potential 
  litigant in future cases, as an ally of one of the parties, or as the representative 
  of an interest not otherwise represented&#133;thus the institution of the amicus 
  curiae brief has moved from neutrality to partisanship, from friendship to advocacy.&quot;</p>
<p>[14] While the law of Ontario has not, perhaps, expanded the role of the friend 
  of the court this far, David Scriven and Paul Muldoon, wrote as long ago as 
  1985, in their article &quot;Intervention as a Friend of the Court: Rule 13 
  of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure&quot; Advocates Quaterly, Vol. 16, 1985-1986 
  at page 456-457: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;While the old case law implicitly assumes that a friend of the court cannot 
  provide &quot;assistance&quot; when it intends to advocate its point of view, 
  the language of Rule 13.02 appears to deny this traditional argument. The rule 
  states that any person may intervene as a friend of the court &quot; for the 
  purpose of rendering assistance to the court by way of argument. The term &quot;argument&quot; 
  literally means to &quot;persuade by giving reasons&quot; and thus directly 
  imports the notion of advocacy in such applications.&quot;</p>
<p>[15] Since the publication of this article the law of this province has developed 
  to recognize the valid and important contribution that can be made in appropriate 
  cases by friends of the court who may be advocates for a particular interpretation 
  of the law. As Dubin, C.JO. succinctly stated in Peel (Regional Municipality) 
  v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Company of Canada Limited (1990), 74 O.R. 2nd 
  164 at page 167: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;Although much has been written as to the proper matters to be considered 
  in determining whether an application for intervention should be granted, in 
  the end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are the nature of the case, 
  the issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being able to make 
  a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing injustice 
  to the immediate parties&quot;</p>
<p>[16] As articulated by Dubin, C.J.O., this is the test for intervention by 
  public interest groups. I am satisfied that although the position of MADD Canada 
  is generally aligned with the position of the plaintiffs, it can &quot;make 
  a useful contribution&quot; to the argument of the issues before the court. 
  Further, I am satisfied that intervention by MADD Canada will not cause injustice 
  to the respondents. As stated by Morden, J.A. in Louie v. Lastman (2001), 152 
  O.A.C. 341 at page 343: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;It is true that the intervention will expand the number of submissions 
  to which the responding party will be obliged to reply but this, which is for 
  the potential benefit of the court, is not an injustice. Further, having regard 
  to the conditions I attach to the intervention order, the responding party may 
  be compensated for any increased costs resulting from the intervention but will 
  not be liable for costs in connection with it.&quot;</p>
<p>[17] While the Executive Director MADD Canada testified at trial, his testimony 
  was restricted to the policy issues in support of recognizing a new tort, and 
  not in relation to the underlying facts of the case. MADD Canada did not otherwise 
  participate in the trial. Counsel for MADD Canada has stated that it will neither 
  challenge the factual findings of the judge nor take any position as to the 
  merits of the case as between the parties. Its participation will be limited, 
  essentially, to whether tortious liability of social hosts does or should exist 
  in Canadian law. In this context, I am satisfied that the fact that the Executive 
  Director of MADD Canada was called to testify at trial is not a bar to its participation 
  as a friend of the court on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [18] Accordingly I grant leave to MADD Canada to intervene as a friend of the 
  court on the following conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) that it take the record as is and will not be permitted 
  to adduce further material; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) that it will not seek costs on the appeal, but that costs 
  may be awarded against it; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) that it deliver its factum, not to exceed 20 pages in length, 
  on or before October 10th, 2003; </p>
<p class="indent">(d) that the respondents may deliver a supplementary factum, 
  if necessary, to respond to matters raised by the intervenor no later than October 
  20th, 2003; </p>
<p class="indent">(e) that the time allocated for its oral submissions be fixed 
  at 20 minutes. </p>
<p>
  There will be no costs of this motion.</p>

<p> &quot;R. Roy McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;</p>
