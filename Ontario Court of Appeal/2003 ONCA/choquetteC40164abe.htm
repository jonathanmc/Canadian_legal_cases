<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Minutes of settlement were signed pursuant to which the Bressis were entitled 
  to remain in possession on certain terms. The minutes provided how the funds 
  are to be disbursed. The last item is that any remaining funds are to be paid 
  to the mortgagor company or as it, and Joseph Bressi, direct.</p>
<p>[2] It is implicit from the minutes of settlement that the sale is to be bona 
  fide and for fair market value.</p>
<p>[3] The endorsement of the motions judge specifies that an order is to issue 
  in terms of the minutes of settlement. The order issued in the name of the motions 
  judge does not comply with the minutes of settlement and he refused to amend 
  his order. The minutes of settlement are clear. The appeal is allowed.</p>
<p>[4] The orders of June 5 and August 26, 2003 are set aside and an order is 
  to go in terms of the minutes of settlement.</p>
<p>[5] Costs at $5,000 for all motions and the appeal.</p>
