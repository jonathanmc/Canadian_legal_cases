<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice Eugene Ewaschuk of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, and a jury, on February 18, 1999.</p>

<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from his convictions for kidnapping, extortion, assault 
  and uttering a death threat. He raises a number of grounds of appeal. Before 
  addressing those grounds, we begin with a brief overview of the case for the 
  Crown and the case for the defence. </p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW OF THE CROWN'S CASE</p>
<p>[2] The charges against the appellant arose out of an incident in which the 
  appellant, his nephew Angelo Zaferis and a third party, Hassan Farhat, allegedly 
  kidnapped the victim, Mazin Jaber, in the belief that Jaber could lead them 
  to Farhat's uncle, Yassin El-Harake. The appellant wanted to find El-Harake 
  because he was owed money by Farhat and he believed that El-Harake would pay 
  his nephew's debt.</p>
<p>
  [3] In the belief that Jaber knew where El-Harake could be found, the appellant 
  and his cohorts kidnapped Jaber and forced him into the appellant's car. They 
  then drove around looking for Mr. El-Harake but with no success. </p>
<p>
  [4] While forcibly confined in the car, Jaber was assaulted and threatened. 
  At one point, he was placed in the trunk of the car. This event formed the subject 
  of a 911 call to the police by an unknown stranger.</p>
<p>
  [5] After driving around for some time with Jaber in the trunk of the car, the 
  car stopped and Jaber was removed from the trunk and returned to the back seat. 
  By now, the car was heading westbound on Highway 401 towards Hamilton. The appellant 
  was driving. </p>
<p>
  [6] By chance, an O.P.P. officer decided to stop the appellant's vehicle and 
  she directed the appellant to pull over to the side of the road. The appellant 
  complied and Jaber took the opportunity to make good his escape. As Jaber stood 
  with the officer at the rear of the car, the appellant got out and told Jaber 
  to return to his seat in the car. The officer told the appellant to get back 
  into the car and he complied. He then drove away and was arrested the next day, 
  along with Farhat and Zaferis.</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW OF THE DEFENCE'S CASE</p>

<p> [7] The appellant did not testify. His defence essentially amounted to a submission 
  that the Crown had failed to prove the essential elements of the various offences 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of that submission, he relied primarily 
  on the fact that the two main Crown witnesses - Farhat and Jaber - were utterly 
  incredible and unreliable and that their evidence should be given little or 
  no weight by the jury.</p>
<p>
  GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>Ground 1: The 911 call</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of 
  a 911 call for the truth of its contents under the principled exception to the 
  hearsay rule. In particular, he argues that the trial judge improperly considered 
  corroborating evidence in arriving at his conclusion that the call was sufficiently 
  reliable to warrant its reception as original evidence.</p>
<p>
  [9] We disagree. It is apparent from the trial judge's reasons that in performing 
  the threshold reliability assessment, he looked only to the circumstances surrounding 
  the call. Moreover, although we need not finally decide the matter, we are inclined 
  to agree with the Crown that in light of the striking similarities between the 
  event described by the caller and the events which occurred shortly thereafter, 
  this was one of those rare instances, identified in R. v. U. (F.)(J.) (1995), 
  101 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), in which it would have been permissible for the 
  trial judge to consider the surrounding evidence as a means of testing the reliability 
  of the 911 call.</p>
<p>
  [10] In sum, we are satisfied that the 911 call was properly admissible as original 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant further contends that the trial judge erred in preventing 
  his co-accused Zaferis from cross-examining the 911operator as to the possibility 
  that the call in question was a crank call.</p>
<p>
  [12] We would not give effect to that submission. A general statement by the 
  911 operator that crank calls occur would not have assisted the jury beyond 
  informing them of that which they already would have known.</p>
<p>
  [13] Finally, the appellant submits that in his charge, the trial judge usurped 
  the function of the jury by telling the jury that the 911 call was reliable 
  evidence and that it proved what it was tendered to prove. </p>
<p> [14] Again, we disagree. The trial judge left it to the jury to decide the 
  worth of the 911 call. He specifically instructed the jury to consider the following 
  factors in assessing its value: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The evidence was not under oath.</li>
  <li>The jury was unable to observe the caller's demeanour during the call.</li>
  <li>The caller was not available for cross-examination.</li>
  <li>The caller was mistaken as to the number of men involved and the description 
    of the car's licence plate, which he referred to as AJBR 765 as opposed to 
    ABJR 755.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the trial judge reminded the jury of the appellant's position 
  that the 911 call was unreliable evidence and that it should be given no weight. 
  In our view, nothing more was required.</p>
<p>
  [15] To the extent, if any, that the trial judge may have left the jury with 
  the impression that he considered the 911 call to be reliable evidence, we note 
  that earlier in his charge, he forcefully instructed the jury that it was their 
  view of the evidence that counted, not his, and that they were duty bound &quot;to 
  make [their] own decision on the evidence adduced at this trial.&quot; He further 
  instructed the jury that in the event he expressed an opinion about the evidence, 
  either consciously or subconsciously, they were not bound to follow his opinion. 
  Rather, they were to come to their own conclusion in accordance with their role 
  as the sole triers of fact. Accordingly, if the trial judge did express an opinion, 
  there is no reason to think that the jury would have been improperly influenced 
  by it.</p>
<p>
  Ground 2: The trial judge's reference to matters conceded or not in dispute</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant contends that references in the jury charge to matters being 
  either conceded or not in dispute occasioned prejudice to him. In particular, 
  he submits that it was wrong for the trial judge to suggest that any facts were 
  either &quot;conceded&quot; or &quot;not disputed&quot; in view of his overall 
  position that the two main Crown witnesses were incredible and unreliable and 
  that their evidence should be given no weight.</p>
<p>
  [17] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The trial judge did, 
  on occasion, refer to undisputed or conceded facts. In some instances, this 
  occurred in his review of the Crown's position. He was merely reminding the 
  jury of submissions made by Crown counsel in his closing address. That was entirely 
  proper.</p>
<p>
  [18] In other instances, the trial judge on his own directed the jury to facts 
  which he viewed as &quot;undisputed&quot; or &quot;conceded&quot;. In doing 
  so, he was attempting to guide the jury as to the manner in which they should 
  approach their deliberations.</p>
<p>
  [19] To the extent that the trial judge may have gone too far, for example, 
  in stating that it appeared &quot;to be conceded that [the victim] had been 
  kidnapped&quot; and that he was not a willing passenger in the appellant's car, 
  we note that in response to an objection from the defence, the trial judge recharged 
  the jury and corrected any misunderstanding that may have resulted from his 
  original remarks. As well, we note that throughout his charge, the trial judge 
  made it known that the defence was conceding nothing and that the Crown bore 
  the onus of proving each and every essential element of the various offences 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. We note as well that the trial judge fully and fairly 
  reviewed the position of the appellant in accordance with his counsel's closing 
  argument. In our view, given the strength of the Crown's case and the failure 
  of the appellant to testify, the trial judge did an admirable job in this regard.</p>
<p>
  [20] Apart from these considerations, we are satisfied that the impugned instructions 
  occasioned no prejudice to the appellant because on this record, the facts to 
  which the trial judge referred as &quot;undisputed&quot; or &quot;conceded&quot; 
  were proved to a virtual certainty. It follows that even if the trial judge 
  should have avoided using words such as &quot;undisputed&quot; and &quot;conceded&quot;, 
  the appellant suffered no harm. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.</p>
<p>
  Ground 3: The charge on the issue of identity</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant submits that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof 
  and led the jury to believe that it was up to the appellant to establish that 
  he was not in his car on the night in question.</p>
<p>
  [22] In our view, there is no merit in this submission. The trial judge made 
  it abundantly clear throughout his charge that identity was an essential element 
  of the various charges and the onus rested with the Crown to prove it, along 
  with the other essential elements, beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  Ground 4: Prior consistent statements</p>
<p>
  [23] Hassan Farhat was initially a co-accused of the appellant and Zaferis. 
  On March 15, 1998, a month or so after his arrest, Farhat provided the police 
  with a statement in which he implicated the appellant and Zaferis in the crimes. 
  Later, at a bail review, Farhat testified and essentially confirmed what he 
  had told the police in his March 15 statement. In light of this, the Crown severed 
  Farhat from the appellant and Zaferis with a view to having him testify as a 
  Crown witness against his former co-accused.</p>
<p>
  [24] At the appellant's trial, Farhat commenced his testimony by stating that 
  he was with his wife on the night of the kidnapping and that he had no involvement 
  in it. Following several voir dires, the trial judge found Farhat to be a hostile 
  witness and he also permitted the Crown to file Farhat's March 15 statement 
  as original evidence. In addition, he allowed the Crown to lead Farhat's evidence 
  at the bail review, not as original evidence but as a prior inconsistent statement.</p>
<p>
  [25] The next day, after retaining new counsel, Farhat returned to court and 
  testified that he had lied in the witness box to protect himself and his family. 
  He stated that the appellant and Zaferis had threatened him and that Zaferis 
  had broken his ribs when he and Zaferis were in jail together awaiting trial. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] In light of this change in circumstances, the trial judge ruled that the 
  Crown could no longer treat Farhat as a hostile witness. The trial judge also 
  removed the March 15 statement from the list of exhibits that would be made 
  available to the jury. Farhat then continued his evidence and testified in a 
  manner that generally accorded with his earlier statements implicating the appellant 
  and Zaferis in the crimes. </p>
<p>
  [27] In his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury that they could not 
  use Farhat's March 15 statement or his evidence on the bail review as original 
  evidence. The jury could, however, use the prior consistent statements &quot;as 
  possibly enhancing [Farhat's] credibility by reason of his consistent testimony 
  before you that the [appellant] threatened him with a view to dissuading [the 
  victim] from testifying at trial and that the [appellant] and [Zaferis] both 
  assaulted and threatened him again with a view to dissuading the [victim] from 
  testifying at trial&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant takes issue with that instruction. He submits that the trial 
  judge erred in instructing the jury that Farhat's prior consistent statements 
  could be used to enhance his credibility because there was no basis in law for 
  such an instruction and it effectively invited the jury to engage in impermissible 
  oath-helping.</p>
<p>
  [29] We would not give effect to that submission. With respect, it fails to 
  recognize the narrow purpose for which the trial judge told the jury they could 
  use the earlier consistent statements. Specifically, it failed to take into 
  account the fact that the trial judge limited the use of those statements to 
  &quot;possibly enhancing&quot; Farhat's explanation for having denied any involvement 
  in the kidnapping on day one of his evidence.</p>
<p>
  [30] Viewed that way, the impugned instruction takes on a different character. 
  As the Crown submits, the consistency in content between the previous statements 
  and Farhat's testimony after day one constituted circumstantial evidence that 
  increased the plausibility of Farhat's assertion that his testimony on day one 
  was the product of a threat made against him by the appellant. Accordingly, 
  we think that in the unique circumstances of this case, it was open for the 
  trial judge to charge the jury as he did.</p>
<p>
  [31] Even if we are wrong in this, given the narrow purpose for which the jury 
  was told they could use the prior consistent statements, we have no doubt that 
  the verdict would have been the same had the jury been told that they could 
  make no use of the prior consistent statements. As indicated earlier, the case 
  against the appellant was extremely strong and it is fanciful to think that 
  the verdict would have been different had the jury been told to ignore the prior 
  consistent statements. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.</p>
<p>
  Ground 5: After-the-fact conduct</p>
<p>
  [32] This ground of appeal was abandoned in oral argument. We simply mention 
  it because it appears as a ground of appeal in the appellant's factum.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [33] In our view, the appellant received a fair trial. The trial judge did not 
  diminish his defence in the eyes of the jury. Instead, he thoroughly reviewed 
  the position of the appellant and the defences upon which he relied.</p>
<p>
  [34] We are not persuaded that the trial judge made any errors in his charge; 
  but if he did, they were minor and could not possibly have affected the outcome. 
  The Crown's case against the appellant was virtually insurmountable. We see 
  no basis for interfering with the verdicts. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
