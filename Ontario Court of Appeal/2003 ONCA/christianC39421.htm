<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Robert A. Blair of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 4, 2002. </p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.:</p>
<p>
  A. Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this appeal is whether the motions judge committed a reviewable 
  error in exercising his discretion to deny a law firm a premium on its account 
  to its client. </p>
<p>
  [2] The law firm of WeirFoulds LLP acted as counsel for the court-appointed 
  liquidator (the &quot;Liquidator&quot;) of the estate of the Christian Brothers 
  of Ireland in Canada (the &quot;CBIC&quot;). For over five years the law firm 
  and its lead counsel, David Wingfield, pursued litigation to determine whether 
  the estate would have assets to compensate its creditors, principally victims 
  of childhood abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland. </p>
<p>
  [3] The litigation was complex, difficult and time consuming, its outcome uncertain. 
  By the beginning of 2001 the estate was insolvent and could not pay its lawyers. 
  Nonetheless, without any assurance that its fees would be paid, WeirFoulds agreed 
  to continue the litigation. Its efforts succeeded. The assets of the estate 
  were increased by $19 million. The law firm then sought a premium on its fees 
  for the twenty months when it acted without any guarantee of payment. The premium 
  sought was measured by increasing Mr. Wingfield's hourly rate from $400 to $675 
  per hour. This premium amounted to less than 3 percent of the assets recovered. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The Liquidator agreed to the premium. The court-appointed representative 
  of the victims did not oppose it. However, Blair R.S.J. refused to approve the 
  premium. He recognized that the &quot;tenacity&quot; of the Liquidator and all 
  counsel had saved the estate from insolvency and justified the significant professional 
  fees and disbursements claimed. But he said that he could not &quot;approve 
  a $675 hourly rate for a 1988 call....keeping in mind that the liquidated estate 
  is being used to compensate victims of egregious acts&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Liquidator appeals with leave from Goudge J.A. It submits that the motions 
  judge exercised his discretion unreasonably by failing to consider the risk 
  assumed by WeirFoulds, the Liquidator's own views and the acquiescence of representative 
  counsel for the victims. I agree with this submission. And because I consider 
  the premium to be reasonable I would allow it in full. </p>
<p>
  B. Background Facts</p>
<p>
  a) The winding-up of CBIC</p>
<p>
  [6] The CBIC was the Canadian branch of the worldwide teaching order of the 
  Roman Catholic Church. Since its incorporation in 1962, it had owned and operated 
  schools and orphanages throughout Canada.</p>
<p>
  [7] In 1996 the CBIC applied to be wound up under the Winding-up and Restructuring 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. W-11, as amended. It did so to facilitate payment of its 
  liabilities, especially to victims of child abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage. 
  When it applied to be wound up the CBIC claimed it had assets of $4.3 million. 
  On October 26, 1996, CBIC was ordered to be wound up. Arthur Andersen Inc. was 
  appointed Liquidator of the estate, and the Ontario General Division (now the 
  Superior Court of Justice) was named the supervising court. Under the winding-up 
  order, the Liquidator was required to obtain court approval of its expenses, 
  including the fees and disbursements of its legal counsel. </p>
<p>
  b) The litigation to determine the assets of CBIC</p>
<p>
  [8] The Liquidator determined that the CBIC's assets included the assets of 
  two private schools in British Columbia, Vancouver College and St. Thomas More 
  Collegiate. It retained WeirFoulds to pursue those assets. In 1998, the winding-up 
  court concluded that unless the assets of these two schools were included in 
  the winding-up of the CBIC, the victims would &quot;for practical purposes...be 
  without recourse&quot;. If, however, these assets were included, the victims' 
  claims could largely be satisfied. </p>
<p>
  [9] Litigation over the schools culminated in a three-month trial in early 2000 
  in the British Columbia Supreme Court. The trial judge decided that the CBIC 
  owned the schools, but that its ownership was subject to a special purpose trust 
  for local Roman Catholic education.</p>
<p>
  [10] Both the Liquidator and the schools appealed. By then, however, the estate 
  had run out of money to finance the litigation. The Liquidator and WeirFoulds 
  agreed on terms to keep the litigation alive. WeirFoulds would continue to conduct 
  the litigation at its own expense, except for a single $30,000 payment by the 
  Liquidator on account of disbursements. If the litigation was unsuccessful WeirFoulds 
  would be paid neither its fees nor the disbursements it incurred. If the litigation 
  was successful it would be reimbursed for disbursements and its fees would be 
  determined. In short, from February 1, 2001 onward WeirFoulds assumed virtually 
  the entire risk of the litigation. </p>
<p>
  [11] Over the next twenty months WeirFoulds, and especially Mr. Wingfield, devoted 
  substantial time to the litigation. In essence, this litigation took place on 
  three fronts. First, WeirFoulds dealt with the schools' appeal and the Liquidator's 
  own cross-appeal in the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The two schools fought 
  vigorously to keep their assets out of the estate, and did so with apparently 
  unlimited resources. The schools and the parties supporting them retained five 
  separate law firms, among them fourteen counsel, including five of the senior 
  counsel in the province. Ultimately the estate succeeded in the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal by a two to one majority. The dissent would have deprived the 
  estate of any recovery. See Rowland v. Vancouver College Ltd. (2001), 94 B.C.L.R. 
  (3d) 249.</p>
<p>
  [12] In the second piece of litigation WeirFoulds responded to applications 
  by the schools in the Supreme Court of Canada for a re-hearing of that court's 
  judgment denying leave to appeal from a decision of this court. Again, WeirFoulds 
  was successful for the estate. </p>
<p>
  [13] The final piece of litigation also took place in British Columbia. The 
  Attorney General of British Columbia petitioned the court to prevent the Liquidator 
  from realizing on the assets of the schools. After WeirFoulds succeeded in having 
  the petition dismissed, the Attorney General brought yet another application 
  to require the Liquidator to transfer ownership of the two schools to a solvent 
  British Columbia entity, which would not be exposed to the liabilities of the 
  CBIC. During the hearing of this application in July 2002 the parties settled. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] On the settlement the Liquidator agreed to sell the two schools to the 
  local Roman Catholic community for $30 million less the costs the Liquidator 
  would have incurred if it had liquidated the schools' assets. The estate realized 
  net proceeds of $19 million. Thus, the litigation resulted in an increase in 
  the assets of the estate from just over $4 million to over $20 million. </p>
<p>
  c) WeirFoulds' accounts</p>
<p>
  [15] The overall fees sought by WeirFoulds and a British Columbia law firm that 
  also acted for the Liquidator totalled about $4.3 million. Of this total WeirFoulds' 
  fees accounted for $3,243,180, or about 17 percent of the assets recovered. 
  During the time the estate was solvent WeirFoulds submitted bills at its lawyers' 
  normal hourly rates. The court approved these bills, amounting to just under 
  $2 million in fees. </p>
<p>
  [16] The bill in question on the appeal is WeirFoulds' account for the period 
  from February 1, 2001 to October 15, 2002, the period for which it was at risk 
  of not being paid. For this period it submitted a bill for fees of $1,344,487.50, 
  reflecting 2150 hours of time, of which Mr. Wingfield contributed 1800 hours. 
  The bill consisted of a base fee of $848,992.50 and a premium of $495,495, calculated 
  by an increase in Mr. Wingfield's hourly rate from its normal $400 per hour 
  to $675 per hour (which was the top hourly rate charged by any other lawyer 
  on the case). The premium amounted to 2.6 percent of the assets recovered. The 
  motions judge approved the base fee, but not the premium. </p>
<p>
  C. Analysis</p>
<p>
  [17] Many factors may bear on whether lawyers are entitled to a premium over 
  their hourly rates. These factors include the difficulty and complexity of the 
  case, the responsibility assumed by the lawyer, the amount in issue, the importance 
  of the case to the client, the skill shown by the lawyer, the result achieved, 
  the client's ability to pay and the lawyer's corresponding financial risk. See 
  for example Ontario (Minister of Transportation) v. Tripp et al. (1999), 123 
  O.A.C. 278 (C.A.). In an insolvency, the interest and position of the creditors 
  and the views of the receiver or liquidator must also be considered. The judge 
  or officer assessing or approving a lawyer's account must, in exercising discretion, 
  take into account and weigh these factors in deciding whether to award a premium. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] In this case the motions judge properly took into account several of these 
  relevant factors. He took into account the importance of the case and the result 
  achieved. He held: &quot;[T]he reality is that without the tenacity of the Liquidator 
  and its counsel and that of Representative Counsel, in pursuing the B.C. schools 
  litigation and succeeding, the estate would be bankrupt and there would be nothing 
  to satisfy the claims of the victims.&quot; He expressly considered Mr. Wingfield's 
  obvious skill and, impliedly, the complexity of the proceedings, when he said 
  that his refusal to approve a premium was &quot;not in the least a reflection 
  on Mr. Wingfield's skill or indeed his considerable contribution to the successful 
  results in this case.&quot; Also, the motions judge took into account the interests 
  of the creditors, observing that &quot;the liquidated estate is being used to 
  compensate victims of egregious acts&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [19] A costs order is discretionary, and therefore is entitled to deference 
  on appeal. An appellate court may intervene when the judge ordering costs fails 
  to consider relevant factors and so exercises his or her discretion unreasonably. 
  That is what has occurred here. The motions judge failed to take into account 
  three relevant factors: the financial risk assumed by WeirFoulds, the view of 
  the Liquidator and the position of representative counsel for the victims. </p>
<p>
  [20] Of these three factors, by far the most important is the financial risk 
  assumed by WeirFoulds. Not only did the law firm carry on with the case from 
  early 2001 with no assurance of receiving any of its fees or any of the disbursements 
  it incurred, but it did so when it was far from certain that the Liquidator 
  would recover any assets to compensate the creditors of the estate. </p>
<p>
  [21] Awarding a reasonable premium to a law firm that assumes such a risk gives 
  lawyers an economic incentive to take on this kind of litigation and do it well. 
  Thus, awarding a premium enhances access to justice in this case and promotes 
  access to justice for future cases. </p>
<p>
  [22] Undoubtedly, any premium paid to the law firm will diminish the funds available 
  to satisfy the claims of the victims. The motions judge correctly took into 
  account the interests of these men who as boys &quot;suffered unspeakable acts 
  of sexual, physical and emotional abuse&quot; at the hands of the Christian 
  Brothers. But as important as their interests are, they must be balanced against 
  the risk that the law firm undertook and the result it achieved for its client 
  and, therefore, for the victims. The reality is that but for WeirFoulds having 
  assumed this risk, the estate would have had no money at all to compensate the 
  victims. </p>
<p>
  [23] The motions judge did not turn his mind to the financial risk assumed by 
  WeirFoulds. Instead he dismissed the requested premium by stating that Mr. Wingfield 
  was &quot;called to the Bar in 1988 and I do not think I can approve a $675 
  hourly rate for a 1988 call.&quot; I disagree with the motion judge's reason 
  for refusing to award a premium. Here, Mr. Wingfield had carriage of the case 
  against much more senior counsel and he should be entitled to a senior counsel 
  rate for the risk he took on behalf of his firm and the result he achieved. 
  Moreover, the year of call to the Bar should be irrelevant to whether a premium 
  is approved. The court should not take away the financial incentive for younger 
  members of the Bar to take on these cases. </p>
<p>
  [24] The financial risk assumed by WeirFoulds alone supports a premium. But 
  other considerations support it as well. </p>
<p>
  [25] The motions judge also failed to take account of the Liquidator's view. 
  The Liquidator made a considered business decision to approve the premium sought 
  by WeirFoulds. Its decision is entitled to the same deference as are the business 
  decisions of court-appointed receivers. Thus, the principle affirmed by this 
  court in Royal Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp. (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1 at 5-6 
  applies: the court should place confidence in the Liquidator's decision and 
  assume it has acted properly unless the contrary is shown. The court should 
  recognize that by appointing a liquidator, it &quot;intends to rely upon the 
  [liquidator's] expertise and not upon its own.&quot; Unless a liquidator can 
  make these kinds of arrangements with its counsel, meritorious litigation may 
  never go forward. Although the court should not rubber-stamp a liquidator's 
  decision, it should nonetheless be reluctant to second-guess it. Here, the motions 
  judge did not consider the Liquidator's decision at all. </p>
<p>
  [26] Finally, the motions judge failed to take account of the position of representative 
  counsel for the victims. Mr. Garbig, counsel for the victims, had reason to 
  oppose a premium. The more money paid to the lawyers, the less money available 
  for the victims. Yet he fairly recognized that a premium was justified and he 
  did not oppose one being given. </p>
<p>
  [27] Because of the motions judge's failure to consider the financial risk assumed 
  by WeirFoulds, the view of the Liquidator and the position of the victims' counsel, 
  I have concluded that the motions judge unreasonably exercised his discretion 
  in denying WeirFoulds a premium. The law firm was entitled to one for Mr. Wingfield's 
  efforts.</p>
<p>
  [28] The remaining question is whether the premium asked for - $495,495, reflecting 
  an increase of $275 over Mr. Wingfield's normal hourly rate of $400 per hour 
  - is reasonable. In this court, Mr. Garbig suggested that half this amount - 
  approximately $250,000 - would be fair. In my opinion, however, the premium 
  requested is eminently reasonable. To summarize what I have said earlier: Mr. 
  Wingfield conducted this litigation with consummate skill; his law firm assumed 
  the entire risk for the litigation after the British Columbia trial court's 
  decision, a decision that would not have benefited the victims; many of the 
  legal issues were novel, complex and difficult; success on appeal was far from 
  guaranteed, as perhaps best evidenced by the split decision in the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal; and Mr. Wingfield achieved an exceptional result for the Liquidator 
  and, indirectly, for the abuse victims.</p>
<p>
  [29] Whether viewed as a percentage of the total recovery (2.6 percent) or as 
  a percentage increase on the firm's base fee (58 percent), the premium is, if 
  anything, modest. In class action litigation this court and experienced Superior 
  Court judges have approved proportionately larger premiums. See for example 
  Gagne v. Silcorp Ltd. (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) and Parsons v. Canadian 
  Red Cross Society (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 281 (S.C.J.), aff'd on other grounds 
  (2001), 140 O.A.C. 348, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 
  190. And in substance, if not in form, the litigation maintained by the Liquidator 
  amounted to a class action because its fruits go to the members of the class 
  of abuse victims. The work of WeirFoulds might well have merited a larger premium. 
  That I need not decide. I can say, however, that I would unhesitatingly approve 
  the premium it asked for. </p>
<p>
  [30] I close these reasons with a brief comment about Mr. Garbig. He represented 
  his clients - the abuse victims - ably throughout these proceedings. He did 
  not seek and was not paid a premium for his work. In recognizing that WeirFoulds 
  was entitled to a premium, though it would come out of the pool of money available 
  to the victims, he acted fairly, honourably and in the best traditions of the 
  Bar. I commend him for his work and for the positions he took.</p>
<p>
  [31] I would allow the appeal, set aside the costs order of the motions judge 
  dated December 4, 2002, and in its place I would approve the payment in full 
  of WeirFoulds' account dated November 5, 2002. I make no costs order as counsel 
  advised the court that it was unnecessary to do so. </p>
