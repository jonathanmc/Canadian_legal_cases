<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: March 26, 2003</p>
<P>
  [1] We are of the view that the motions judge erred in concluding that the terms 
  in the collective agreement dealing with the provision of long-term disability 
  benefits were within Brown &amp; Beatty's third category. The language of the 
  collective agreement itself and of the Letter of Understanding between the Union 
  and the TTC make it clear that the benefits plan is to be incorporated into 
  the collective agreement. </p>    <P>
  [2] Nothing in the ASO agreement contradicts this clear intention. The collective 
  agreement required the TTC to pay the benefits to their employees, to fund the 
  plan, to comply with the terms of the plan as incorporated into the collective 
  agreement and to submit differences over entitlement to benefits to the arbitration 
  process. </p>    <P>
  [3] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of Loukidelis J. is set aside, 
  and the action against the TTC is dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [4] The TTC is entitled to its costs on the appeal fixed on a partial indemnity 
  basis in the amount of $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. We agree with 
  the submissions of the TTC that there should be no costs of the motion.</p>
