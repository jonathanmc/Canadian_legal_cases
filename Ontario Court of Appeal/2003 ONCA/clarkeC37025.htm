<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Archie G. Campbell of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated May 31, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of manslaughter, by a court composed of a judge 
  and jury, in the stabbing death of Daniel Cousins. </p>
<p>
  [2] The victim was a friend of the appellant. He was 47 years of age. He was 
  emaciated and frail and suffered from numerous health problems. He was stabbed 
  seven times in his own home, a rooming house in which the appellant also had 
  a room. Two of the wounds were likely fatal. The victim was an alcoholic and 
  his blood alcohol level when he died was 196 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres 
  of blood. It was a brutal killing.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant was 29 years of age at the time of the offence and in good 
  health. He was unemployed and on welfare, but was interested in boxing and hoped 
  to work as a trainer in that field. The appellant diverted suspicion away from 
  himself until he was confronted with strong evidence arrayed against him by 
  the police. He then admitted that he had caused the victim's death.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge concluded that the jury's verdict was based either on a 
  doubt about provocation or the &quot;rolled up&quot; defence of lack of intent 
  caused by some alcohol consumption and some provocation. He also concluded that 
  any evidence of the appellant's impairment was very slight.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a term of 14 years' imprisonment 
  less pre-trial custody. The appellant was in custody for 18 months prior to 
  his trial, for which the trial judge gave the appellant 2 years' credit. The 
  trial judge declined to give the appellant credit on a two-for-one basis on 
  the ground that the appellant himself had prolonged the length of his custody 
  because he changed counsel and lost his first trial date. The Crown concedes 
  that there was no evidence that the appellant changed counsel for any improper 
  purpose and, thus, the trial judge erred in principle because he took into consideration 
  an irrelevant factor. The considerations respecting two-for-one credit for pre-trial 
  detention all apply here. Pre-trial custody cannot be used to earn remission 
  towards parole; there are few rehabilitative programs available in detention 
  centres, and the conditions in detention facilities are more crowded than in 
  correctional facilities such as penitentiaries. The appellant should have received 
  a credit of at least 3 years for the time spent in custody. </p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, the trial judge was also in error in stating that &quot;provocation 
  cannot mitigate a sentence in a case like this.&quot; In R. v. Stone, [1999] 
  2 S.C.R. 290 at para. 237, Bastarache J. for the Court, held that, &quot;[t]he 
  argument that the provocation factor was spent because it had already served 
  to reduce the legal character of the crime overlooks the purpose of s. 232 and 
  therefore must fail.&quot; Thus, provocation is one of the many factors to be 
  considered when assessing the appropriate sentence. In this case, it deserved 
  some modest consideration.</p>
<p>
  [7] The range of sentence for the offence of manslaughter can vary immensely. 
  This case involved an incident that carried substantial moral culpability. In 
  his sentencing submissions, defence counsel appeared to agree that the appropriate 
  range of sentence for &quot;aggravated&quot; manslaughter was 8 to 12 years' 
  imprisonment. Crown counsel at trial did not seem to disagree with the stated 
  range. On this appeal, however, counsel for the appellant argues that this is 
  not a case of aggravated manslaughter. We disagree. There are numerous aggravating 
  factors in this case:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the extremely frail and vulnerable nature of the victim, 
  who was defenceless against this armed attack;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the victim was attacked in his own home;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) although not in a position of trust, the appellant was 
  looked upon by the deceased and others as a friend who provided some assistance 
  and friendly care to the victim in the past and he abused this relationship 
  by killing Daniel Cousins;</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) the use of a knife during the commission of the offence;</p>
<p class="indent"> (e) the brutality of the attack, resulting in seven stab wounds 
  in the chest area, two of which could have caused the death, and some of which 
  were inflicted with considerable force, as shown by the wound going through 
  the breast bone and the pericardial sac into the pulmonary artery;</p>
<p class="indent"> (f) the appellant wrapped the knife in paper and plastic and 
  hid it in a plastic bag beside recycling boxes outside the building after the 
  killing;</p>
<p class="indent"> (g) the appellant waited at least 20 minutes before making 
  an anonymous 911 call for medical help for his supposed friend, who was not 
  killed immediately by the stab wounds; </p>
<p class="indent"> (h) the appellant successfully diverted suspicion away from 
  himself at the scene by purporting to care for the deceased's welfare and suggesting 
  possible routes which some unknown assailant may have taken into the building;</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the appellant characterized himself as flying into &quot;pure 
  rage&quot; against a friend who had only slightly provoked him; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (j) the devastating impact on the family of Daniel Cousins.</p>
<p>
  [8] In light of these aggravating factors, we agree that the proper range for 
  this offence and this offender is 8 to 12 years' imprisonment. The 14-year sentence 
  imposed by the trial judge is outside that range. </p>
<p>
  [9] We note that the fresh evidence filed on behalf of the appellant indicates 
  that he has adapted well to prison life and keeps busy with school work and 
  other courses and that the authorities are positive about his performance.</p>
<p>
  [10] In all the circumstances, after the appellant is given credit for his pre-trial 
  custody and the provocation factor is taken into consideration, we would impose 
  a sentence of 9 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  [11] Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence 
  is reduced from 12 years to 9 years' imprisonment. </p>
