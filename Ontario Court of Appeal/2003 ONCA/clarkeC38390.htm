<p>On appeal from the conviction entered on February 1, 2002 and the sentence 
  imposed on May 30, 2002 by The Honourable Justice Trafford of the Superior Court 
  of Justice sitting without a jury.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of fraud in relation to social assistance benefits 
  received over the course of approximately three years. She was sentenced to 
  an 18-month conditional sentence followed by three years probation. The conditional 
  sentence and probation orders included conditions that she make restitution 
  in an amount of no less than $100 a month and make reasonable efforts, as directed 
  by her probation officer, to make full restitution in the amount of $25,281. 
  She appeals against conviction and sentence. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was self-represented at trial. Her main ground of appeal against 
  conviction relates to the trial judge's conduct of the trial. The appellant 
  submits that the trial judge's intervention during her examination and re-examination 
  was so excessive that it effectively prevented her from presenting her evidence 
  in the manner she had chosen. She submits further that his intervention in the 
  process became cross-examination and, as such, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. Finally, the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to provide 
  her with adequate assistance, particularly during the course of her cross-examination 
  of the Crown witnesses. </p>
<p>
  [3] There is no question that the trial judge assumed a prominent role in eliciting 
  the appellant's evidence. We are not satisfied, however, that the appellant 
  was prejudiced as a result. The appellant, in answering the questions directed 
  to her, testified about all the matters she had identified as relevant to her 
  defence. In addition, the trial judge repeatedly asked the appellant whether 
  she had anything to add to her testimony with respect to any of the matters 
  that were canvassed. In the result, we are not persuaded that the active role 
  of the trial judge resulted in any prejudice to the appellant in the presentation 
  of her evidence as she contends. </p>
<p>
  [4] To the extent that some of the trial judge's questions may arguably have 
  been more in the nature of cross-examination and may have been better had they 
  not been posed, we are of the view that the questions did no more than alert 
  the appellant to the obvious areas of concern in the case. We see nothing in 
  this record that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, we see no merit to the contention that the trial judge failed to 
  provide the appellant with adequate assistance. To the contrary, the record 
  reveals that the trial judge went to great length to assist the appellant at 
  the various stages of the trial. </p>
<p>
  [6] Consequently, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [7] We see no merit to the additional grounds of appeal relating to the trial 
  judge's consideration of the evidence and to its sufficiency to support a conviction. 
  The appeal against conviction is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [8] On her appeal against sentence, the appellant contends that it was inappropriate 
  for the trial judge to impose conditions that she make restitution in the circumstances 
  of this case where it was difficult to calculate the amount of the loss. Further, 
  she submits that there was no evidence that she was capable of making restitution. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] We do not accept either submission. With respect to the appellant's ability 
  to make restitution, it is noteworthy that the sentence requires her to make 
  a minimum payment of $100 a month, and further amounts only to the extent that 
  she can reasonably do so. It cannot be said that these conditions are unreasonable 
  given that the appellant had a full time employment earning $46,000 a year, 
  she owned a home in which she had $20,000 equity, and she was expected to complete 
  a Masters Degree in Business Administration in two years. Further, we are of 
  the view that the finding on the quantum of the loss is supported by the evidence. 
  Hence, we see no reason to interfere with the sentence. </p>
<p>
  [10] Leave to appeal the sentence is allowed but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
