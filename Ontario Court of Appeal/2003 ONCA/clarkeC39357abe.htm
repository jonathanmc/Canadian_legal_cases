<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] This appeal is dismissed. There is no genuine issue for trial on the issue 
  of damages and therefore the action cannot succeed. We agree with the reasons 
  of the motion judge with respect to the argument as it was put to him. Counsel 
  for the appellant has attempted to reframe the argument before us; but even 
  on this new theory, there is no evidence that the appellant suffered any damages 
  because of the negligent advice from the solicitor. These new theories are based 
  on speculation and are contradicted by the appellant's own affidavit.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
