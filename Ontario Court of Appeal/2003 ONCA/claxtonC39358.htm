<p>On appeal from the order of Justice J.J. Cavarzan dated December 13, 2002.</p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] This appeal is involves the scope of a motions judge's jurisdiction to 
  determine matters alleged to arise under a collective agreement.</p>
<p>[2] Stuart Claxton worked for BML Multi Trades Group Ltd. (&quot;BML&quot;) 
  as a sprinkler fitter since 1983. He was a member of Local 853 of the United 
  Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry 
  of the United States and Canada (&quot;UA&quot;). </p>
<p>[3] BML is a construction industry employer and is bound to the National Road 
  Sprinkler Fitter Collective Agreement between the Canadian Automatic Sprinkler 
  Association and several Local Unions of the UA, including Local 853.</p>
<p>[4] On May 6, 2002, Mr. Claxton was laid off when BML's General Manager accused 
  him of taking a company truck without permission and leaving a company meeting 
  early.</p>
<p>[5] Mr. Claxton's position is that he was unjustly terminated. Moreover, he 
  asserts that at the time, he was a manager, not an employee in the bargaining 
  unit, since, among other things, he had supervisory responsibilities over several 
  sprinkler fitter employees. When he advised the union by letter dated May 9, 
  2002 of the circumstances surrounding his termination, he asked that it be dealt 
  with &quot;as a managerial position not a worker&quot;. </p>
<p>[6] The union's lawyer, in a letter dated June 18, 2002 to the lawyer Mr. Claxton 
  retained to bring legal proceedings, agreed with Mr. Claxton's position that 
  he was managerial and therefore not covered by the collective agreement. He 
  also indicated that in the construction industry, it was common for a person 
  promoted to management to retain membership in the union.</p>
<p>[7] BML, on the other hand, claims that at the time of his lay off, Mr. Claxton 
  was a sprinkler fitter foreman, employed and paid under the terms of the current 
  Collective Agreement, and that union funds and dues were being deducted and 
  remitted on his behalf to Local 853.</p>
<p>[8] BML also submitted that Mr. Claxton's duties and responsibilities were 
  the same as those of BML's other unionized foremen.</p>
<p>[9] On July 16, 2002, Mr. Claxton started an action in the Superior Court of 
  Justice seeking damages for wrongful dismissal.</p>
<p>[10] BML responded by bringing a motion pursuant to Rule 21.01 (3)(a) to have 
  the action dismissed on the grounds that the Superior Court of Justice had no 
  jurisdiction because Mr. Claxton, and the issues he was raising, were covered 
  by the Collective Agreement.</p>
<p>[11] The motions judge dismissed BML's motion. He examined the evidence before 
  him and concluded that Mr. Claxton was exercising managerial functions. As a 
  result, he found him not to be an &quot;employee&quot; within the meaning of 
  that term in s. 1(3)(b) of the Labour Relations Act S.O. 1995 c. 1. Because 
  Mr. Claxton was not covered by the Collective Agreement, the motions judge concluded 
  that the court had jurisdiction to hear the wrongful dismissal claim.</p>
<p>[12] With respect, the motions judge lacked jurisdiction to embark on an inquiry 
  into whether Mr. Claxton was exercising managerial functions. The only issue 
  he ought to have considered was whether the core of the jurisdictional dispute 
  before him was governed by the terms of the Collective Agreement. By assessing 
  instead the merits of the dispute, namely, whether Mr. Claxton was an employee 
  covered by the Collective Agreement, he was trespassing on arbitrable territory.</p>
<p>[13] McLachlin J., in adopting the 'exclusive jurisdiction' model for the resolution 
  of labour disputes in Weber v. Ontario Hydro [1995] 125 D.L.R. (4th) 583 (S.C.C.), 
  stated, at p. 602, said:</p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;The question in each case is whether the dispute, in its essential character, 
  arises from the interpretation, application, administration or violation of 
  the collective agreement.&quot;</p>
<p> [14] This approach finds resonance in s. 48 (1)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  of the Labour Relations Act, as well as in s. 133 (1)<a href="#2">[2]</a>,<a name="r2"></a> 
  which applies to the construction industry. Both provisions confirm that differences 
  between the parties relating to the interpretation, application, administration 
  or alleged violation of a collective agreement, including any question as to 
  whether a matter is arbitrable, are to be determined in accordance with the 
  Collective Agreement. </p>
<p> [15] The preliminary dispute between Mr. Claxton and BML is whether he is 
  covered by the Collective Agreement. If he is, the dispute over his termination 
  will be arbitrated. If he is not, it will proceed in the Superior Court of Justice 
  as a wrongful dismissal action. But the issue whether the dispute is arbitrable, 
  engages squarely the application and interpretation of the Collective Agreement 
  and the motions judge, accordingly, had no jurisdiction to make that determination. 
</p>
<p>[16] I would expect that the parties - and the union - will co-operate in facilitating 
  a timely, arbitrated determination on whether Mr. Claxton exercised managerial 
  functions or was an &quot;employee&quot; included in the bargaining unit. Thereafter, 
  the appropriate forum for scrutinizing Mr. Claxton's termination can be identified 
  and his remedies pursued. Until that determination is made, it seems to me to 
  be more appropriate to stay, rather than dismiss the action.</p>
<p>[17] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Cavarzan 
  J. dismissing the motion, and substitute a stay of the action.</p>
<p>[18] In all of the circumstances, I believe that the parties should bear their 
  own costs of the motion and of the appeal. I would not award any costs of the 
  appeal.</p>
<p>RELEASED: &quot;OCT -7 2003&quot; &quot;RSA&quot; </p>
<p> &quot;R.S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree M. J. Moldaver J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree Robert Sharpe J.A.&quot;</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<p> <a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> S. 48 (1): Every collective agreement 
  shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration, without stoppage 
  of work, of all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, 
  application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement, including 
  any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable [Emphasis added].</p>
<p> <a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> S. 133 (1): Despite the grievance and 
  arbitration provisions in a collective agreement or deemed to be included in 
  a collective agreement under section 48, a party to a collective agreement between 
  an employer or employers' organization and a trade union or council of trade 
  unions may refer a grievance concerning the interpretation, application, administration 
  or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether 
  a matter is arbitrable, to the Board for final and binding determination [Emphasis 
  added].</p>
