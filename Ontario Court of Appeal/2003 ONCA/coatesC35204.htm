<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Ronald A. Minard of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 16, 2000.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals his convictions for carrying ammunition without lawful 
  excuse in a careless manner contrary to s. 86 (1) of the Criminal Code and for 
  possession of a restricted firearm contrary to s. 95(1) of the Code. </p>
<p>
  [2] The main issue is whether the trial judge erred in law in holding that the 
  police were justified in stopping the appellant's vehicle. The appellant contends 
  that the police did not have articulable cause to stop the appellant's car and 
  that, as a result, he was arbitrarily detained in violation of his s. 9 Charter 
  rights. The search and seizure of the bullets and firearm which followed the 
  detention were therefore, in the appellant's submission, unreasonable, and the 
  trial judge erred in not excluding the evidence obtained as a result under s. 
  24 (2) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [3] As stated in R.v. Simpson (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 at 501, articulable 
  cause is &quot;a constellation of objectively discernible facts which give the 
  detaining officer reasonable cause to suspect that the detainee is implicated 
  in the activity under investigation.&quot; In ascertaining whether articulable 
  cause exists the court must have regard to the facts and circumstances as a 
  whole, rather than isolating each in turn and must be satisfied that there are 
  bona fide clearly expressed and factually objective reasons justifying not only 
  the detention of the suspect but also the extent and nature of the investigation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant further contends that, even if the stop was justified, the 
  trial judge erred in not excluding the evidence obtained under section 24 (2) 
  of the Charter because the appellant's right to be promptly informed of the 
  reason for his arrest under s. 10 (a) and his right to retain and instruct counsel 
  under s. 10 (b) were violated.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [5] Constable Ritchie and his partner Constable DaSilva were part of a special 
  task force investigating a rash of violent robberies that had taken place in 
  the City of Vaughn, outside of Toronto. During a briefing before the commencement 
  of their shift, the officers were instructed to patrol a specified region of 
  Vaughn that had been the target of these robberies and to be on the lookout 
  for suspicious vehicles or individuals.</p>
<p>
  [6] At approximately 2 a.m. the officers noticed a vehicle with Quebec licence 
  plates in close proximity to a commercial area where one would not expect tourists 
  to be. The car stopped for a red light at an intersection and Constable Ritchie 
  drove the police car along side. He observed that the appellant, the driver 
  of the vehicle, and the passenger were not speaking to one another and did not 
  appear to &quot;belong together&quot;. He also noted that when he brought his 
  vehicle along side the appellant's car the passenger appeared to be &quot;very 
  nervous&quot; and was not wearing a seat belt. He attempted to make eye contact 
  with the passenger but the passenger and driver stared out of the front windshield 
  and would not make eye contact with him.</p>
<p>
  [7] When the light turned green, both cars continued northbound with the police 
  vehicle driving slightly behind and to the right of the appellant's car. At 
  this time, the appellant's car made an abrupt lane change very close to an intersection 
  in a manner that caused Constable Ritchie to believe they were attempting to 
  evade contact with the police. The officer testified that in his experience, 
  this type of abrupt lane change often occurs with drivers that have been drinking 
  or people involved in activities they wish to conceal from the police. He changed 
  lanes, followed the appellant's car and once again both cars stopped beside 
  each other for a red light. Once again, Constable Ritchie attempted to make 
  eye contact, but the passenger continued to stare straight ahead and refused 
  to look over at the police or acknowledge the unusually close proximity of the 
  police vehicle.</p>
<p>
  [8] When this second traffic light turned green, Constable Ritchie deliberately 
  waited to determine in which direction the appellant's car was about to proceed. 
  Several seconds passed and the appellant's car remained stationary at the green 
  light. Finally, the appellant's car turned westbound. At that point Constable 
  Ritchie activated his emergency lights and performed a traffic stop.</p>
<p>
  [9] Once the appellant's car stopped, Constable DaSilva approached the car. 
  Within seconds, Constable Ritchie, who had aimed a spotlight at the appellant's 
  car, observed a black sock-like object being thrown out of the front passenger 
  window. The object landed between the curb and sidewalk. Constable Ritchie walked 
  up and nudged the object with his foot. Several silver bullets fell out. Officer 
  Ritchie formed the belief that there was a strong possibility there was a firearm 
  in the car. He was concerned for the safety of himself and his partner and decided 
  to act as if he was completely unaware of the existence of the bullets for the 
  moment.</p>
<p>
  [10] Meanwhile, P.C. DaSilva asked the appellant for his driver's licence, ownership 
  and insurance. He advised the appellant that he was being stopped because his 
  passenger was not wearing a seatbelt. P.C. DaSilva then asked the appellant 
  where he was going and the appellant replied that he was going to McDonald's. 
  P.C. DaSilva did not believe the appellant as both vehicles had just passed 
  a McDonald's on the southwest corner of Highway 7 and Pine Valley Road. He asked 
  the appellant where he was staying and the appellant replied, &quot;Dodge Suites&quot;. 
  P.C. DaSilva asked where Dodge Suites was and the appellant replied, &quot;On 
  Highway 7. I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [11] Standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, P.C. Ritchie shone a flashlight 
  into the interior of the car and noticed power cords of the type often used 
  for radar detectors and a pair of binoculars under the passenger's front seat. 
  Constable Ritchie asked the passenger and the appellant if there was a radar 
  detector in the car and asked the passenger to step out of the vehicle. Upon 
  opening the passenger door, Constable Ritchie observed a balaclava and an unfolded 
  map of city streets on the back seat.</p>
<p>
  [12] The passenger was escorted back to the police cruiser and given a quick 
  pat-down search before being placed in the back seat by Constable Ritchie because 
  of his concern for officer safety. Constable Ritchie then returned to the appellant's 
  car. After informing Officer DaSilva that the men were &quot;up to something&quot; 
  he instructed that the appellant be arrested for having, or being about to commit, 
  an indictable offence.</p>
<p>
  [13] Following his arrest, the appellant was searched and his waist pouch revealed 
  five .38 calibre bullets, a small tape recorder, papers and a large quantity 
  of cash. The appellant was rearrested but the evidence is not clear whether 
  the basis for the arrest was &quot;possession of bullets&quot; or careless storage 
  of ammunition. Neither the appellant nor his passenger was given the right to 
  counsel at this time.</p>
<p>
  [14] Following the appellant's arrest, Constable Ritchie performed a &quot;quick 
  interior search&quot; of the car and located two full-face balaclavas, a radar 
  detector in the glove compartment, a roll of duct tape in the armrest and the 
  open city map. Constable Ritchie also opened the trunk and observed a gym bag, 
  panels from a bulletproof vest, a camouflage jacket and a video camera. The 
  two officers then waited for back-up assistance.</p>
<p>
  [15] Approximately 30 minutes later the appellant was transported to the police 
  station where he was informed of his right to counsel and his right to remain 
  silent. The appellant requested the opportunity to contact his lawyer at that 
  time but was not permitted to do so for a period of approximately four hours 
  due to security concerns on the part of the Sergeant in charge of the investigation. 
  The Sergeant testified that he was concerned that the appellant and his passenger 
  were involved in a contract killing and that information could be released to 
  others working in concert with the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [16] The same morning a search warrant was issued for the appellant's vehicle. 
  The police officer conducting the search found a loaded .38 caliber handgun 
  containing hollow point ammunition under the appellant's back seat. The butt 
  of the handgun contained an abrasion in the area where a serial number is normally 
  located. In addition to the items observed by Constable Ritchie, the police 
  also found two Hell's Angels support stickers, a blue knapsack with a red-handled 
  knife, a set of wire cutters, an ear piece for a cell phone or tape recorder, 
  one black hand glove and one bottle of rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>
  The Decision of the Trial Judge</p>
<p>
  [17] At the appellant's trial, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Constable 
  Ritchie that the fact the passenger in the front seat of the vehicle was not 
  wearing a seat belt was a real factor in the decision to stop the vehicle and 
  &quot;wasn't a pretext in any way.&quot; Having regard to all the circumstances, 
  he held that the police had articulable cause to stop the appellant's vehicle. 
  In the event the appellant's rights under s. 9 had been infringed, the trial 
  judge held that he would nevertheless have admitted the evidence from the search 
  under s. 24(2) of the Charter on the basis that the stop was intended to be 
  very brief and it was only a few seconds before the police had ample reasonable 
  and probable grounds to suspect that both the passenger and the driver were 
  involved in the commission of an indictable offence.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  i.) Did The Trial Judge Err In Concluding That The Stop Was Justified?</p>
<p>
  [18] Each case depends on its own facts and the inquiry into the existence of 
  articulable cause must begin with a determination of whether the detention was 
  justified in the totality of circumstances. Thus, in R. v. Wilson (1990), 56 
  C.C.C. (3d) 142 (S.C.C.) at 147, Cory J. on behalf of the Court held that &quot; 
  &#133;where the police offer grounds for stopping a motorist that are reasonable 
  and that can be clearly expressed (the articulable cause referred to in the 
  American authorities)&quot; the stop was justified, the detention was not arbitrary 
  and the stop did not violate s. 9 of the Charter. </p>
<p>
  [19] In this case Constable Ritchie offered grounds for stopping the appellant's 
  vehicle that were clearly expressed. The officer identified two specific factors 
  that justified a stop under s. 216(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, namely the 
  seatbelt infraction and the abrupt lane change, which Const. Ritchie associated 
  with the possibility of an impaired driver. The trial judge found that the police 
  did not use these factors as a pretext for the stop. In Brown v. Durham Regional 
  Police Force, (1998), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 1at 13-14 (Ont. C.A.), this Court held 
  that a &quot; trial judge's finding that highway safety concerns were one of 
  the purposes behind the stop is a finding of fact.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [20] A trial judge's findings of fact and inferences from facts can only be 
  overturned where the judge committed a palpable and overriding error: Housen 
  v. Nikolaisen, [2002] S.C.J. No. 31. The decision in Housen, supra, stressed 
  very strongly the need for great caution and deference on the part of appellate 
  courts when they review the assessment of facts by a trial court. The rule in 
  Housen, supra, does not, however, preclude an appellate court from identifying 
  errors in the findings of fact where those errors are sufficiently palpable 
  and important and have a sufficiently decisive effect that they would justify 
  intervention and review on appeal: Prudhomme v. Prudhomme , [2002] S.C.C. No. 
  85. </p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant contends that this Court's intervention is justified because 
  the trial judge's finding that highway safety concerns were one of the purposes 
  behind the stop is unreasonable. On a proper application of the unreasonableness 
  test, the question is not whether there was a reasonable basis in the evidence 
  to make the finding of fact. Rather, an appellate court must ask itself whether, 
  on the evidence as a whole, a reasonable trier of fact could have made the impugned 
  finding notwithstanding the competing conclusion. Absent a determination that 
  no reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting judicially, could 
  have made the same findings the verdict should not be disturbed on appeal: R. 
  v. Yebes (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) at 430; R. v. Biniaris (2000), 
  143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.) 
  at 515. </p>
<p>
  [22] In support of his submission that the stop was unreasonable, counsel for 
  the appellant directed us to a passage in the evidence in which Constable Ritchie 
  agreed that, given his task that night, he would not have stopped the vehicle 
  on the basis of the passenger's seat belt violation alone. </p>
<p>
  [23] There is, however, evidence that highway safety was one of the purposes 
  for the stop. In response to the suggestion that the seat belt violation was 
  not the reason for stopping the car Constable Ritchie testified: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If I came up alongside of a vehicle, whether it be daytime or the nighttime, 
  the passenger or the driver was not wearing their seat belt, and I made an effort, 
  dependent on what type of effort, to get their attention, which they chose to 
  ignore, and then were defiant enough not to wear-put their seat belt on after, 
  I would, in all likelihood, stop that car and ask why they don't have their 
  seat belt on, and why they didn't put it on when they saw the police.</p>
<p>[24] The appellant also argues that once the appellant's car was stopped Constable 
  Ritchie did nothing to investigate the seat belt violation. However, Constable 
  Ritche's partner, Constable DaSilva, informed the appellant that the reason 
  for the stop was that his passenger's seat belt was not done up.</p>
<p>
  [25] Considered in the content of the evidence at trial as a whole, the trial 
  judge's finding that the passenger's failure to wear a seat belt was a real 
  factor in the police officer's decision to stop the vehicle is supported by 
  the evidence and is one that a reasonable trier of fact could have made. </p>
<p>
  [26] In the context of the investigation of the recent robberies, the time of 
  night, the area of the stop, and the other observations demonstrating that the 
  appellant and his passenger were acting suspiciously and evasively, the police 
  had articulable cause to detain the appellant for brief investigative purposes. 
  Constable Ritchie had an objective factual basis that gave rise to his suspicion 
  and this basis rose above the level of a mere hunch. The existence of other 
  lawful police purposes such as investigation of other criminal activity and 
  intelligence gathering, in addition to highway safety concerns, does not taint 
  the lawfulness of the stop: See Brown v. Durham Regional Police Force (1998), 
  131 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont.C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge did not err in holding that the initial detention of the 
  appellant was justified and did not violate his rights under s. 9 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  ii.) Did the trial judge err in admitting the evidence of the search under s. 
  24 (2)?</p>
<p>
  [28] I must now consider the effect of the violation of the appellant's rights 
  under s. 10 on the admissibility of the evidence under s. 24 (2). At trial, 
  the Crown conceded that the appellant had not been promptly given his right 
  to counsel and that the delay in allowing him to exercise his right to counsel 
  was a breach of his rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [29] The appellant submits that his s. 10 (a) right to be informed of the offence 
  with which he was charged was also violated. He was initially arrested for an 
  offence that is not known to law, and he was not advised of the reason for his 
  arrest until approximately 6 a.m. more than four hours after his arrest.</p>
<p>
  [30] After the .38 calibre bullets were found in the appellant's pouch, the 
  appellant was rearrested at the scene. While the exact basis for the appellant's 
  rearrest is unclear, the appellant knew that his arrest related to the .38 calibre 
  bullets. For the purposes of this appeal I will, however, assume that the appellant's 
  rights under s. 10(a) were also violated. </p>
<p>
  [31] The test under s. 24(2) is whether the evidence &quot;could&quot; bring 
  the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of a reasonable person, 
  dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances of the case: R. v. Collins 
  (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). Where admitting the evidence affects the 
  fairness of the trial, then the admission of the evidence would tend to bring 
  the administration of justice into disrepute and, subject to consideration of 
  other factors, it should generally be excluded: R. v. Stillman (1997), 113 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 321 (S.C.C.). </p>
<p>
  [32] The evidence of the firearm was real evidence not causally connected to 
  the breach of the appellant's right to counsel. No statements were taken from 
  the appellant prior to his being afforded access to a telephone to contact his 
  lawyer. The appellant appropriately concedes that the evidence obtained as a 
  result of the breach of his rights was not conscriptive and did not affect trial 
  fairness. The trial judge found that the police had acted in good faith. That 
  finding is entitled to deference. In exercising his discretion not to exclude 
  the evidence of the bullets and the weapon pursuant to s. 24(2) the trial judge 
  committed no error in principle.</p>
<p>
  [33] I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. </p>
