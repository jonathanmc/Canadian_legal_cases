<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants/plaintiffs in this action appeal from the judgment of Borkovich
  J. which granted summary judgment to the respondents/defendants dismissing
  the appellants' action. </p>
<p>
  [2] The main claims in the action were for the torts of abuse of public office
  and conspiracy to injure. The appellants were in the business of constructing
  and operating student housing in and around McMaster University. The municipality
  passed certain by?laws in order to prohibit the construction of "monster" homes
  in the same areas of Hamilton. The appellants contended that the municipality's
  true purpose in enacting these by-laws was to prevent the construction of student
  housing which, they say, the municipality could not legally prohibit. </p>
<p>
  [3] Although there existed a by-law prohibiting lodging houses in the area,
  the appellants took the view that their student accommodation was not lodging
  houses within the meaning of that by-law. They did not challenge the ability
  of the municipality to regulate the construction and operation of lodging houses,
  but rather its ability to target students as tenants. For its part, the municipality
  agreed that one class of occupants of "monster" homes could be
  students and that its prohibition of the construction of "monster" homes
  could have the effect of limiting student housing, but that was within the
  legal power and authority of the municipality.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants allege non-compliance with the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990,
  c. P.13, and Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 in the procedures used by
  the City to pass the relevant by-laws, thereby making them illegal and void.
  However, the appellants did not appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board, where
  the by-laws were ultimately confirmed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The hearing of the cross-motions for summary judgment took nine days. After
  considering all of the voluminous evidence and submissions, the motion judge
  concluded at paras. 21 and 22 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Mark Cole is of the opinion
  that the real purpose for By-laws 95-02 and 95-03 is to prohibit student housing.
  There is no evidence that this is so and, no submission made on evidence submitted
  that student housing has in any way been affected. Certainly, the by-laws prevent
  the plaintiffs from building "monster" homes but the plaintiffs
  have not demonstrated how student housing has been affected. There is nothing
  in the by-laws that prevents the plaintiffs from renting to students. On the
  evidence it is clearly demonstrated that the plaintiffs way of providing student
  housing by building "monster" homes is no longer available to him.
  But there is no evidence that the by-laws were directed solely at the plaintiffs.
  Likewise, others in the same line as the plaintiffs have been effected as well
  as all the residents in the neighbourhoods who might seek to enlarge their
  facilities.</p>
<p class="indent">After having considered the evidence submitted, the submissions
    of counsel and the authorities brought forth by counsel in support of their
    positions,
    I am satisfied that the plaintiffs herein have failed to demonstrate a genuine
    issue for trial on the basis of the tort of abuse of public office and conspiracy.</p>
<p>
  [6]	Although the motion judge referred to the term "no genuine issue
  for trial", in the context of the plaintiffs' case, we understand
  him to be referring to "no case to meet". </p>
<p>
  [7] We have not been persuaded on this appeal that the motion judge made any
  palpable and overriding error in his assessment of the evidence. His findings
  are entitled to deference. We see no basis to interfere with his conclusions.
  We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs on a partial-indemnity scale
  fixed in the amount of $20,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellants also appealed the costs order made by the motion judge wherein
  he ordered costs on a solicitor-and-client scale before December 31, 2001,
  and on a substantial-indemnity scale thereafter. The motion judge gave very
  brief reasons for his award. Although the costs issue was raised in the amended
  notice of appeal, the court had no argument on it in the factums or in oral
  argument from the respondents. In the circumstances, we request the appellants
  and respondents to provide brief (maximum 5 pages) written submissions on the
  issue within 5 and 10 days respectively of the release of these reasons. </p>
