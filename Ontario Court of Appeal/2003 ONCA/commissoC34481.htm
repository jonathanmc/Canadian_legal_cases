<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Katherine E. Swinton of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated May 25, 2000, reported at 48 O.R. (3d) 484.
<p>MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal from the judgment of Swinton J. dated May 25, 2000 
  dismissing their action against the respondent Dr. Allan Handysides. They ask 
  that the judgment be set aside and that judgment be granted finding Dr. Handysides 
  negligent and awarding the agreed damages to the appellants.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The infant appellant, Francesco Commisso, suffers from cerebral palsy with 
  resultant quadriplegia and neurological damage caused by an acute asphyxial 
  event that occurred in the period shortly before his birth. After Francesco's 
  mother had not delivered her baby following several hours in delivery, Dr. Sam 
  Rubenzahl, the general practitioner performing the delivery, consulted with 
  Dr. Handysides, the head of the obstetrics department at North York Branson 
  Hospital. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Dr. Handysides decided to perform &quot;a trial of mid-forceps&quot; delivery. 
  The word &quot;trial&quot; means an attempt. At the trial of this action, Dr. 
  Handysides' decision to attempt a mid-forceps delivery was not questioned by 
  any of the medical experts (Dr. Manning and Dr. Bernstein who were called by 
  the plaintiffs and Dr. Barrett who testified as a defence witness).<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Dr. Handysides' attempt at a mid-forceps delivery failed because the baby's 
  head was too large to navigate the mother's birth canal. At the trial, no issue 
  was taken with the location in which Dr. Handysides applied the forceps or the 
  manner in which he applied them.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Once the trial of mid-forceps failed, delivery by caesarean section (&quot;c?section&quot;) 
  was inevitable. Dr. Manuel Yung, an anesthetist who was in the delivery room, 
  moved to the operating room just down the hall. Pursuant to hospital policy, 
  there was a dedicated operating room with operating room nurses available to 
  perform the c-section.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] Dr. Handysides left the delivery room and walked a few paces to a nursing 
  station to place a call to Dr. Kurt Andre, the pediatrician on call, to request 
  that he attend for a c?section. While on the phone, Dr. Handysides was told 
  by a nurse that the baby's heart rate had dropped. He rushed back into the delivery 
  room. He quickly checked the fetal monitor to determine the baby's heart rate; 
  however, he could not obtain a reliable tracing. In order to determine whether 
  there was a problem with the monitor or an abnormal heart rate, Dr. Handysides 
  applied a scalp electrode directly to the fetal head. He confirmed the abnormal 
  heart rate for a few seconds and declared a dire emergency.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Mrs. Commisso was moved quickly to the operating room. Dr. Yung applied 
  the anesthetic and an emergency c?section was performed. The baby was delivered; 
  sadly, it is profoundly disabled, probably because the trial of mid-forceps 
  caused a blockage in the umbilical cord. The consequences, as found by the trial 
  judge, were:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I find that there was asphyxial insult following the 
  application of the forceps, which caused hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy - that 
  is, brain dysfunction due to inadequate oxygen delivery and blood flow to the 
  brain. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that this was the cause of 
  Francesco's current neurological status - that is, his cerebral palsy.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] It is important to note that although the plaintiffs sued the hospital, 
  four doctors and several nurses, the trial itself unfolded against only Dr. 
  Handysides. As explained by the trial judge in the first two paragraphs of her 
  44 page judgment:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs seek damages as a result of the brain 
  injury allegedly suffered by the minor plaintiff, Francesco Commisso, at the 
  time of his birth on April 27, 1989. As the action was settled against the nurses 
  and the North York Branson Hospital, the issues at trial related only to the 
  liability of Doctors Allan Handysides, Manuel Yung, Kurt Andre and Samuel Rubenzahl 
  . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">At trial, the plaintiffs essentially pursued their case 
  only against Dr. Handysides, the obstetrician who delivered Francesco. The evidence 
  led by them does not support any claim of negligence against Doctors Rubenzahl, 
  Yung and Andre, and, therefore, the action against them is dismissed without 
  further comment. [Emphasis added.]<br>
</p>
<p>[9] It is also important to observe that at trial the plaintiffs did not allege 
  that Dr. Handysides was negligent in making the decision to attempt a mid-forceps 
  delivery or in the manner in which he performed the procedure.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] At trial, the plaintiffs' case proceeded on two bases: first, that Dr. 
  Handysides was negligent, in the words of the trial judge, in not &quot;ensuring 
  that all preparations for a caesarean had been made before the vaginal delivery 
  was attempted&quot; and, in particular, not providing for &quot;a double setup, 
  so that the caesarean section could have been done in the same room as the trial 
  of forceps&quot;; and, second, Dr. Handysides was negligent &quot;in failing 
  to proceed to a caesarean section without delay - more precisely, within the 
  ten minute period necessary to avert permanent damage&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The trial judge engaged in a careful and extensive review of the evidence. 
  Relying on the testimony of both of the plaintiffs' experts, she found that 
  the standard of care did not require a double setup in 1989:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Manning conceded that the standard of care in 1989 
  did not require that the trial of forceps be done in a room equipped for an 
  immediate caesarean section. Rather, he agreed that the standard of care required 
  that it be possible to do an &quot;immediate&quot; caesarean section, and that 
  standard could be met it there was an operating room close by, staffed and with 
  an anesthetist available. What was important to him was the immediate response 
  to an emergency, not the location of the operation.<br>
</p>
<p>Dr. Bernstein's testimony on this issue was virtually 
  identical.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] On the second issue - the speed of delivery of the baby after a dire emergency 
  was declared - the trial judge rejected &quot;a fixed ten minute standard of 
  care for the delivery&quot;. Rather, she held that the appropriate standard 
  of care was &quot;where a fetus is at risk . . . the doctor must move as expeditiously 
  as possible to deliver the baby, having due regard for the safety of both patients 
  - baby and mother&quot;. After reviewing the evidence, she concluded that Dr. 
  Handysides met this standard.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] On appeal, the appellants challenge the trial judge's reasoning and conclusions 
  on both the preparation and speed issues.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Before turning to a consideration of these issues, it is important, in 
  my view, to set out the chronology of events as found by the trial judge. A 
  central issue at trial was how much time elapsed between the failure of the 
  trial of forceps and the delivery of the baby. The reason a large amount of 
  time was devoted to this issue at trial was that the delivery took place in 
  two rooms, the delivery and operating rooms, and the crucial events were recorded 
  using three different instruments or methods - the time recording monitor clock 
  in the delivery room, the clock in the operating room and Dr. Yung's watch, 
  with Dr. Yung being present in both rooms throughout the procedures. The trial 
  judge made a factual finding that there was &quot;a difference of four to five 
  minutes in the times recorded using Dr. Yung's watch and those found on the 
  tracing from the fetal heart rate monitor&quot;. She then analyzed the evidence 
  relating to the various steps taken during the emergency and made a factual 
  conclusion &quot;that the time between the removal of the forceps and the delivery 
  of the baby was about 17 minutes&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] Using 5:24 p.m. as the time of delivery, and working back through the 
  steps and times described by the trial judge, it is clear that she found the 
  chronology to be (all times within one minute):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[16] Against the backdrop of this chronology, I turn to the two issues advanced 
  by the appellants on this appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The general standard of care expected of a medical practitioner, including 
  a specialist like Dr. Handysides, is not in dispute. As expressed by Schroeder 
  J.A. in Gent and Gent v. Wilson, [1956] O.R. 257 at 265 (C.A.):<br>
  Every medical practitioner must bring to his task a reasonable degree of skill 
  and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. He is bound to 
  exercise that degree of care and skill which could reasonably be expected of 
  a normal, prudent practitioner of the same experience and standing, and if he 
  holds himself out as a specialist, a higher degree of skill is required of him 
  than of one who does not profess to be so qualified by special training and 
  ability.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The appellants contend that the trial judge erred by not finding that 
  the standard of care for an obstetrician who elects to attempt a mid-forceps 
  delivery requires him to anticipate failure and therefore make all preparations 
  in advance for an immediate c?section. The appellants also submit that the trial 
  judge erred by not finding that Dr. Handysides failed to meet this standard.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] I disagree. The appellants' argument on this point is essentially a restatement 
  of their argument at trial in favour of a double setup in a single delivery/operating 
  room. That position was not supported by their own experts at trial who conceded 
  that the standard of care in 1989 with respect to preparedness for an emergency 
  c?section could be met by ensuring that a staffed operating room was immediately 
  available. Moreover, the appellants' experts offered no evidence at trial about 
  other preparations, different than a double setup, that Dr. Handysides should 
  have made before attempting a trial of mid-forceps delivery.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] As well, I reject, for two reasons, the appellants' claim that the total 
  elapsed time between identifying a dire emergency and delivery creates an inference 
  that Dr. Handysides failed to make all necessary preparations in advance for 
  an immediate c?section. First, I conclude that the trial judge's findings produce 
  the chronology set out in paragraph 15, which yields an elapsed time of 13?14 
  minutes between identifying a dire emergency and delivery (and not the 18&frac12; 
  minutes asserted by the appellants). Second, the trial judge found that the 
  steps taken prior to Mrs. Commisso's arrival in the operating room, which fully 
  account for the time elapsed in the relevant interval, were reasonable for the 
  reasons that I accept. As I will explain more fully later, trial counsel (not 
  appeal counsel) chose not to attack the steps taken after Mrs. Commisso arrived 
  in the operating room. The total elapsed time does not therefore give rise to 
  an inference that Dr. Handysides failed to make all necessary preparations for 
  an immediate c?section in advance.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] Accordingly, on the first issue I agree with the trial judge's statement 
  that &quot;the standard of care in 1989 required that an obstetrician should 
  have an operating room immediately available before attempting a mid-forceps 
  delivery&quot;. I also agree with her application of this standard of care to 
  the facts of the case:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he next issue is whether Dr. Handysides met the standard 
  of care. At the time he commenced the trial of mid-forceps, he had Dr. Yung 
  available with him in the delivery room. He would have known that there was 
  an operating room available a short distance away down the hall, because an 
  operating room, staffed with nurses, was assigned to Dr. Yung. Therefore, I 
  find that the facilities necessary to perform the cesarean section were immediately 
  available when he commenced the trial of forceps.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Turning to the second issue, the speed of the delivery once a dire emergency 
  was identified and declared, the appellants make two submissions which parallel 
  their submissions on the previous issue - first, the trial judge erred in her 
  formulation of the standard of care; and second, she erred in her application 
  of the standard of care to the facts of the case.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The standard of care adopted by the trial judge was &quot;where a fetus 
  is at risk . . . the doctor must move as expeditiously as possible to deliver 
  the baby, having due regard for the safety of both patients - baby and mother&quot;. 
  The appellants submit that the words &quot;as expeditiously as possible&quot; 
  set too low a standard; they propose a formulation of &quot;as fast as humanly 
  possible&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] I do not see a real difference in these formulations. The New Oxford Dictionary 
  of English (Oxford: Claredon Press, 1998) defines &quot;expeditious&quot; as 
  &quot;done with speed and efficiency&quot;. Moreover, it is clear from the seven 
  pages of analysis following her formulation of the standard of care that the 
  trial judge regarded it as a very high standard indeed, requiring great skill 
  and speed on the part of the specialist doctor.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] On the issue of application, the appellants contend that the trial judge 
  erred by not finding that the c?section should have been performed in less that 
  10 minutes from the declaration of a dire emergency. The trial judge rejected 
  this contention in the circumstances of this case. She reasoned:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the plaintiffs' submission that the standard 
  of care required that a caesarean section be completed in ten minutes, the evidence 
  of their two medical experts did not support that standard, given that one or 
  both did not criticize certain steps taken by Dr. Handysides prior to the delivery 
  that took ten minutes or more. Doctors Manning and Bernstein testified that 
  the four minute period to perform the actual caesarean was acceptable - indeed, 
  Dr. Bernstein thought it was fast. They also testified that the decision as 
  to the appropriate form of anesthesia was one to be made by the anesthetist, 
  and Dr. Handysides could not be criticized because it took five minutes from 
  the commencement of the anesthetic induction to the incision. Both accepted 
  that the transfer of the patient to the operating room met the standard of care 
  - if done in one to two minutes, according to Dr. Manning; for Dr. Bernstein, 
  the time was variously referred to as one and two to three minutes. In addition, 
  Dr. Manning did not question the application of the scalp electrode, which would 
  take approximately one minute, nor the draining of the mother's bladder in preparation 
  for surgery. Added to this must, of necessity, be the time reasonably taken 
  to recognize the emergency.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">All of this suggests the inappropriateness of a fixed 
  ten minute standard of care for the delivery. The fact that the defendants' 
  expert, Dr. Barrett, testified that caesareans could be done more quickly than 
  ten minutes in emergency situations does not mean that the standard of care 
  requires performance within that time frame, without consideration of the facts 
  of the particular case, including the time at which the emergency was recognized 
  or should have been recognized, the reasonableness of the steps taken to respond, 
  and the conditions of both baby and mother.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] I agree with the trial judge's reasoning and conclusion on this issue. 
  Importantly, the appellants' attempt to define speed in terms of less than 10 
  minutes is, in my view, almost completely undermined by the fact that at the 
  trial, counsel (not appeal counsel) chose not to attack in any way Dr. Handysides' 
  conduct during the final nine minutes of the emergency. As the trial judge noted, 
  &quot;there was no criticism by the plaintiffs' experts of events after entry 
  into the operating room - that is, the five minutes for the anesthetic (from 
  17:15 to 17:20) and the four minutes from incision to delivery&quot;. Indeed, 
  not only was there no criticism of the doctors' conduct during these nine minutes; 
  rather, Dr. Manning and Dr. Bernstein were highly complimentary on the doctors' 
  performance, with Dr. Bernstein going as far as to say that Dr. Handysides &quot;gets 
  a medal for that&quot; - the c?section and delivery of the baby in four minutes.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] In my view, the appellants' argument that delivery of the baby should 
  have taken place within 10 minutes of the declaration of a dire emergency simply 
  dissolves in light of their acknowledgement at trial that the final nine minutes 
  of the delivery procedure were well?handled. It would be impossible for the 
  doctors to perform the other steps in less than one minute. Moreover, the trial 
  judge carefully considered those other steps - Dr. Handysides checked the baby's 
  fetal heart rate, monitored the results, applied and read a scalp electrode 
  and inserted a catheter in the mother - and found that the time it took Dr. 
  Handysides to perform them, plus the one minute to transfer the mother to the 
  operating room, were as expeditious as possible. Indeed, with respect to these 
  steps, Dr. Manning made no criticism of Dr. Handysides and Dr. Bernstein criticized 
  only Dr. Handysides' decision to use a scalp electrode (a step which was supported 
  by Dr. Manning and Dr. Barrett).<br>
</p>
<p>[28] In the end, the trial judge found as a fact that the time between the 
  removal of the forceps and the delivery of the baby was about 17 minutes. The 
  time from declaration of emergency to delivery was about 13 - 14 minutes (not 
  18&frac12; minutes as asserted by the appellants). Based on my review of the 
  record, I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's findings on these 
  crucial matters. Indeed, they seem entirely correct, as does her legal conclusion 
  that Dr. Handysides' conduct during this time frame complied with the standard 
  of care &quot;to move as expeditiously as possible to deliver the baby&quot;. 
  In any event, even if I had some concern about the trial judge's factual findings 
  and legal conclusions (which I do not), in a long and complex negligence case
