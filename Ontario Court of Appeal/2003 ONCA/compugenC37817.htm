<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 25, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 366.</p>

<p>
  CARTHY J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The background facts in this action were neatly outlined by the trial judge 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> [1] The plaintiff, Compugen Systems Ltd., (&quot;Compugen&quot;) 
  is a value-added reseller of information technology engaged in the business 
  of supplying computer products and services to private and public sector customers 
  throughout Canada. The defendant, MFP Technology Services Ltd., now MFP Financial 
  Services Ltd., (&quot;MFP&quot;), was both a value-added reseller of computer 
  products and services and a provider of lease financing for both computer products 
  and services and other equipment to private and public sector customers throughout 
  Canada. In 1996, MFP determined to wind down certain of its businesses including 
  the supply of computer products and services and concentrate on its core business 
  of lease financing. At this time and since July, 1994, MFP had had a vendor 
  of record agreement (the &quot;MBS Agreement&quot;) with the Management Board 
  Secretariat of the Government of Ontario (&quot;MBS&quot;) for the supply of 
  personal computers and related services and lease financing to the government. 
  Any ministry, agency, municipality or other provincial government entity could 
  acquire and lease computer products and services from MFP through the MBS Agreement. 
  MFP also had at this time separate vendor of record agreements with the Ministry 
  of the Solicitor General and Correctional Services (&quot;SolGen&quot;) for 
  the supply of services dated January 9, 1996 as amended (the &quot;SolGen Supply 
  Agreement&quot;) and for lease financing dated March 1, 1993 (the &quot;SolGen 
  Leasing Agreement&quot;).</p>
<p class="indent">[2] After having decided to get out of the computer products 
  and services supply business in late 1995, MFP began to look for a business 
  partner to fulfill the supply of computer products and related services to MFP's 
  customers. MFP determined to look for a business partner which was not involved 
  in the leasing business and Compugen was selected. MFP approached Compugen in 
  late February or early March, 1996 to discuss the proposed partnership. Following 
  meetings between the parties in March, 1996, a letter of intent was executed 
  by the parties on March 26, 1996. A formal agreement was then negotiated, drafted 
  and executed by the parties on April 15 and 16, 1996 (the &quot;Main Agreement&quot;).</p>
<p class="indent">[3] The term of the Main Agreement was 18 months from April 
  15, 1996 to October 15, 1997. During the term of the Main Agreement relations 
  between Compugen and MFP deteriorated. Compugen alleged that MFP was in breach 
  of the Main Agreement and it was not renewed on its termination date.</p>
<p>
  [2] After an 18-day trial, Ground J. delivered extensive reasons in which he 
  found that the Main Agreement should be interpreted as appointing Compugen as 
  the sole and exclusive supplier of equipment and related services to all of 
  MFP's Ontario public sector clients (&quot;OPS&quot;), except where the client 
  dealt directly with a third party supplier, or where the client specifically 
  directed MFP to obtain supply of equipment or services from a third party. He 
  also found that MFP had an obligation to use its best efforts to ensure that 
  OPS clients respected this arrangement. The trial judge further found that MFP 
  sourced substantial equipment and services elsewhere on behalf of OPS clients 
  during the currency of the agreement, and that MFP had breached its agreement 
  with respect to some of that business with consequent loss of profits to Compugen 
  assessed at $4,999,180.00 plus prejudgment interest. That judgment is appealed 
  by MFP. Compugen cross-appeals, seeking to increase the damages by $1,000,000.00.</p>
<p>
  [3] It is my conclusion that both the appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed. 
  The trial judge's factual findings are all supported by the evidence and I am 
  in agreement with each of his legal conclusions. Because his reasons are so 
  comprehensive, it is my intention to do no more than comment by way of overview 
  on the major arguments presented on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] The major thrust of the appeal was the argument that the trial judge erred 
  in failing to find an implied term in the Main Agreement that the obligations 
  of the parties were subject to obtaining the consent of the OPS customers to 
  the sub-contract with Compugen for the supply of equipment and services. The 
  trial judge found no basis in the evidence for implying such a term and I cannot 
  identify any. To the contrary, business efficacy and common sense were best 
  served by giving full meaning to the phrase &quot;sole and exclusive supplier&quot; 
  in the agreement, and to the warranty by the appellant that the Main Agreement 
  did not conflict with any contract binding on the appellant. It would be inconsistent 
  to then engraft a term requiring a formal consent of a customer as a precondition 
  of liability.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant then argues that, even if there is no implied term as to consent, 
  there was no breach concerning the Community and Social Services (ComSoc) supply 
  contract because there was evidence that the customer had rejected the respondent 
  as a supplier. However, there was other evidence that the trial judge was entitled 
  to, and did, accept to the effect that ComSoc was indifferent to the source 
  of the equipment. Moreover, the trial judge found that the appellant breached 
  the agreement by failing to use its best efforts to ensure that the respondent 
  was the supplier to ComSoc.</p>
<p>
  [6] On the issue of damages, the appellant argues that Ground J. should not 
  have refused to hear the evidence of Roger Hall, who was put forward by the 
  appellant to speak to gross and net margins that may have been realized by Compugen 
  on the lost sales. Hall was a former employee of G.E. Capital Information Technology 
  Solutions; he intended to address G.E. Capital's experience in those respects. 
  The trial judge ruled the evidence inadmissible on the ground that direct evidence 
  of Compugen's margins was available, and that it would not be helpful to know 
  the experience of another company of no proven similarity to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [7] Another judge might have admitted the evidence and then assessed the weight, 
  but this was not an exercise of discretion that could justify interference on 
  appeal. The trial judge had before him two expert witnesses on the damages issue. 
  It is hard to imagine that Hall's evidence would have had any impact standing 
  against the evidence of two professionals who analyzed the respondent's own 
  experience.</p>
<p>
  [8] The cross-appeal concerns the following finding of the trial judge regarding 
  the assessment of damages:</p>
<p class="indent"> [56] In general, I prefer the analysis done by Martin with 
  respect to incremental expenses. The analysis is based on a detailed review 
  of Compugen's historic overhead costs and a per unit analysis of Compugen's 
  capability to manage the additional sales with existing staff and resources 
  as opposed to Lowe's almost straight line mathematical calculation of increased 
  expenses based upon increased sales. It does seem to me, however, that an increase 
  in sales of approximately $68,000,000 would have necessitated some overall increase 
  in overhead expenses and I would add to the calculation of incremental expenses 
  determined by Martin, an arbitrary figure of an additional $1,000,000 for overall 
  increases in overhead expenses.</p>
<p>
  [9] MFP argues that Martin's evidence to the effect that there would be no incremental 
  overhead expenses should not have been discarded in favour of the trial judge's 
  admittedly arbitrary allowance.</p>
<p>
  [10] As I see it, the trial judge was being arbitrary only in the sense that 
  any judge must be when a conclusion is reached that damage has occurred but 
  the precise amount cannot be extracted from the evidence. Ground J. apparently 
  had reservations as to one aspect of Martin's evidence, but was not prepared 
  to accept the opinion of Lowe on the subject of incremental costs. He obviously 
  considered Martin to be overly optimistic and modified his opinion as to those 
  costs by what appears to be a very reasonable amount.</p>
<p>
  [11] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal, both with 
  costs on a partial indemnity basis. Bills of costs have been submitted and, 
  having regard to the relative weight of the appeal and cross-appeal and with 
  some reduction of the amounts claimed, I would award Compugen a total amount 
  of $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
