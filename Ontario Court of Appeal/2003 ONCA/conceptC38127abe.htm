<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] After hearing argument it is clear to us that there is a factual dispute 
  as to the scope of the guarantee, and an insufficient factual basis in the record 
  to determine the damages if any that would flow from a breach of that guarantee. 
  These issues could not properly have been determined on an application under 
  Rule 14.</p>
<p>[2] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below in its 
  entirety and direct the trial of an issue on the alleged breach of the guarantee 
  and the resulting damages. We would award costs below to the respondent of $16,000 
  and, given the appellant's less than full success on the appeal, costs in this 
  court to the appellant of $6,000 both inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
