<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In our view, the trial judge's finding of fact and the legal conclusions 
  he reached based on those findings are, with respect, inconsistent. In particular, 
  he concluded, as he was entitled to do based on the evidence introduced during 
  2 days of trial, that Continental did not complete the work on Jobs 467, 468 
  and 470 in a timely way. This amounted to a finding that Continental breached 
  the contract, which in turn entitles McBride to damages for that breach, subject 
  to its duty to mitigate. Moreover, based on the evidence, the trial judge erred 
  in concluding that McBride was not entitled to be compensated for the purchase 
  of three new tools. </p>
<p>
  [2] The damages to McBride properly include, therefore, $311,905.00 for the 
  cost of the new tools, and 85% of the total costs of $34,678.00 for the laser 
  cut parts for Jobs 467 and 468 and 82% of Job 470. We see no basis for interfering 
  with the award to Continental of compression costs. </p>
<p> [3] The appeal is allowed, and the trial judge's order varied in accordance 
  with these reasons. Costs of the appeal to the appellant in the total amount 
  of $15,000. No costs of the trial.</p>
