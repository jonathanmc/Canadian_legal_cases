<p>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (James D. Carnwath, Ellen 
  M. Macdonald and George Czutrin JJ.) dated November 27, 2002, setting aside 
  the order of Justice Sherill M. Rogers of May 16, 2001.</p>
<p>WEILER AND ROSENBERG JJ.A.: </p>
<p> [1] This appeal concerns the interpretation of the shared custody provision 
  in s. 9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines S.O.R./97-175, as am. (&quot;Guidelines&quot;). 
  The appellant father applied to reduce the child support that he must pay for 
  the support of his son because the amount of time that the son was in his physical 
  custody had increased to 50 per cent of the time. The motion judge, Rogers J., 
  granted the motion and reduced the amount of monthly child support that the 
  father had been paying, based on the Guidelines' Table amount, of over $550 
  to $100, retroactive to September 2000. She applied a mathematical formula similar 
  to the formula found in s. 8 of the Guidelines for split custody and essentially 
  set-off the father's and mother's Table amounts. She then required the father 
  to pay the difference, with a very minor adjustment.</p>
<p> [2] On appeal by the mother, the Divisional Court, in reasons reported at 
  (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 295, overturned the decision of the motion judge and ordered 
  the father to pay the monthly Table amount, which it found to be $688, commencing 
  September 1, 2000 and further ordered that his support obligation be increased 
  or decreased annually in accordance with the Guideline amount reflected by his 
  annual income. The Court relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Francis v. Baker, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 250, 50 R.F.L. (4th) 228 in holding that 
  there is a presumption that the Table amount is in the best interests of the 
  child. Unless the father could adduce clear and convincing evidence to rebut 
  the presumption, he would be obliged to pay the Table amount as required by 
  s. 3 of the Guidelines. The Divisional Court found that the father had not done 
  so and therefore allowed the appeal and ordered the father to pay the Table 
  amount.</p>
<p> [3] The father now appeals to this court. In our view, the Divisional Court 
  erred in its interpretation of s. 9 of the Guidelines. Once the applicant parent 
  has shown that the shared custody threshold set out in s. 9 has been reached 
  because the parent exercises a right of access to, or has physical custody of, 
  a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time, the court is obligated to 
  apply that section. The presumption that the Table amount under s. 3 should 
  be paid by one spouse to another for the support of the child no longer applies 
  because s. 9 provides otherwise. The Table amount for both spouses is to be 
  taken into account under s. 9(a) in addition to the factors in ss. 9(b) and 
  (c). </p>
<p> [4] We are also of the view that the motion judge erred in applying a strict 
  formulaic approach to s. 9, which is inconsistent with the wording of this provision.</p>
<p> [5] This appeal thus requires the court to determine the proper approach to 
  awarding child support in custody situations falling within s. 9. Courts have 
  tended to use two different approaches to the assessment of support under s. 
  9 of the Guidelines. One approach, similar to the approach used by the motion 
  judge, can be described as a &quot;formulaic approach&quot;. Under this approach, 
  generally the Table amounts are set-off as if the case were one of split custody 
  and the parent with the greater income is required to pay the difference. <a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> 
  Sometimes the judge will pro-rate the amount to account for the amount of time 
  the child spends with each parent. Often, this formula is adjusted by use of 
  a multiplier to take into account the increased costs to both parents of the 
  shared custody arrangement.<a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> In our view, 
  this approach, while providing greater predictability, is inconsistent with 
  the wording of s. 9, which requires the court to take into account not only 
  the Table amounts and the increased costs of shared custody but also &quot;the 
  conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child 
  for whom support is sought&quot;.</p>
<p> [6] The other approach, which may be described as a &quot;discretionary approach&quot;, 
  eschews the use of formulae. That approach, while truer to the wording of s. 
  9, suffers from a lack of predictability and objectivity, two of the key objectives 
  of the Guidelines. An important example of this more discretionary approach 
  is Green v. Green (2000), 75 B.C.L.R. (3d) 306, 6 R.F.L. (5th) 197 (C.A.), to 
  which we will make greater reference below.<a name="r3"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a> 
</p>
<p> [7] For the reasons that follow, we generally prefer the more discretionary 
  approach. We are, however, of the view that it is possible to structure that 
  discretion to provide some predictability and objectivity and that formulae, 
  when used in appropriate cases, can assist the court in achieving a result that 
  is fair and in the best interests of the child.</p>
<p> [8] We are concerned about the lack of information presented to the motion 
  judge about the increased costs of shared custody and the conditions, means, 
  needs and other circumstances of the parents and children. This is an issue 
  that has plagued the s. 9 cases. In the absence of sufficient evidence on those 
  circumstances, the courts have tended to fall back on a straight set-off formula. 
  The decision in Slade v. Slade (2001), 197 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 4, 13 R.F.L. 
  (5th) 187 (Nfld. C.A.) is an example. </p>
<p> [9] In this case, the evidence presented to the motion judge was not as detailed 
  as it could or should have been. We are nevertheless of the view that it is 
  inappropriate to simply resort to a strict formulaic approach in such cases. 
  We are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence in the record from which 
  this court can determine the appropriate child support amount under s. 9 for 
  2001. The parties did not present any further or updated information to this 
  court from which we could make a determination of the appropriate amount of 
  child support for 2002 or the current year. We believe that the parties ought 
  to be able to settle on an appropriate amount for those years based on these 
  reasons. If not, we would permit them to make brief written submissions following 
  the release of these reasons.</p>
<p> [10] For reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and decrease the monthly 
  amount of child support that the Divisional Court ordered the father to pay 
  to $399.61 as of June 2001.</p>
<p> THE FACTS</p>
<p> [11] The parties were married on October 30, 1982. For convenience, we will 
  refer to the appellant as the father and the respondent as the mother. They 
  have one child, Christopher, born on March 26, 1986, who is now 17 years of 
  age. The parties separated in January 1989 and entered into a separation agreement 
  dated May 25, 1992. They were divorced on January 7, 1993. We were advised at 
  the hearing of the appeal that the father has since remarried. As indicated, 
  however, we have no current information about the financial circumstances of 
  the parties. </p>
<p> [12] The separation agreement provided that the father and mother were to 
  have joint custody of Christopher but that he would reside with the mother on 
  a daily basis. The father was to have free and liberal access to Christopher. 
  If either party was unhappy with the custody and access arrangements, they could 
  require that the terms be reviewed and varied. If the parties could not agree, 
  then &quot;either party may commence court action in the appropriate court for 
  a variation of the terms based upon the facts as if this agreement had not been 
  made and not solely based upon a material change in circumstances.&quot; The 
  agreement further provided that commencing on June 1, 1992, the father was to 
  pay the mother $500 child support, subject to annual cost of living increases, 
  to continue until certain events occur, none of which are relevant to this appeal. 
  The parties waived any right to spousal support. The mother also waived any 
  right to an interest in four named companies in exchange for the father saving 
  her harmless from any debts of these companies.<a name="r4"></a><a href="#4">[4]</a> 
</p>
<p> [13] No annual cost of living increases were in fact ever paid by the father. 
  In 1998, the mother brought an application to vary the amount of the child support. 
  By minutes of settlement dated July 20, 1998, the father agreed to pay the monthly 
  sum of $563 in accordance with the Guidelines, based on the father having an 
  income of $68,712. The quantum of child support was to be adjusted annually 
  in accordance with the Guidelines. Despite this term of the agreement, child 
  support was not adjusted even though the father's taxable income for 1999 was 
  $83,527.58. The parties further agreed to share equally in the cost of Christopher's 
  orthodontic expenses, even though the mother's income of $53,292 was less than 
  the father's.</p>
<p> [14] In March 2001, the father brought an application to vary the child support 
  because Christopher was spending more time with him. In his affidavit in support 
  of the application, the father stated that he has no other dependents, that 
  Christopher was spending 50 per cent of the time with him and that he provided 
  Christopher &quot;with his own bedroom on a full-time basis, and all of the 
  costs pertaining to him while he is residing with the applicant.&quot; The father 
  stated that in September 2000, he asked the mother to agree to vary the child 
  support but she refused. </p>
<p> [15] The mother did not retain counsel on the application. In her affidavit, 
  she explained that in 2000 she began taking a course on Tuesday nights and asked 
  the father if he would switch days so that Christopher would be with him on 
  Tuesday rather than Thursday. The father instead said he would take Christopher 
  both days for the duration of the course. He made no mention that he would seek 
  any adjustment to the child support. The mother also notes in her affidavit 
  that the child support had not been adjusted annually in accordance with the 
  Guidelines, as they had agreed in the 1998 minutes of settlement.</p>
<p> [16] On the application, the parties filed their respective financial statements 
  and 1998, 1999 and 2000 tax returns. In Part 7 of the financial statements, 
  &quot;Expenses of the Child(ren)&quot;, the parties purport to set out the expenses 
  attributable to Christopher. Both parties attribute 50 per cent of their fixed 
  and variable costs such as the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance and groceries 
  to Christopher. In addition, the mother states that she spends a total of $275 
  monthly on things such as clothing and school fees and activities solely for 
  Christopher. The father states that he spends a total of $120 on items solely 
  for Christopher. The mother also invests $153.84 monthly in an RESP for Christopher's 
  benefit.</p>
<p> SECTION 9 OF THE GUIDELINES</p>
<p> [17] We have set out the applicable legislation in greater detail in the Appendix. 
  However, for convenience, we set out s. 9 of the Guidelines, which was the basis 
  for the father's application: </p>
<p class="indent"> 9. Where a spouse exercises a right of access to, or has physical 
  custody of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course 
  of a year, the amount of the child support must be determined by taking into 
  account</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of 
  the spouses;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of 
  each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.</p>
<p> THE HEARING BEFORE ROGERS J.</p>
<p> [18] The May 16, 2001 proceedings before the motion judge were transcribed 
  and the appellant has provided the court with a copy of the transcript. This 
  transcript was not available to the Divisional Court. The mother was not represented 
  by counsel at this hearing. Counsel for the father told the motion judge that 
  two weeks earlier, Goodman J. held a pre-hearing conference and endorsed on 
  the record that the mother conceded that the son would live with the father 
  50 per cent of the time. Thus, the temporary arrangement while the mother was 
  taking the course, which had begun in February 2000, had become permanent. The 
  motion was therefore limited to setting the amount of child support under the 
  Guidelines. The father claimed the amount should be set in accordance with s. 
  9 of the Guidelines.</p>
<p> [19] The mother's 1999 tax return showed that her income was $73,009.33. Her 
  year 2000 tax return showed her income was $105,199.26, however, over $44,000 
  of that was from cashing in her RRSP<a name="r5"></a><a href="#5">[5]</a> , 
  leaving approximately $61,000 in employment and other income. The motion judge 
  assessed the mother's income at $68,000 not $61,000 because she included a bonus 
  paid to her in January 2001.</p>
<p> [20] At the hearing, the father's counsel produced the father's 2000 income 
  tax return. It showed his income was $87,315.26. This was the first time that 
  the mother had seen the 2000 return. When she attempted to question some of 
  the items in the return, the motion judge said the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Court: Well you may wish to critique it, generally speaking, 
  at some other time but I think you would probably want to use the larger number 
  for today's purposes. Maybe there's something else that you need to talk to 
  Mr. Cooper [the father's counsel] about. So, I think it's on consent I receive 
  that sir. May I have it?</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Contino: Yes [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [21] Although it appears the father was also eligible for a bonus to be paid 
  in 2001, the motion judge did not include that bonus in assessing his income.</p>
<p> [22] Based on the father's income of $87,315, the motion judge found that 
  the Table amount of support he would pay to the mother was $688 a month. Having 
  found the mother's income to be $68,000, the Table amount was $560 if the mother 
  were paying child support to the father.</p>
<p> [23] Counsel for the father suggested that the motion judge set-off the two 
  amounts ($128), pro-rate the amount to account for the fact that the child spends 
  50 per cent of the time with each parent ($64) and then add a 50 per cent multiplier 
  ($32) to account for the additional costs of the child living in two homes. 
  Thus, he submitted that his client should pay $96 in child support. He also 
  asked that the adjustment be retroactive and suggested that it be retroactive 
  to February 2000 when the 50 per cent arrangement took effect, or to September 
  2000 when the father first asked the mother to vary the child support.</p>
<p> [24] The mother told the motion judge that in November she moved to Woodbridge 
  because it was in the child's best interests, even though it caused her great 
  financial hardship and that she had relied on the child support to make these 
  new arrangements.<a name="r6"></a><a href="#6">[6]</a> At this point, counsel 
  for the father intervened and submitted that the mother's submissions should 
  be confined to the record. The motion judge accepted this and told the mother 
  to confine her comments to the materials that were already filed: </p>
<p class="indent"> I can only hear about what's already in the materials. So go 
  from what the evidence is that you've introduced and you may wish to tell me 
  how that relates to this but essentially there's been a finding that there's 
  a fifty per cent regime here. We're just doing math today. Okay? [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [25] The mother then told the motion judge that even though she was earning 
  less than the father, she always paid half of the child's extraordinary expenses 
  such as orthodontics in accordance with the separation agreement. The mother 
  also pointed out that s. 9 of the Guidelines requires the court to take into 
  account the assets and means of the parties.</p>
<p> [26] The motion judge gave very brief reasons. She found that there was now 
  a shared custody regime and &quot;there is going to be a reduction from the 
  Guideline amount&quot;. She stated that she had &quot;gone through the math&quot; 
  with the father's counsel and this produced a number of $96. She decided to 
  pick a slightly different number for &quot;ease of the calculation&quot; and 
  because the mother was paying 50 per cent of the special expenses although her 
  income was lower. She therefore set the amount of child support at $100 a month 
  and ordered that this adjustment be retroactive to September 2000. The father 
  was entitled to deduct $50 a month to account for his overpayment until it is 
  retired. The motion judge ordered the mother to pay the father's costs in the 
  amount of $3,800. A portion of the costs award took into account that the father 
  had made an offer to settle that was higher than the judgment.</p>
<p> THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
<p> [27] The mother appealed the judgment to the Divisional Court. She had by 
  now retained counsel. The Divisional Court identified several errors in the 
  reasons of the motion judge. First, the court found that the judge had erred 
  in not making a finding as to income as required by s. 13 of the Guidelines. 
  Section 13(b) of the Guidelines states that a child support order must contain 
  &quot;the income of any spouse whose income is used to determine the amount 
  of the child support order&quot;. However, as noted by the Newfoundland Court 
  of Appeal in Lee v. Lee (1998), 167 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 176, 43 R.F.L. (4th) 
  339, an order lacking this information will not necessarily be void: &quot;Where 
  an error or slip occurs in the drawing up of a formal order, the court retains 
  jurisdiction to correct that error&quot;. While the Divisional Court was correct 
  in stating that no income finding was contained in the order, the transcript 
  of the proceedings shows that the motion judge made a finding as to the income 
  of both parties. As we have noted, the Divisional Court did not have the benefit 
  of the transcript of the proceedings before the motion judge.</p>
<p> [28] The Divisional Court also found that there was no evidence regarding 
  the factors set out in ss. 9(b) and (c) of the Guidelines and no analysis of 
  those factors. The court expressed the view that the more important issue was 
  the procedure to be followed in applying s. 9. It held that this procedure is 
  set out in Francis v. Baker, supra, a case decided under s. 4 of the Guidelines. 
  The court held as follows at paras. 16 and 17: </p>
<p class="indent"> In considering an application for deviation under any statutory 
  exception a court must first: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) make a presumption in favour of the Guidelines amount;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) impose an onus on the party seeking a deviation to establish 
  on &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot; that the deviation is in the child's 
  best interest;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) consider all the statutory factors noted in the section 
  establishing a permitted deviation without providing pre-eminence to any factor;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) deny any application for a deviation based merely upon invocation 
  of the discretionary provision;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) focus on the child's actual circumstances and not perceived 
  parental fairness considerations, such as balancing of parental means.</p>
<p class="indent">To hold otherwise would lead to an inconsistent application 
  of discretionary principles to the permitted deviations. As an example, it would 
  result in a presumption in favour of the Guidelines amount when considering 
  s. 4, as in Francis v. Baker, but no such presumption when considering a payor 
  standing in the place of a parent as in s. 5. We find nothing in Francis v. 
  Baker nor in the statutory scheme of the Guidelines that supports such an inconsistent 
  approach.</p>
<p> [29] The court then set out a three-step analysis to be followed where a party 
  seeks to apply &quot;to deviate from the Guidelines amount&quot; (at para. 18): 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the Court must first determine whether the applicant exercises 
  a right of access to or has physical custody of a child for no less than 40 
  per cent of the time over the course of a year. The onus is on the applicant;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) if the 40 per cent test is met, the court must then find 
  that the presumption in favour of the Guidelines amount has been rebutted. In 
  order to so find, the court must find the applicant has discharged the onus 
  of establishing on &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot; that the decision 
  is in the child's interest. There is no right of deviation merely upon invocation 
  of the discretionary provision of s. 9. The court must consider all the statutory 
  factors without providing pre-eminence to any factor. The focus of determination 
  must be the child's actual circumstances, not perceived parental fairness consideration, 
  such as balancing parental means;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) if the court finds in accordance with (b) above that the 
  applicant has rebutted the presumption of the Guidelines amount, then and only 
  then does the court consider ss. 9(a), (b) and (c) in the exercise of its discretion 
  to deviate from the Guidelines [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [30] The court held that the motion judge was clearly wrong in not carrying 
  out the second step of this analysis and that given the absence of evidence 
  needed to conduct a proper s. 9 analysis, the judge was wrong to depart from 
  the Guidelines amount. The court held that there was no clear and compelling 
  evidence that the deviation was in the child's interest. The court therefore 
  allowed the appeal, restored the 1998 order and, taking into account the father's 
  increased income, increased the child support to $688 per month retroactive 
  to September 2000. The court ordered the father to retire the resulting arrears 
  at a rate of $350 per month. Costs were awarded to the mother fixed at $5,000.</p>
<p> ANALYSIS</p>
<p> The Legislative Scheme Generally</p>
<p> [31] The overall scheme of the legislation is important to an appreciation 
  and interpretation of s. 9 of the Guidelines. Section 15.1(3) of the Divorce 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2nd Supp.) requires that support orders be made in accordance 
  with the Guidelines. The Guidelines are based on the principle contained in 
  s. 26.1 of the Act, &quot;&#133;that spouses have a joint financial obligation 
  to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities 
  to contribute to the performance of that obligation.&quot; Section 3 of the 
  Guidelines creates a presumption that the amount of a child support order is 
  the amount set out in the applicable table plus the amount, if any, for special 
  or extraordinary expenses under s. 7, &quot;unless otherwise provided under 
  these Guidelines&quot;. The Guidelines identify five circumstances where the 
  court has discretion to award an amount other than the amount determined under 
  s. 3. They are: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) where the child is over the age of majority and the court 
  considers the amount determined by applying these Guidelines as if the child 
  were under the age of majority to be inappropriate, the court may award the 
  amount it considers appropriate (s. 3(2)); </p>
<p class="indent">2) if the payor's income is over $150,000 per annum and the 
  court considers the amount determined under s. 3 to be inappropriate (s. 4); 
</p>
<p class="indent">3) if the payor spouse stands in the place of a parent the court 
  may order such amount as it considers appropriate, having regard to the Guidelines 
  and any other parent's legal duty to support the child (s. 5); </p>
<p class="indent">4) shared custody (s. 9); and</p>
<p class="indent">5) where a child or spouse would otherwise suffer undue hardship 
  from having to pay the amount determined under sections 3 to 5, 8 or 9 a court 
  may award a different amount of child support. (s.10). The circumstances that 
  may cause undue hardship include, but are not limited to, those set out in s. 
  10(2) such as unusually high expenses in relation to exercising access to a 
  child.</p>
<p> [32] We disagree with the Divisional Court's conclusion that a consistent 
  approach to all of these discretionary exceptions to the Guidelines is required. 
  The court concluded that there was a presumption that a payor spouse should 
  continue to pay the Guidelines amount although exercising physical custody of 
  the child for over 40 per cent of the time. It held that to deviate from the 
  Guidelines amount, &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot; was required that 
  such deviation was in the child's interest. This is the language used by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in Francis v. Baker in determining whether the Guidelines 
  amount is &quot;inappropriate&quot; under s. 4, which relates to incomes over 
  $150,000.</p>
<p> [33] In our view, a consistent approach to all of the specified exceptions 
  to the application of the Guidelines ignores the differences in wording contained 
  in these sections. Section 4 states that when a payor spouse has income over 
  $150,000 the amount of a child support order is the amount determined under 
  s. 3. It is only if the court considers this amount to be &quot;inappropriate&quot; 
  that the court exercises its discretion to award a different amount of support. 
  In giving content and meaning to the word &quot;inappropriate&quot;, the Supreme 
  Court placed an onus on the party seeking a departure from the s. 3 amount to 
  establish on &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot; that such a departure 
  is warranted.</p>
<p> [34] Section 3(2) pertaining to children over the age of majority uses language 
  similar to s. 4. It prescribes that the amount of support is the amount determined 
  under s. 3(1) unless &quot;the court considers that approach to be inappropriate.&quot; 
  By contrast, pursuant to s. 5, a spouse who stands in the place of a parent 
  will simply be ordered to pay &quot;such amount as the court considers appropriate 
  having regard to these Guidelines.&quot; The court is to also have regard to 
  any other parent's legal duty to support the child.</p>
<p> [35] The wording of s. 9 does not start with a presumption that the amount 
  determined under s. 3 is to be paid by the person seeking an order under s. 
  9; it instead states that the amount in the tables is to be taken into account. 
  Nowhere in s. 9 is the word &quot;inappropriate&quot; to be found, such as would 
  signal an onus on a payor spouse to establish that a departure from the amount 
  determined under s. 3 is warranted. The Divisional Court erred in ignoring these 
  significant differences in wording in the various sections. The Divisional Court's 
  analysis of s. 9 introduces a presumption not called for by the language of 
  the section and one that is contrary to the plain wording of the provision and 
  to principles of statutory interpretation.</p>
<p> [36] In seeking to uphold the decision of the Divisional Court, counsel for 
  the mother relied in particular on a portion of para. 42 of the reasons of Bastarache 
  J. in Francis v. Baker: </p>
<p class="indent"> For that portion of the paying parent's income over $150,000, 
  the strict Guidelines amount is immediately open to review; under s. 4(b)(ii) 
  any amount attributable to income above the $150,000 threshold can be reduced 
  or increased by a court if it is of the opinion that the amount is inappropriate 
  having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the 
  children, and the financial abilities of the spouses. Nevertheless, based on 
  the ordinary meaning of the provision, its context in the overall child support 
  scheme, and the purposes of the Guidelines, I find that in all cases Parliament 
  intended that there be a presumption in favour of the Table amounts. I agree 
  with Abella J.A. that the words &quot;Presumptive Rule&quot; found in the marginal 
  note beside s. 3 of the Guidelines are relevant in this regard. Accordingly, 
  the Guideline figures can only be increased or reduced under s. 4 if the party 
  seeking such a deviation has rebutted the presumption that the applicable Table 
  amount is appropriate [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [37] The passage quoted above cannot be taken out of context. The words &quot;in 
  all cases&quot; refer to all cases to which s. 3 applies. Section 3 itself recognizes 
  that the calculation under that provision will not apply where &quot;otherwise 
  provided under these Guidelines.&quot; Section 9 sets out a different regime 
  that falls within this &quot;unless otherwise provided&quot; exception. </p>
<p> [38] Subsection 9(a) requires that in cases of shared custody the court must 
  determine the amount of the child support order by taking into account the incomes 
  of both parents; in the words of the section, &quot;the amounts set out in the 
  applicable tables for each of the spouses.&quot; Thus, in our view, the presumption 
  set out in s. 3, which the court in Francis v. Baker found applied to s. 4, 
  has no application to s. 9. Unlike s. 9, s. 4 makes express reference to s. 
  3 and requires the court to apply that provision unless this would produce an 
  inappropriate order. In the context of s. 4, a presumption in favour of the 
  s. 3 approach is consistent with the wording of the statute. Requiring the s. 
  4 payor spouse to show that such an amount is inappropriate by clear and convincing 
  evidence is consistent with the overall objectives of the Guidelines, which 
  the Francis v. Baker court described at para. 39 as &quot;to establish fair 
  levels of support for children from both parents upon marriage breakdown, in 
  a predictable and consistent manner&quot; and to ensure &quot;that a divorce 
  will affect the children as little as possible.&quot; </p>
<p> [39] Section 9 must be interpreted with those objectives in mind, but regard 
  must also be had to the wording of that section, which is quite different from 
  s. 4. In Francis v. Baker at para. 40, the court held that the proper construction 
  of s. 4 requires that the &quot;objectives of predictability, consistency and 
  efficiency on the one hand, be balanced with those of fairness, flexibility 
  and recognition of the actual 'condition, means, needs and other circumstances 
  of the children' on the other&quot;. In considering the interpretation of s. 
  9, the goals of predictability, consistency and efficiency must similarly be 
  balanced with those of fairness, flexibility and recognition of the actual &quot;condition, 
  means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom 
  support is sought&quot; (s. 9(c)). A court must also consider the amounts set 
  out in the tables &quot;for each of the spouses&quot; (s. 9(a)); and &quot;the 
  increased costs of shared custody arrangements&quot; (s. 9(b)) [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [40] It seems to us that the error by the Divisional Court was in treating 
  the s. 3 calculation as the &quot;Guidelines amount&quot;. The court made the 
  same error in saying that &quot;[t]here is no right of deviation merely upon 
  invocation of the discretionary provision of s. 9.&quot; To the contrary, where 
  the 40 per cent threshold in s. 9 has been met, that provision establishes the 
  manner of calculating the amount of child support, a calculation quite different 
  from that set out in s. 3 or s. 4. As we read s. 9, especially the use of the 
  phrase &quot;must be determined&quot; in the opening paragraph, deviation from 
  the amount determined under s. 3 or s. 4 is required and the court must follow 
  the process set out in s. 9. We appreciate that this results in more uncertainty 
  and introduces more subjectivity in the calculation of child support orders, 
  but that is an inevitable consequence of the wording of s. 9.</p>
<p> [41] In her submissions, counsel for the mother attempted to support the decision 
  of the Divisional Court by reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in Metzner v. Metzner, [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 481. This was a decision on 
  an application for leave to appeal remanding the case to the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal. The reasons of the leave panel, L'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, Gonthier 
  and Bastarache JJ., are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Court of Appeal having rendered its decision on the basis 
  of the impact on custodial arrangements occasioned by the application of the 
  Federal Child Support Guidelines, and under s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act, without 
  the benefit of the judgment of this Court in Francis v. Baker, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 
  250, which provides for support corresponding to the actual living conditions 
  of the children, the matter is remanded to the Court of Appeal to be disposed 
  of in accordance with the decision in Francis v. Baker.</p>
<p> [42] The original decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal is reported 
  at (1999), 69 B.C.L.R. (3d) 39, 175 D.L.R. (4th) 587. The reasons of the majority, 
  Hollinrake J.A. (Southin J.A. concurring), made no mention of s. 9 and turned 
  instead on s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act, which explains the reference to that 
  subsection in the remand order. That subsection provides that the court in making 
  a variation order, may award an amount that is different from the amount that 
  would be determined in accordance with the Guidelines if special provision has 
  been made in an order, judgment or written agreement respecting financial obligations 
  of the spouses or division of property that benefits the child, and the application 
  of the Guidelines would result in an amount of child support that is inequitable 
  given those arrangements. The reference to Francis v. Baker in the Supreme Court's 
  brief endorsement must be read in that light. It cannot be taken as an indication 
  that the court had determined that Francis v. Baker governs the interpretation 
  of s. 9. The only references to s. 9 in the court's reasons are found in the 
  dissenting reasons of Rowles J.A.</p>
<p> [43] We are reinforced in this view by the subsequent decision of the British 
  Columbia Court of Appeal, reported at (2000), 80 B.C.L.R. (3d) 133, 190 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 366, which interprets the remand order of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
  The reasons of the majority, Finch J.A. (Huddart J.A. concurring), turn on the 
  application of s. 4 of the Guidelines (which was the provision in issue in Francis 
  v. Baker) in the context of s. 17(6.2) of the Act. There is no reference at 
  all to s. 9. In fact, it is not entirely clear that this was a s. 9 case. The 
  trial judge had made an unusual custody order giving custody to the father, 
  who was quite wealthy, but providing that the children would have their principal 
  place of residence with the mother. For these reasons, Metzner does not provide 
  support for the result reached by the Divisional Court.</p>
<p> [44] While the Divisional Court erred in interpreting s. 9 as creating a presumption 
  in favour of the Guidelines amount, the motion judge erred in applying what 
  is essentially the set-off approach found in s. 8. The latter section deals 
  with split custody, which occurs where, for example, there are two children 
  of a marriage and each parent has custody of one child. Where there is split 
  custody, the amount of a child support order is the difference between the amount 
  that each spouse would otherwise pay if a child support order were sought from 
  each spouse. This is a formulaic approach. Unlike the other sections referred 
  to above, s. 8 does not grant any discretion to the court. </p>
<p> [45] The formulaic language of set-off in s. 8 is not found in s. 9. The language 
  of s. 9 requires the court to determine child support &quot;by taking into account&quot; 
  the three factors contained therein. This language, and the language of subsection 
  (b) pertaining to increased costs of shared custody and subsection (c), &quot;the 
  conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child 
  for whom support is sought&quot;, suggest an individualized, fact-specific approach 
  to each case. </p>
<p> [46] The straight set-off approach ignores the fact that shared custody may 
  result in overall costs of caring for a child that are greater than the Guidelines 
  amount that an individual parent would otherwise be obligated to pay. It also 
  ignores the spending patterns of the parties for the child. Had the legislators 
  wished to adopt a set-off approach in s. 9 cases, they would have said so.</p>
<p> [47] In this case, after applying a straight set-off approach, the motion 
  judge grossed up the net amount after set-off, such as is done in some United 
  States jurisdictions, by the use of a multiplier. We do not fault the motion 
  judge for using a multiplier for the reasons we give later.</p>
<p> [48] The motion judge's use of a multiplier cannot, however, compensate for 
  her failure to undertake a full analysis under s. 9 of the Guidelines. Her comment, 
  &quot;We're just doing the math today&quot; is indicative of a mechanical approach. 
  Further, as set out above, when the mother, who only received the father's 2000 
  tax return on the day of the hearing on May 18, 2001, indicated that she wished 
  to question some of the father's deductions, the motion judge told her she could 
  do so, &quot;some other time.&quot; There was no other time offered to the mother. 
  When the mother, who was self-represented, attempted to explain that a reduction 
  in child support would result in &quot;great financial hardship&quot; to herself, 
  she was interrupted by the husband's counsel who indicated that this was not 
  in the materials and &quot;&#133;otherwise it's a matter of giving evidence 
  which we are not doing today.&quot; The motion judge did not at that point inquire 
  whether the mother wished to give evidence respecting undue hardship pursuant 
  to s. 10 of the Guidelines, consider whether the mother should be allowed to 
  amend her material to reflect this and adjourn the proceedings or order a trial 
  of this issue. Although the motion judge briefly averted to the subsections 
  of s. 9, her reasoning was conclusory and she did not provide a pathway to her 
  conclusion.</p>
<p> The Application of Section 9</p>
<p> [49] Section 9 requires a two-part determination: first, establishing that 
  the 40 per cent threshold has been met; and second, where it has been met, determining 
  the appropriate amount of support. In this case, as noted above, the mother 
  conceded that this was a regime of shared custody, as the father has the child 
  50 per cent of the time.</p>
<p> [50] With respect to the second part of the determination, as we said in the 
  introduction, courts across the country have struggled to develop an interpretation 
  of s. 9 of the Guidelines that promotes the Guideline objectives of ensuring 
  consistent treatment of spouses and children and reducing conflict by making 
  calculation of child support orders more objective. To that end, most courts 
  have utilized various formulae as a means of bringing some objectivity and consistency 
  to the exercise. The various formulae are reviewed in the case law and the literature. 
  See in particular Carol Rogerson, &quot;Child Support under the Guidelines in 
  Cases of Split and Shared Custody&quot; (1998), 15 Can. J. Fam. L. No. 2, 11. 
  A few courts have rejected any kind of formula in favour of a broad discretionary 
  approach.</p>
<p> [51] The Guideline objectives of establishing a fair standard of support for 
  children and ensuring that children benefit from the financial means of both 
  parents are also essential, and should, along with the other enumerated objectives, 
  guide the exercise of discretion under s. 9. This requires that in making the 
  s. 9 determination, the overall context and well-being of the child or children 
  be considered.</p>
<p> Section 9(a): The Table Amounts</p>
<p> [52] Section 9(a) provides that in determining the amount of the child support 
  order, the court must take into account &quot;the amounts set out in the applicable 
  tables for each of the spouses&quot;. As courts and commentators have noted, 
  this provision is different from the split custody regime under s. 8. In split 
  custody cases, where each parent has one or more of the children, the child 
  support is determined by a rigid formula, subject of course to s. 4 [&quot;incomes 
  over $150,00&quot;], s. 7 [&quot;special expenses&quot;] and s. 10 [&quot;undue 
  hardship&quot;]. Under s. 8, the amount of child support is the difference between 
  the amount that each spouse would otherwise pay if a child support order were 
  made against each of the spouses. </p>
<p> [53] Section 9 only requires the court to take the Table amounts &quot;into 
  account&quot;. Nevertheless, most courts have used a formula that in some way 
  resembles the set-off approach in s. 8. As Prowse J.A. recognized in Green v. 
  Green at para. 34, formulae can be of assistance: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is apparent from a review of the decided cases that the 
  courts have not succeeded in finding a s. 9 formula or formulas which can be 
  applied in an equitable way in all cases. Section 9 is one of the provisions 
  of the Guidelines which appears to recognize, particularly in ss. 9(b) and (c), 
  that the myriad of fact patterns which come before the courts require some room 
  for the exercise of judicial discretion. Discretion is built into the section. 
  This is not to say that formulas cannot be of assistance in applying s. 9, or 
  in testing the result, but only that a particular formula should not be regarded 
  as definitive.</p>
<p> [54] We agree that no formula can be definitive, but a formula that resembles 
  the set-off approach in s. 8 can be useful as a starting point because it brings 
  some consistency and objectivity to the determination. However, the court retains 
  the discretion not to use a formula where it would lead to a result that is 
  inconsistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and contrary to the best 
  interests of the child. As James G. McLeod said in his annotation to Green, 
  &quot;a court should not adopt a simplistic approach to save time if the effect 
  is to provide inadequate support so that a payee parent has insufficient funds 
  to meet a child's needs&quot;: see 2000 Carswell B.C. 1048.</p>
<p> [55] The amount produced by a formula that takes into account the Table amounts 
  of both parents as required by s. 9(a) must then be modified to take into account 
  the factors set out in ss. 9(b) and (c). As Eberhard J. stated at para. 5 in 
  Rosati v. Dellapenta, supra, cited with approval by Prowse J.A. in Green, supra, 
  at para. 24, &quot;Time tells me little about who arranges for the children's 
  material needs.&quot; In order to ensure that the best interests of the children 
  prevail, the section needs to be read as a whole and effect must be given to 
  each of the subsections of s. 9. The objectivity of a formulaic approach is 
  of little value if the best interests of the child in receiving adequate support 
  are not met. </p>
<p> [56] We would also not foreclose the possibility that in a particular case, 
  such as where the expenses of caring for a child are greater than the Table 
  amount for either parent, the only solution is to revert, as suggested by McLeod, 
  to the pre-Guideline approach in Paras v. Paras, [1971] 1 O.R. 130 (C.A.). Under 
  the Paras formula, a court calculates the appropriate quantum of child support 
  by, firstly, arriving at a sum that reflects the total needs of the child. This 
  sum is then divided in proportion to the respective incomes and resources of 
  the parents. At this stage the court could decide what further adjustment is 
  necessary having regard to the costs already assumed by a parent and the increased 
  costs of exercising access. The court could then compare the result with the 
  Table amounts under s. 9(a) for each parent and assess whether the result is 
  a reasonable reflection of what that parent could pay. The resulting amount 
  is derived after taking into account the three factors in s. 9 as a whole as 
  opposed to considering them as separate watertight compartments.</p>
<p> [57] However, in most cases and particularly in a case such as this where 
  there is limited information and the incomes of the parties are not widely divergent, 
  we think a formula based on the Table amounts is the most appropriate starting 
  point. In adopting this approach, we are conscious of the important policy concerns 
  raised by Rogerson, supra, at pp. 20-22 and others. In particular, we are aware 
  that any formula that has the effect of dramatically reducing support can create 
  financial incentives on the part of a custodial parent to limit access, and 
  on the part of the access parent to seek increased time with the child or children 
  solely to reduce the quantum of the child support obligation. The application 
  of any formula should strive to minimize these incentives, which go directly 
  against the best interests of the child and in effect create a phenomenon of 
  trading &quot;dollars for days&quot;. This case is an excellent example of the 
  danger: the mother would have had a strong financial incentive to hire a caregiver 
  once a week for the duration of her evening course rather than seek the assistance 
  of the father, which led to a reduction in the child support from $688 to $100.</p>
<p> [58] An interpretation of s. 9(a) that would aggravate these concerns would 
  be inconsistent with the objectives in s. 1 of the Guidelines. The formulae 
  most susceptible to that criticism are those that produce the so-called &quot;cliff 
  effect&quot; where a modest increase in access results in a dramatic reduction 
  in the amount of support. Examples of such formulae are those that use a pro-rated 
  approach, whereby in addition to applying some form of set-off, the quantum 
  is further reduced to reflect time actually spent in each parent's care. In 
  our view, this is in effect a double penalty and such formulae fail to reflect 
  the reality that many costs associated with having the child in one's care are 
  constant, irrespective of the percentage of time spent with the child. The set-off 
  approach used by the motions judge in this case suffers from this defect.</p>
<p> [59] We can illustrate the problem with examples taken from this case. The 
  Table amount that the mother would receive from the father if the father had 
  access to Christopher 39 per cent of the time is $688. Using a pro-rated formula 
  produces the following result based on the incomes as determined by the motion 
  judge: </p>
<p class="indent"> Father's Table amount $688</p>
<p class="indent">Pro-rated at 50% as father has custody/access for 50% of the 
  time $344</p>
<p class="indent">Mother's Table amount $560</p>
<p class="indent">Pro-rated at 50% as mother has custody/access for 50% of the 
  time $280</p>
<p class="indent">Set-off the two amounts ($344 - $280) $ 64</p>
<p> [60] Thus, because the father now has Christopher for one night more, his 
  child support obligation to the mother has fallen from $688 to $64. As Prowse 
  J.A. points out in Green v. Green at para. 32, the loss of income produced by 
  the cliff effect has a disproportionate impact on the lower income parent. This 
  result is more readily justified where both parents have similar incomes, but 
  even so, there is in our view no sound conceptual reason for the pro-rated approach 
  where the Table amounts have already been set-off.</p>
<p> [61] One solution to reducing the cliff effect was suggested by Speigel J. 
  in Moran v. Cook (2000), 9 R.F.L. (5th) 352 (Ont. S.C.J.). She based the set-off 
  on the greater amount of time that the access parent had the child over and 
  above the 39 per cent cut-off. In that case, because the father had access to 
  the child for 46 per cent of the time, she reduced his child support obligation 
  by 17.5 per cent to take into account that he had the children for 17.5 per 
  cent more than he would have them if he only had them for 39 per cent of the 
  time [(46-39)/(40) = 17.5%]. </p>
<p> [62] The increased amount of time that a child spends with the other parent 
  is a factor to consider under s. 9(c) as part of the condition of the child. 
  Used as the dominant factor, however, this approach does not take into account 
  the mother's Table amount as required by s. 9(a): see Harrison v. Harrison (2001), 
  14 R.F.L. (5th) 321 (Ont. S.C.J.). Taking the mother's Table amount into account 
  in the way that was done in Harrison, since each party has custody of Christopher 
  for 50 per cent of the time, there has been a 28 per cent increase from 39 per 
  cent for the father and a corresponding reduction for the mother. This produces 
  the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Father's obligation: $688 less 28% (i.e. $192.64) $495.36</p>
<p class="indent">Mother's obligation: $560 less 28% (i.e. $156.80) $403.20</p>
<p> [63] The Moran v. Cook approach, modified as was done in Harrison to take 
  into account the Table amounts of both parents, would result in the following 
  calculation: $495.36 - $403.20 = $92.16.</p>
<p> [64] Another approach is simply to set-off the two table amounts as under 
  s. 8 for split custody. In this case, that results in $688 - $560 = $128.</p>
<p> [65] To summarize, the four different formulae produce the following results 
  (rounding off for simplicity) in this case: </p>
<p class="indent"> Pro-rated set off $ 64</p>
<p class="indent">Moran v. Cook approach $495</p>
<p class="indent">Modified Moran v. Cook approach as was done in Harrison v. Harrison 
  $ 92</p>
<p class="indent">Simple set-off (as in s. 8) $128</p>
<p> [66] None of these formulae produce entirely satisfactory results. We have 
  already discussed why we consider the pro-rated set-off to be unsatisfactory. 
  While the Moran v. Cook approach is the most effective at reducing the cliff 
  effect, it does not take into consideration the Table amount for both parents 
  as required by s. 9(a). The modified Moran approach adopted in Harrison is in 
  reality simply a more nuanced method of pro-rating and suffers from the same 
  flaws discussed above in that it also does not reflect the wording of the statute 
  and it gives undue emphasis to s. 9(a). This leaves simple set-off as the basic 
  starting point for the section 9 analysis. </p>
<p> [67] If a formula is used as a starting point, we consider the simple set-off 
  approach to be the starting point that is most faithful to the wording of s. 
  9. This approach takes into account the Table amounts for both parents, and 
  recognizes the importance of the 40 per cent threshold. The simple set-off approach, 
  however, has certain underlying assumptions including the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The Table amount is the maximum that a parent with that 
  income can afford to pay for support (apart from extraordinary expenses);</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The ordinary needs of the child equal the Table amount;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The parents each spend an equal amount for the care of the 
  child; and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The child's needs are reduced by virtue of a shared custody 
  arrangement on a dollar for dollar basis.</p>
<p> [68] Parliament has recognized that these assumptions will not accord with 
  the reality of the situation. The set-off is therefore nothing more than a starting 
  point and has to be revised in accordance with subsections (b) and (c). Put 
  another way, the analysis under s. 9 is incomplete without a full consideration 
  of subsections (b) and (c), and the cliff effect remains unaddressed until they 
  are applied. </p>
<p> Section 9(b): Increased cost of shared custody</p>
<p> General considerations</p>
<p> [69] Subsection 9(b) provides that the court must take into account &quot;the 
  increased costs of shared custody arrangements.&quot; Read in context and in 
  view of the opening words of s. 9, which refer to &quot;a spouse who exercises 
  a right of access to, or has physical custody of&quot; a child, the term &quot;shared 
  custody&quot; must refer not only to the case of actual shared custody, but 
  to cases of increased access that have reached the 40 per cent threshold.</p>
<p> [70] In our view, the provision recognizes that the parent sharing custody 
  or exercising access 40 per cent or more of the time incurs certain expenses 
  for the child. The aim of the subsection is not, however, to compensate that 
  parent for all shared custody or access costs but to recognize that there are 
  increased costs associated with having the child for 40 per cent or more of 
  the time. In addition, the subsection recognizes that greater access is not 
  reflected in a dollar for dollar decrease in the spending of the custodial parent. 
  See Rogerson, supra, at pp. 20-22, Green v. Green, supra, at para. 27, and Slade 
  v. Slade, supra. As Cameron J.A. said in the latter case at para. 17, &quot;In 
  short, as s. 9(b) recognizes, the total cost of raising children in shared custody 
  situations is greater than where there is sole custody.&quot; Each parent must 
  bear some of this burden according to his or her ability.</p>
<p> The use of a multiplier</p>
<p> [71] As we have said, s. 9 recognizes that the custodial parent's costs are 
  not reduced by virtue of a shared custody arrangement on a dollar for dollar 
  basis. Some of a custodial parent's costs are constant irrespective of the residential 
  arrangement. Accommodation is one such constant and constitutes a major component 
  of the parent's costs. As well, of course, the child's needs will not have been 
  reduced by the shared custody arrangement and to the contrary may well have 
  increased. In an attempt to recognize the impact on the custodial parent, some 
  courts have adopted a &quot;multiplier approach&quot; to augment the figure 
  arrived at after a simple set-off. </p>
<p> [72] In the United States, jurisdictions that use a multiplier incorporate 
  it into the relevant legislated child support guidelines and it replaces the 
  need to introduce evidence of the actual increased costs of a shared custody 
  arrangement. See Carol Rogerson, supra, in which Professor Rogerson describes 
  the various multipliers at pp. 75-79. Prowse J.A. in Green v. Green, supra, 
  at para. 35, while recognizing the advantage of a multiplier approach from the 
  point of view of simplicity, was sceptical that our Guidelines justify such 
  an approach. She stated, &quot;I do not interpret our Guidelines, as currently 
  drafted, as justifying such an approach.&quot;</p>
<p> [73] In our opinion, the use of a multiplier recognizes the concerns raised 
  by the commentators and the courts that dollars spent on increased access or 
  shared custody do not necessarily lead to a reduction in expenditure for the 
  custodial parent. The use of a multiplier also furthers two of the objectives 
  of the Guidelines, predictability and consistency, in calculating support. Used 
  with discretion, a multiplier can provide a mechanism for recognizing the relative 
  inflexibility of some of the custodial parent's costs. In the absence of evidence 
  concerning fixed costs of the responding parent, the most common multiplier 
  is 50 per cent, which is applied to the set-off amount. The amount of the multiplier 
  ought, however, to be adjusted depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p> [74] The manner in which s. 9(a) is dealt with has a bearing on the approach 
  used under s. 9(b). The appropriate method of accounting for the increased costs 
  of shared custody arrangements under s. 9(b) is a fact-specific one. After considering 
  the evidence, the increased costs of shared custody may become more apparent. 
  Where they do not, and in the absence of evidence concerning those costs, the 
  Guidelines as currently drafted, while not providing for a multiplier, at least 
  do not prohibit its use and may be a useful tool to recognize the responding 
  parent's fixed costs.</p>
<p> Increased costs of the applicant parent</p>
<p> [75] A particular problem in interpreting s. 9(b) is the extent to which the 
  court may take judicial notice of increased costs. In our view, the provision 
  is worded to permit the court to make the common sense assumption that a parent 
  exercising shared custody or access for 40 per cent or more of the time will 
  have additional costs for such variable items as food, entertainment and transportation. 
  If, however, that parent wants to show that the increased cost of shared custody 
  has resulted in some extra fixed cost expense such as larger living quarters, 
  he or she must adduce evidence to that effect. The judge will then take that 
  into account under subsection (b). Depending on the nature of the additional 
  cost, the applicant parent will be entitled to a reasonable reduction in the 
  support payment equal to some portion of the amount expended.</p>
<p> [76] Further, because the wording of s. 9(b) refers to the &quot;increased&quot; 
  costs of shared custody, it seems to envisage that the applicant parent must 
  show what his or her costs are for time spent with the child in excess of 40 
  per cent. Thus, if the applicant already provided the child with his or her 
  own bedroom before the child began spending more than 40 per cent of the time 
  with that parent, this would not be an increased cost.</p>
<p> Section 9(c): Conditions, means, needs and other circumstances</p>
<p> [77] The final consideration under s. 9 involves the &quot;conditions, means, 
  needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support 
  is sought&quot;. In applying this subsection the court should take into account 
  the goal that the child should, so far as possible, enjoy a comparable standard 
  of living in both households. Further, where a wide disparity of income is evident, 
  the court will need to recognize that the lower income parent spends a greater 
  percentage of his or her income on the child's expenses, both fixed and variable. 
  Where a parent who has been paying support brings an application under s. 9, 
  the court should make the common sense assumption that the responding parent's 
  fixed costs have remained unchanged and that his or her variable costs have 
  been reduced only modestly by the increased access, in the absence of evidence 
  to the contrary. If the applicant claims that the respondent's costs have been 
  substantially reduced because of the new custody arrangement, for example that 
  baby-sitting costs are drastically reduced, then he or she must adduce evidence 
  to that effect. </p>
<p> [78] Subsection (c) also allows the court to take into account the actual 
  spending patterns of the parents. One parent often absorbs more of the variable 
  costs for a child than the other. These may include expenses such as clothing, 
  school supplies and activities, birthday presents for friends, spending allowances, 
  dental checkups, camp fees and entertainment expenses. In this regard child 
  expense budgets are particularly important. Under subsection (c), the court 
  will also consider, where relevant, any other circumstances such as whether 
  the parent has income in excess of $150,000, the income of other members of 
  the household and the incomes of other persons who are contributing to the support 
  of the child.</p>
<p> The importance of evidence</p>
<p> [79] Before turning to the application of the factors relating to s. 9 in 
  this case, we wish to express our concern, as have the appellate courts in Green 
  v. Green and Slade v. Slade, about lack of evidence concerning the subsection 
  (b) and (c) factors. In Green, at para. 35, Prowse J.A. stated, &quot;In order 
  to apply s. 9, it is important that the parties lead evidence relating to subsections 
  (b) and (c); that is, of the 'increased costs of shared custody arrangements' 
  and 'the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse [parent] 
  and of any child for whom support is sought.'&quot; Prowse J.A. suggests, at 
  para. 35, that the court has two options: either to make assumptions as to the 
  increased costs or to dismiss the application for lack of evidence. </p>
<p> [80] We would add a third option. The court can adjourn the motion and require 
  the parties to provide additional evidence or direct a trial. Rule 15(13) of 
  the Family Law Rules, which apply to this proceeding, provides that on a motion 
  to change a final order, &quot;If the court is of the opinion that a motion 
  &#133; can not be properly dealt with because of the material filed, because 
  of the matters in dispute or for any other reason, the court may give directions, 
  including directions for a trial&quot; [emphasis added]. </p>
<p> [81] We also note that in Francis v. Baker, supra, at para. 48, the Supreme 
  Court observed in reference to s. 4 of the Guidelines that, &quot;there is nothing 
  objectionable per se about recognizing that trial judges have the discretion 
  to require custodial parents to produce child expense budgets&quot;. As the 
  court pointed out, &quot;Along with other factors, these budgets speak to the 
  reasonable needs of the children&quot;. The needs of the children is a factor 
  expressly included in s. 4(b) and is also referred to in s. 9(c). The Supreme 
  Court's comments have particular application in cases of shared custody where 
  there is no presumption in favour of the Table amounts. What the Supreme Court 
  found objectionable was that the custodial parent, under pre-Guideline jurisprudence, 
  had the burden of proving the reasonableness of each budgeted expense on a balance 
  of probabilities (at paras. 48 and 49). The Court held that such an approach 
  ran contrary to the presumption that the Table amount in the Guidelines was 
  the appropriate amount of support that should be paid for the child. The Court 
  cautioned that there is some inherent imprecision in child expense budgets and 
  that the pre-Guideline approach failed to recognize the unique situation of 
  high income earners. Thus, it was held that the trial court should not be too 
  quick to condemn expenses as unreasonable for children of high income earners. 
  Taking into account the different contexts of ss. 4 and 9, we nevertheless think 
  those comments are helpful in applying s. 9.</p>
<p> [82] As pointed out in Francis v. Baker, at para. 39, the actual circumstances 
  of the child are the central consideration. In dealing with an application under 
  s. 9 by a payor spouse, it will be particularly important for the responding 
  parent to present a child care budget if he or she wishes to contend that the 
  existing expenses of caring for the child exceed the Table amount in the Guidelines 
  that the applicant has been paying and that the respondent is presently contributing 
  to the child's support. In such situations, it may be that the overall support 
  required to meet the needs of the child will exceed the Table amount of one 
  parent.</p>
<p> Undue hardship</p>
<p> [83] We recognize that because of this approach to s. 9, in some cases there 
  will be considerably less money available to the payee spouse than was the case 
  when access by the payor spouse did not exceed 39 per cent. In some cases this 
  could result in undue hardship to the payee spouse. In such cases, the court 
  will need to consider the provisions of s. 10(1) of the Guidelines, which allow 
  a court to award a different amount than the amount determined under, inter 
  alia, s. 9, where &quot;the spouse making the request, or a child in respect 
  of whom the request is made, would otherwise suffer undue hardship&quot;. Section 
  10(2) lists some circumstances that may cause undue hardship, but it is not 
  exhaustive. At the same time, s. 10 must not be given an overly broad interpretation 
  so as not to defeat the objectives of the Guidelines. See Hanmore v. Hanmore 
  (2000), 255 A.R. 163, 4 R.F.L. (5th) 348 (C.A.) at para. 10 [leave to appeal 
  refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 182]: </p>
<p class="indent"> The objectives of the Guidelines are set out in s. 1. The primary 
  objectives are &quot;to establish a fair standard of support for children that 
  will ensure that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both spouses 
  after separation&quot;, and &quot;to ensure consistent treatment of spouses 
  and children who are in similar circumstances&quot;. Such objectives will be 
  defeated if the Courts adopt a broad definition of &quot;undue hardship&quot; 
  or if such applications become the norm rather than applying to exceptional 
  circumstances. That has been the consistent message of the Courts since the 
  Guidelines came into force.</p>
<p> [84] In our view, this policy is of less importance in the case of s. 9 because 
  of the greater subjectivity that is implicit in the application of that section.</p>
<p> Summary</p>
<p> [85] To summarize, the Guidelines are based on the principle that spouses 
  have a joint obligation towards their children in accordance with their financial 
  means. The objectives of the Guidelines are to achieve a fair, objective, consistent 
  measure of support. To reach these objectives, judicial discretion is limited 
  to five specific situations. In those five situations the court is granted a 
  discretion that is structured by the specific wording of the particular section. 
</p>
<p> [86] On application by the payor parent, s. 9 requires the court to make a 
  determination, &quot;by taking into account&quot; the three factors that follow. 
  Subsection (a), which refers to the Table amounts, is not the dominant factor. 
  However, a simple formula setting-off the amounts that each parent would be 
  required to pay the other will often be a convenient starting point. </p>
<p> [87] Subsection (b) recognizes that shared custody does not necessarily result 
  in a dollar for dollar decrease in the amount of support required by the responding 
  parent. Shared custody arrangements may actually require an increased amount 
  of overall child support. In the absence of evidence, a formula, such as a multiplier, 
  can assist in quantifying the increased costs of shared custody arrangements 
  to the respondent. While a 50 per cent multiplier may be appropriate in many 
  cases, the court should have regard to the respondent's actual fixed costs, 
  especially costs of accommodation, in determining an appropriate multiplier. 
  The court can also take notice of the common sense proposition that increased 
  access over 39 per cent will result in increased variable costs to the applicant. 
  However, it is not all access costs, only the increased costs of access, that 
  are taken into account under subsection (b). Where the applicant claims to have 
  incurred extra fixed costs, he or she will have to adduce evidence of those 
  expenses to have some portion of that expenditure taken into account. </p>
<p> [88] The factors in subsection (c) give the court a broad discretion to take 
  into account the actual situation of the parents and children in ordering support. 
  This is not novel, as prior to the enactment of the Guidelines, support orders 
  for children under both the Divorce Act and the Children's Law Reform Act took 
  into account the condition, needs, means and circumstances of the parties and 
  the children. Further, the exercise of the court's discretion under s. 9 must 
  recognize that in apportioning support, the court must, insofar as the overall 
  level of family resources allows, ensure that at the end of the day there is 
  an adequate amount of resources to meet the child's needs in both households. 
</p>
<p> [89] Finally, the court will consider any application by either parent based 
  on undue hardship under s. 10.</p>
<p> Application of the s. 9 factors to this case</p>
<p> [90] We would adopt the following approach in this case. First, we see no 
  reason not to start with the simple set-off. We would then adopt an appropriate 
  multiplier to reflect the mother's fixed costs. As we have said, in many cases 
  the 50 per cent multiplier will be appropriate. In other cases, having regard 
  to the responding parent's actual fixed costs, some different multiplier might 
  be appropriate to reflect these fixed costs. We think this is one of those cases. 
  The mother's costs for accommodation are higher than 50 per cent of her variable 
  costs for the child. Her monthly expenditures, not including the RESP, are approximately 
  $1,260 of which accommodation is $845 or 67.6 per cent of her fixed costs. We 
  would therefore multiply the set-off sum by the 67.6 per cent multiplier and 
  obtain the product. It is then necessary to adjust the result to reflect the 
  actual spending pattern of the parents on the child.</p>
<p> [91] Accordingly, we begin in this case with the simple set-off amount of 
  $128.<a name="r7"></a><a href="#7">[7]</a> To that we would add $86.62, reflecting 
  the use of a 67.6 per cent multiplier. This produces a figure of $215 (rounding 
  off).</p>
<p> [92] The material filed by the father provided very little evidence of his 
  increased costs of shared custody. For example, in his affidavit, he stated, 
  &quot;I provided [Christopher] with his own bedroom on a full-time basis and 
  all of the costs pertaining to him while he is residing with me.&quot; However, 
  he did not indicate when he provided the child with his own bedroom and what 
  if any additional costs this entailed. Further, the father did not provide any 
  information about the increased costs pertaining to Christopher that were occasioned 
  by the increased access. Accordingly, we propose to make the common sense assumption 
  that the father has incurred additional variable costs for such items as food 
  and entertainment. These increased costs are part of the overall variable costs 
  that we will take into account under s. 9(c) as part of the condition, means, 
  needs and circumstances of the spouses and the child. </p>

<p>[93] It is then necessary to consider the factors in subsection (c) by looking 
  at the actual spending patterns of the parents. While the parties did not adduce 
  evidence expressly directed to the factors in subsection (c), it is possible 
  to take these factors into consideration, to a certain extent, by having regard 
  to the parties' financial statements. Each parent incurs the expense of transporting 
  the child to and from school and we assume that this expense will continue to 
  be borne by that parent. We note that we do not have actual information on other 
  normal variable expenses such as haircuts, birthday gifts and gifts for family 
  occasions, dental bills, etc. Not including her contribution to an RESP, the 
  mother's variable monthly expenses for the child are: clothing $100; food $137.50; 
  school fees $25; school lunches $40; school activities $15; entertainment $60, 
  and summer camp $35 for a total of $403.41. The father's variable expenses for 
  groceries, clothing, school lunches and children's summer camp are $270 on a 
  monthly basis. The difference between the mother's variable expenses of $403.41 
  and the father's of $270 is $133.41. The total variable expenses should be shared 
  by the parties in proportion to their incomes. Adding the two figures of $403.41 
  and $270 together equals $673.41. The ratio of the father's income to the mother's 
  income is 55:45. The result is that the father should pay 55% of $673.41 or 
  $370 rounded off and the mother's share is $303. Inasmuch as the father is only 
  expending $270, he should pay to the mother an additional $100. When $100 is 
  added to the $215 figure, it produces a total of approximately $315 regular 
  support to be paid. Factoring in the expense for the mother's contribution to 
  an RESP of $153.84 as a special expense in the same proportion, we would add 
  $84.61 to the $315 for a total of $399.61 in support to be paid by the father 
  to the mother based on the 2001 financial information.</p>
<p> [94] In her submissions to the motion judge, the mother stated that she had 
  moved to Woodbridge because it was in Christopher's best interest, but that 
  she did so &quot;with great financial hardship to myself&quot;. Counsel for 
  the father objected to this submission because it was not supported by any material. 
  The motion judge upheld the objection and in that context made the comment that 
  &quot;we're just doing math today&quot;. In the result, there is no information 
  about the hardship resulting from the mother's move and whether this would constitute 
  undue hardship under s. 10 of the Guidelines. The mother did not seek to adduce 
  any such evidence before us to supplement the record. We are therefore not prepared 
  to increase the support amount arrived at under s. 9.</p>
<p> Wylie v. Leclair</p>
<p> [95] Before concluding this part of our reasons, we wish to very briefly deal 
  with the effect of this court's decision in May of this year in Wylie v. Leclair 
  (2003), 226 D.L.R. (4th) 439. This case concerned two issues including the quantum 
  of child support for two children. The parties had been in a long-term, committed 
  relationship but had not married. When they separated they agreed on a joint 
  custody regime with the children residing with their parents on alternate weeks. 
  At trial, apparently with the agreement of the parties, the trial judge held 
  that the proper approach in interpreting s. 9(a) was to use a simple set-off 
  approach. This produced a monthly payment by the father to the mother of $272. 
  The trial judge then increased that amount to $400, taking into account subsections 
  (b) and (c) because of the parties' &quot;lifestyle&quot; and the father's assets. 
  MacPherson J.A. speaking for the court held that the trial judge's comments 
  about lifestyle and assets were entirely speculative and inconsistent with other 
  findings of fact made by the trial judge. Counsel also conceded that there was 
  no evidence of increased costs of shared custody arrangements. MacPherson J.A. 
  therefore held that the trial judge's analysis and application of the factors 
  in subsections (b) and (c) were not supportable and that &quot;there was no 
  basis for departing from the set-off amount which the parties acknowledged was 
  the sum of $272 per month&quot; (at p. 443).</p>
<p> [96] Neither counsel in their submissions before us suggested that the Wylie 
  decision represented a binding precedent on the interpretation of s. 9. Counsel 
  for the father informed us that the interpretation of s. 9 was not fully argued 
  in this court. It is also apparent that the case was argued on the basis of 
  concessions made at trial concerning the use of the simple set-off approach. 
  In those circumstances, we do not consider that the Wylie case stands in the 
  way of the analysis set out above. Unlike in Wylie, this court has had the benefit 
  of full argument on the interpretation of s. 9 of the Guidelines and we have 
  been referred to most of the reported cases and the leading articles on the 
  issue.</p>
<p> Retroactive child support</p>
<p> [97] The motion judge ordered that the adjusted child support order be retroactive 
  to September 2000 when the father first contacted the mother and asked for a 
  reduction in child support because of the shared custody. Many of the factors 
  to be considered in deciding whether to make an order for support retroactive 
  have been summarized by Rowles J.A. in L.S. v. E.P. (1999), 67 B.C.L.R. (3d) 
  254, 50 R.F.L. (4th) 302 (C.A.) at paras. 66 and 67. A detailed application 
  of those factors is not required. In our view, the motion judge erred in principle 
  in making the order retroactive in this case. The overwhelming factor against 
  making the new order retroactive in the circumstances of this case is that the 
  father had failed to pay increased child support as his income increased, as 
  required by the 1998 minutes of settlement. In fairness, it does not appear 
  that the mother specifically drew this to the attention of the motion judge, 
  although it was mentioned in her affidavit.</p>
<p> Costs</p>
<p> [98] The question of costs is a difficult one in this case. We have found 
  that both the motion judge and the Divisional Court erred in their interpretation 
  and application of s. 9. The motion judge erred in failing to take into account 
  all of the factors in s. 9 and in simply using a pro-rated set-off approach. 
  These errors favoured the father. She also erred in making the new order retroactive 
  to September 2000. The Divisional Court erred in its application of Francis 
  v. Baker and in holding that there was a presumption in favour of the Table 
  amount that had not been rebutted by the father. These errors favoured the mother. 
  The result of the appeal in this court is mixed. While the father has succeeded 
  in overturning the decision of the Divisional Court, the amount of child support 
  that we have arrived at is substantially more than the motion judge ordered. 
</p>
<p> [99] Having regard to all of these circumstances and that this is the first 
  occasion on which this court has been called upon to consider in detail the 
  interpretation and application of s. 9 of the Guidelines, we believe that this 
  is a proper case for each party to bear their own costs at all stages of the 
  proceedings. We consider this order to be consistent with Rule 24 of the Family 
  Court Rules, and in particular, subrule (6), which speaks to divided success.</p>
<p> DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [100] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Divisional 
  Court, and order that the father pay child support to the mother in the monthly 
  amount of $399.61 as of June 2001. Because the father was paying a lesser amount 
  until the date of the order of the Divisional Court and then a greater amount 
  thereafter, there may have been some overpayment or underpayment. We assume 
  that the parties will be able to agree on the amount of this overpayment or 
  underpayment and how it can be dealt with. If not, they may serve and file brief 
  written submissions within 30 days of the release of this judgment. </p>
<p> [101] As indicated, the parties did not present any further or updated information 
  to this court from which we could make a determination of the appropriate amount 
  of child support for 2002 or the current year. We believe that the parties ought 
  to be able to settle on an appropriate amount for those years based on these 
  reasons. If not, we would permit the parties to serve and file brief written 
  submissions within 30 days of the release of this judgment.</p>
<p> [102] We would order that each party bear their costs of the proceedings in 
  this court, in the Divisional Court and before the motion judge.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"> APPENDIX</p>
<p> Federal Child Support Guidelines</p>
<p> 1. The objectives of these Guidelines are: </p>
<p> (a) to establish a fair standard of support for children that 
  ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both spouses 
  after separation;</p>
<p>(b) to reduce conflict and tension between spouses by making 
  the calculation of child support orders more objective;</p>
<p>(c) to improve the efficiency of the legal process by giving 
  courts and spouses guidance in setting the levels of child support and encouraging 
  settlement; and</p>
<p>(d) to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and children who 
  are in similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p> 3. (1) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, the amount of a child 
  support order for children under the age of majority is</p>
<p> (a) the amount set out in the applicable table, according to the number of 
  children under the age of majority to whom the order relates and the income 
  of the spouse against whom the order is sought; and</p>
<p> (b) the amount, if any, determined under section 7.</p>
<p> (2) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, where a child to whom 
  a child support order relates is the age of majority or over, the amount of 
  the child support order is</p>
<p> (a) the amount determined by applying these Guidelines as if the child were 
  under the age of majority; or</p>
<p> (b) if the court considers that approach to be inappropriate, the amount that 
  it considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and other 
  circumstances of the child and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute 
  to the support of the child.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p> 4. Where the income of the spouse against whom a child support order is sought 
  is over $150,000, the amount of a child support order is</p>
<p> (a) the amount determined under section 3; or</p>
<p> (b) if the court considers that amount to be inappropriate,</p>
<p>(i) in respect of the first $150,000 of the spouse's income, the amount set 
  out in the applicable table for the number of children under the age of majority 
  to whom the order relates;</p>
<p>(ii) in respect of the balance of the spouse's income, the amount that the 
  court considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and 
  other circumstances of the children who are entitled to support and the financial 
  ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the children; and</p>
<p>(iii) the amount, if any, determined under section 7.</p>
<p  class="center">
  </p>
<p> 8. Where each spouse has custody of one or more children, the amount of a 
  child support order is the difference between the amount that each spouse would 
  otherwise pay if a child support order were sought against each of the spouses.</p>
<p> 9. Where a spouse exercises a right of access to, or has physical custody 
  of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of a year, 
  the amount of the child support order must be determined by taking into account</p>

<p> (a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;</p>
<p>(b) the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and</p>
<p>(c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and 
  of any child for whom support is sought.</p>
<p> 10. (1) On either spouse's application, a court may award an amount of child 
  support that is different from the amount determined under any of sections 3 
  to 5, 8 or 9 if the court finds that the spouse making the request, or a child 
  in respect of whom the request is made, would otherwise suffer undue hardship.</p>
<p>Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)</p>
<p> 15.1 (1) A court of competent jurisdiction may, on application by either or 
  both spouses, make an order requiring a spouse to pay for the support of any 
  or all children of the marriage.</p>
<p  class="center">
  </p>
<p>(3) A court making an order under subsection (1) &#133; shall do so in accordance 
  with the applicable guidelines.</p>
<p  class="center">
  </p>
<p>26.1 (1) The Governor in Council may establish guidelines respecting the making 
  of orders for child support, including, but without limiting the generality 
  of the foregoing, guidelines</p>
<p>(a) respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is 
  to be determined;</p>
<p>(b) respecting the circumstances in which discretion may be exercised in the 
  making of an order for child support;</p>
<p  class="center">
  </p>
<p>(h) respecting the production of income information and providing for sanctions 
  when that information is not provided.</p>
