<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the decision of this court in Ukrainian Credit Union Ltd. 
  v. Nesbitt, Burns Ltd. (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 311 (C.A.) is determinative of the 
  issue raised on this appeal. The third party claim advanced against the respondents 
  by the appellant is a claim for contribution and indemnity in connection with 
  any sums which the appellant may be required to pay to the plaintiff in the 
  main action.</p><p>
  [2] Contrary to the conclusion of the motions judge, such a claim for contribution 
  and indemnity is not a claim for the recovery of damages within the meaning 
  of s. 14(1) of the Condominium Act (Ontario). Accordingly, that section does 
  not apply to the third party proceedings in this case. </p><p>
  [3] The appeal is therefore allowed to the extent that paragraph two (2) of 
  the Order of the motions judge dated January 15, 2003 is set aside.</p><p>
  [4] The appellant is entitled to its costs of this appeal on a partial indemnity 
  basis, fixed in the amount of $4,000 inclusive of disbursements and Goods and 
  Services Tax.</p>
