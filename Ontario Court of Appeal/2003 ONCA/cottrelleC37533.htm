<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lynne Leitch of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 7, 2001.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p > [1] Darlene Cottrelle, one of the respondents, suffered from diabetes for 
  more than 30 years. In April 1993, at the age of 54, she developed a sore between 
  the toes of her left foot. That sore eventually became infected and by mid-July, 
  the appellant's leg was gangrenous and needed to be amputated below the knee. 
  Examination of the amputated limb revealed severe atherosclerosis (obstruction 
  of the arteries) that inhibited the respondent's ability to fight the infection.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge found that the appellant, Dr. Alexander Gerrard, the respondent's 
  family physician, was negligent in the treatment of the sore that became infected. 
  The trial judge found that the appellant failed to examine the respondent's 
  foot when she visited his office on July 2nd, and that he failed to ensure an 
  appropriate follow-up procedure to monitor the condition of her foot thereafter. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Both the appellant's and the respondent's expert witnesses testified that 
  had Ms. Cottrelle received an aggressive form of treatment when the condition 
  of her foot deteriorated, she might not have suffered the loss of her leg. However, 
  in light of the pre-existing medical condition of her leg, no witness was prepared 
  to say that it was more likely than not that with proper treatment of the sore, 
  the leg could have been saved. In the end, the trial judge found that Dr. Gerrard's 
  negligence was a material cause of the loss of the leg and found him liable. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons set out below, I conclude that trial judge erred with respect 
  to the legal test for causation, that on the evidence and on the trial judge's 
  findings, the respondent failed to establish that the appellant's negligence 
  was the cause of her loss. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the action 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] As a type 2 diabetic, the respondent was at risk for the development of 
  vascular disease. The experts agreed that her risk was increased because she 
  was a First Nations Canadian and because she was a smoker. It is well known 
  that because of their high incidence of vascular disease, diabetics are at risk 
  for the development of gangrenous tissue on their feet.</p>
<p>
  [6] At trial, the action was pursued only against the appellant. The respondent 
  first called the appellant's office about the sore between her toes on April 
  19, 1993. She did not speak directly to the appellant, but he prescribed Kenelog 
  cream for her sore. The appellant did not examine the sore, and took no steps 
  to follow-up with the respondent. The respondent saw the appellant regarding 
  other ailments on May 12 and May 14, 1993. She made no complaints about her 
  foot during those two visits. She returned on May 25. This time the appellant 
  did examine her foot. He prescribed Diprasone lotion, a topical steroid. Again, 
  no arrangements were made for a follow-up visit. On June 30, 1993 the respondent 
  awoke with throbbing pain between her toes, and she went to the Emergency Department 
  at Victoria Hospital for treatment. Dr. Upfold, the emergency physician, observed 
  a &quot;small (2 mm) open area on left fifth toe where it rubs fourth - no cellulitis, 
  has sensation - grossly normal&quot;. Her diagnosis was an ulcer on the toe. 
  She prescribed a seven to ten day course of oral antibiotics and advised the 
  respondent to follow-up with her family physician later that week. </p>
<p> [7] The respondent arranged to see the appellant on July 2, 1993. Her foot 
  was then in the same condition as when she was seen by Dr. Upfold. It was not 
  suggested that the standard of care required the appellant to admit her to hospital 
  for more aggressive treatment as of that date. The issue was whether the appellant 
  properly examined the respondent and given her appropriate advice for follow-up 
  care. The appellant testified that he examined the respondent's foot but the 
  respondent testified that he did not. The trial judge accepted the respondent's 
  evidence and found that the appellant did not physically examine the respondent's 
  foot, but simply told her that he would make an appointment for her to see a 
  skin specialist. The appellant conceded that he gave the respondent no further 
  instructions or warnings. He testified that she had never hesitated to make 
  appointments in the past and that as she came to see him three to four times 
  as often as most patients, he did not expect that she would allow her foot to 
  deteriorate without getting medical attention. The appointment with the dermatologist 
  was not made until July 15 and not scheduled until September 21. </p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant did not see the respondent after July 2. She remained at home 
  and the condition of her foot deteriorated. It became painful, changed colour 
  and got darker and developed an odour. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance 
  on July 20, 1993. According to the orthopaedic surgeon on call at the time, 
  the respondent's foot had developed gangrene and the infection was spreading 
  proximally. On July 21, 1993, the respondent's leg was amputated below the knee. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] The pathologist's examination of the amputated limb determined that the 
  anterior and posterior tibial arteries were totally occluded and the peroneal 
  artery was 80% occluded. The limited circulation of blood to her leg significantly 
  inhibited the respondent's ability to fight the infection in her foot, with 
  or without the help of an antibiotic. Dr. Anne Kenshole, an endocrinologist 
  and diabetician who practices at Women's College Hospital in Toronto and has 
  considerable expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diabetic 
  foot lesions, testified that the extent of atherosclerosis revealed by the pathology 
  report was as severe as she had ever seen. There was no suggestion by any of 
  the experts that the appellant could or should have been aware of this very 
  serious atherosclerosis prior to the amputation, nor was there anything he should 
  have done that would have allowed the respondent to avoid the complication of 
  atherosclerosis that resulted from her diabetes. </p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge found that the appellant fell below the appropriate standard 
  of care in two ways: first, on July 2, 1993 he should have physically examined 
  the respondent's foot; and second, he should have followed-up or monitored the 
  respondent's condition after that date. The trial judge further found that the 
  appellant's negligence denied the respondent a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; 
  to save her leg, and that his negligence was therefore a cause of her loss sufficient 
  to ground liability. </p>
<p>
  [11] The trial awarded damages for the cost of future care and assessed general 
  damages at $125,000. Family Law Act claims were assessed at $10,000 in total. 
  The trial judge reduced the award by 20% on account of the respondent's contributory 
  negligence in failing to seek medical attention when the condition of her foot 
  deteriorated. The trial judge also applied a negative contingency factor of 
  14% to reduce the award on account of the respondent's pre-existing condition. 
  The total damages awarded, including $10,000 in favour of OHIP and including 
  pre-judgment interest, was $157,545.99.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant raises the following issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Negligence. Did the trial judge err in finding that the 
  appellant fell below the applicable standard of care?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Causation. Did the trial judge err in finding that the appellant's 
  negligence caused the respondent's loss?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Damages.</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Did the trial judge err in refusing to reduce the damages 
  on account of the government benefits to which the respondent was entitled?</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Did the trial judge err by applying only a 14% negative 
  contingency factor?</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) Did the trial judge err in assessing the respondent's 
  contributory negligence at 20%?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  1. Negligence</p>
<p>
  [13] In his notice of appeal and in his factum, the appellant appeals the trial 
  judge's findings relating to negligence and his failure to meet the standard 
  of care. While the appellant did not abandon that aspect of the appeal, counsel 
  elected to devote all of the time allocated for oral argument to what is clearly 
  the central issue, namely causation. I intend to follow suit and I will discuss 
  the negligence issue only briefly in these reasons. </p>
<p>
  [14] In his factum, the appellant submits that the trial judge's finding that 
  he failed to examine the respondent's foot on July 2, 1993 should be set aside 
  as contrary to the evidence and unreasonable. Given the deference to which the 
  trial judge's factual findings are entitled in this court, I am unable to accept 
  that submission. Simply put, there was conflicting evidence on the point. While 
  another judge might have found otherwise, on this record, the trial judge was 
  entitled to accept the respondent's evidence, reject that of the appellant, 
  and to make the finding that she did. It was also open to the trial judge, on 
  the evidence before her, to find that the appellant's failure to ensure that 
  the respondent would seek medical attention if her foot deteriorated was negligent. 
  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  2. Causation</p>
<p>
  [15] The respondent's theory of causation was that had the appellant monitored 
  her condition more closely after July 2, he would have observed the deteriorating 
  condition of her foot and admitted her to hospital for more aggressive treatment, 
  namely, the intravenous administration of antibiotics to control the infection 
  and possibly the amputation of a toe before the infection spread to the point 
  that the leg had to be amputated. The appellant's theory of causation was that 
  given the serious atherosclerosis in the appellant's leg, more aggressive treatment 
  would not have made any difference. Because of the very limited circulation 
  in the respondent's leg, neither her body's natural defences nor the intravenous 
  administration of antibiotics would have been effective to combat the infection. 
  Consequently, argues the appellant, it cannot be said that the appellant's negligence 
  caused the injury. </p>
<p>
  [16] Both parties called expert evidence on causation. The respondent's expert, 
  Dr. Rodney Box, was a retired internal medicine specialist whose main clinical 
  experience had been in the area of respirology. As the trial judge noted in 
  her reasons on this point, Dr. Box's was testimony did not go beyond the suggestion 
  that the patient &quot;might&quot; have kept her limb if the infection had been 
  managed more aggressively. Although the trial judge did not specifically refer 
  to the passage in her reasons, Dr. Box admitted in cross-examination that he 
  could not say that with a more aggressive form of treatment, it was more probable 
  than not that the leg could have been saved: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. In the second last paragraph [of one of Dr. Box's reports], 
  do you not say &quot;I believe that it is impossible to say whether such energetic 
  treatment as I have described could have saved her leg and for how long&quot;?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I did.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. You stand by that statement?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes. We have no idea if it would have worked.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And that all you can say, in fairness, is that there was 
  a potential to reverse the infectious process?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I believe that.</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Now, by potential to reverse the infectious process, what 
  you mean in other words is a chance. Correct?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I do.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And your correct criticism of Dr. Gerrard is that you say 
  he caused her to lose that chance?</p>
<p class="indent">A. The chance was missed.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Yes. But you certainly can't say that she had anything more 
  than a chance?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No.</p>
<p class="indent">. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And you can't go so far as to say that on a balance of probability 
  that leg would have been saved based on anything that you know?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I won't go that far [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[17] The trial judge placed considerable weight on the evidence of the appellant's 
  expert, Dr. Anne Kenshole who testified that the respondent's leg was &quot;non-salvageable&quot; 
  and that the &quot;ultimate cause&quot; of the amputation was the respondent's 
  &quot;extremely severe peripheral vascular disease&quot;. This vascular disease 
  made it impossible for Ms. Cottrelle's own healing processes to fight the infection, 
  either with or without the addition of antibiotics. According to Dr. Kenshole, 
  the respondent's atherosclerosis was so severe that &quot;there was no potential 
  for healing once a break in the skin of the ulcer occurred.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge quoted at para. 68 of her reasons, the following passage 
  from Dr. Kenshole's written report: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In that Mrs. Cottrell had been in habit of seeing Dr. Gerrard frequently and 
  for a wide variety of minor complaints and had not hesitated to visit a hospital 
  emergency department at 3:00 a.m., one can only surmise that she was well aware 
  of the increasing gravity of her illness between July 2 and July 20 yet chose 
  to deny it and by so doing missed an important window of opportunity wherein 
  aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics and/or local amputation of 
  the toe might have avoided the need for the life-saving below knee amputation 
  which was ultimately required [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [19] Dr. Kenshole expanded upon this opinion in cross-examination: </p>
<p class="indent">Q. No. What you're saying in this paragraph, Dr. Kenshole, is 
  that what occurred between July 2nd and July 20th was important and that there 
  was a significant window of opportunity to avoid the below-knee amputation?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is not what I have said in my report. In all fairness, 
  Mr. Williams, umm, if I can just paraphrase, if I may, uhh, what I believe happened 
  from July the 2nd 'til approximately July the 9th, Mrs. Cottrelle, by her own 
  testimony, was not feeling better or worse. She did not see herself any change 
  in this two millimetre ulcer. </p>
<p class="indent">In and around July the 9th, she started to feel unwell. She 
  noticed darkening of the skin in that area. That is, I believe, when the infection 
  started to take hold. Between July the 9th and July the 20th, the situation 
  was clearly getting graver the whole time in terms of her systemic wellbeing, 
  in terms of the appearance, subsequently the odour of this area which by the 
  time she got to hospital was grossly infected. </p>
<p class="indent">What I intended, or what I hoped to imply by what I've written 
  there is, if Mrs. Cottrelle had from July the 9th or shortly thereafter, when 
  she noticed a change in the appearance of the ulcer, was becoming darker. She 
  was developing a small area of tissue death in that area. </p>
<p class="indent">If she had gone to hospital at that stage, indeed if she'd seen 
  her family physician, I strongly suspect that her family physician would have 
  immediately sent her on to the hospital, where, given the information as I have 
  read it, she would have been admitted to hospital. She would have been started 
  on intravenous antibiotics. She would have had vascular studies and she had 
  a chance, a small chance, because the infection, the infected area would then 
  be localized to a small area, she might, and I underline &quot;might&quot; have 
  got away with a localized, a more localized amputation, maybe through the ankle 
  amputation. </p>
<p class="indent">I can't say obviously for sure that that would've been the outcome 
  because in the light of the vascular tree that we subsequently know she had, 
  I think it likely that local amputation, if undertaken, would not have been 
  successful because of the poor vascular supply to the entire foot.</p>
<p class="indent">Or, if it had been tried, it would have failed, as she would 
  ultimately have had a below-the-knee amputation at some later date. That is 
  my best interpretation of the circumstances, having been involved in the care 
  of not one, not ten, but many patients who followed a similar course [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>[20] The trial judge based her analysis of the causation issue on the decision 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada in Athey v. Leonati, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458. At 
  para. 64, the trial judge identified five principles from that case as being 
  applicable: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) The plaintiff must prove to the civil standard on a balance 
  of probabilities that the defendant's tortious conduct caused or contributed 
  to the plaintiff's injury - the causation test is not to be applied too rigidly 
  and causation need not be determined by scientific precision; see Snell v. Farrell, 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311.</p>
<p class="indent">2) The plaintiff does not need to establish that the defendant's 
  negligence was the sole cause of the injury.</p>
<p class="indent">3) The law does not excuse a defendant from liability merely 
  because other causal factors for which he is not responsible also helped produce 
  the harm - it is sufficient if the defendant's negligence was a cause of the 
  harm.</p>
<p class="indent">4) The plaintiff must be placed in the position he or she would 
  have been in absent the defendants' negligence (&quot;original position&quot;) 
  - it is the difference between the original position and the injured position 
  that is the plaintiff's loss.</p>
<p class="indent">5) If there is a measurable risk that the pre-existing condition 
  would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff in the future, regardless of 
  the defendants' negligence, then this can be taken into account in reducing 
  the overall award.</p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge then adopted the passages quoted above at paras. 18 and 
  19 from Dr. Kenshole's written opinion and cross-examination. She specifically 
  adopted Dr. Kenshole's &quot;window of opportunity&quot; analysis at para. 70 
  of her reasons in making her finding on causation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As noted above I have found that Dr. Gerrard did not meet his duty of care after 
  July 2 and I further find that the breach of his duty of care denied Mrs. Cottrelle 
  the &quot;window of opportunity&quot; described by Dr. Kenshole. As a result 
  of the breach of the duty of care, the risk that concerned Dr. Upfold - the 
  development of a deeper infection - materialized. This deeper infection contributed 
  to the development of gangrene and the resulting need for below the knee amputation.</p>
<p>[22] The trial judge then concluded her analysis of causation at paras. 71 
  and 72 by considering the &quot;loss of chance&quot; doctrine: </p>
<p class="indent"> The remaining issue is whether the &quot;loss of chance&quot; 
  doctrine is applicable and if so whether a plaintiff is entitled to compensation 
  for such a loss. The defendant asserts that Mrs. Cottrelle lost only a chance 
  of reversing the infectious process and that such a loss of chance cannot ground 
  liability in a medical context (see Laferriere v. Lawson, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 541). 
  In Athey v. Leonati the Supreme Court of Canada at p. 474 described the loss 
  of chance doctrine as one which suggests that plaintiffs may be compensated 
  where their only loss is the loss of a chance at a favourable opportunity or 
  of a chance of avoiding a detrimental event. The Court concluded that such a 
  doctrine was not applicable to the facts of that case and they neither approved 
  nor disapproved of the doctrine. </p>
<p class="indent">In my view the loss of chance doctrine is not applicable to 
  this case. I am satisfied that Dr. Gerrard's failure to meet the requisite standard 
  of care caused the infection to deepen and that such infection contributed to 
  the development of gangrene which mandated the amputation.</p>
<p>
  [23] From her reasons, it is difficult to know precisely what legal test of 
  causation the trial judge applied. Simply put, there was no evidence that, on 
  a balance of probabilities, but for the appellant's negligence, the respondent 
  would not have lost her leg. Indeed, counsel for the respondent conceded in 
  oral argument that there was no evidence suggesting that it was more likely 
  than not that had the appellant lived up to the standard of care, the respondent's 
  leg would have been saved. He submitted, however, that the evidence of a possibility, 
  lower than a probability, that the respondent's leg might have been saved satisfied 
  the test in Athey, and it seems likely that the trial judge proceeded on that 
  same basis. I am unable to accept the correctness of that proposition. </p>
<p>
  [24] As explained in Athey at para. 13, causation is established when the plaintiff 
  proves on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant caused or contributed 
  to the injury. The generally applicable test is the &quot;but for&quot; test. 
  This test &quot;requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have 
  occurred but for the negligence of the defendant&quot; (Athey, at para.14). 
  </p>
<p>
  [25] I agree with the appellant's submission that in an action for delayed medical 
  diagnosis and treatment, a plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities 
  that the delay caused or contributed to the unfavourable outcome. In other words, 
  if, on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff fails to prove that the unfavourable 
  outcome would have been avoided with prompt diagnosis and treatment, then the 
  plaintiff's claim must fail. It is not sufficient to prove that adequate diagnosis 
  and treatment would have afforded a chance of avoiding the unfavourable outcome 
  unless that chance surpasses the threshold of &quot;more likely than not.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [26] In Athey, the plaintiff proved on a balance of probabilities that the defendants' 
  negligence caused the loss. The defendants sought to escape liability by pointing 
  to other more significant causes for which they were not responsible. It was 
  in that context that Athey held that if the defendant's negligence materially 
  contributed to the occurrence of the injury, the defendant could not escape 
  liability by pointing to other causes. However, Athey does not excuse the plaintiff 
  from proving on a balance of probabilities that but for the defendant's negligence, 
  the plaintiff would not have suffered the loss. </p>
<p>
  [27] The plaintiff in Athey had a history of back problems. He suffered neck 
  and back injuries in two accidents two months apart involving the two defendants. 
  He then suffered a herniated disc while following a course of exercise recommended 
  by his physician. The defendants contended that they had not caused the herniated 
  disc and that it was attributable to the plaintiff's pre-existing condition. 
  Writing for a unanimous court, Major J. identified the issue on the appeal, 
  at para. 1, as being &quot;whether the loss should be apportioned between tortious 
  and non-tortious causes where both were necessary to create the injury&quot; 
  [emphasis added]. In Athey, the evidence clearly established that but for the 
  defendants' negligence, the plaintiff would not have suffered a herniated disc. 
  The issue was instead whether the defendants could escape liability because 
  the plaintiff's back problems were also caused by his pre-existing condition. 
  Major J. held that the answer to that question was &quot;no&quot;, so long as 
  the negligence of the defendants materially contributed to the loss.</p>
<p>
  [28] The respondent relies on the following passages at paras. 15-20 of Athey 
  which qualify the basic &quot;but for&quot; rule: </p>
<p class="indent"> The &quot;but for&quot; test is unworkable in some circumstances, 
  so the courts have recognized that causation is established where the defendant's 
  negligence &quot;materially contributed&quot; to the occurrence of the injury: 
  Myers v. Peel County Board of Education, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 21; Bonnington Castings, 
  Ltd. v. Wardlaw, [1956] 1 All E.R. 615 (H.L.); McGhee v. National Coal Board, 
  supra. A contributing factor is material if it falls outside the de minimis 
  range: Bonnington Castings, Ltd. v. Wardlaw, supra; see also R. v. Pinske (1988), 
  30 B.C.L.R. (2d) 114 (B.C.C.A.), aff'd [1989] 2 S.C.R. 979.</p>
<p class="indent">In Snell v. Farrell, supra, this Court recently confirmed that 
  the plaintiff must prove that the defendant' s tortious conduct caused or contributed 
  to the plaintiff's injury. The causation test is not to be applied too rigidly. 
  Causation need not be determined by scientific precision; as Lord Salmon stated 
  in Alphacell Ltd. v. Woodward, [1972] 2 All E.R. 475, at p. 490, and as was 
  quoted by Sopinka J. at p. 328, it is &quot;essentially a practical question 
  of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense&quot;. Although 
  the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff, in some circumstances an inference 
  of causation may be drawn from the evidence without positive scientific proof. 
</p>
<p class="indent">It is not now necessary, nor has it ever been, for the plaintiff 
  to establish that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injury. 
  There will frequently be a myriad of other background events which were necessary 
  preconditions to the injury occurring. &#133; As long as a defendant is part 
  of the cause of an injury, the defendant is liable, even though his act alone 
  was not enough to create the injury. There is no basis for a reduction of liability 
  because of the existence of other preconditions: defendants remain liable for 
  all injuries caused or contributed to by their negligence&#133;. </p>
<p class="indent">The law does not excuse a defendant from liability merely because 
  other causal factors for which he is not responsible also helped produce the 
  harm&#133;. </p>
<p class="indent">This position is entrenched in our law and there is no reason 
  at present to depart from it. If the law permitted apportionment between tortious 
  causes and non-tortious causes, a plaintiff could recover 100 percent of his 
  or her loss only when the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injuries. 
  Since most events are the result of a complex set of causes, there will frequently 
  be non-tortious causes contributing to the injury. Defendants could frequently 
  and easily identify non-tortious contributing causes, so plaintiffs would rarely 
  receive full compensation even after proving that the defendant caused the injury. 
  This would be contrary to established principles and the essential purpose of 
  tort law, which is to restore the plaintiff to the position he or she would 
  have enjoyed but for the negligence of the defendant. </p>
<p>
  [29] In my opinion, these qualifications or refinements to the basic rule requiring 
  the plaintiff to meet the ordinary burden of proving &quot;but for&quot; causation 
  on a balance of probabilities do not assist the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [30] The &quot;but for&quot; test has been relaxed as &quot;unworkable&quot; 
  in cases where, practically speaking, it is impossible to determine the precise 
  cause of the injury. In Athey, for example, the Supreme Court affirmed the &quot;material 
  contribution&quot; test as a qualification to the strict &quot;but for&quot; 
  test only when used in cases similar to Bonnington Castings Ltd. v. Wardlaw, 
  supra, and McGhee v. National Coal Board, supra. The more recent House of Lords 
  decision in Fairchild v. Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd. and Others, [2002] 
  3 All E.R. 305 (H.L.) also reflects this same tendency to depart from the &quot;but 
  for&quot; standard, but only where the precise cause of the injury is unknown. 
  Bonnington, McGhee, and Fairchild all involved situations where the plaintiff 
  was exposed to a harmful substance from various sources, but could not prove 
  precisely that the substance resulting from the defendant's tortious conduct 
  caused the loss. In Fairchild, the plaintiffs had been exposed to asbestos while 
  working for various employers for various periods. The plaintiffs developed 
  a fatal disease caused by asbestos, but could not establish which exposure or 
  exposures to asbestos had actually caused the disease. The House of Lords allowed 
  the plaintiffs' appeals from lower court decisions dismissing their claims and 
  held that they were entitled to recover. The salient feature of Fairchild was 
  that the plaintiffs were definitely injured by the negligence of one of the 
  defendants, and there was no other operative cause or explanation for the injury. 
  As pointed out in Lewis N. Klar, Tort Law, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Thompson, 2003) 
  at 400: &quot;courts will strive to fashion a just solution in this type of 
  case to allow a wronged plaintiff to recover. Courts will not allow wronged 
  plaintiffs to fall between the cracks due to the formal requirements of proving 
  cause.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [31] In my view, the principle followed in this line of cases does not assist 
  the respondent. In the case at bar, there is no practical uncertainty as to 
  the impact of the appellant's wrongful conduct upon the plight of the respondent. 
  It was clearly established that the respondent lost her leg because of an infection. 
  The question was whether the appellant could have prevented an outcome that 
  was unquestionably caused by the infection and the respondent's pre-existing 
  vascular condition. The evidence demonstrated that it is more likely than not 
  that even if the appellant had lived up to the standard of care, the respondent 
  would have lost her leg. </p>
<p>
  [32] Nor, in my view, is the respondent assisted by the principle established 
  in Snell v. Farrell, supra. Snell involved a situation in which the plaintiff 
  became blind following cataract surgery. The court found the defendant negligent 
  in proceeding with the operation despite retrobulbar bleeding. The expert witnesses 
  who testified were unable to say with certainty what caused the plaintiff's 
  blindness, but the retrobulbar bleeding was found to be a possible cause. In 
  Snell, Sopinka J. held that the plaintiff did not need to prove with scientific 
  precision that the bleeding was the cause of her blindness, particularly since 
  the facts as to precisely what had occurred during the surgery were within the 
  knowledge of the defendant. </p>
<p>
  [33] The &quot;robust and pragmatic&quot; approach to proof of causation utilized 
  in Snell v. Farrell does not assist the respondent. In the case at bar, there 
  is no uncertainty over why Darlene Cottrelle suffered the amputation of her 
  leg and this is not a case where the appellant is in a better position to say 
  what happened. Here, the issue is not whether the appellant created a situation 
  that might have caused the respondent's loss. Instead, the issue is whether 
  the appellant could have prevented the loss of the respondent's leg in any event. 
  In this case, the experts agree that it is more likely than not that even if 
  the appellant had met the appropriate standard of care, the respondent still 
  would have lost her leg. </p>
<p>
  [34] In Athey, Major J. summarized his reasons for imposing liability on the 
  defendants by pointing to the plaintiff's pre-existing condition at para. 41: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The applicable principles can be summarized as follows. If the injuries sustained 
  in the motor vehicle accidents caused or contributed to the disc herniation, 
  then the defendants are fully liable for the damages flowing from the herniation. 
  The plaintiff must prove causation by meeting the &quot;but for&quot; or material 
  contribution test. Future or hypothetical events can be factored into the calculation 
  of damages according to degrees of probability, but causation of the injury 
  must be determined to be proven or not proven. This has the following ramifications: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. If the disc herniation would likely have occurred at the 
  same time, without the injuries sustained in the accident, then causation is 
  not proven.</p>
<p class="indent">2. If it was necessary to have both the accidents and the pre-existing 
  back condition for the herniation to occur, then causation is proven, since 
  the herniation would not have occurred but for the accidents. Even if the accidents 
  played a minor role, the defendant would be fully liable because the accidents 
  were still a necessary contributing cause.</p>
<p class="indent">3. If the accidents alone could have been a sufficient cause, 
  and the pre-existing back condition alone could have been a sufficient cause, 
  then it is unclear which was the cause-in-fact of the disc herniation. The trial 
  judge must determine, on a balance of probabilities, whether the defendant's 
  negligence materially contributed to the injury.</p>
<p>
  [35] I agree with the appellant's submission that the case at bar falls within 
  the first category and does not fall into either the second or the third category. 
  Proper treatment might have saved the respondent's leg, but, according to the 
  medical experts, in view of the severe pre-existing atherosclerosis in her leg, 
  she likely would have lost her leg in any event. The appellant's negligence 
  was not a necessary cause to bring the case within the second category, nor 
  could the appellant's negligence alone have been a sufficient cause to bring 
  the case within the third category.</p>
<p>
  [36] In my view, the respondent established no more than the loss of a less 
  than 50% chance of salvaging her leg had the appellant not been negligent. Unfortunately 
  for the respondent, under the current state of the law, loss of a chance is 
  non-compensable in medical malpractice cases: see Laferri&egrave;re v. Lawson, 
  supra; St-Jean v. Mercier, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 491; Hotson v. East Berkshire Area 
  Health Authority, [1987] A.C. 750 (H.L.). The trial judge did not explain the 
  basis for her conclusion that &quot;the loss of chance doctrine is not applicable 
  to this case&quot;. In view of the evidence I have reviewed, and in view of 
  the respondent's concession that there was no evidence to suggest that it was 
  more than likely a better outcome would have followed had the appellant acted 
  with care, the trial judge's finding reveals either a misapprehension as to 
  the law or a palpable and overriding error on the facts. </p>
<p>
  [37] The exclusion of recovery for the loss of a chance in medical malpractice 
  cases has been criticized as being unduly rigid and harsh: see. Klar, supra 
  at 403-405; John G. Fleming, &quot;Probalistic Causation in Tort Law&quot; (1989) 
  68 Can. Bar Rev. 661; S.M. Waddams, &quot;The Valuation of Chances&quot; (1988) 
  30 Can. Bus. L.J. 30; S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, looseleaf (Toronto: 
  Canada Law Book, 2002) at 13.260-13.370; Salvatore Mirandola, &quot;Lost Chances, 
  Cause-in-Fact and Rationality in Medical Negligence&quot; (1992) 50 U. T. Fac. 
  L. Rev. 258. Recovery based upon the loss of a chance would require substantial 
  reduction of the damages to reflect the value of the less than 50% chance that 
  was lost. In any event, the authorities cited in para. 36 preclude us from considering 
  such an award.</p>
<p>
  [38] Finally, I note that in a case with facts very similar to those presented 
  here, the Alberta courts have concluded that the plaintiff failed to meet the 
  legal test for causation. In Sohal v. Brar (1998), 211 A.R. 81 (Q.B.), the defendant 
  doctor was found to have been negligent in failing to advise the plaintiff, 
  a diabetic with a cut on his foot, to seek immediate treatment when the cut 
  became infected. Within days, the plaintiff's foot had to be amputated. As in 
  the present case, the expert evidence on causation did not establish that it 
  was more likely than not that that earlier aggressive treatment would have saved 
  the foot. McBain J. reviewed Snell and Athey, and considered the plaintiff's 
  argument that the evidence established a material contribution to the injury 
  beyond the de minimus range. He concluded at para. 185 that the evidence &quot;does 
  not prove to the civil standard on a balance of probabilities that the defendant 
  caused the injury nor [did] it&#133;establish on a balance of probabilities 
  that the delay by the defendant doctor materially contributed to the injury&quot;. 
  As a result, the legal test for causation had not been met and the defendant 
  could not be held liable. In coming to this conclusion, McBain J. held that 
  the plaintiff had proved no more than the loss of a chance, and that this type 
  of loss, on the authorities cited above, is not compensable. A panel of the 
  Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's motion to extend the time 
  for serving a notice of appeal, on the ground that there was no basis for arguing 
  that the trial judge erred in law in his characterization of the test for causation: 
  (1998), 223 A.R. 141 at para. 5.</p>
<p>
  [39] For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge either erred in law 
  in her appreciation of the appropriate legal test for causation, or she made 
  a palpable and overriding error in her appreciation of the evidence. As there 
  was no evidence to suggest that it was more probable than not that the respondent 
  would have avoided the loss of her leg had the appellant not been negligent, 
  the action should have been dismissed.</p>
<p>3. Damages</p>
<p>
  [40] In view of the conclusion I have reached on the issue of causation, it 
  is not necessary for me to consider appellant's contention that the trial judge 
  erred in her assessment of the damages.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [41] For these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judgment 
  and dismiss the action. The appellant is entitled to his costs of the trial 
  and of this appeal but as suggested by Mr. Hamer, I would order costs on a partial 
  indemnity basis only if demanded.</p>
