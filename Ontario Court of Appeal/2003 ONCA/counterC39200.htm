<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice R. Pitt of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated October 29, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants brought an application seeking, among other relief, to have 
  certain portions of a by-law restricting the natural garden they had planted 
  on two zones of city property declared unconstitutional and of no force and 
  effect. One zone is a narrow strip between the property line and the sidewalk; 
  the second zone is between the sidewalk and the paved roadway that serves as 
  a storm water management ditch.</p>
<p>
  [2] Pitt J. held that any infringement of the appellants' freedom of conscience, 
  freedom of religion or freedom of expression is justified as a reasonable limit 
  under s. 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The crucial holdings of Pitt 
  J. are contained in para. 33 of his reasons:</p>
<p class="indent"> [33] Can the infringement be justified as a reasonable limit 
  demonstrably in a free and democratic society?</p>
<p class="indent"> The restriction is justified and even apparent through common 
  sense. An application of the s. 1 test in R. v. Oakes (1986), 26 D.L.R. (4th) 
  200 (S.C.C.) makes this clear. I accept the submissions of the City that the 
  by-laws are precise enough to qualify as limits prescribed by law. The objective 
  of the by-laws is pressing and substantial - public safety through visibility 
  on roadways. By-laws that give a municipality the ability to regulate what is 
  on public areas where visibility is at issue are rationally connected to that 
  objective. As for minimal impairment, it should be recalled that there is no 
  ban on natural gardens of any kind on public space. The limitation in the by-laws 
  is just that - a limitation on the extent of growth. Limitations, rather than 
  prohibitions, are generally easier to justify as minimal impairment. Here, it 
  is not appropriate to require the municipality to scientifically prove every 
  inch of sight line from every direction for every individual. The height restriction 
  imposed by the City is based on sensible driver sight line estimates, and still 
  permits generous natural growth. Therefore, the minimal impairment requirement 
  is met. Finally, a proper balance exists between the effects of the limiting 
  measures and the legislative objective. It is the view of City officials, reasonably 
  held in my opinion, that some of the plants on the road allowance create dual 
  traffic concerns. One involves drivers entering into Mulgrove Drive from the 
  side streets immediately north and south of the property, and the second from 
  the viewpoint of drivers exiting the residential driveway neighbouring 52 Mulgrove 
  Drive. The Counters are only required to alter the public portion of their garden 
  to the extent that the City determines driver and pedestrian safety to be at 
  risk. Based on the above, then, the measures taken by the City are proportional, 
  and the limitations are justified. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>
  [3] We agree generally with the analysis of Pitt J. and with his conclusion. 
  In our opinion, the authority to limit the extent of the vegetation is tied 
  specifically to safety hazards and is a reasonable limitation on the appellants' 
  Charter rights. We agree with Pitt J.'s conclusion that when read and interpreted 
  in the light of its underlying purpose of controlling encroachments which create 
  a safety hazard, the by-law is not so vague, ambiguous, uncertain or discretionary 
  as to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs of the appeal are fixed at $5,000 
  payable by the appellants to the respondents.</p>
