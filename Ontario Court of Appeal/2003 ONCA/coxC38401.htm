<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There is no doubt that Dr. Cox is a loving and committed parent and that 
  he has been frustrated by Ms. Stephen's unwarranted interference with his access 
  rights. However, in our view, Templeton J., in thoughtful reasons, correctly 
  concluded that in removing the child from the only home he had ever known, Dunn 
  J. failed to consider the best interests of the child. </p>
<p>[2] We do not accept the appellant's submission that Templeton J. improperly 
  substituted her discretion for that of the trial judge. In our view, her conclusion 
  that the trial judge made a material error in principle was warranted given 
  the following factors:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The trial judge's failure to advert to the impact of removing 
  the child from his residence and his family, including his three siblings, in 
  his detailed and lengthy reasons;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge's overwhelming focus on the conduct of the 
  mother rather than on the best interests of the child;</p>
<p class="indent">3. The terms of his order giving the father effective control 
  over the mother's access rights; </p>
<p class="indent">4. The trial judge ignoring the evidence that Ms. Stephen was 
  otherwise an excellent parent and that the independent assessor concluded that 
  the child should not be removed; and</p>
<p class="indent">5. The trial judge's costs order.</p>
<p>[3] Both the trial judge and the appeal judge properly found that the mother's 
  conduct with respect to the father was entirely inappropriate. However, read 
  as a whole, the trial judge's reasons place excessive emphasis on the conduct 
  of the mother and insufficient emphasis on the best interests of the child. 
  Templeton J. fashioned a remedy, on the other hand, that took appropriate account 
  of the risk of alienation by awarding joint custody to Dr. Cox, yet protecting 
  the child's sense of stability by not requiring him to leave his lifelong home 
  and family.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.</p>
