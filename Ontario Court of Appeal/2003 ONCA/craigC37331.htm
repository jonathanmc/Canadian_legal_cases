<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Harry J. Keenan of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 22, 1998.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Steven Craig, was convicted by a jury of manslaughter in 
  the death of his lover. The trial judge sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment. 
  Craig appeals his sentence. He submits that the trial judge made the following 
  four errors justifying appellate intervention: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Although the basis for the jury's verdict was unclear, the 
  trial judge did not give the appellant the benefit of the doubt;</p>
<p class="indent">2. He relied on a statement of the appellant that he had already 
  ruled inadmissible at trial;</p>
<p class="indent">3. He failed to take into account several mitigating factors; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">4. He failed to give the appellant any credit for pre?trial 
  custody.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown acknowledges that the appellant was entitled to credit for seven 
  months' pre?trial custody, but submits that otherwise the trial judge did not 
  err and imposed a fit sentence. </p>
<p>
  B. Agreed Facts About the Offence and the Appellant's Statement</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant and the Crown filed an agreed statement of facts. </p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant met the victim, James Detzler, while both were serving sentences 
  in the Kingston Penitentiary. In prison they developed a sexual relationship. 
  After Detzler was released they maintained their relationship by sexually explicit 
  correspondence. </p>
<p>
  [5] On May 6, 1997, the appellant was released on parole. He moved to Toronto 
  and rented a bachelor apartment. On May 28, Detzler visited him in his apartment. 
  By the end of the evening Detzler was dead. The pathologist who performed the 
  post mortem testified that the cause of death was drowning associated with blunt 
  force injury. In the doctor's opinion, Detzler's injury could not have been 
  caused by a single punch, but more likely resulted from the sustained application 
  of force. </p>
<p>
  [6] Two days after Detzler's death, the appellant went to the office of his 
  lawyer, who got in touch with the police and told them where the body was located. 
  The police picked up the appellant and took him to the police station. At the 
  station the appellant gave three statements.</p>
<p>
  [7] In his first statement, which was inculpatory, he said that he and Detzler 
  were drinking and that Detzler made sexual advances to him. The appellant rejected 
  the advances and they got into a fight. The appellant felt &quot;pissed off&quot; 
  because Detzler had been &quot;coming on&quot; to him. He &quot;freaked out&quot; 
  and began hitting Detzler with his fists. He kept hitting him for ten or twenty 
  minutes, then he grabbed Detzler's clothes and purse and threw them into the 
  incinerator. </p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant said that he left his apartment after locking the door behind 
  him and breaking the key inside the lock. He maintained that when he left Detzler 
  was in the kitchen and conscious, as far as he knew, though he was bruised and 
  in &quot;not very good&quot; condition. The appellant &quot;couldn't say&quot; 
  how Detzler ended up being found in the bathroom. He said that he told his lawyer 
  he had done something accidentally. </p>
<p>
  [9] After he gave his first statement the appellant was charged with second 
  degree murder. He was advised of his right to speak to counsel and immediately 
  asked to telephone his lawyer. The police telephoned his lawyer's office and 
  left a message. However, instead of waiting for the lawyer to return the call, 
  the police took the appellant into a video room and obtained a second, lengthier 
  and even more inculpatory statement. The trial judge later ruled this statement 
  inadmissible on the ground that the appellant had not waived his right to counsel. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] In the second statement the appellant said that Detzler had arrived at 
  his apartment between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. After talking for a while Detzler 
  asked to be handcuffed. The appellant obliged by handcuffing Detzler behind 
  his back. Detzler then wanted to have anal intercourse. The appellant refused 
  and began hitting Detzler because Detzler was &quot;bugging&quot; him and he 
  got &quot;fed up with it&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [11] For between five and twenty minutes the appellant used his closed fist 
  to hit Detzler on his lower back, on his shoulder blades, around his neck and 
  on the back of his neck. Detzler fell into the bathtub, which had water in it 
  because the appellant was going to soak his blistered feet. The appellant slammed 
  the bathroom door and went to another room of the apartment, leaving Detzler 
  leaning over in the water. </p>
<p>
  [12] About five minutes later the appellant went back to the bathroom to see 
  if Detzler was all right. He saw that Detzler's head was further down in the 
  water and that he was not moving. The appellant removed the handcuffs and noticed 
  that Detzler's arms were limp. He didn't think of getting him any medical help 
  because he was &quot;pissed off&quot;. However, he felt scared because he thought 
  that he had killed him. He threw Detzler's clothing down the incinerator and 
  left the apartment, locking the door behind him and breaking the key in the 
  lock so that no one could enter. </p>
<p>
  [13] The next morning the appellant got rid of the shirt he was wearing during 
  the incident so that it could not be traced. After walking the streets, he &quot;felt 
  [his] conscience following [him] around&quot;, so he went to his lawyer and 
  told him what had happened. </p>
<p>
  [14] After the appellant gave his second statement he was charged with first 
  degree murder under s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code. The prosecution alleged 
  that he forcibly confined or sexually assaulted Detzler while murdering him.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant then gave a third, brief statement to the police in which 
  he said that on the evening of May 28 he had been drinking four or five beers 
  but was not drunk. He also said that Detzler did not drink or &quot;do drugs.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [16] At trial, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge of first degree 
  murder but guilty to the included offence of manslaughter. The trial judge ruled 
  that the appellant's first and third statements were admissible, but excluded 
  his second statement. At the end of the Crown's case the trial judge directed 
  a verdict of acquittal on the first degree murder charge because the prosecution 
  had not presented any evidence that Detzler was either forcibly confined or 
  sexually assaulted during the alleged murder. </p>
<p>
  [17] The jury was given two competing theories of what occurred. The Crown contended 
  that the appellant strangled or choked Detzler and that he either intended to 
  cause Detzler's death or intended to cause him bodily harm that he knew was 
  likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued. Under the Crown's 
  theory the appellant was guilty of second degree murder. </p>
<p>
  [18] The defence acknowledged that the appellant assaulted Detzler and that 
  the assault had led to his death. The defence contended that Detzler sustained 
  his neck injuries by blows administered before he fell into the bathtub and 
  that, therefore, the killing was not intentional. Under the defence's theory 
  the appellant was guilty of unlawful act manslaughter. The jury returned a verdict 
  of manslaughter. </p>
<p>
  [19] In sentencing the appellant to ten years' imprisonment, the trial judge 
  concluded that &quot;this homicide cannot under any view of the evidence be 
  described as accidental....It is a homicide which is at the higher end of the 
  scale&quot;.</p>
<p>
  C. Is Appellate Interference With the Sentence Justified?</p>
<p>
  [20] Despite the deference accorded to sentencing decisions, in my view this 
  court is justified in interfering with the appellant's sentence, largely for 
  the four reasons he gives. I will discuss them briefly. </p>
<p>
  (i) Benefit of the doubt when the basis of the jury's verdict is unclear </p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to apply the 
  principle that a sentencing judge must give an accused the benefit of any doubt 
  about the basis of a jury's verdict. I agree with this submission. </p>
<p>
  [22] In R. v. Brown, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 518, the Supreme Court held that a sentencing 
  judge is bound by the express and implied factual implications of a jury's verdict. 
  Parliament codified the Supreme Court's holding by enacting s. 724 of the Criminal 
  Code, which states: </p>
<p class="indent"> 724. (1) In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved 
  any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentence proceedings and any 
  facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the court is composed of a judge and jury, the court 
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) shall accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that 
  are essential to the jury's verdict of guilty; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) may find any other relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence 
  at the trial to be proven, or hear evidence presented by either party with respect 
  to that fact.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where there is a dispute with respect to any fact that is 
  relevant to the determination of a sentence,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the court shall request that evidence be adduced as to the 
  existence of the fact unless the court is satisfied that sufficient evidence 
  was adduced at the trial;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the party wishing to rely on a relevant fact, including 
  a fact contained in a presentence report, has the burden of proving it;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) either party may cross?examine any witness called by the 
  other party;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) subject to paragraph (e), the court must be satisfied on 
  a balance of probabilities of the existence of the disputed fact before relying 
  on it in determining the sentence; and</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt, the existence of any aggravating fact or any previous conviction by the 
  offender.</p>
<p>
  [23] Thus, in this case, following s. 724(2)(a), the trial judge had to accept 
  the necessary implication from the jury's manslaughter verdict that the appellant 
  did not have the specific intent to kill Detzler. He had to sentence him for 
  unlawful act manslaughter, where the unlawful act was the assault.</p>
<p>
  [24] Beyond the appellant's assault of Detzler, however, the basis on which 
  the jury arrived at a verdict of manslaughter is unclear. Although s. 724(3) 
  requires disputed facts to be proven before the sentencing judge may rely on 
  them, the Code does not address cases of factual ambiguity such as this one. 
  </p>
<p>
  [25] In such cases, the accused is entitled to the benefit of any doubt about 
  the basis of the jury's verdict. This principle was set out by Finlayson J.A. 
  in R. v. Cooney (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 196 at 204 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  My own view is that, consistent with R. v. Gardiner, supra, and the proposition 
  that the normal burden of proof still rests on the Crown when dealing with disputed 
  facts, the sentencing judge is obliged to give to the convicted accused the 
  benefit of the doubt regarding the basis on which he was convicted by the jury. 
  </p>
<p>
  See also R. v. Poorman (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 82 at 89 (Sask. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [26] Although the trial judge is not bound to accept the most lenient view of 
  the facts, or the accused's characterization of the facts, any doubt about the 
  basis of the verdict must be resolved in the accused's favour. I am not persuaded 
  that the trial judge applied this principle.</p>
<p>
  [27] In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge rejected the idea that Detzler's 
  death was &quot;accidental&quot;. In his words: </p>
<p class="indent"> On all of the evidence it is clear to me that this homicide 
  cannot under any view of the evidence be described as accidental. The injuries 
  that were suffered by the victim were substantial - very serious injuries caused 
  by the accused. The most significant of those injuries were those to the neck 
  structures which were described as having been caused by a sustained application 
  of pressure to the throat and voice box of the victim consistent with strangulation.</p>
<p class="indent">The cause of death was described and was not in any way seriously 
  challenged as death by, in effect, drowning, that is, the ingestion of water 
  consistent with the deceased being alive and having his head put under water. 
</p>
<p>
  [28] I am not sure what the trial judge meant by his use of the word &quot;accidental&quot;. 
  He could not have meant that the killing of Detzler was intentional. Yet, in 
  this passage, the trial judge seems to have concluded that the appellant strangled 
  his victim. Although I suppose it is possible the jury convicted the appellant 
  of manslaughter on the basis that he strangled Detzler and put his head underwater 
  but did not intend to kill him, this harsh inference from the evidence was not 
  the only one available to the trial judge. It is also possible that the assault, 
  including the neck injuries consistent with strangulation, caused Detzler to 
  fall into the bathtub, where he later drowned. In this sense, his death could 
  be described - as his defence counsel contended - as &quot;accidental&quot;. 
  Nonetheless, the appellant would still be guilty of manslaughter because the 
  death was objectively foreseeable. </p>
<p>
  [29] In seemingly rejecting this possible characterization of what occurred 
  the trial judge did not give the appellant the benefit of the doubt about the 
  basis of the jury's verdict. Had he given the appellant the benefit of the doubt 
  about when Detzler sustained his neck injuries, he likely would not have imposed 
  a sentence at the higher end of the range for manslaughter. The trial judge's 
  failure to apply the principle in Cooney justifies appellate review. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Reliance on an inadmissible statement</p>
<p>
  [30] The trial judge ruled the appellant's second statement - in which he confessed 
  to handcuffing Detzler - inadmissible because it was obtained in breach of s. 
  10(b) of the Charter. Having ruled the statement inadmissible at trial, the 
  trial judge was not entitled to rely on the contents of the statement in sentencing 
  the appellant. This much the Crown acknowledges. See s. 724(2)(b) of the Criminal 
  Code; and R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.</p>
<p>
  [31] What the parties disagree about is whether the trial judge did rely on 
  the statement. The appellant says that he did and points to this troubling passage 
  at the beginning of the reasons for sentence: </p>
<p class="indent"> The jury was deprived of cogent evidence in this case by reason 
  of a ruling made by me for the exclusion of evidence of a statement which had 
  been obtained from the accused in violation of his rights under the Charter 
  of Rights. It was a statement which was voluntary in the classic sense and would 
  otherwise have been part of the evidence before the jury. The jury if they had 
  had that evidence would have had a somewhat larger and somewhat more complete 
  picture of at least what the accused had said about the commission of the offence. 
</p>
<p class="indent">In assessing the penalty that is appropriate in this case I 
  must, of course, be bound by the verdict of the jury and must impose a sentence 
  which is a fit sentence for the offence of manslaughter. I am, however, at liberty 
  to take into account all of the evidence and make my own assessment of the facts 
  of the case and my own view as to what it was that caused the death of the victim. 
</p>
<p>
  [32] In support of his submission the appellant emphasizes the juxtaposition 
  of the judge's statement that &quot;[t]he jury was deprived of cogent evidence 
  in this case by reason of a ruling made by me for the exclusion of... a statement&quot; 
  with his assertion that &quot;I am, however, at liberty to take into account 
  all of the evidence&quot;. The appellant also emphasizes that the evidence of 
  handcuffing could well - in the trial judge's mind - have justified a sentence 
  for manslaughter at the &quot;higher end of the scale&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [33] The Crown, however, argues that the trial judge commented on the exclusion 
  of the second statement solely to explain why the jury convicted the appellant 
  of manslaughter instead of second degree murder. The Crown observes that in 
  his reasons for sentence the trial judge did not refer to the handcuffing of 
  Detzler and that he would have done so had he actually relied on the excluded 
  statement.</p>
<p>
  [34] I do not think that the absence of any reference to the handcuffing in 
  the reasons for sentence adequately answers the appellant's submission. Other 
  than a brief reference to the pathologist's evidence and to the seriousness 
  of Detzler's injuries, the trial judge did not discuss or make findings on how 
  the death occurred. Instead, he emphasized how little was known: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whatever it was that really transpired that night we may never know. Clearly 
  what Mr. Craig told to the police was only part of the story. We have not heard 
  the exact details as to what it was that caused the assault on Mr. Detzler which 
  eventually ended in his death.</p>
<p>
  It thus seems to me that the trial judge's reasons are unclear about whether 
  he used the excluded statement to sentence the appellant. Both the appellant 
  and this court are left to wonder whether he improperly took the contents of 
  this statement into account. </p>
<p>
  [35] This lack of clarity in the trial judge's reasons about whether he used 
  such an important piece of evidence justifies appellate review of the sentence. 
  As Binnie J. observed in R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869 at para. 46: </p>
<p class="indent">
  These cases make it clear, I think, that the duty to give reasons, where it 
  exists, arises out of the circumstances of a particular case. Where it is plain 
  from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the absence 
  or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment to the exercise 
  of the right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account intervene. 
  On the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through confused 
  or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult issues 
  of law that need to be confronted but which the trial judge has circumnavigated 
  without explanation, or where (as here) there are conflicting theories for why 
  the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of which 
  would clearly constitute reversible error, the appeal court may in some cases 
  consider itself unable to give effect to the statutory right of appeal. In such 
  a case, one or other of the parties may question the correctness of the result, 
  but will wrongly have been deprived by the absence or inadequacy of reasons 
  of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly scrutinized on appeal. 
  In such a case, even if the record discloses evidence that on one view could 
  support a reasonable verdict, the deficiencies in the reasons may amount to 
  an error of law and justify appellate intervention [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  I therefore hold that this lack of clarity about the use of the second statement 
  is another justification for reviewing the fitness of the sentence.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Mitigating factors not considered</p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge did take into account the appellant's plea of guilty to 
  manslaughter. In his reasons he said, &quot;The accused has in some measure 
  accepted responsibility and offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter&quot;. 
  But the trial judge did not take into account another important mitigating consideration: 
  the appellant turned himself in to the police and confessed to his crime. Where, 
  as in this case, an accused implicates himself to help solve a crime he spares 
  the public the cost of an investigation and shows that he has accepted some 
  responsibility for his actions. He is entitled to some credit for having done 
  so. </p>
<p>
  (iv) Credit for pre?trial custody</p>
<p>
  [37] Before he was released on parole in early May 1997, the appellant had been 
  serving a series of consecutive sentences for robbery, break and enter and theft, 
  possession of a weapon and uttering threats. When he was arrested and charged 
  with Detzler's murder his parole was revoked. He then spent nineteen months 
  in custody until he was sentenced for manslaughter on December 22, 1998. The 
  trial judge denied him any credit for pre?trial custody on the manslaughter 
  conviction, instead holding that the entire nineteen months should be attributed 
  to the previous sentences for which his parole had been revoked. In this court, 
  the appellant submits and the Crown accepts that he is entitled to credit for 
  seven months' pre?trial custody on the manslaughter offence. </p>
<p>
  D. What is a fit sentence?</p>
<p>
  [38] Once this court is justified in interfering with the sentence imposed by 
  the trial judge, it is entitled to impose a sentence that it considers fit. 
  See R. v. Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [39] I would reduce the ten?year sentence. Giving the appellant the benefit 
  of the doubt, I assume that the trial judge derived the lengthy sentence in 
  part from excluded evidence and an unnecessarily harsh interpretation of the 
  facts underlying the jury's verdict.</p>
<p> [40] Several mitigating factors also take this case out of the high?end range 
  of sentences for manslaughter. They include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant turned himself in, confessed to the assault and, at least 
    in some measure, cooperated with the police.</li>
  <li>He then pleaded guilty to manslaughter, showing both remorse and responsibility 
    for what occurred.</li>
  <li>Dr. Orchard observed that &quot;the subject's own insight into his problems 
    and the need for treatment is greatly enhanced by his self?criticism over 
    causing a death&quot;.</li>
  <li>The appellant has had an unfortunate upbringing characterized by multiple 
    placements in foster and group homes. Yet he is only thirty-one years of age 
    and still has some prospects of rehabilitating himself.</li>
</ul>
<p> [41] Although I would reduce the sentence given by the trial judge, I acknowledge 
  the several aggravating factors that warrant a substantial penitentiary term: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant attacked a person with whom he had had an intimate sexual 
    relationship.</li>
  <li>He had been on parole for less than a month when he committed the offence. 
  </li>
  <li>He has a lengthy criminal record consisting of sixteen previous convictions, 
    including several for offences of violence.</li>
  <li>Dr. Orchard, a psychiatrist who gave a written assessment of the appellant, 
    said that the appellant had an &quot;explosive personality&quot; that required 
    treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [42] Balancing these aggravating and mitigating factors, and giving credit for 
  the seven months of pre?trial custody on the usual two for one basis, I consider 
  a fit sentence to be seven years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  E. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [43] I would grant leave to appeal the sentence, allow the appeal and reduce 
  the appellant's sentence from ten years' to seven years' imprisonment. </p>
