<p class="boldcenter">ADDENDUM TO SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>[1] In our reasons for judgment released on May 26, 2003, among other things, 
  we allowed the appellant's sentence appeal on the charge of criminal harassment 
  and reduced the sentence from three years to two years less one day plus three 
  years probation.</p>
<p> [2] Unbeknownst to counsel and the court, it seems that on December 20, 2002, 
  the appellant received a sentence of 90 days for an offence that did not form 
  part of the appeal. Significantly, the 90-day sentence was made consecutive 
  to the sentences imposed by the trial judge in the instant case. It follows 
  that when we varied the sentence on the criminal harassment charge to two years 
  less one day plus three years probation, the total period of incarceration imposed 
  on the appellant remained in excess of two years. In turn, that had the effect 
  of nullifying the probation order which we felt was necessary in the circumstances.</p>
<p> [3] The Crown has now requested that we re-open the sentence appeal to address 
  this matter. Specifically, she requests that we vary the sentence on the criminal 
  harassment charge from two years less one day plus three years probation to 
  twenty months plus three years probation. The appellant consents to that variation. 
</p>
<p>[4] In our view, this is an appropriate case to re-open the sentence appeal. 
  Our jurisdiction to do so arises from the fact that at the time of the appeal, 
  we did not have the information needed to fully and properly adjudicate the 
  issue of sentence on the merits. </p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, an order will go varying the sentence on the criminal harassment 
  charge to twenty months plus three years probation. The terms of probation will 
  remain the same as those set out in paragraph 40 of our reasons for judgment. 
  In all other respects, our reasons for judgment stand.</p>
