<p>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice Norman D. Dyson of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated July 19, 2002. </p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant's main submission is that the verdicts were unreasonable. 
  It seems to us that to accept that submission we must conclude that the trial 
  judge could not rely on Ms. Tobin's identification of the appellant. We think, 
  however, that despite the poor quality of the photograph, it was open to the 
  trial judge to rely on her identification. This was not a case of a stranger 
  identifying the appellant but of an identification made by someone who had met 
  and been with him several times in the past. Given that Ms. Tobin recognized 
  someone she had seen before, the trial judge was entitled to consider her identification 
  as a strong piece of evidence in support of the verdicts. There are other pieces 
  of circumstantial evidence that also supported the verdicts. They included the 
  cell phone records, the appellant's comment to the police in Texas and the store 
  employees' permitting the robber to enter the store at closing. Taken together, 
  this evidence reasonably supported the verdicts. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant's other submission is that the reasons do not comply with 
  the Supreme Court's judgment in R. v. Sheppard (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 198 (S.C.C.), 
  because they do not come to grips with the main planks of the defence: the appellant's 
  alleged alibi and his accent. Although the reasons could have been more detailed, 
  we think that they are adequate enough to permit appellate review. We think 
  it implicit in those reasons that the trial judge did not accept the store employees' 
  evidence that the appellant was in the store on one of the two Thursdays before 
  the robbery. </p>
<p>[3] As for the appellant's alleged accent, the store employee who mainly dealt 
  with the appellant was not definitive about whether he had an accent, and the 
  trial judge was unable to make a first hand assessment as the appellant did 
  not testify. </p>
<p>[4] For these brief reasons, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
