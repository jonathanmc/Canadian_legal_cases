<p>On appeal from the sentence of Justice D. Pettit-Baig of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated June 24, 2002.</p>
<p>McMURTRY C.J.O.:<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by the Crown of the conditional sentence imposed on the 
  respondent by the Honourable Madam Justice D. Pettit-Baig on June 24, 2002 following 
  a plea of guilty to one count of incest contrary to s. 155 of the Criminal Code, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c.C-46 (&quot;Criminal Code or &quot;Code&quot;). A conditional 
  sentence of eighteen months was imposed, followed by one year probation.</p>
<p>FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[2] In 1999, the respondent was 24 years old and lived on a First Nation Reserve 
  with his common law spouse and their infant son. They now have two sons. The 
  complainant is the half sister of the respondent and at the time of the offence 
  was 14 years old.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The complainant had spent the previous seven years living in foster homes. 
  On August 1, 1999, the complainant was placed in the respondent's home as a 
  foster child as a result of a foster care service agreement.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In the course of the year between August 1, 1999 and the removal of the 
  complainant a year later, there were a series of sexual contacts between the 
  respondent and the complainant.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The sexual contact began by the respondent kissing the complainant, then 
  touching her genitals and having her masturbate him until he ejaculated. This 
  conduct escalated and developed into mutual oral sex which occurred on four 
  occasions and then to full intercourse on six occasions. These incidents took 
  place in the family home and behind the railway tracks.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] During the sexual relationship with the complainant, the respondent was 
  heavily addicted to alcohol.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The relationship between the complainant and the respondent was eventually 
  disclosed to the respondent's common-law spouse and as a result the complainant 
  was removed from the home and placed elsewhere.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] On July 20, 2001, the respondent disclosed the relationship to his psychologist 
  who advised a probation officer who in turn advised the police. The same day, 
  the respondent attended upon the police and provided a videotaped, cautioned 
  statement in which he fully admitted the offence. The complainant shortly thereafter 
  provided a videotaped statement confirming the statement of the respondent.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The respondent has a previous criminal record as follows:</p>

<p> PRE-SENTENCE REPORT<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The respondent's childhood years were characterized by parental substance 
  abuse, neglect, physical and emotional abuse and death. His parents had a tumultuous 
  relationship. His father abused his mother, and his mother abused the respondent. 
  She was extremely physically abusive, causing broken bones and cutting him with 
  knives. Child welfare agencies were constantly involved with the family. When 
  the respondent was seven, his father was killed in a car accident.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Intermittently, the respondent lived with his paternal grandfather and 
  his step-grandmother. During this time, he suffered extensive sexual abuse, 
  at the hands of the step-grandmother's two sons. They were convicted of sexual 
  offences in relation to the respondent.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] After his father's death, the respondent and his sister were placed in 
  their first foster home. A year later their mother gained custody of them and 
  moved them to Alberta. She worked as a prostitute and the respondent often saw 
  sexual acts in the home. She would disappear for months at a time. He began 
  to steal to survive. After this, he was placed in twenty different homes, many 
  of which he ran away from. From age 11 to 14 he lived in a group home in Alberta. 
  He also spent time living on the street, stealing, pimping and trafficking in 
  drugs to support himself.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The respondent commenced a relationship with his common-law spouse when 
  he was 20 years old. He was convicted of assaulting her but, according to the 
  appellant's factum, that assault was &quot;uncharacteristic behaviour&quot; 
  by the respondent.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The respondent moved out of their home when, as a result of the charge 
  of incest, he was ordered by the local Child and Family Services Agency to leave 
  because of the presence of his two sons. According to the pre-sentence report, 
  a professional assessor had expressed the opinion that he was not a danger to 
  his sons but the author of the pre-sentence report was unable to clarify the 
  situation with the Agency.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The pre-sentence report also indicated that the respondent hopes to one 
  day reconcile with his common-law spouse, who he states is the most stable and 
  consistent person he has ever had in his life. He recognizes that he &quot;messed 
  up&quot; and has to deal with himself and the consequences of his conduct before 
  they can reconcile. Regardless, he intends to be a part of his sons' lives. 
  His common law spouse described the respondent as a &quot;really good guy&quot; 
  and good with the kids. She was upset that he was forced to leave the home, 
  and wishes to reconcile after the respondent has &quot;[dealt] with his situation&quot;. 
  They apparently had a very positive family relationship before the respondent 
  got involved with the complainant. They continue to spend time together outside 
  of the family home.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The respondent's substance abuse history, as detailed in the pre-sentence 
  report, began when his mother used to put alcohol in his baby bottle to put 
  him to sleep. He remembers drinking with his mother at the age of five, thinking 
  she would like him more. At age seven he used marijuana with her for the first 
  time. His use of substances progressed. At age eighteen, he was admitted to 
  the Adolescent Residential Program for Chemical Dependency and Treatment at 
  the Smith Centre in Thunder Bay. He voluntarily discharged himself after less 
  than one month. He reports having abstained since that time until he reverted 
  to alcohol as a result of the pressures of having a young child and his involvement 
  with the complainant. He was intoxicated at the time he assaulted his common-law 
  spouse, for which he was convicted in 2000.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The respondent recalled having extended counselling as a young boy in 
  relation to his own victimization at the hands of his uncles. Following his 
  conviction for assault in 2000, and after his arrest in relation to the conviction 
  herein, the respondent was referred for various treatments but showed little 
  motivation, at least until recently.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] In relation to his sexual contacts with the complainant, the respondent 
  told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had brought the complainant 
  into his home because he knew what it was like to grow up without a family and 
  he wanted her to have a family environment. While he wanted to show the complainant 
  a different life, he admitted that he ended up by &quot;repeating on her the 
  experiences he knew growing up&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] The respondent described his involvement with the complainant as being 
  &quot;so mutual&quot;. He recalls feeling scared and uneasy about the involvement 
  and the fact that it happened behind his spouse's back. He described being &quot;flooded&quot; 
  with emotions for the complainant, for whom he felt love and wanted to make 
  happy. In speaking with the probation officer during preparation of the pre-sentence 
  report, he advised that he now felt that he likely caused the complainant some 
  emotional problems, and that &quot;she must feel so used&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] The respondent has upgraded his education over the years after leaving 
  public school in grade five. In the months prior to his sentence in June of 
  2002 the respondent completed a Personal Career Development Program at Confederation 
  College and commenced a Literacy and Basic Skills Program at the same College. 
  The respondent has a limited employment history, which is mostly comprised of 
  short term contract work in tree planting, fire fighting and bush cutting.<br>
</p>
<p>FRESH EVIDENCE<br>
</p>
<p>[21] The appellant agreed that the respondent be permitted to file a letter 
  from the Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital dated November 27, 2002 related to the 
  hospital's sexual behaviour program and a letter from Confederation College 
  dated November 19, 2002 in relation to the respondent's enrolment as a full-time 
  student in the Literacy and Basic Skills (LBS) Program.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Although the letter from the Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital stated that 
  it was too early in the program to comment on the respondent's progress to date, 
  it indicated that he &quot;appears highly motivated and has been an attentive, 
  vocal and an active participant to date&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The letter from Confederation College stated as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my interactions with Mr. H. I have found him to 
  be highly motivated to succeed. He works hard, takes great pride in his accomplishments 
  and is very receptive to feedback. In addition he takes responsibility for his 
  progress and often identifies learning strategies that will help with his academic 
  success. He is a pleasure to have in the class and to work with, and I look 
  forward to seeing him reach his academic goals.<br>
</p>
<p>POSITIONS OF COUNSEL ON SENTENCING<br>
</p>
<p>[24] Defence counsel submitted that a conditional sentence was appropriate 
  given the respondent's tragic background, his guilty plea, the absence of violence 
  or threats of violence, the fact that he voluntarily ceased the conduct and 
  disclosed it to the authorities, and his positive relationship with his common 
  law spouse and two children.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] The Crown submitted that a penitentiary sentence in the range of three 
  to five years was appropriate because of the egregious breach of trust by the 
  respondent who, in addition to being an older sibling, stood in loco parentis 
  to the complainant by virtue of being her foster parent.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] At trial, the respondent made the following statement to the court:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous. I just wanted to say I'm sorry, I know what I 
  did was wrong and the choices I made weren't the best. I didn't mean to cause 
  [the complainant] any harm, my sons and [common law spouse]. I've turned myself 
  in, I brought myself here to - I don't know if I can fix the future but iron 
  it out, try to make it for a family and ahead of time with maybe counselling 
  and on [the complainant's] behalf and mine maybe. I'm just sorry for what I 
  did. What I did was wrong and I'm willing to accept what comes. Thanks Your 
  Honour.</p>
  
<p>VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The following victim impact statement was filed on the sentencing hearing:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This offence has scared [sic] me for life. I now have a hard time letting people 
  get close to me in fear they are out to hurt me. I feel a lot of betrayal and 
  hatred for D.A.H. for what he did to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to 
  forgive him even though he's family. I have also lost my nephews who are the 
  last blood relatives I have that are close to me because of what D.A.H. has 
  done. I feel very deppresed [sic] and lonley [sic] because I have not seen my 
  nephews in a long time and may not see them again because D.A.H.'s girlfriend 
  thinks that I wanted to let D.A.H. take advantage of the love I had for him 
  by hurting me this way. I also fear that in the future I may not trust another 
  man who tries to get close to me because of what D.A.H. has done. I have emotional 
  problems becase [sic] of lack of trust for people expecially [sic] men. This 
  is how this offence has affected me.<br>
</p>
<p>THE REASONS FOR SENTENCE<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The trial judge accepted that the range of sentence for the abuse of a 
  child by a person standing in loco parentis where intercourse is involved, is 
  three to five years. However, she stated that there were a number of factors 
  which took this case outside of that range, as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Appellant turned himself in prior to detection<br>
  (b) guilty plea, voluntary disclosure, confession to police<br>
  (c) remorse, full acceptance of responsibility<br>
  (d) absence of violence, threats of violence<br>
  (e) little risk of re-offence as complainant lives elsewhere<br>
  (f) disruption of family life<br>
  (g) support of common law spouse; needs of his children<br>
  (h) has had to overcome almost insurmountable obstacles<br>
  (i) the importance of rehabilitation given his youthful age<br>
  (j) he is on the path to financial independence<br>
  (k) promising treatment prospects<br>
  (l) he does not fall within the definition of parent.</p>
  
<p>[29] The trial judge also made the following observations concerning the relationship 
  between the respondent and the complainant:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I do not see that he truly comes within the definition of parent. He and the 
  complainant are half-brother and half-sister. There is a discrepancy in their 
  age which makes him the offender in this relationship. He was old enough, he 
  ought to have known better and he needs to understand that she was in a situation 
  where her security depended upon him. He was opportunistic, although he may 
  not have understood that at the time.<br>
  The fact that the complainant went into that household with the accused and 
  his common law spouse assuming the position of foster parents for the sake of 
  the funding of the complainant in the household does not make him a parent. 
  The complainant was not a young child. She is a child under the law but she 
  was 14 turning 15 and seemingly sexually mature.</p>
  
<p>[30] The trial judge rejected a penitentiary sentence as being inappropriate. 
  She decided that the seriousness of the offence and the need for deterrence 
  and denunciation could be reflected in a term of less than two years. She concluded 
  that the rehabilitation of the respondent would best be achieved by allowing 
  him to serve the sentence in the community. As stated earlier in these reasons, 
  a conditional sentence of eighteen months was imposed, followed by one year 
  probation. A DNA order was also made.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The terms of the conditional sentence were as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) curfew from 11 p.m. to 5:30 am, subject to written permission from the 
  supervisor<br>
  (b) continue in school full time and/or seek and maintain employment<br>
  (c) attend and, actively participate in, and complete rehabilitative treatment 
  in the Sexual Behaviours Program, and psychological counselling with Dr. Brockwell<br>
  (d) abstain absolutely from alcohol and other substances<br>
  (e) non-association with the complainant subject to written permission by her<br>
</p>
<p>[32] The terms of the probation are as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) report as required to the probation officer<br>
  (b) attend school and/or seek and maintain employment<br>
  (c) continue psychological counselling with Dr. Brockwell<br>
  (d) abstain absolutely from alcohol and other substances<br>
  (e) non-association with the complainant subject to written permission by her<br>
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>[33] In R. v. B. (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307, this court held that the &quot;usual 
  range&quot; of sentence in all cases of sexual abuse of children to whom the 
  offender stands in loco parentis if the abuse involves sexual intercourse is 
  three to five years. That decision has been repeatedly followed in this court 
  and nothing in these reasons should be taken as a departure from that holding. 
  However, the court is required to consider the particular circumstances of the 
  case in determining whether the usual range of sentence should be applied. Trial 
  judges are required to do justice in the individual case and, in appropriate 
  circumstances, this may require departure from the usual range of sentence. 
  Bastarache J. made this clear in R. v. Stone (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) 
  at 450:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">One function of appellate courts is to minimize disparity of sentences in cases 
  involving similar offences and similar offenders; see M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 
  92, and McDonnell, supra, at para. 16, per Sopinka J. In carrying out this function, 
  appellate courts may fix ranges for particular categories of offences as guidelines 
  for lower courts. However, in attempting to achieve uniformity, appellate courts 
  must not interfere with sentencing judges' duty to consider all relevant circumstances 
  in sentencing; see McDonnell supra, at para. 43, per Sopinka J.; and at para. 
  66, per McLachlin J. In Archibald, McEachern C. J. clearly stated, at p. 304, 
  that it would be wrong to assume that there is any &quot;precise range that 
  will apply to every case&quot;. In my opinion, this qualification reveals that 
  the Court of Appeal in Archibald correctly intended for trial judges to balance 
  uniformity in sentencing with their duty to consider the circumstances of the 
  particular case [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[34] In this case, the trial judge considered a number of circumstances that, 
  in her view, took this case out of the usual range. Unfortunately, she erred 
  in at least one respect. She seems to have been of the view that the respondent 
  was not in a position of loco parentis with the complainant. I do not think 
  that the admitted facts can fairly bear that interpretation. The respondent's 
  own counsel conceded that the respondent was in a position of parent with the 
  complainant although she was also his half-sister. Given that error in principle, 
  it remains for this court to determine the appropriate sentence: R. v. Rezaie 
  (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[35] I also disagree with the statement of the trial judge that &quot;[t]he 
  complainant was not a young child. She is a child under the law but she was 
  14 turning 15 and seemingly sexually mature.&quot; These comments would suggest 
  that the complainant should bear some responsibility, a position which is simply 
  unsupported by the evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] Notwithstanding the very serious nature of the offence, it is my view 
  that this is a proper case to impose a reformatory sentence and that the sentence 
  be served in the community as a conditional sentence. My primary reason for 
  coming to that conclusion concerns the application of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal 
  Code as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue (1999), 133 
  C.C.C. (3d) 385 and R. v. Wells (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 368.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] I will begin with a consideration of the factors that justify a reformatory 
  sentence in this case, although I point out that many of these circumstances 
  are also relevant to the decision to impose a conditional sentence. First, the 
  circumstances leading to this conviction are quite unusual. As I have indicated, 
  the offence came to light because of the respondent's voluntary disclosure to 
  his psychologist when he was seeking treatment. Thereafter, the respondent was 
  fully co-operative with the police, provided a videotaped statement to them 
  and, of course, pleaded guilty. The respondent has only a minor unrelated criminal 
  record. Second, the respondent's upbringing is simply one of the most horrendous 
  that I have seen. He was subjected to terrible physical abuse at the hands of 
  his own mother and extensive sexual abuse from other relatives. He was heavily 
  addicted to alcohol, having begun to consume alcohol as an infant. Only recently 
  has he been able to start to overcome some of the effects of this background 
  by participating in counselling and various programmes and educational upgrading. 
  In my view, these circumstances justify departure from the usual range as set 
  out in R. v. B, supra.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] It now remains to consider the application of s. 742.1 of the Criminal 
  Code in this case and whether there should be a conditional sentence. The starting 
  place is s. 718.2(e) which provides as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in 
  the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention 
  to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[39] As held in R. v. Wells, supra, at para. 30, &quot;whenever a judge narrows 
  the choice to a sentence involving a sentence of incarceration, the judge is 
  obliged to consider the unique system or background circumstances which may 
  have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the 
  courts.&quot; In short, Gladue and Wells require a different approach to the 
  sentencing of aboriginal offenders because of systemic or background circumstances. 
  In R. v. Sackanay (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 612 at para. 9 this court observed in 
  relation to that offender that his background &quot;is a poignant example of 
  just how much the upbringing of an aboriginal can differ from that of most Canadians.&quot; 
  The same can be said of this respondent. I have set out some of those circumstances 
  above and they need not all be repeated. The most significant are these. The 
  respondent was subjected to alcohol as an infant. He began drinking with his 
  mother when he was five. His father abused his mother and she in turn inflicted 
  terrible physical abuse on him. His father was killed when he was seven. He 
  suffered terrible sexual abuse from his own relatives. His mother was a prostitute 
  and performed sexual acts in his presence. She would disappear for months at 
  a time. As a child, the respondent was left to fend for himself for long periods 
  and spent time in twenty different foster homes and in a group home. This has 
  left the respondent psychologically damaged and with a serious alcohol addiction, 
  a Grade 5 education, and few marketable employment skills.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] In Gladue, supra, the court described the impact of these kind of systemic 
  and background factors, at para. 68:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that systemic and background factors explain in part the incidence 
  of crime and recidivism for non-aboriginal offenders as well. However, it must 
  be recognized that the circumstances of aboriginal offenders differ from those 
  of the majority because many aboriginal people are victims of systemic and direct 
  discrimination, many suffer the legacy of dislocation, and many are substantially 
  affected by poor social and economic conditions. Moreover, as has been emphasized 
  repeatedly in studies and commission reports, aboriginal offenders are, as a 
  result of these unique systemic and background factors, more adversely affected 
  by incarceration and less likely to be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; thereby, because 
  the internment milieu is often culturally inappropriate and regrettably discrimination 
  towards them is so often rampant in penal institutions.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] Gladue also instructs the sentencing court as to how to use the evidence 
  of these systemic and background factors, at para. 69:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In cases where such factors have played a significant role, it is incumbent 
  upon the sentencing judge to consider these factors in evaluating whether imprisonment 
  would actually serve to deter, or to denounce crime in a sense that would be 
  meaningful to the community of which the offender is a member. In many instances, 
  more restorative sentencing principles will gain primary relevance precisely 
  because the prevention of crime as well as individual and social healing cannot 
  occur through other means.</p>
  
<p>[42] At the time that the respondent disclosed the commission of his offence, 
  he had begun to access resources in the community that could begin to help him 
  deal with the consequences of his terrible upbringing. Earlier interventions 
  at the time his relatives sexually assaulted him and when he assaulted his common-law 
  wife had not met with much success. The difference now seems to be that it is 
  the respondent who is motivated to try to recover from the years of abuse and 
  alcoholism. In this, as I have said, he has the support of a number of community-based 
  resources. He had a Grade 5 education. He is now taking courses to upgrade his 
  education at Confederation College. He has completed one course and is now taking 
  a literacy and basic skills course. He has taken steps to deal with the sexual 
  problems at Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital. He has continued to see the psychologist 
  to whom he made the initial disclosure. He is abstaining from the consumption 
  of alcohol and drugs. Finally, and significantly, the respondent has the support 
  of his common-law spouse. She is hopeful that in time she and the respondent 
  will be able to re-establish their family unit.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] I recognize that a conditional sentence in this type of offence is a highly 
  unusual disposition. However, I am of the view that such a disposition is consistent 
  with s. 718.2(e) of the Code, and I am satisfied that with appropriate conditions 
  the sentence can meet the important objectives of deterrence and denunciation. 
  In that respect, I do not consider the conditions imposed by the trial judge 
  to be appropriate. They were simply not sufficiently punitive. In particular, 
  at a minimum, the trial judge should have directed that the respondent be under 
  house arrest. The curfew that was imposed was from 11:00 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. It 
  is my respectful view that such a minimal curfew in any conditional sentence 
  risks undermining public confidence in the conditional sentencing regime.<br>
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br>
</p>
<p>[44] I would increase the conditional sentence to two years less one day and 
  increase the probation period to two years. The terms of the balance of the 
  conditional sentence are to be as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) The respondent to remain in or on his residential property at all times 
  except for the following: transportation to and from and attendance at his employment; 
  pre-authorized attendance for ordinary medical and dental requirements, exempting 
  emergency conditions; pre-authorized attendance for visits with children; pre-authorized 
  attendance for religious service; shopping on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 
  a.m.; also as required for his community service, as required for reporting 
  to his supervisor and for children's activities, provided they are pre-authorized 
  by his supervisor.<br>
  (b) The respondent will abstain from the consumption of alcohol.<br>
  (c) He will provide samples of blood or breath for alcohol analysis upon demand 
  by his supervisor or a peace officer.<br>
  (d) He will perform 150 hours of community services as directed by his supervisor.<br>
  (e) When off his residential property, the respondent will carry a copy of this 
  order, which he will provide to police upon request for identification.<br>
  (f) The respondent will take counselling as may be directed by his supervisor 
  and actively participate therein.<br>
  (g) The respondent will not communicate or associate with the complainant C. 
  D. in any way; he will not be at her residence or place of employment.</p>
