<p>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Justices James D. Carnwath, 
  Ted Matlow and Anne M. Molloy) released June 27, 2000 and reported at [2000] 
  O.J. No. 2927, and from the judgment of Justice Harry J. Keenan of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 11, 2001 and reported at 14 C.P.C. (5th) 134.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] These two appeals were heard together, as the proceedings are related. The 
  first appeal is from an order of the Divisional Court staying the action commenced 
  by the appellant Dalimpex Ltd. (&quot;Dalimpex&quot;) against all three respondents 
  pending the final arbitration, by the Court of Arbitration in Poland, of all 
  disputes between Dalimpex and the respondent Agros Trading Spolka Z.O.O. (&quot;Agros&quot;). 
  The second appeal is from a &quot;provisional&quot; judgment recognizing an 
  award of the Court of Arbitration in Poland obtained by Agros against Dalimpex 
  as a valid and enforceable judgment in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [2] Two central questions are raised on these appeals: (1) whether the Court 
  of Arbitration in Poland is the proper arbitrator under the arbitration agreement 
  between Dalimpex and Agros; and (2) whether the disputes that have arisen between 
  Dalimpex and Agros fall within the scope of that agreement. In the event that 
  these questions are answered in the affirmative, a subsidiary question is raised 
  on the first appeal as to whether the other two defendants in the Dalimpex action, 
  Andrzej Janicki and Agropol International Trade Ltd., are privies in interest 
  to Agros such that Dalimpex's action against all three respondents should be 
  stayed pending final resolution of the disputes by arbitration.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the first issue, I have concluded that the Court of Arbitration in Poland 
  is the proper arbitrator under the arbitration agreement. On the second issue, 
  it is my view that it is at least arguable that the disputes, in both the Dalimpex 
  action in Ontario and the Agros arbitration proceeding in Poland, fall within 
  the scope of the arbitration agreement and that the preferable approach is to 
  leave any definitive pronouncement on the scope of the agreement to be determined 
  by the arbitral tribunal as decision-maker of first instance. On the subsidiary 
  question, I have concluded that all three defendants in the Dalimpex action 
  are privies in interest and that Dalimpex's claims essentially stand or fall 
  on the merits of its action against Agros. </p>
<p>
  [4] Consequently, it is my view that Dalimpex's action as against all three 
  respondents was properly stayed pending final arbitration of the disputes between 
  Dalimpex and Agros before the Court of Arbitration in Poland and I would dismiss 
  the appeal from the order of the Divisional Court. On the second appeal, it 
  is my view that the &quot;provisional&quot; judgment should be set aside, and 
  the application to recognize and enforce the arbitral award obtained by Agros 
  should be adjourned pending the final disposition of Dalimpex's appeal from 
  the arbitral award in the Polish courts. I would therefore allow the second 
  appeal and order accordingly. </p>
<p>
  II. The Nature of the Disputes Between the Parties </p>
<p>
  [5] The main protagonists in this litigation are Dalimpex and Agros. Prior to 
  the commencement of this action in 1998, these two parties did business together 
  for approximately thirty years. Dalimpex is a Canadian company that imports 
  and distributes various goods, most of which are manufactured in Poland. A large 
  portion of Dalimpex's business consists of food products, and its major supplier 
  was Agros, a large Polish food conglomerate and broker. </p>
<p>
  [6] In 1983, Dalimpex and Agros entered into an amended Agency Agreement (an 
  earlier one had been entered into in 1968) giving Dalimpex the right to sell 
  products of Agros in Canada on commission. Under the terms of the agreement, 
  Agros could trade in the same goods in Canada on its own behalf but Dalimpex 
  was to be paid a reduced commission on such direct sales. Dalimpex could also 
  purchase goods directly from Agros and trade on its own behalf with its own 
  customers. Dalimpex was obliged to keep Agros fully informed about all of its 
  activities and to &quot;keep business secret&quot; both within the duration 
  of the agreement and after its expiration. The agreement, which came into effect 
  on January 1st, 1984, was for an unlimited period of time. However, it could 
  be terminated by either party upon six months notice. The Agency Agreement was 
  drafted in English but provided that only Polish law applied to it. It contained 
  the following arbitration clause: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Any disputes which may arise in connection with interpretation or execution 
  of this Agreement will be settled by the College of Arbitrators /Arbitration 
  Court/ at the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade in Warsaw. Decision of this College 
  will be final and binding for both parties. Competence of any state courts is 
  absolutely excluded. </p>
<p>
  [7] In 1989, legislative changes were made by the Polish government and the 
  Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade ceased to exist. A new body known as the National 
  Chamber of Commerce was created to &quot;[take] over all matters, liabilities 
  and assets of the hitherto Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade&quot;. The National 
  Chamber of Commerce was given the power to create a separate Polish Chamber 
  of Foreign Trade, and through it, a new College of Arbitrators. Rather, it created 
  a new arbitral body known as the Court of Arbitration. As will be discussed 
  in more detail later, the question whether the arbitration clause encompassed 
  this new arbitral tribunal as the chosen arbitrator of disputes between the 
  parties became one of the central issues in the litigation between the parties 
  before the Ontario courts. </p>
<p>
  [8] During the course of 1994, Agros guaranteed a portion of Dalimpex's line 
  of credit with the Toronto Dominion Bank by posting a time-limited letter of 
  credit with the Toronto Dominion Bank in the amount of U.S. $400,000. Dalimpex 
  ran into financial difficulties and on June 28, 1998, the bank satisfied its 
  claims against Dalimpex from the guarantee to the full extent of the letter 
  of credit. On June 29, 1998, Dalimpex received a letter from Agros terminating 
  the Agency Agreement effective at the end of 1998.</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondent Andrzej Janicki (&quot;Janicki&quot;) was a long term employee 
  of Agros who became an employee and senior executive of Dalimpex in 1993. Shortly 
  after Agros gave notice of termination of the Agency Agreement, Janicki resigned 
  from his employment with Dalimpex in July 1998 and subsequently became an employee 
  and senior executive of the respondent Agropol International Trade Ltd. (&quot;Agropol&quot;), 
  an Ontario corporation incorporated in July 1998. </p>
<p>
  [10] Dalimpex alleges that, during the years 1996, 1997 and 1998, Janicki conspired 
  with Agros and then with Agropol to injure Dalimpex by appropriating for themselves 
  Dalimpex's customers, confidential information, and food business in Canada. 
  Among other things, Dalimpex alleges that the respondents made secret arrangements 
  with each other for Agros to withdraw its commitment to guarantee Dalimpex's 
  indebtedness with the TD bank for the purpose of causing Dalimpex severe financial 
  difficulty.</p>
<p>
  [11] Dalimpex therefore commenced this action on September 2, 1998 claiming 
  as against Janicki damages for breach of contract, breach of trust and breach 
  of fiduciary duty. As against Agros, Dalimpex claims damages for conspiracy, 
  interference with the economic relationship between Dalimpex and Janicki and 
  inducing a breach of the contract between Dalimpex and Janicki. Dalimpex further 
  claims against all respondents an injunction, an accounting of all transactions 
  conducted with its customers and disgorgement of all profits generated by those 
  transactions. </p>
<p>
  [12] In its Statement of Defence, Agros agrees that the relationship between 
  Dalimpex and itself is governed by the terms of the 1983 Agency Agreement. Agros 
  pleads firstly that the only competent body to hear Dalimpex's claim against 
  it is the Court of Arbitration at the Polish Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw. 
  The respondents further plead that, under the terms of the Agency Agreement, 
  Dalimpex was to be the agent of Agros; that all of the customers and confidential 
  information were the property of Agros; that Janicki was at all times the agent 
  of Agros appointed to protect its interests under the agreement; and that Agros 
  was entitled to terminate its relationship with Dalimpex at any time with proper 
  notice. Agros further pleads that it was under no obligation to renew its guarantee 
  of Dalimpex's indebtedness. Consequently, the respondents plead that Dalimpex's 
  claims are without foundation. </p>
<p>
  [13] On October 23, 1998, shortly after the commencement of Dalimpex's action 
  in Ontario, Agros instituted a proceeding against Dalimpex in the Court of Arbitration 
  in Poland claiming reimbursement of the monies paid under the letter of credit 
  in the amount of U.S. $403,646.16 plus interest, and U.S. $36,590.40 for unpaid 
  goods purchased by Dalimpex. Dalimpex defended the claim on the ground of lack 
  of jurisdiction only and did not present evidence on the merits of the claim. 
  As will be further discussed later, Dalimpex's jurisdictional argument was based, 
  not on the identity of the tribunal but on the ground that the bank guarantee 
  fell outside the scope of the Agency Agreement and the arbitration clause. By 
  majority decision dated September 30, 1999, the Court of Arbitration held that 
  the dispute fell within the scope of its jurisdiction and granted an award in 
  the amount of U.S. $440,236.56. In November 1999, Dalimpex brought an application 
  before the Polish courts to set the award aside based on the same jurisdictional 
  argument. Sometime after the decisions under appeal before this court were rendered, 
  the application to set aside the arbitral award was dismissed and Dalimpex launched 
  an appeal from that decision. That appeal is still pending before the Polish 
  courts. </p>
<p>
  III. The Proceedings Under Appeal</p>
<p>
  1. The motion for a stay and referral to arbitration</p>
<p>
  [14] On April 30, 1999, Agros moved under s. 106 of the Courts of Justice Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 and article 8 of the Schedule to the Ontario International 
  Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9 for a stay of the action commenced 
  by Dalimpex and a referral of the underlying disputes to the Court of Arbitration 
  in Poland. The motion was dismissed by Mandel J. on the grounds that the arbitrator 
  named in the arbitration clause had ceased to exist, and the tort claims fell 
  outside the scope of the arbitration agreement. On appeal to the Divisional 
  Court, the motion judge's decision was overturned by majority judgment delivered 
  by Molloy J. (Carnwath J. concurring, Matlow J. dissenting.) The majority of 
  the court held that the arbitration clause was broad enough to encompass the 
  existing Court of Arbitration and that the disputes fell within the scope of 
  the arbitration clause. The Divisional Court granted a stay of Dalimpex's action 
  against the three respondents pending final resolution by arbitration of all 
  disputes between Dalimpex and Agros, and referred the disputes to the Court 
  of Arbitration of the Polish Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw. </p>
<p>
  [15] Dalimpex appeals from the order of the Divisional Court, with leave of 
  this court. Dalimpex raises two main issues, the first relating to the identity 
  of the arbitrator named under the arbitration clause, and the second relating 
  to the scope of arbitrable disputes under the Agency Agreement. </p>
<p>
  2. The application for recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award</p>
<p>
  [16] On March 1, 2000, Agros filed a notice of application in the Ontario Superior 
  Court of Justice under article 35 of the Schedule to the International Commercial 
  Arbitration Act for recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. The application 
  was heard on July 4, 2001. Keenan J. granted the application and made a &quot;provisional&quot; 
  judgment recognizing the award of the Court of Arbitration in Poland against 
  Dalimpex as valid and enforceable in Ontario. The judgment further provides 
  that it must be vacated in the event that the arbitral award is set aside by 
  the Polish courts.</p>
<p>
  [17] Dalimpex appeals from this judgment essentially on the same grounds that 
  it advances on the first appeal. It argues that the arbitral award should not 
  be enforced in Ontario for two reasons: first, because the Court of Arbitration 
  in Poland was not the parties' chosen arbitrator, and second, because it did 
  not have jurisdiction over the dispute in question. Agros cross-appeals on the 
  basis that the judgment should not have been &quot;provisional&quot; but, rather, 
  should have been final and then stayed pending any appeal from the award in 
  the Polish courts. On the cross-appeal, Dalimpex agrees that, if the judgment 
  recognizing the arbitration award is to stand, the judgment should be amended 
  as submitted by Agros. </p>
<p>
  IV. Analysis</p>
<p>A. The Motion for a Stay and Referral to Arbitration</p>
<p>
  1. The Role of the Court </p>
<p>
  [18] An additional question was raised as part of the argument on the two main 
  issues before the court. It is an important one in the context of a motion for 
  a stay of a court action pending arbitration proceedings. The question is whether 
  it is the role of the court, in cases where the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal 
  has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction, to make a definitive pronouncement 
  on the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, or whether the preferable approach is 
  to leave the matter to the arbitrator as decision-maker of first instance. The 
  answer to that question depends largely on any applicable legislative provisions, 
  the wording of the arbitration agreement, and the nature of the dispute. </p>
<p>
  [19] In this case, the motion for referral to arbitration was brought under 
  article 8 of the Schedule to the International Commercial Arbitration Act. It 
  reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Article 8. Arbitration agreement and substantive claim before 
  court </p>
<p class="indent">(1) A court before which an action is brought in a matter which 
  is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not 
  later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, 
  refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null 
  and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where an action referred to in paragraph (1) of this article 
  has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, 
  and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court. </p>
<p>
  [20] The wording of article 8 is mandatory. Hence, a court that would otherwise 
  have jurisdiction over an action that is brought before it is required to refer 
  those matters which are the subject of an arbitration agreement to arbitration 
  in accordance with the agreement of the parties. There is no doubt that the 
  court, not the arbitral tribunal, has the competence to determine the court's 
  own jurisdiction in respect of the action that is brought before it. It is in 
  the context of determining the scope of its own jurisdiction that a court will 
  often make determinative findings in respect of the scope of the arbitration 
  agreement. However, article 16 of the Schedule to the International Commercial 
  Arbitration Act makes it clear that the arbitral tribunal has the competence 
  to rule on its own jurisdiction: </p>
<p class="indent"> Article 16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its 
  jurisdiction </p>
<p class="indent">(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, 
  including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration 
  agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract 
  shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. 
  A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall 
  not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction 
  shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A 
  party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he has appointed, 
  or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral 
  tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as 
  the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during 
  the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a 
  later plea if it considers the delay justified. </p>
<p class="indent">(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in 
  paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary question or in an award 
  on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that 
  it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having 
  received notice of that ruling, the [Superior Court of Justice] to decide the 
  matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is 
  pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make 
  an award. </p>
<p>
  [21] It is my view that the proper approach to be taken by the court on a motion 
  pursuant to article 8 is that set out by Hinkson J.A. of the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal in Gulf Canada Resources v. Arochem International (1992), 43 
  C.P.R. (3d) 390. That case was decided under the British Columbia International 
  Commercial Arbitration Act, S.B.C. 1986, c. 14 of which ss. 8 and 16 are substantially 
  identical to articles 8 and 16 of the Schedule to the Ontario statute. Hinkson 
  J.A. wrote at p. 397: </p>
<p class="indent"> Considering s. 8(1) in relation to the provisions of s. 16 
  and the jurisdiction conferred on the arbitral tribunal, in my opinion, it is 
  not for the court on an application for a stay of proceedings to reach any final 
  determination as to the scope of the arbitration agreement or whether a particular 
  party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement, because 
  those are matters within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Only where 
  it is clear that the dispute is outside the terms of the arbitration agreement, 
  or that a party is not a party to the arbitration agreement, or that the application 
  is out of time should the court reach any final determination in respect of 
  such matters on an application for a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent">Where it is arguable that the dispute falls within the terms 
  of the arbitration agreement or where it is arguable that a party to the legal 
  proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement then, in my view, the stay 
  should be granted and those matters left to be determined by the arbitral tribunal.</p>
<p>
  [22] An issue may also arise on an article 8 motion as to whether the agreement 
  is (a) null and void; (b) inoperative; or (c) incapable of being performed. 
  In the same way, where it is clear that one of these situations exist, the court 
  will make a determinative finding to that effect and dismiss the motion for 
  referral. However, in cases where it is not clear, it may be preferable to leave 
  any issue related to the &quot;existence or validity of the arbitration agreement&quot; 
  for the arbitral tribunal to determine in the first instance under article 16. 
  In my view, this deferential approach is consistent with both the wording of 
  the legislation and the intention of the parties to refer their disputes to 
  arbitration. </p>
<p>
  [23] I will comment further on the desirability of this approach as I deal with 
  each of the substantive issues on the appeal. </p>
<p>
  2. The identity of the arbitrator</p>
<p>
  [24] The first issue raised by Dalimpex is whether the Court of Arbitration 
  in Poland is the proper arbitrator under the agreement. For convenience, I repeat 
  the wording of the arbitration clause: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Any disputes which may arise in connection with interpretation or execution 
  of this Agreement will be settled by the College of Arbitrators /Arbitration 
  Court/ at the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade in Warsaw. Decision of this College 
  will be final and binding for both parties. Competence of any state courts is 
  absolutely excluded.</p>
<p>
  [25] The question of whether the existing Court of Arbitration was the legal 
  successor to the College of Arbitrators became central to the proceedings below 
  and, indeed, it formed a substantial part of Dalimpex's argument before this 
  court. Expert opinion evidence was filed by both parties on this question. </p>
<p>
  [26] At first instance, the motion judge held that the new tribunal was not 
  the legal successor of the arbitrator named in the Agency Agreement. He then 
  accepted the opinion of one of the experts that under Polish law, the arbitration 
  clause fails if the arbitrator can no longer act. Therefore he concluded that 
  the arbitration clause was incapable of being performed. </p>
<p>
  [27] On appeal, the Divisional Court held that the motion judge erred in so 
  concluding. Molloy J., in writing for the majority, stated as follows at paras. 
  23-26: </p>
<p class="indent"> With the greatest of respect, we are of the view that Mandel 
  J. erred in framing the question before him as he did. It is certainly true 
  that if the new Court of Arbitration is the legal successor of the former &quot;College 
  of Arbitrators&quot; then the arbitration clause is enforceable. However, the 
  reverse is not necessarily true. To uphold the arbitration clause, it is not 
  necessary to prove as a matter of law that the Court of Arbitration is the legal 
  successor of the College of Arbitrators. Rather, the appropriate test is to 
  consider whether the language used by the parties, reasonably interpreted, is 
  capable of being construed as including a referral of disputes to the new Court 
  of Arbitration in Warsaw.</p>
<p class="indent">It is significant that the language used in the arbitration 
  clause in naming the arbitrator is not limited to &quot;College of Arbitrators&quot;. 
  The agreement refers to the &quot;College of Arbitrators/Arbitration Court/ 
  at the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade in Warsaw&quot;. In our opinion the inclusion 
  of the generic words &quot;Arbitration Court&quot; imports a measure of flexibility 
  in respect of the identity of the arbitration tribunal. Otherwise there would 
  be no need to include those words at all. The insertion of the words &quot;Arbitration 
  Court&quot; also brings a degree of ambiguity to the arbitration clause. Where 
  an arbitration clause is capable of bearing two interpretations, and one of 
  those interpretations fairly provides for arbitration, the courts should lean 
  towards that option: Canadian National Railway Co. v. Lovat Tunnel Equipment 
  Inc. (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at 390 (Ont. C.A.) citing, Blair J. in Onex 
  Corp. v. Ball Corp. (1994), 12 B.L.R. (2d) 151 at 160 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).</p>
<p class="indent">It was clearly the intention of the parties to submit their 
  disputes to arbitration. It is possible to interpret the arbitration clause 
  as referring to the College of Arbitrators or other arbitration court at the 
  Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade. The National Chamber of Commerce has pursuant 
  to statute taken over &quot;all matters&quot; of the Polish Chamber of Foreign 
  Trade. The National Chamber of Commerce has created an arbitration court. There 
  is no other arbitration body to which the clause could refer. It is either the 
  Court of Arbitration created by the Chamber of Commerce, or nothing. The expert 
  evidence filed by the defendant established that: </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> the Court of Arbitration was created by the National Chamber of Commerce 
        to perform the same function as the College of Arbitrators; </li>
      <li>as a practical matter, the Court of Arbitration carries on the same 
        function as did its predecessor, the College of Arbitrators;</li>
      <li>the Court of Arbitration at the National Chamber of Commerce is the 
        de facto successor to the College of Arbitrators;</li>
      <li>the Court of Arbitration arbitrates disputes over contracts which refer 
        to the former College of Arbitrators.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="indent">Although the expert evidence filed by the plaintiff takes 
    issue with whether the new arbitration entity is the legal successor of the 
    former, it does not rebut the evidence that as a practical matter the Court 
    of Arbitration has simply replaced the College of Arbitrators. In these circumstances, 
    and given the language of the agreement, it is possible and reasonable to 
    interpret the arbitration clause as encompassing the new Court of Arbitration. 
    Since this interpretation &quot;fairly provides for arbitration&quot; and 
    is consistent with the objective intention of the parties, we are of the view 
    that it is the one that should govern in this case [emphasis in original].</p>
</ul>
<p>
  [28] Dalimpex submits that there was no basis for the Divisional Court to interfere 
  with the motion judge's conclusion on this issue. Dalimpex relies mainly on 
  the reasons of the dissenting justice in the Divisional Court in support of 
  its argument. In essence, the dissenting justice held that there was never any 
  doubt about the identity of the arbitration tribunal contemplated by the parties 
  during the period that the College of Arbitrators existed and that the parties 
  had chosen that arbitrator and no other. </p>
<p>
  [29] Agros submits that the Divisional Court was correct in its interpretation 
  of the arbitration clause. It submits that the words and marks &quot;/Arbitration 
  Court/&quot; should be interpreted as meaning that a more generic arbitration 
  court at the Chamber of Foreign Trade was contemplated by the parties. Agros 
  submits that these words, together with the fact that the Chamber of Commerce 
  is the legal successor to the Chamber of Foreign Trade, provide ample support 
  for this interpretation. Agros also reiterates the submission it made in the 
  courts below that the existing Court of Arbitration is the legal successor to 
  the College of Arbitrators. On this point, Agros seeks leave to file further 
  evidence to show that the Court of Arbitration itself has held in a decision 
  dated May 14, 1993 that there is no basis to question its jurisdiction in cases 
  for which there is a valid registration with the former College of Arbitrators 
  of the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade. </p>
<p>
  [30] In any event, Agros further submits that Dalimpex is estopped from disputing 
  the jurisdiction of the Court of Arbitration on this ground of successorship 
  because it failed to raise this issue before the arbitral tribunal in the proceedings 
  that form the subject-matter of the second appeal. The basis of the estoppel 
  argument is the following. </p>
<p>
  [31] As noted earlier, after Dalimpex brought this action in September 1998, 
  Agros commenced an arbitration proceeding before the Court of Arbitration at 
  the Polish Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw in October 1998. This arbitration proceeding 
  was pending at the time Mandel J. heard and dismissed Agros's motion for a stay 
  in April and May 1999. As set out earlier, it was Dalimpex's position before 
  the motion judge, as it is on this appeal, that the arbitration clause is incapable 
  of enforcement because the named arbitrator has ceased to exist. Agros seeks 
  leave to introduce fresh evidence before this court to show that Dalimpex did 
  not raise this argument before the Court of Arbitration. </p>
<p>
  [32] In May 1999, Dalimpex, through its Polish counsel, made a preliminary submission 
  to the arbitral panel in Poland that it was not competent to conduct the arbitration 
  by virtue of the wording of the arbitration clause in the Agency Agreement. 
  However the proposed fresh evidence establishes that this jurisdictional argument 
  was based on the scope of the arbitration clause and not the identity of the 
  chosen arbitrator. The arbitration panel rejected the jurisdictional argument 
  and, in September 1999, decided the arbitration in favour of Agros. </p>
<p>
  [33] The proposed fresh evidence further establishes that Dalimpex's outstanding 
  appeal from the arbitral award before the Polish courts is also based on the 
  argument that the scope of the arbitration clause does not include matters relating 
  to the bank guarantee and not on any argument that the Court of Arbitration 
  of the Polish Chamber of Commerce is not the tribunal referred to in the Agency 
  Agreement. Agros submits that, given Dalimpex's failure to dispute the constitution 
  of the arbitral panel as the proper arbitrator under the agreement, it is now 
  estopped from raising the issue in these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [34] Dalimpex opposes the motion to introduce the fresh evidence on the ground 
  that the information was available to Agros and should have been presented on 
  the motion for the stay before Mandel J. Indeed, counsel for Dalimpex states 
  that Agros sought to introduce the proposed fresh evidence before Mandel J. 
  but then withdrew its request to present this material. In response, counsel 
  for Agros submits that while he was aware from the start that Dalimpex was disputing 
  the jurisdiction of the Court of Arbitration, he did not know until sometime 
  in 2001 that the jurisdictional issue did not include any argument with respect 
  to the identity of the tribunal as the proper arbitrator.</p>
<p>
  [35] It is my view that the proposed fresh evidence relating to Dalimpex's position 
  before the Court of Arbitration is properly before this court. The decision 
  of the Court of Arbitration, including its ruling on the jurisdictional issue 
  that was raised by Dalimpex, forms an integral part of the record on the second 
  appeal before this court. It is apparent on the face of that record that Dalimpex 
  never questioned the identity of the tribunal as the proper arbitrator in its 
  submissions before the Court of Arbitration, or in its pending appeal from the 
  arbitral award. This court has ordered that both appeals be heard together and 
  Dalimpex presents the same jurisdictional argument in support of its position 
  on both appeals. In these circumstances, it is my view that the evidence can 
  be relied on by Agros on both appeals, regardless of the question of due diligence 
  raised by Dalimpex. In any event, Dalimpex's submission that Agros, by the exercise 
  of due diligence, ought to have discovered earlier that Dalimpex's position 
  before the Ontario courts on this crucial jurisdictional question was, in effect, 
  inconsistent with that adopted in the Polish courts, is rather hollow.</p>
<p>
  [36] There is much merit to the argument that Dalimpex should be precluded from 
  arguing that the Court of Arbitration is not an arbitral institution contemplated 
  by the parties' agreement in circumstances such as these when it has failed 
  to raise this argument before the tribunal itself. The application of the doctrine 
  of issue estoppel would serve to promote consistency and certainty in international 
  commercial matters. However, I do not find it necessary in order to dispose 
  of this ground of appeal to determine in the strict legal sense whether the 
  doctrine applies to the facts of this case. I say this for two reasons. </p>
<p>
  [37] First, I am in agreement with the analysis and the conclusion of Molloy 
  J. of the Divisional Court on the interpretation of the arbitration clause. 
  In my view, it is reasonable to interpret the arbitration clause as encompassing 
  the new Court of Arbitration and, as stated by Molloy J., since this interpretation 
  fairly provides for arbitration and is consistent with the intention of the 
  parties to submit their disputes to arbitration, it should govern. Second, it 
  is my view that the evidence of Dalimpex's failure to object to the identity 
  of the arbitral tribunal, quite apart from any question of estoppel, provides 
  further support to the conclusion that the parties intended by the inclusion 
  of the generic words &quot;Arbitration Court&quot; to import a measure of flexibility 
  in respect of the identity of the arbitration tribunal. Given the ambiguity 
  of the language, the court can consider the conduct of the parties in determining 
  what was intended under the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [38] Before concluding my analysis on this issue, I note that, in my view, it 
  would have been preferable in all the circumstances for this jurisdictional 
  issue to have been decided in the first instance by the arbitral tribunal. On 
  the evidence, it was far from clear that the Court of Arbitration was not the 
  proper arbitrator under the agreement. The question was one that required a 
  consideration of Polish law, including the legal constitution of the foreign 
  arbitral tribunal. In these circumstances, the Court of Arbitration in Poland 
  would have been in a better position to determine the question at probably much 
  less cost to the parties. Hence, it is my view that the motion judge could and 
  should have declined to make a definitive finding on this jurisdictional issue. 
  However, in light of the unfolding of the proceedings, I find it appropriate 
  at this point to simply uphold the definitive finding of the Divisional Court 
  and conclude that the arbitration clause is still valid and capable of enforcement.</p>
<p>
  [39] For these reasons, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  3. The scope of the arbitration clause </p>
<p>
  [40] The motion judge held that Dalimpex's tort claims fell outside the scope 
  of the arbitration clause and were not arbitrable. On appeal, the Divisional 
  Court held that he erred in two respects in coming to this conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [41] First, the court held that the motion judge erred in failing to adopt the 
  approach set out in Gulf Canada as discussed earlier. The court espoused the 
  view at para. 30 that &quot;it is only where it is clear that the dispute in 
  question is outside the terms of the arbitration agreement that the court should 
  usurp the role of the arbitrator as the decision-maker of first instance in 
  respect of jurisdiction.&quot; Second, the court held that the motion judge 
  erred in focusing entirely on the claims made by the plaintiff without considering 
  the defences raised by Agros in determining whether the subject matter of the 
  action was within the arbitration clause. The court stated the following at 
  paras. 31-32: </p>
<p class="indent"> [I]n determining whether the dispute is one that relates to 
  the interpretation or execution of the agency agreement, it is relevant to consider 
  whether the existence of the contractual obligation is a necessary element to 
  create the claim or to defeat it: Kaverit Steel &amp; Crane Ltd. v. Kone Corp. 
  (1992), 87 D.L.R. (4th) 129 at 135 (Alta. C.A.) leave to appeal denied, 93 D.L.R. 
  (4th) vii (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class="indent">In its defence Agros pleads that under the agreement, Dalimpex 
  was to be the agent of Agros, that all of the customers and confidential information 
  were the property of Agros (not Dalimpex), that the individual defendant Janicki 
  was at all times the agent of Agros to protect its interests under the agreement 
  and that Agros was entitled under the agreement to terminate its relationship 
  with Dalimpex at any time. Therefore, Agros argues that because of the contract 
  terms between Agros and Dalimpex, the claims asserted by Dalimpex are without 
  foundation. The defences raised by Agros call into question the interpretation 
  of the agreement as well as the manner in which the contract was performed. 
  As such, they can reasonably be construed as a &quot;dispute in connection with 
  (the) interpretation or execution&quot; of the agreement. Therefore, the dispute 
  between Dalimpex and Agros in the action in this court is covered by the arbitration 
  clause and should be stayed pending determination of those issues by the Court 
  of Arbitration of the National Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw.</p>
<p>
  [42] Dalimpex, of course, disagrees with this analysis and submits that the 
  motion judge was correct in finding that its tort claims clearly fell outside 
  the scope of the arbitration clause. Agros, on the other hand, supports the 
  finding of the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>
  [43] I agree with the analysis and the conclusion of the Divisional Court, except 
  where the court appears to make a definitive finding that &quot;the dispute 
  between Dalimpex and Agros in the action in this court is covered by the arbitration 
  clause.&quot; In my view, it is preferable to leave the matter for final determination 
  to the Court of Arbitration and to stay the action against Agros until final 
  determination of the disputes by arbitration, including any jurisdictional issue, 
  or until further order of the Superior Court of Justice. </p>
<p>
  4. Other respondents' privity of interest </p>
<p>
  [44] On this point, the Divisional Court simply concluded as follows at para. 
  33: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Since the main protagonists in this dispute are Dalimpex and Agros, the claims 
  against other parties in this action should also be stayed pending the determination 
  of the Court of Arbitration: Boart Sweden AB v. NYA Stromnes AB (1988), 41 B.L.R. 
  295 at 304 (Ont. H.C.).</p>
<p>
  [45] Dalimpex did not advance any credible argument to dispute the correctness 
  of this conclusion. In my view, it is obvious from the pleadings that its action 
  against the other two respondents will stand or fall on the merits of the action 
  against Agros. I see no basis to interfere with the order of the Divisional 
  Court extending the stay of the action to Janicki and Agropol. </p>
<p>
  B. The Application for Recognition and Enforcement of the Arbitral Award</p>
<p>
  [46] This application was brought under article 35 of the Schedule to the International 
  Commercial Arbitration Act, supra. The relevant provisions read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Article 35. Recognition and enforcement </p>
<p class="indent">(1) An arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which 
  it was made, shall be recognized as binding and, upon application in writing 
  to the competent court, shall be enforced subject to the provisions of this 
  article and of article 36. </p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> Article 36. Grounds for refusing recognition or enforcement 
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Recognition or enforcement of an arbitral award, irrespective 
  of the country in which it was made, may be refused only: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, if that party furnishes 
  to the competent court where recognition or enforcement is sought proof that: </p>
<p class="indent10"> (i) a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in article 
  7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law 
  to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under 
  the law of the country where the award was made, or </p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given 
  proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings 
  or was otherwise unable to present his case, or </p>
<p class="indent10">(iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or 
  not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains 
  decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided 
  that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated 
  from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions 
  on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced, or </p>
<p class="indent10">(iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral 
  procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing 
  such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the 
  arbitration took place, or </p>
<p class="indent10">(v) the award has not yet become binding on the parties or has 
  been set aside or suspended by a court of the country in which, or under the 
  law of which, that award was made; or </p>
<p class="indent">(b) if the court finds that: </p>
<p class="indent10"> (i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement 
  by arbitration under [the laws of Ontario and any laws of Canada that are in 
  force in Ontario], or </p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) the recognition or enforcement of the award would be 
  contrary to the public policy of [Ontario]. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) If an application for setting aside or suspension of an 
  award has been made to a court referred to in paragraph (1)(a)(v) of this article, 
  the court where recognition or enforcement is sought may, if it considers it 
  proper, adjourn its decision and may also, on the application of the party claiming 
  recognition or enforcement of the award, order the other party to provide appropriate 
  security. </p>
<p>
  [47] Unlike the situation on a motion for a stay, it is clear that, at this 
  stage of the proceedings, it falls upon the court to make a final determination 
  of any issue that may be raised under article 36. </p>
<p>
  [48] In this case, it appears from the record that Dalimpex defended the application 
  on the basis that the arbitral award was not yet binding between the parties. 
  Although the position advanced by Dalimpex is far from clear, it appears from 
  my review of the record that this position was based on three grounds: (a) its 
  appeal to this court from the order of the Divisional Court was still pending; 
  (b) its application to set aside the arbitral award was also pending before 
  the Polish courts; and (c) there had been no confirmation of the arbitral award 
  before a superior court in Poland. Hence, although it was not expressly stated, 
  it would appear that Dalimpex defended the application for recognition and enforcement 
  by invoking articles 36(1)(a)(iii) (the dispute does not fall within the terms 
  of the arbitration agreement), 36(1)(a)(iv) (the composition of the arbitral 
  tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties) and 36(1)(a)(v) 
  (the award has not yet become binding on the parties).</p>
<p>
  [49] On the first ground, Dalimpex simply noted in its material that the question 
  of whether the Court of Arbitration was the proper arbitrator was still pending 
  before the Ontario courts and submitted that the award should not be enforced 
  until final determination of that issue. </p>
<p>
  [50] On the second ground, Dalimpex filed opinion evidence indicating that its 
  appeal from the arbitral award before the Polish courts had &quot;very substantial 
  chances of success, especially because of the strong dissent which was delivered 
  by Professor Rajski, a prominent Polish jurist.&quot; In his dissenting opinion, 
  Professor Rajski expressed the view that the majority of the Court of Arbitration 
  had acted without jurisdiction because, in his view, the subject matter of the 
  claim filed by Agros did not fall within the scope of the Agency Agreement. 
  Rather, the bank guarantee was the subject matter of a separate and new agreement 
  between the parties that did not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause. 
  </p>
<p>
  [51] On the third ground, Dalimpex took the position that the arbitral award 
  was not yet binding on the parties because Agros had not obtained a confirmation 
  of the award from a Polish court superior to the Arbitration Court in accordance 
  with the Polish Code of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p>
  [52] It would appear from the record and the reasons of the application judge 
  that only the third ground was fully argued on the merits. The application judge 
  stated that it was &quot;the only real issue before the court.&quot; On this 
  issue, Dalimpex filed expert evidence in support of its position that the award 
  needed to be confirmed by a superior court in Poland before it was binding on 
  the parties. Agros responded in kind and filed expert opinion evidence that 
  the award was binding between the parties and that no confirmation by a higher 
  Polish court was required. A confirmation was only required in the event that 
  Agros sought to enforce the award in Poland. Since Dalimpex had no assets in 
  Poland, there was no reason for Agros to seek a confirmation of the award in 
  Poland. However, the lack of confirmation in Poland had no effect on the binding 
  nature of the award.</p>
<p>
  [53] The application judge accepted the position advanced by Agros and concluded 
  that the award was binding on the parties. Dalimpex has not advanced any argument 
  before this court on this issue and I see no reason to interfere with the conclusion 
  reached by the application judge on the binding nature of the arbitral award. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] As for the other two grounds, it is unclear from the reasons of the application 
  judge whether he was of the view that the award was not yet binding on the parties 
  because of the two outstanding appeals, one in the Ontario courts and the other 
  before the Polish courts. The application judge expressly recognized that he 
  had the authority to adjourn the application under article 36(2) because there 
  was an outstanding application to set aside the arbitral award before the Polish 
  courts. However, he found it more appropriate in the circumstances to recognize 
  the arbitral award and enter a judgment, but to make the judgment &quot;provisional&quot; 
  pending the outcome of the appeal brought by Dalimpex before the Ontario courts, 
  and subject to being vacated in the event that the arbitral award was set aside 
  by the Polish courts. </p>
<p>
  [55] Both parties take the position that the application judge had no jurisdiction 
  to make a provisional judgment under the statute. As noted earlier, this question 
  is the subject-matter of the cross-appeal. I agree with the joint position of 
  the parties on this issue. The only avenues open to the application judge under 
  articles 35 and 36 were to allow, adjourn or dismiss the application. </p>
<p>
  [56] In its argument before this court, Dalimpex reiterates its position that 
  the application should have been dismissed because &quot;it would be against 
  public policy&quot; to enforce the award before the issues raised in the two 
  outstanding appeals had been finally disposed of. </p>
<p>
  [57] The argument with respect to the outstanding appeal before the Ontario 
  courts and the question of the identity of the arbitral tribunal can be easily 
  disposed of. For the reasons I have stated on the companion appeal, I conclude 
  that the Court of Arbitration was a competent arbitrator under the parties' 
  agreement. Further, I am of the view that Dalimpex's failure to raise this issue 
  before the arbitral tribunal is fatal to his contention on this application 
  that the award should not be recognized and enforced on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [58] As for the issue in the appeal before the Polish courts, the jurisdiction 
  of the arbitral tribunal over the subject-matter, Dalimpex never really addressed 
  the merits on the application or before this court. Rather, Dalimpex simply 
  reiterates its position that the award is yet not binding on the parties until 
  the appeal before the Polish courts is disposed of and submits that it would 
  be against public policy to recognize and enforce the award before that time. 
  </p>
<p>
  [59] Agros never really addressed the question whether the arbitral tribunal 
  had the jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the dispute either. It simply 
  takes the position that the judgment below should be final in its terms and 
  stayed pending the final disposition of the appeal before the Polish courts. 
  I did not understand Agros to take issue, however, with the provision that the 
  judgment must be vacated in the event that the arbitral award was set aside 
  by the Polish courts. </p>
<p>
  [60] In my view, it was entirely correct for the application judge to conclude 
  that the judgment should be vacated in the event that the arbitral award was 
  set aside by the Polish courts because, as he stated, &quot;the only reason 
  for permitting its registration would thereby have disappeared&quot;. However, 
  the converse does not follow. In the event that the appeal from the arbitral 
  award is dismissed, it does not follow that it is automatically recognized and 
  enforced by a final judgment in Ontario. Dalimpex is raising the question of 
  the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction over the subject-matter in defence of the 
  article 35 application. It is entitled to do so under article 36(1)(a)(iii). 
  As it stands, the effect of the judgment below is to leave the final determination 
  on the question of whether the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration 
  clause to the arbitral process. This result renders article 36(1)(a)(iii) meaningless. 
  Under its terms, the application judge must make his or her own determination 
  of the matter.</p>
<p>
  [61] In the circumstances, it is my view that the application should have been 
  adjourned under article 36(2) pending the final decision in the Polish courts. 
  In the event that the arbitral award is set aside, the basis of the application 
  will have disappeared. If the appeal is dismissed, the application can be brought 
  back before a justice of the Superior Court of Justice to be dealt with on the 
  merits on this outstanding issue. </p>
<p>
  V. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [62] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from the order of the Divisional 
  Court with costs to the three respondents. I would allow the appeal on the application 
  to recognize and enforce the arbitral award, set aside the judgment, and adjourn 
  the application to be heard in the Superior Court of Justice after the final 
  determination of the appeal from the arbitral award before the Polish courts. 
  The parties have 30 days to exchange and file their written submissions on costs.
