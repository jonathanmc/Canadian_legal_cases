<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Taking into account the pre-trial custody on a 2:1 basis and the time spent 
  at Harvest House on a 1:1 basis, the sentence for the home invasion was the 
  equivalent of just under 4&frac12; years. That sentence cannot be said to be 
  unfit, nor does it represent an error in principle.</p>
<p> [2] However, we agree with the Crown that the sentence of 6 months for the 
  assault on the taxi driver should be consecutive to the other sentences imposed.</p>
<p> [3] The two offences - the home invasion and the assault on the taxi 
  driver - were completely unrelated and the totality of the sentences, 
  if concurrent, would be inadequate for those offences.</p>
<p> [4] Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence of 
  6 months for assault causing bodily harm on the taxi driver committed September 
  2, 2000 is made consecutive to the other sentences. </p>
