<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants, Ronald and Vivian Davies, appeal from the judgment of J. 
  Wright J. dated December 19, 2001. The trial judge held that the respondent 
  Evelyn Bayda, a real estate agent in Sioux Falls, owed a fiduciary duty to her 
  clients, the Davies, with respect to assisting them to find a new home to purchase 
  once their current home had been sold. However, the trial judge also held that 
  Ms. Bayda's decision to buy for herself a mobile home in Sioux Falls did not 
  constitute a breach of her fiduciary duty because (a) she did not purchase the 
  mobile home using any confidential information received from Mr. Davies and 
  (b) she understood that the Davies believed that they would not be able to purchase 
  the mobile home. In addition, the trial judge held that even if Ms. Bayda breached 
  her fiduciary duty to the Davies, they did not sustain any damage because their 
  financial circumstances &quot;put an end to any practical attempt to buy&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellants appeal the second (breach of fiduciary duty) and third (no 
  damage) components of the trial judge's reasons and conclusions.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The question of fiduciary duty is a question of mixed fact and law; accordingly, 
  the trial judge's conclusion on this issue is entitled to substantial deference: 
  see Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In our view, the trial judge's conclusion that Ms. Bayda did not misuse 
  confidential information received from Mr. Davies is strongly supported in the 
  record. The trial judge said: &quot;In fact the evidence is overwhelming that 
  Mrs. Bayda learned of the availability of 4 Pelto Rd. through the Pearen family 
  and then followed up that information with inquires to the owner&quot;. We see 
  no basis for challenging this conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge's conclusion on the other branch of the breach issue, namely 
  that Mr. Davies had essentially conveyed to Ms. Bayda that he believed he was 
  no longer able to buy the mobile home, is also supported in the record.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] Finally, on the question of remedy, we note that the remedy sought by the 
  appellants is a declaration of constructive trust. This is an equitable remedy. 
  Even if we agreed with the appellants on the breach issue, we do not think that 
  their conduct entitles them to such a remedy. The appellants not only did not 
  object to Ms. Bayda's purchase of the mobile home in June 1997; instead, they 
  accepted Ms. Bayda's offer to rent it to them, lived in it for more that a year, 
  accepted improvements and repairs to the home, and then initiated an action 
  challenging Ms. Bayda's conduct.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.<br>
