<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Joseph W. Quinn of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 7, 2003.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] The issue in these appeals is whether the transfer of roads from the Regional 
  Municipality of Niagara Falls (&quot;Region&quot;) to The Corporation of the 
  City of Niagara Falls (&quot;City&quot;) instantly and completely extinguished 
  the liability of the Region for any negligence with respect to non-repair of 
  the roads under s. 284 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45, as amended.<a href="#r1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  That section provides:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The council of the corporation that has jurisdiction over 
  a highway or bridge shall keep it in a state of repair that is reasonable in 
  light of all the circumstances, including the character and location of the 
  highway or bridge.</p>
<p class="indent">(1.1) In case of default, the corporation, subject to the Negligence 
  Act, is liable for all damages any person sustains because of the default. </p>
<p class="indent">(1.2) The corporation is not liable under subsection (1) or 
  (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable state of repair 
  if it did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know about 
  the state of repair of the highway or bridge.</p>
<p class="indent">(1.3) The corporation is not liable under subsection (1) or 
  (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable state of repair 
  if it took reasonable steps to prevent the default from arising. </p>
<p> [2] The Region is statutorily entitled to remove roads from its regional road 
  system and to transfer a regional road, or a portion thereof, to a municipality 
  in which the road or portion thereof is situated (see ss. 23(2) and (6) of the 
  Regional Municipalities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.R.8.<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  The effect of the transfer, as provided in s. 23(6), is to vest jurisdiction 
  and control over the roads in the transferee. Section 23(6) of the Regional 
  Municipalities Act states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (6) Where a road or a part thereof is removed from the regional road system&#133;such 
  road or part is thereupon transferred to and the jurisdiction and control and 
  the soil and freehold thereof is thereupon vested in the area municipality in 
  which it is situate, and the area municipality may sue upon any rights or under 
  any agreements of by-laws in the same manner and to the same extent as the Regional 
  Corporation in respect of such road.</p>
<p>
  [3] It is against this legislative background that the facts must be considered. 
  The intersection of Biggar Road and Morris Road used to be the responsibility 
  of the Region. The City, an area municipality in which Biggar and Morris Roads 
  were situated, was aware of the Region's intention to transfer or &quot;download&quot; 
  these and parts of 15 other roads totalling approximately 45.62 kilometres to 
  it in advance of the transfer. Although the Region could have transferred the 
  roads without the consent of the City, the Region discussed the proposed transfer 
  with the City and it agreed to the transfer in principle. The transfer, originally 
  scheduled for April 7, 2000, was postponed and took place instead on May 1, 
  2000. </p>
<p>
  [4] On August 16, 2000, the plaintiff, Thomas Davis, was a motorcyclist travelling 
  westbound on Biggar Road. When he came to the intersection of Biggar Road and 
  Morris Road, the defendant, David Grand, who was driving an ATV in a northerly 
  direction on Morris Road, struck him. Thomas Davis and the other plaintiffs 
  commenced an action for damages. They allege in their statement of claim that 
  Thomas Davis had the right of way at the intersection and that David Grand failed 
  to stop at the stop sign on Morris Road governing northbound traffic. The plaintiffs 
  further allege that David Grand's failure to stop at the intersection was due 
  partly or entirely to overgrown brush and trees on public and private property 
  in the southeast quadrant of the intersection that obscured his view of the 
  stop sign. The accident took place 108 days after the Region had transferred 
  the intersection to the City. The plaintiffs sued both the Region and the City 
  alleging breach of the statutory duty of repair.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Region moved for summary judgment to dismiss the claim against it on 
  the basis that once the transfer took place s. 23(6) of the Regional Municipalities 
  Act rendered the City liable for any non-repair of the road. The City took the 
  position that liability for non-repair that occurred prior to the transfer from 
  the Region ought not to be immediately extinguished by the transfer. The City 
  further submitted that the Region had a duty to make it aware of any roads that 
  were in a state of non-repair when the transfer took place and that it had not 
  had sufficient time to see that the roads transferred were in a reasonable state 
  of repair. </p>
<p>
  [6] Quinn J. granted the Region's motion for summary judgment and the City appealed. 
  Paragraphs 29 to 34 form the core of the motion judge's reasons and are reproduced 
  below: </p>
<p class="indent"> [29] If overhanging foliage obscured the stop sign on Morris 
  Road, that state of affairs is capable of constituting non-repair under s. 284(1) 
  of the Municipal Act; and, such non-repair can amount to actionable negligence 
  if it caused or contributed to the August 16th accident. Mr. Newcombe argues 
  that it is a triable question of fact whether the City had the opportunity to 
  inspect Biggar Road and whether the City relied on the Region to identify any 
  areas that required immediate inspection or maintenance. In my opinion, there 
  is no genuine issue of fact to be tried. Instead, the issue here is one of law 
  and it can be resolved now. </p>
<p class="indent">[30] As a matter of law, s. 23(6) of the Regional Municipalities 
  Act operates as a complete transfer of the relevant portion of Biggar Road to 
  the City. This transfer, as I see it, includes all liabilities, such as non-repair 
  under s. 284 of the Municipal Act. Even though s. 23(6) does not expressly mention 
  liabilities, I think it would be illogical to interpret the transfer of &quot;jurisdiction 
  and control&quot; so as to exclude liabilities. If this produces a bad bargain 
  for the City, it is one that is permitted by the legislation. Jurisdiction over 
  Biggar Road and responsibility for any then-existing non-repair passed concurrently 
  from the Region to the City on May 1, 2000. </p>
<p class="indent">[31] The City knew of the pending road transfer since at least 
  mid-1999 and, in my opinion, it has merely stated (and not explained) its inability 
  to do a site review of Biggar Road before May 1, 2000. It was the responsibility 
  of the City to inspect Biggar Road before the transfer. Absent fraud or misrepresentation 
  by the Region, the reason for the City's failure to inspect is not relevant. 
</p>
<p class="indent">[32] As for after the date of transfer, neither the Regional 
  Municipalities Act nor the by-law provides for any delayed or overlapping jurisdiction 
  following the date of a road transfer. There is no reason, rooted in law, logic 
  or policy, to read into s. 23(6) (or the by-law) an inspection period, that 
  is to say, a provision whereby the City is permitted a period of time, after 
  the effective date of the transfer, to inspect the road. Equally, there is no 
  basis for holding that, for a period of time after the effective date of the 
  transfer, the liability for non-repair should fall on the Region and City jointly. 
  Section 23(6) does not permit such a finding; neither does the by-law itself. 
</p>
<p class="indent">[33] Accordingly, whether or not the City had the opportunity 
  to inspect Biggar Road before May 1st (or even before August 16th) is irrelevant. 
  The ability to inspect is a non-issue. </p>
<p class="indent">[34] Perhaps I should add that my decision might have been different 
  if the alleged non-repair was related to a latent defect concerning Biggar Road 
  in which case an issue of fact could arise as to whether the Region had, or 
  should have had, knowledge of the defect. However, at bar, the alleged non-repair 
  is of the patent variety, being easily detectable by visual inspection. </p>
<p>
  [7] In enacting s. 284 and the successor legislation the legislature made municipalities 
  liable to users of the highway for negligent maintenance of roads. The Regional 
  Municipalities Act says nothing about liability following a transfer. It does 
  not follow from the transfer of jurisdiction to the City over future maintenance 
  that the prior negligence of the Region becomes the City's responsibility. To 
  determine the issue of liability for prior negligence resort must be had to 
  the common law and evolving principles of tort law.</p>
<p>
  [8] There is no issue that overhanging foliage that obscures a stop sign can 
  create a state of non-repair. The result of the interpretation of Quinn J. is 
  that the Region would not be liable for any negligence on its part in permitting 
  the bushes to become overgrown and obscure the stop sign prior to the transfer 
  of the intersection to the City. At the same time, if, pursuant to s. 284(1.2), 
  the City did not know of the state of non-repair of the road and could not reasonably 
  have been expected to know about it, the City may avoid liability. In this situation, 
  the plaintiffs could be left without a remedy for their damages. Once both fault 
  and injury have been established, the prospect of an uncompensated harm is to 
  be avoided. See Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp., [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634 at 685 and 
  the discussion by Professor Vaughan Black in &quot;The Transformation of Causation 
  in the Supreme Court: Dilution and 'Policyization'&quot; in T. Archibald &amp; 
  M. Cochrane, eds., The Annual Review of Civil Litigation, 2002 ed. (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2003) 187 at 189-90 and 198-200. The decision of the motions judge 
  does not avoid the prospect of an uncompensated harm where both fault and injury 
  have been established. </p>
<p>
  [9] In Giant Tiger Stores Ltd. v. 697781 Ontario Ltd., [1995] O.J. No. 3893, 
  (Gen. Div.) Cumming J. dealt with a motion for summary judgment brought by the 
  defendants The Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada (&quot;MICC&quot;), the 
  former owner of the Hawkesbury Town Centre, and Touche Ross and Co. (&quot;Touche 
  Ross&quot;), the former property manager. The plaintiffs, Giant Tiger Stores 
  Ltd. (&quot;Giant Tiger&quot;) et al. were tenants whose property had been damaged 
  by an explosion and fire at the Hawkesbury Town Centre. The explosion was alleged 
  to have occurred because of a malfunction of the oil-fired burner and boiler 
  that were part of the furnace on the premises that Touche Ross had a duty to 
  inspect. Two days before the fire, 697781 Ontario Ltd. had taken over ownership 
  of the Centre. Prior to this, 635213 Ontario Inc. was the intermediate owner 
  for eleven months. Assuming that the deterioration of the burner giving rise 
  to the explosion occurred at least in part during the ownership of MICC, Cumming 
  J. addressed the question of whether a duty of care was owed by MICC to Giant 
  Tiger et al. to avoid the damage. He held that there was. At paras. 42-43 of 
  his reasons Cumming J. stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> [42] The proximity of MICC to these persons is not automatically 
  broken by reason of the mere fact of transfer of ownership. If MICC was negligent 
  in respect of its stewardship of the oil-burner and that was at least a contributing 
  cause to the explosion and fire then MICC's responsibility remains. </p>
<p class="indent">[43] The lapse of time following ownership may mean that at 
  some point in time it cannot be said either that there is a relationship of 
  proximity, or if there is, that the negligence of MICC is the proximate cause 
  of the loss thereafter occurring. That is, the lapse of time may affect the 
  duration of the vendor's liability. It is a question of fact considering all 
  the circumstances as to when this might be, requiring a trial. </p>
<p>
  [10] Similarly, in Winnipeg Condominium Corp. No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co., 
  [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85, a decision to which Cumming J. referred, La Forest, J. held 
  on behalf of the Court that the contract negotiated between Bird Construction 
  Co., a general contractor, and Tuxedo Properties Co. Ltd., the developer and 
  original owner of the building, did not insulate Bird from a separate independent 
  duty in tort to the current condominium owners of the building. He held that 
  the law had now progressed to the point where contractors (as well as subcontractors, 
  architects and engineers) who take part in the design and construction of a 
  building will owe a duty in tort to subsequent purchasers of the building if 
  it can be shown that it was foreseeable that a failure to take reasonable care 
  in constructing the building would create defects that pose a substantial danger 
  to the health and safety of the occupants. At the same time, La Forest J. recognized 
  that the passage of time would make it increasingly difficult for owners of 
  a building to prove at trial that any deterioration in the building was attributable 
  to the initial negligence of the contractor and not simply to the inevitable 
  wear and tear suffered by every building.</p>
<p>
  [11] I agree with Cumming J. that the current state of the law is that when 
  a person creates a foreseeable danger to others on his or her property the fact 
  that the property is transferred to another person is not, in and of itself, 
  a reason why the transferor should immediately be relieved of liability for 
  damages. </p>
<p>
  [12] Thus, the mere fact that the Region transferred Biggar and Morris Roads 
  to the City does not instantly absolve the Region of any potential liability 
  for negligent non-repair of these roads. Whether the Region has lost the right 
  to make repairs to the roads because it no longer has jurisdiction over them 
  is not the point; the Region had a duty to users of the road to make inspections 
  and guard against non-repair before transferring the roads. This is the alleged 
  breach that is the subject of the litigation. If the Region's negligence created 
  or augmented the risk of an accident, absent a clear statutory provision to 
  the contrary, it should not be able to absolve itself instantly of any potential 
  liability by transferring portions of roads to the City. This is particularly 
  true where, as here, the City has no choice in law but to accept a transfer 
  of roads from the Region. Practically speaking, however, the passage of time 
  will make it more difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that the non-repair 
  of the road due to the overgrowth was a result of the negligence of the Region. 
  This is a question of fact to be determined at a trial.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Region seeks to distinguish the decision in Giant Tiger, supra, on 
  the basis that the overgrown bushes in this case are a patent, as opposed to 
  a latent, defect. They rely on the decision of Ekkebus v. Lauinger (1994), 22 
  C.C.L.T. (2d) 148 (Ont. Gen. Div.). In that case, Beaulieu J. dismissed an action 
  by the current owners of a residential property against the former owners for 
  contribution and indemnity towards a settlement under the Negligence Act for 
  injuries sustained by an infant who wandered onto the property and fell into 
  a hot tub. The current owners as plaintiffs sought damages in contract and in 
  tort against the vendors who had installed both the hot tub and deck that housed 
  it two years previously. The former owners had not obtained a permit for the 
  construction and the hot tub was not enclosed in accordance with the relevant 
  municipal by-law. Beaulieu J. held that the law was well settled that a vendor 
  is not liable in contract to a purchaser for patent defects in a property that 
  could have been detected by a full inspection. Therefore, part of the plaintiff's 
  inspection should have included a consideration of the relevant bylaw. With 
  respect to the action in tort, Beaulieu J. held that the former owners had a 
  duty of care to their neighbours to ensure that they did not carry out any activity 
  that exposed their neighbours to risk. While some American decisions had held 
  that such a duty survives a conveyance of property, Beaulieu J. distinguished 
  these cases on the basis that the purchasers in the case before him had had 
  almost two years, a reasonable amount of time, to remedy any deficiency in the 
  construction or safety of the hot tub. In Giant Tiger, supra, Cumming J. commented 
  on the decision in Ekkebus at para. 58 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [58] I do not think that the issue as to whether the defect is latent or patent 
  is determinative. Rather, the essential question is whether the elements of 
  a tort for negligence are present&#133;. The real question is - has such time 
  lapsed since the change in ownership that it can be said either that there is 
  no longer a relationship of proximity such that a duty of care arises on the 
  part of the former owner or, if it does, that the negligence of the former owner 
  is not the proximate cause of the loss, and hence, not all the elements necessary 
  to prove negligence are present. If the defect is patent then there will usually 
  no longer be a relationship of proximity between the injured person and the 
  former owner. Even if the duty of care remains, it could be said that the negligence 
  of the former owner is not the proximate cause of the loss. In such instances, 
  the defect is of such a character that it could or should have been known to 
  the new owner as s/he has had a reasonable opportunity to discover the condition 
  on prompt inspection and s/he had the responsibility as owner to make the necessary 
  repairs.</p>
<p>
  [14] So too, here, one of the factors that will affect the City's duty of care 
  is whether, owing to the passage of time following the transfer, it had a reasonable 
  opportunity to discover the condition of the roads by inspecting them and to 
  make the necessary repairs. </p>
<p>
  [15] The passage of time and the opportunity of the City to inspect the roads 
  are not, however, the only factors to be considered. The transfer of the roads 
  from the Region to the City differs in one important respect from a contract 
  for the sale of land. As I have indicated, the latter is based on consent. Section 
  23(6) of the Regional Municipalities Act enables the Region to transfer the 
  roads to the City even without the City's consent. The motions judge erred when 
  he said that if the transfer of the roads produced a &quot;bad bargain&quot; 
  for the City the statute permitted it. The doctrine of &quot;buyer beware&quot; 
  which applies to the sale of land and is at the heart of the distinction between 
  a patent and a latent defect in contract law has no role to play here. More 
  importantly, the concern that tort should not create liability in respect of 
  a relationship where the common law of contract would not impose liability was 
  repudiated by La Forest J. in Winnipeg Condominium, supra as being inconsistent 
  with Anns v. London Borough of Merton, [1977] 2 All E.R. 492 (H.L.). </p>
<p>
  [16] At the time of the transfer the Region had all of the information respecting 
  the condition of the roads. The ultimate user of the road was dependant on the 
  Region to pass that information on to the City. To the extent the Region did 
  not do so, it augmented the foreseeable risk of an accident. The passage of 
  time may have given the City an opportunity to request the information, to conduct 
  its own examination of the roads or to observe the defects and to repair them 
  thereby attenuating the duty that the Region had to ultimate users of the road 
  or severing any causal link between the conduct of the Region and the accident. 
  These are all factual issues to be considered by a judge at a trial.</p>
<p>
  [17] To summarize, the transfer of the roads by the Region to the City does 
  not automatically instantly absolve the Region from liability for prior negligence 
  respecting their maintenance. There is a sound policy reason for rejecting the 
  conclusion of the motions judge that it did. His conclusion was also inconsistent 
  with the evolving principles of the common law respecting torts. There are important 
  factual issues that require resolution at a trial. Summary judgment ought not 
  to have been granted. For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside 
  the decision granting summary judgment and dismiss the Region's motion for summary 
  judgment. </p>
<p> [18] With respect to costs, the plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of 
  the motion and of this appeal on a partial indemnity basis as against the Region. 
  I would fix these costs in the amount of $5000 inclusive of disbursements and 
  G.S.T. As between the Region and the City agree that, as between them, the costs 
  of the motion and of the appeal should follow the result of the litigation as 
  between them.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Note that s. 284(1) of the Municipal 
  Act R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 was repealed by s. 54(1) of the Better Local Government 
  Act, S.O. 1996, c..32 on December 19, 1996. This later Act substituted the maintenance 
  provision quoted here. The entire Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 was repealed 
  and replaced with the Municipal Act, S.O. 2001, c. 25, which was given Royal 
  Assent on December 12, 2001 and came into force on January 1, 2003. The maintenance 
  provisions contained s. 284 of the previous Municipal Act are now provided for 
  in s. 44 of the Municipal Act. The provisions are substantially the same, although 
  the defenses available to a municipality in the case of non-repair are more 
  extensive.</p>

  1990, c. R.8 has also been repealed by the Municipal Act, S.O. 2001, c. 25 (see

  highways.</p>
