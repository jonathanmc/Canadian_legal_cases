<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a highly unusual case on its facts. In the circumstances, we think 
  that the motions judge is to be commended for getting to the heart of the matter 
  and resolving the real issue in dispute.</p>
<p>[2] Of the many issues raised by the appellant, we believe that the appeal 
  turns on whether the motions judge erred in concluding that the appellant could 
  not rely upon s. 22(1) of the Mortgages Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) because the 
  respondent mortgagee had sold the property under s. 22(1)(a) before the appellant 
  took what he submits were the necessary steps to redeem. In that regard, although 
  much of the argument before us focused on whether the April 5, 2002 agreement 
  of purchase and sale, which contained a number of conditions, constituted a 
  'sale' within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a), we find it unnecessary to finally 
  resolve that issue. </p>
<p>[3] Assuming that no sale had occurred until May 3, 2002, when the purchaser 
  waived any outstanding conditions in the April 5th agreement of purchase and 
  sale, as extended, the motions judge found that there was no evidence that the 
  respondent mortgagee was aware of the injunctive relief obtained by the appellant 
  pursuant to the ex parte order of Matheson J. dated April 29, 2002. In our view, 
  that finding was open to the motions judge and it is fatal to the appellant's 
  position. In short, even if the payment into court pursuant to Matheson J.'s 
  order could be considered as payment of the amount due under the mortgage pursuant 
  to s. 22(1) of the Act (something the motions judge did not accept), as the 
  mortgagee had no notice of the payment into court, it was not precluded from 
  pursuing and finalizing the sale under the power of sale. The result was that 
  on May 3, 2002, the agreement of purchase and sale became unconditional and 
  constituted a sale within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a) of the Act. Accordingly, 
  the appellant was not entitled to rely on s. 22(1) of the Act to redeem the 
  mortgage. </p>
<p>[4] For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $15,000.00 
  inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
