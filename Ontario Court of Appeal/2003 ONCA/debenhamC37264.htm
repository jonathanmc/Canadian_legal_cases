<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Frank K. Roberts of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 18, 2001.</p>    <P>
  BY THE COURT:</p>    <P>
  [1] Following a two day trial, Roberts J. rendered a judgment in favour of Audrey 
  Debenham in a wrongful dismissal action. He determined that the proper notice 
  period for Ms. Debenham, a twenty six year employee with the appellant and its 
  predecessor companies, was fifteen months. He awarded damages of $63,029.80 
  plus pre judgment interest and costs.</p>    <P>
  [2] The appellant, CSI Maximus, appeals from the trial judgment on three bases. 
  The respondent, Ms. Debenham, cross appeals on one ground.</p>    <P>
  A. CSI Maximus' appeal</p>    <P>
  [3] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by concluding that Debenham 
  was an employee rather than an independent contractor. The appellant submits 
  that the trial judge ignored the &quot;organization/integration&quot; test for 
  determining whether Debenham's status from 1994 to her dismissal in 2000 was 
  that of an employee or an independent contractor: see 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. 
  Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. (2001), 11 C.C.E.L. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); and Mayer 
  v. J. Conrad Lavigne Ltd. (1979), 27 O.R. (2d) (C.A.).</p>    <P>
  [4] We disagree. Although the trial judge did rely on the intentions of both 
  the new owner and Debenham in 1994 (to continue the twenty year relationship, 
  but with an alteration, for administrative reasons only, to the method of paying 
  Debenham), he also reviewed and relied on many objective factors which strongly 
  supported Debenham's position that her status as an employee never changed during 
  her twenty six years with the various owners for whom she worked.</p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by not holding that the 
  release signed by Debenham when the appellant purchased the company related 
  to all aspects of her employment relationship, not just to the issue of unpaid 
  back salary.</p>    <P>
  [6] We disagree. Although the trial judge did not consider this issue in his 
  reasons, it is clear that the subject matter of the release was the payment 
  of the back salary she was owed.</p>    <P>
  [7] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to consider 
  the two prior asset sales, one of which was an insolvency sale, in determining 
  the relevant length of service for the notice period. The appellant contends 
  that one or both of these sales constituted a clean break which, in effect, 
  severed the employment relationship.</p>    <P>
  [8] We disagree. The trial judge relied on the reasons of Sachs J. in Kamen 
  v. Rose, [2001] O.J. 291 at para. 22 (S.C.):</p>    
<P class="indent"> There are a number of cases involving businesses that have 
  been sold or reorganized, in which the courts have decided that an employee 
  who retains his or her employment following such a sale or reorganization is 
  entitled to rely on his or her employment history with the previous, as well 
  as the current owner, in the calculation of reasonable notice upon termination. 
  These cases further hold that this will be the presumption unless there is an 
  express agreement to the contrary.</p>    
<P>
  We agree with this statement of the law and with the trial judge's conclusion 
  that, on the record before him, &quot;the plaintiff's history of employment 
  from 1974 to the date of termination in March, 2000 should be the basis for 
  the calculation of reasonable notice.&quot;</p>    <P>
  B. Ms. Debenham's cross appeal</p>    <P>
  [9] The respondent contends that the fifteen month notice period determined 
  by the trial judge is outside the range for an employee in her situation.</p>    <P>
  [10] It is true that an appellate court can intervene if the notice period set 
  by a trial judge is outside an acceptable range. However, the decision of a 
  trial judge on this issue is entitled to considerable deference: see Minott 
  v. O'Shanter Development Co. (1998), 40 C.C.E.L. (2d) 1 (Ont. C.A.).</p>    <P>
  [11] The respondent cites no case where an employee similarly situated to her 
  has been awarded damages flowing from a notice period of twenty one to twenty 
  four months, which is the range that she asserts is appropriate. We can see 
  no basis for interfering with the trial judge's analysis or conclusion on this 
  issue.</p>    <P>
  Disposition</p>    <P>
  [12] The appeal is dismissed, with costs fixed at $7500 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>    <P>
  [13] The cross appeal is dismissed, with costs fixed at $2000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>    <P>
