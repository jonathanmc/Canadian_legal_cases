<p>On appeal from conviction dated June 13, 2001 by the Justice M. Morten of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice and from sentence imposed on August 23, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] On June 13, 2001, after a two-day trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice 
  Morten of the Ontario Court of Justice, the appellant was convicted of one count 
  of assault, one count of criminal harassment, one count of breach of recognizance 
  and one count of breach of probation. On August 23, 2001 the appellant was sentenced 
  as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>for the offence of assault, time served (five and one-half months) plus 
    three years probation; </li>
  <li>for the offence of criminal harassment, three years imprisonment;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></li>
  <li>for the offence of breach of recognizance, 12 months consecutive; and </li>
  <li>for the offence of breach of probation, 9 months concurrent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, two orders were made against the appellant, one being a prohibition 
  order for ten years under s. 109 of the Criminal Code, the other a DNA order. 
  The appellant appeals against conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [2] The offences for which the appellant stands convicted span a four-month 
  time period from February 2001 to May 2001. They arise as a result of the termination 
  of his lengthy common-law relationship (seven or eight years) with the complainant, 
  Ms. C. Deguzman.</p>
<p>
  [3] According to the complainant, she and the appellant got along well for the 
  first five and a half years of their relationship. During that time frame, two 
  children were born. Thereafter, the relationship began to deteriorate. There 
  were arguments and sometimes the appellant would hit the complainant. Matters 
  came to a head at the beginning of February 2001 when the appellant assaulted 
  her and threatened to either abscond with the children or harm them. </p>
<p>
  [4] Fearing for her safety and the safety of her children, Ms. Deguzman took 
  the children and moved to her brother's home in Brampton. A day or so later, 
  the appellant arrived unannounced and demanded to see her and the children. 
  Ms. Deguzman called the police and upon their arrival, she explained that she 
  was frightened of the appellant and that he had assaulted her several days earlier. 
  She showed the police a large bruise on her right arm, which she had sustained 
  during the assault.</p>
<p>
  [5] Later that evening, the appellant was arrested for assault and detained 
  in custody. He was released several days later on a recognizance with conditions, 
  including a term that he have no contact with the complainant. </p>
<p>
  [6] A few days later, on February 13, the appellant attempted to contact Ms. 
  Deguzman by telephone and on February 14, he was arrested and charged with breach 
  of recognizance. After spending several days in custody, he entered a plea of 
  guilty to that charge. On his plea, he was sentenced to time served and placed 
  on probation for two years. The probation order contained various conditions, 
  including a term that he have no contact with the complainant.</p>
<p>
  [7] On February 26, within days of his release, the appellant broke into the 
  complaint's apartment and he and the complainant spent the day with each other. 
  According to the complainant, she did not want to be with the appellant but 
  she was afraid of him and feared that if she called the police, he would harm 
  her and the children. Later that afternoon, the complainant managed to secretly 
  alert her employer to the problem she was having with the appellant. As a result, 
  her employer called the police and upon attending the complainant's apartment 
  that night, the police found the appellant and arrested him for breaking and 
  entering and for breach of recognizance.</p>
<p>
  [8] After serving five days in custody, the appellant pleaded guilty to both 
  charges. He received a 50-day intermittent sentence and he was released from 
  jail on March 5th. </p>
<p>
  [9] No sooner had he been released than he again attempted to contact the complainant. 
  On the night of March 5, Ms. Deguzman received five 'hang-up' calls. On the 
  morning of March 6, the appellant tried several times to call her on her cell 
  phone and on one occasion, she spoke briefly with him. The complainant then 
  contacted the police and the appellant was arrested later that day and charged 
  with breach of probation, breach of recognizance and criminal harassment. Those 
  charges, along with the original assault charge of February 4, form the subject 
  matter of this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [10] With respect to the charge of criminal harassment, it should be noted that 
  the conduct giving rise to it includes the original assault, the breaches of 
  recognizance and the break and enter to which the appellant pleaded guilty and 
  generally, the appellant's persistent efforts to contact the complainant up 
  to the eventual date of his arrest on March 6th.</p>
<p>
  CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p>[11] The appellant raises three grounds of appeal against conviction.</p>
<p>
  [12] First, he submits that the trial judge improperly relied upon bad character 
  evidence and impermissible propensity reasoning to convict him on the charge 
  of criminal harassment.</p>
<p>
  [13] We disagree. The reasons for judgement are admittedly not a model of perfection. 
  More analysis would have been preferable. That said, when the reasons are read 
  fairly as a whole, we are not persuaded that the trial judge misused the bad 
  character evidence, which, of necessity, formed part of the record on the criminal 
  harassment charge. Rather, he used it properly to explain the appellant's motivation, 
  his animus towards the complainant and his need to dominate and control her. 
  These were legitimate factors which the trial judge was entitled to take into 
  account in assessing the conduct of the appellant and in determining whether 
  he knew or was reckless as to whether the complainant was harassed and whether 
  she had reason to fear for her safety or the safety of others. Accordingly, 
  this ground of appeal fails. </p>
<p>
  [14] Second, the appellant submits that the trial was a nullity because his 
  election to be tried by a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice was involuntary 
  and thus invalid. </p>
<p>
  [15] In our view, this ground of appeal (and others relating to it that form 
  part of the sentence appeal) are entirely without merit.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant initially pleaded guilty before Mr. Justice Forsythe of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice to the charges of assault, criminal harassment and 
  breach of recognizance. He was represented by counsel and as part of the plea 
  negotiations, it was agreed that the Crown would proceed summarily on all of 
  the charges. Part way through the proceeding, it became apparent to Justice 
  Forsythe that the appellant was not prepared to admit the facts necessary to 
  support a conviction for the charges of assault and criminal harassment. Accordingly, 
  he struck the pleas. At the request of the Crown, he also struck the Crown election 
  to proceed summarily. Crown counsel made it known at the time that the decision 
  to proceed summarily was part and parcel of the plea negotiations and now that 
  the pleas had been struck, so too should the election. The trial judge agreed 
  and the appellant raised no concerns.</p>
<p>
  [17] Several weeks later, when the matter came on for trial before Justice Morten, 
  the appellant appeared with new counsel [not Mr. Harris]. Upon arraignment, 
  the Crown elected to proceed by indictment on the various charges. Defence counsel 
  then made it known that he &quot;wasn't advised the Crown was proceeding by 
  indictment&quot; and that he would need a few minutes to consult with his client 
  to obtain instructions. He requested 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
  [18] In response, the trial judge indicated his displeasure with the fact that 
  this had not been resolved earlier and he gave defence counsel five minutes 
  to sort the matter out with the appellant. This was done and defence counsel 
  reported that the appellant wished to proceed to trial &quot;today in front 
  of your Honour&quot;. The trial judge asked the appellant if that was correct, 
  to which the appellant replied &quot;yes, sir&quot;. The trial then proceeded.</p>
<p>
  [19] Against this backdrop, the appellant now submits that his election was 
  uninformed and involuntary and therefore invalid. He has filed no affidavit 
  material in support of his submission. Absent such material, there is nothing 
  in the record to suggest that his counsel did not fully apprise him of his rights 
  and that he did not exercise his rights freely and voluntarily. Accordingly, 
  we are satisfied that his election was valid.</p>
<p>
  [20] We are further of the view that the Crown was entitled to proceed to trial 
  by way of indictment. The earlier election to proceed summarily was contingent 
  upon the appellant pleading guilty to three of the counts. The appellant reneged 
  on his end of the bargain and the plea was struck. In these circumstances, absent 
  impropriety on the part of the Crown (and there was none here in our opinion), 
  the Crown was entitled as of right to have its election to proceed summarily 
  struck as well. To hold otherwise would make a mockery of justice. It would 
  allow an accused to renege on his or her agreement while at the same time requiring 
  the Crown to uphold a part of its agreement beneficial to the accused.</p>
<p>
  [21] In the alternative, if the Crown needed judicial approval to withdraw its 
  original election, such approval was given here and quite properly so.</p>
<p>
  [22] Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge misapplied the rule in 
  Brown v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.) and in doing so, he effectively deprived 
  the appellant of his sole defence on the assault charge. </p>
<p>
  [23] In our view, there is merit in this submission. The appellant's sole defence 
  to the charge of assault was self-defence. The appellant did not deny striking 
  the complainant but he claimed that he did so because the complainant was attacking 
  him with a knife and he feared for his life and safety. That scenario was put 
  to the complainant in cross-examination as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And so, I'm going to suggest to you, when you came back 
  in the living room with the knife &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">A. I did not have a knife.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. &#133; that Paul had one of your daughters, Marissa, in his 
  arm. Isn't that right?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I don't recall that.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Well, are you saying it might have happened?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I'm just saying I don't recall it. I don't remember that 
  -- that -- that thing happening.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And I'm going to suggest that you pointed the knife at him 
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">A. No, I did not.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. &#133; agitating the knife at his chest?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No, I did not.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And I'm going to suggest to you further that he pushed you?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That he pushed me?</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Right.</p>
<p class="indent">A. Because I put the knife against him?</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">A. No, I don't recall that at all.</p>
<p>
  [24] In-chief, the appellant testified that the complainant attacked him with 
  a knife and he defended himself by striking her arm with his right elbow. The 
  force of that blow caused the complainant to drop the knife and he retrieved 
  it. The appellant then went on to state that the complainant was crying and 
  trying to break his record collection. At that point, Crown counsel objected 
  and the following exchange occurred between the Crown and the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent"> [CROWN] I think my friend's questions are eliciting answers 
  that are violating the rule in Brown and Dunn, since none of this was put to 
  Ms. Deguzman when she was on the stand.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Quite true. Especially the self defence aspects about 
  poking in the chest with the knife and being assailed without any provocation. 
  All of that, I've borne that in mind &#133; [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">[CROWN] Okay, Thank you.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: &#133; I'm just listening </p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant's examination-in-chief continued into the next day. At a 
  certain point, while testifying about his activities with the complainant on 
  February 19 and 20, a week or so before he allegedly broke into the complainant's 
  apartment, the trial judge interjected and the following exchange occurred between 
  the trial judge and defence counsel: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: This is another line of questioning that was never 
  addressed to the alleged complainant in this matter. It's improper, totally. 
  Totally.</p>
<p class="indent">[DEFENCE COUNSEL]: Your Honour, I did question her with the 
  February &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: You never questioned her on these issues whatsoever. 
  I can review my notes, there is nothing about him completing delivery, meeting 
  her, her calling him, going in to an underground parking garage, absolutely 
  nothing and you will not proceed any further with this line of questioning and 
  it will not happen again. Yesterday I allowed it because of out of interest 
  with no weight attached to it because you had not addressed the complainant. 
  Today you will not do any of it, none [emphasis added]. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p>
  [26] In view of his determination that the appellant's evidence regarding the 
  knife attack would receive &quot;no weight&quot; because it had &quot;not [been] 
  addressed to the complainant&quot;, it comes as no surprise that the trial judge 
  rejected the appellant's defence of self-defence on the assault charge. His 
  reasons in this regard are reproduced below: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You indicate that this scuffle in the apartment involved a knife, I find that 
  there was no knife used by her. She did not threaten you. She did not attempt 
  to over power you. You were not defending yourself. Self-defence is not open 
  to you, it did not happen that way.</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge was wrong in concluding that the rule in Brown and Dunn 
  applied to the appellant's evidence as it related to the knife attack. As the 
  record indicates, the complainant was questioned about the knife. Indeed, defence 
  counsel put the suggestion directly to her that she had pointed the knife at 
  the appellant and agitated it at his chest. In view of this, there was no basis 
  for the trial judge's remark, reproduced earlier, that she had not been questioned 
  about &quot;the self-defence aspects about poking in the chest with the knife 
  &#133; .&quot; </p>
<p>
  [28] In view of this error, the conviction for assault cannot stand. This is 
  not a case in which the proviso can safely be applied to sustain the conviction. 
  In short, we cannot say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same 
  had the trial judge tested the appellant's evidence without reference to the 
  rule in Brown and Dunn. Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, quash the conviction 
  for assault and order a new trial on that count.</p>
<p>
  [29] The appellant submits that if the assault charge falls, the conviction 
  for criminal harassment must fall as well because the assault formed an integral 
  part of the harassment charge. We disagree. While it is true that the alleged 
  assault formed part of the conduct in respect of the criminal harassment charge, 
  the remainder of the appellant's conduct more than amply supports the harassment 
  conviction. </p>
<p>
  [30] In the result, we would dismiss the appeal against conviction in respect 
  of the charges of criminal harassment, breach of recognizance and breach of 
  probation.</p>
<p>
  SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [31] The appellant was sentenced to time served (five and one-half months) on 
  the assault charge. On the other offences - criminal harassment, breach of recognizance 
  and breach of probation - he received a global sentence of four years in the 
  penitentiary. The appellant submits that the four-year sentence was manifestly 
  unfit and he seeks to have it reduced. We agree, especially in view of our disposition 
  of the assault charge for which the five and one-half months pre-trial custody 
  was assigned. The appellant is now entitled to have that block of time credited 
  to the charges that remain.</p>
<p>
  [32] Apart from any reduction for time spent in pre-trial custody, we believe 
  that the three-year sentence for the offence of criminal harassment was manifestly 
  excessive in the circumstances. In our view, it failed to adequately reflect 
  the fact that the appellant had already been sentenced for some of the conduct 
  (the break and enter and the two breaches of recognizance) which, combined with 
  other conduct, formed the essence of the criminal harassment charge. The sentence 
  imposed by the trial judge did not take this into account and resulted in the 
  appellant receiving something akin to double punishment. By and large, the same 
  can be said for the one-year consecutive sentence imposed for the offence for 
  breach of recognizance. That crime formed part of the conduct making up the 
  criminal harassment charge and in our view, it should have attracted a concurrent 
  sentence.</p>
<p>
  [33] Finally, in assessing the appropriate sentence for the charge of criminal 
  harassment, we note that the appellant did not have a criminal record prior 
  to the four-month time period under consideration. It is also noteworthy that 
  the effect on the complainant, as evidenced by Crown counsel's comment at the 
  time of sentencing, did not appear to be as serious as is often seen in cases 
  of this nature.</p>
<p>
  [34] That said, we should not be taken as minimizing the seriousness of the 
  appellant's crimes. In our view, the crime of criminal harassment is always 
  serious and there are some disturbing features in this case that give us cause 
  for concern. </p>
<p>
  [35] First, we find it significant that the appellant continued his harassment 
  by contacting or attempting to contact the complainant from jail after being 
  arrested and detained in custody on March 6, and later, from a hospital where 
  he was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation. Of particular concern in this regard 
  is a letter written by the appellant, addressed to his children, in which he 
  portrayed the complainant as an evil person and blamed her for having him locked-up 
  in jail. In a word, his effort to poison the minds of the children against their 
  mother was reprehensible. </p>
<p>
  [36] We are also troubled by aspects of the psychiatric report and pre-sentence 
  report filed at the sentence hearing. The author of the pre-sentence report 
  states that the appellant &quot;blames the victim for his circumstances and 
  does not accept responsibility for the offences.&quot; The report continues 
  that &quot;the writer has concerns for the victim's safety. To date the offender 
  has not abided by any court orders.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [37] The psychiatric report, dated August 3, 2001 and prepared by the forensic 
  unit at the St. Joseph's Health Care Centre, contains even more disturbing aspects. 
  The appellant is described as &quot;narcissistic&quot;, &quot;grandiose&quot;, 
  &quot;lacking in empathy and exploitative of others&quot;, &quot;impulsive, 
  superficial and at times untruthful with staff.&quot; The report continues that 
  he has &quot;great difficulty in accepting the consequences of his behaviour&quot; 
  and he &quot;projects all his problems onto his wife, the police [and the] legal 
  system which in his opinion have unduly persecuted him.&quot; The report further 
  indicates that &quot;he has consistently not displayed any remorse in the slightest 
  for his actions&quot;, &quot;he has expressed little need for change in his 
  behaviour&quot; and &quot;his inability to appreciate consequences for his behaviour 
  is of concern.&quot; In the end, he is described as presenting a &quot;moderate&quot; 
  risk of committing spousal assault and he is potentially capable of harming 
  himself and the children. </p>
<p>
  [38] These observations are chilling and give us serious cause for concern. 
  Taking them into account, along with the principles of sentencing that must 
  take precedence in cases of this nature - denunciation and general and specific 
  deterrence - we think that the appellant should have received a global sentence 
  of two years less one day, plus probation for three years. In arriving at that 
  sentence, we have credited the appellant for time served in pre-trial custody.</p>
<p>
  [39] To give effect to this disposition, we would reduce the sentence on the 
  criminal harassment charge from three years to two years less one day, plus 
  three years probation. On the charge of breach of recognizance, we would vary 
  the sentence from one year consecutive to one year concurrent. In all other 
  respects, we would not interfere with the sentence imposed at trial.</p>
<p>
  [40] With respect to the probation order, it shall contain the following terms 
  and conditions. The appellant shall: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.<br>
  (2) Not communicate directly or indirectly with the complainant Catherine Deguzman 
  or her children, except through counsel for legal purposes or as permitted by 
  lawful order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
  (3) Report to a probation officer forthwith upon his release and thereafter 
  as required.<br>
  (4) Undergo counselling as prescribed by his probation officer.<br>
  (5) Not possess any weapons as that term is defined in the Criminal Code.</p>
