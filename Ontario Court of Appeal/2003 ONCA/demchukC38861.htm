<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released orally: November 3, 2003</p>
<p>
  [1] We cannot accept the Crown's submission, grounded in s. 255.1(a)(ii) and 
  (iii) of the Criminal Code, that where an accused is convicted of a subsequent 
  drinking and driving offence, but the Crown has not served the notice required 
  by s. 727, the accused stands convicted &quot;of an offence that is punishable 
  by a minimum term of imprisonment&quot; as described in s. 742.1 of the Code. 
  Absent the notice, the accused is not subject to a minimum term of imprisonment 
  and a conditional sentence is not foreclosed for that reason. It follows that 
  we do not reach the issue of the constitutionality of the minimum sentences 
  set out in s. 255.1(a) (ii) and (iii). </p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of two years less a day with 
  stringent terms, including house arrest for the first eight months. Unfortunately, 
  the reasons of the trial judge do not comply with s. 726.2 of the Code. His 
  reasons are simply the imposition of the terms of the sentence without any explanation 
  for any of those terms. Moreover, the sentence bears no relationship to the 
  positions of either the Crown or the defence. Both made submissions concerning 
  a custodial sentence; without explanation, the trial judge imposed a conditional 
  sentence.</p>
<p>
  [3] This error requires this court to impose a fit sentence. A conditional sentence 
  for this offender and this offence is not warranted. The respondent has been 
  convicted fourteen times for drinking and driving and seven times for driving 
  while disqualified. On three previous occasions, he has received a custodial 
  sentence of sixz months. In light of this record, there was simply no basis 
  for imposing a conditional sentence.</p>
<p>
  [4] The offence committed by the respondent is a very serious one. A second 
  aggravating factor is the long record of the respondent for various drinking 
  and driving offences.</p>
<p>
  [5] However, there are several mitigating factors. First, the respondent had 
  committed no criminal offence, including drinking and driving offences, for 
  a six year period (1996?2002). Second, the respondent has recently benefitted 
  from, and can continue to count on, the exceptional support of his employer 
  and friend, which holds out some promise that the respondent can overcome his 
  alcoholism. Third, after a person has served a period of pre-trial custody (here 
  90 days) as well as a substantial portion of a conditional sentence and complied 
  with its strict terms, including house arrest for many months, caution should 
  be exercised before converting it into a custodial term.</p>
<p>
  [6] We think that at this point in time an appropriate custodial sentence in 
  this case is twelve months in custody. The respondent is entitled to six months 
  credit for the three months in pre?trial custody. He has served fourteen months 
  of his conditional sentence, eight months of which had very strict conditions. 
  We would be inclined to equate the fourteen months of the conditional sentence 
  to the additional six months of the sentence we would impose. In addition, the 
  lifetime prohibition from driving anywhere in Canada and from applying for a 
  driver's licence imposed by the trial judge are affirmed.</p>
<p>
  [7] We would also impose a three year term of probation on the following terms:</p>
<p>
  (1) The respondent is not to occupy the driver's seat of a motor vehicle;</p>
<p>
  (2) The respondent is not to own a motor vehicle;</p>
<p>
  (3) The respondent on consent is to continue treatment for alcohol abuse, as 
  directed by his probation officer;</p>
<p>
  (4) The respondent must consent to the release of information from his caregivers 
  to his probation officer; and</p>
<p>
  (5) The respondent is to report to his probation officer within one week of 
  the release of these reasons to sign the Probation Order.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is allowed in part in accordance with these reasons.</p>
