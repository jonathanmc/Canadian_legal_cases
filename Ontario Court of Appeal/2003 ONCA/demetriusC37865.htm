<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Hugh R. Locke of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated November 21, 2001.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The central issue at the appellant's trial for attempted murder was identity. 
  Shortly after the incident, Durvent Dave Jack, the victim and acquaintance of 
  the appellant, identified the appellant as the shooter to Detective Martin Woodhouse. 
  At trial, Jack testified that the appellant was his assailant, and Detective 
  Woodhouse testified of the prior identification made by Jack in the hospital. 
  The defence called Dwight Wisdom who testified that he shot Jack. According 
  to the defence's theory, Jack had refused to identify Wisdom as the shooter 
  because he wanted to hide his involvement with Wisdom in a robbery. The appellant 
  did not testify. The jury found the appellant guilty of attempted murder at 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [2] In oral argument, counsel for the appellant abandoned a ground of appeal 
  relating to the trial judge's instructions on the criminal antecedents of Crown 
  and defence witnesses. Accordingly, the sole issue to be decided is whether 
  the trial judge erred by failing to give the jury a limiting instruction with 
  respect to the use of Jack's identification of the appellant while in the hospital. 
  </p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] On August 21, 1999, at approximately 12:45 p.m., Jack was shot three times, 
  twice in the leg and once in the arm, outside a take-out restaurant in a busy 
  strip mall in Scarborough. Jack testified that just before the incident, he 
  and his cousin went into the restaurant to pick up some food. While they were 
  in the restaurant, the appellant, known to Jack as &quot;Omar&quot;, entered 
  the restaurant with a friend. The appellant and his friend got into an argument 
  with the counter clerk, and according to Jack, the appellant flashed a knife 
  during the exchange. At that point, Jack intervened and warned the appellant 
  by saying &quot;Omar, don't get yourself in no trouble&quot;. To this, the appellant 
  responded: &quot;Dave, don't say nothing to me, being like you is a big pussy 
  hole.&quot; Jack did not reply to this insult, and instead left the restaurant 
  with his cousin, and headed towards his parked car where his wife, Jacqueline 
  Saulter, was waiting. The appellant then followed Jack out of the restaurant 
  and again called him a &quot;big pussy&quot;. Jack responded to this insult 
  by saying: &quot;It takes one to know one.&quot; After the appellant and Jack 
  traded further insults, the appellant then pulled out a handgun. By this time, 
  Jack's wife had gotten out of the car. She yelled at the appellant: &quot;Omar, 
  what are you doing? Remember I know you, I know, remember I know you.&quot; 
  According to Jack and Saulter, the appellant then shot Jack three times. Jack's 
  cousin, who was present throughout the incident, did not testify at trial because 
  he had immigration problems and his whereabouts were unknown. </p>
<p>
  [4] The police were called immediately following the shooting. Detective Woodhouse 
  went to the hospital to interview Jack, who promptly identified the appellant 
  as the shooter. Police officers were then quickly sent to the restaurant where 
  Jack was shot, but no one at the scene was prepared to give the police any information. 
  Consequently, the crown was only able to call three witnesses at trial - Jack, 
  Saulter, and Detective Woodhouse. </p>
<p>
  [5] The defence at trial essentially rested on the evidence of Dwight Wisdom, 
  an admitted drug trafficker with an extensive criminal record and several outstanding 
  charges. According to Wisdom, it was he, and not the appellant, who had shot 
  Jack. Wisdom testified that he had lent Jack a gun to rob a local drug dealer 
  known as &quot;the Rasta&quot; two and one half months before the shooting. 
  When the robbery was completed, Jack was to return the gun and give Wisdom $2000 
  from the proceeds of the robbery. Wisdom testified that the robbery had taken 
  place, but because he had not heard from Jack since, he was pursuing Jack for 
  the weapon and the money when the incident occurred. On the day of the shooting, 
  Wisdom ran into the appellant at the take-out restaurant. After speaking with 
  the appellant, Wisdom saw Jack outside and confronted him about the gun and 
  the money from the robbery. According to Wisdom, Jack told him that he had thrown 
  away the gun, and that he would not give Wisdom a share of the proceeds from 
  the robbery. Then, after Jack uttered some insulting remarks, Wisdom became 
  angry and shot Jack in the legs, intending to hurt him but not to kill him. 
  Crown counsel attacked Wisdom's credibility in cross-examination and got him 
  to admit that he had understated his relationship and contact with the appellant 
  in the months leading up to the trial.</p>
<p>
  PROCEEDINGS AT TRIAL RELATING TO THE IMPUGNED EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [6] The issue in this appeal centres on Detective Woodhouse's testimony of his 
  exchange with Jack in the hospital. At trial, defence counsel objected to the 
  admission of Jack's in-hospital statement on the grounds that it violated the 
  rule excluding prior consistent statements. Crown counsel responded by submitting 
  that while the statements were prior statements, they were admissible as part 
  of the narrative. At the time of defence counsel's objection, the Crown did 
  not seek to have the statements admitted for the truth of their contents. The 
  following is the relevant portion of the transcript of Detective Woodhouse's 
  evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q: All right. And did you know at that point who it was you 
  were looking for?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes. We had an idea that the accused Omar Demetrius was, 
  ah, the man who caused the shooting to happen and he lived in the complex of 
  4301-</p>
<p class="indent">Q: All right.</p>
<p class="indent">A: -- Kingston.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. SAPIANO [appellant's trial counsel]: I would be objecting 
  to this evidence and line of questioning, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. CLARK [crown trial counsel]: All right. I am submitting 
  none of this is in - I mean I should have laid that. I thought it was obvious, 
  maybe I should have asked that. None of this is going for its truth but rather 
  to explain what the officer did and why he did it. Obviously he is only - the 
  information come from other parties and has no utility through his mouth for 
  the truth of the content. What I was trying to direct the officer to was why 
  he did what he did.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. CLARK: Q: Were you told, without obviously not going for 
  this truth, were you told by someone who the shooter was? That's my - I guess 
  the thrust of my question.</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: All right. And who told you who the shooter was?</p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. SAPIANO: I object to this, Your Honour. This is prior consistent 
  out of court statements. That's being -</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Are you going to get to the bottom line fairly soon?</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. CLARK: I am indeed. I just want to have this officer, this 
  jury understands through the mouth of this officer why certain officers were 
  detailed to the scene. They've already heard from the people involved.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. CLARK: All right. Thank you. So I take it - well, all right. 
  Let me deal with it this way. You have got the ETF involved. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: Without going into who said what to whom, who were you looking 
  for? Who were they looking for, ah, a particular person?</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Mr. Demetrius. </p>
<p>
  [7] Prior to Detective Woodhouse's testimony, the Crown called Jack as its first 
  witness. During Jack's cross-examination, the appellant's trial counsel put 
  to him the defence theory that Jack had been involved in a robbery and that 
  he was refusing to identify the true assailant in order to avoid disclosing 
  details of that robbery. Jack denied the allegations. Crown counsel did not 
  refer to this exchange when seeking to tender Detective Woodhouse's impugned 
  statements.</p>
<p>
  [8] No further mention was made of Jack's statement to the police during the 
  course of the trial until counsel made their closing addresses to the jury. 
  Having called evidence, counsel for the appellant addressed the jury first. 
  During the course of this address, counsel for the appellant indirectly referred 
  to Jack's prior statement when attempting to explain why Jack had identified 
  the appellant instead of pleading no knowledge of the shooter: </p>
<p class="indent"> Now, Mr. Jack could have lied in different ways. He could have 
  put it on someone other than my client. He could have put it, he could have 
  said I don't know the person. He could have said a number of things, but, ladies 
  and gentlemen, under perhaps the moment, the very same trauma and shock that 
  the Crown is going to be urging upon you to explain away all these frailties, 
  that very same shock and trauma resulted in him naming my client as opposed 
  to doing something perhaps more logical saying geeze, the shooter was wearing 
  a mask or I have just never seen him before.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Now, let's consider the testimony and just before leaving that, 
  the Crown quite rationally and reasonably is apt to say to you well, if Mr. 
  Sapiano is right and he didn't want to name the real shooter, then why didn't 
  he just say I didn't know who the person was or is and I submit to you that's 
  a perfectly legitimate and reasonable argument. However, it didn't happen, and 
  it didn't happen for any of a number of reasons, and Mr. Jack is not the sharpest 
  knife in the drawer. Mr. Jack had to think quickly and this is the best that 
  he was able to come up with. I assure you anyway, that's my response to that 
  comment. Yes, that argument makes sense, but it is not the end of the story, 
  you have to consider all the evidence and all the circumstances. </p>
<p>[9] Crown counsel argued in his closing address that the defence theory made 
  no sense. If Jack did not want to name Wisdom, it would be much more plausible 
  simply to have said that he did not know who had shot him than to accuse the 
  appellant. In fact, the Crown suggested, the implausibility becomes even more 
  apparent when it is remembered that Jack made the statements while he was in 
  the hospital, when he had no idea what other witnesses at the scene might say. 
  During the course of these arguments, Crown counsel made direct reference to 
  what Jack told the police at the hospital: </p>
<p class="indent"> The defence says essentially that Mr. Jack lied to cover up 
  his earlier illegal deals with Mr. Wisdom, and in turn the robbery of this fellow 
  Rasta. Well, ask yourselves this, and then, of course, compound all of this 
  illegal, earlier illegal activity by lying to the police and because he dare 
  not say, of course, who the person who really shot him was. That's the defence 
  theory and I ask you to look very long and hard at that because I submit to 
  you, it makes very little sense, of any. Think about this. Does, firstly, does 
  Mr. Jack the one who can kind of turn on and off according to Mr. Sapiano, when 
  he wants to be co-operative or not, does he look any more than Mr. Wisdom like 
  someone who is intimidated by the police? Does he look like some retiring shy 
  retiring violet there? I submit not. He looks like he can hold his own, police 
  or not, and if he thought, I submit to you, if he thought that by telling the 
  truth, assuming there was some truth to tell about it being Wisdom and not Demetrius, 
  if he thought he was going to jam himself up, to use the sort of street parlance, 
  get himself in legal trouble, why would he - and Mr. Sapiano alluded to this 
  - why not say simply yeah, I went in a restaurant to get some food, I got in 
  a beef with some guy and the next thing you now he follows me out of the restaurant 
  and shoots me three times because we had words and I don't know who he is. I 
  wouldn't know him from Adam. What is so hard about that? Is it really believable 
  or sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in your mind that&#133;Mr. Jack is 
  so traumatized by having been shot and conveyed to the hospital and what not 
  that he can't figure that out? </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">So Jack's on the record from the get go. Before he has any idea, 
  as the Detective later told you, that there will be no witnesses that the police, 
  whether they were afraid to come forward, who knows, I am not gonna go down 
  that road&#133;.So why is he gonna lie and mention this fella Mr. Demetrius 
  here when he has no idea whether, in fact, he is going to be caught out, never 
  mind at the preliminary inquiry couple years later at a trial whether he is 
  going to be caught out the same day. The self same day, ladies and gentlemen. 
  So it makes no sense that he is going to tell this lie.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant's trial counsel objected to the Crown's closing address, 
  reminding the trial judge that he had objected to the admission of that portion 
  of Detective Woodhouse's evidence, and that the Crown, at the time, had assured 
  the Court that the evidence was only being admitted as part of the narrative. 
  Now, he submitted, Crown counsel was inappropriately using the prior statements 
  as proof of Jack's veracity. The appellant's trial counsel was initially uncertain 
  about the appropriate remedy, but in the end, did ask the trial judge to give 
  a limiting instruction. </p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge made no explicit ruling on the matter, but he did not give 
  a limiting instruction about the use the jury could make of the prior consistent 
  statements. When explaining the positions of the parties, he repeated the crown's 
  argument on the point: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Clark submits that Mr. Jack is not a stupid man as the defence makes out. 
  He named Mr. Demetrius as his shooter very quickly in a situation where he had 
  no knowledge of events and things that would unfold after he gave the statement. 
  Mr. Clark urges you to find that there is no sense in the defence submission 
  that Mr. Jack dare not identify Mr. Wisdom as the shooter.</p>
<p>
  Defence counsel again objected and submitted that the Crown was improperly relying 
  upon prior consistent statements. However, the trial judge did not provide the 
  jury with any further instruction on the point. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Rule Relating to Prior Consistent Statements</p>
<p>
  [12] There is a well established rule that self-serving evidence, such as prior 
  consistent statements are generally not admissible at trial. In R. v. Toten 
  (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 5 at 36 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. identified the rationale 
  for generally rejecting prior consistent statements as resting &quot;not &#133; 
  on any principle unique to prior consistent statements, but on the very practical 
  assessment that, generally speaking, such evidence will not provide sufficient 
  assistance to the trier of fact to warrant its admission.&quot; As David M. 
  Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, The Law of Evidence, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 
  1999) at 305 explain: &quot;In most cases, the evidence is&#133;of no value. 
  It is redundant and potentially prejudicial to allow the testimony to be repeated. 
  It may gain false credence in the eyes of the trier of fact through the consistency 
  with which it is asserted.&quot; Another frequently cited reason for excluding 
  prior consistent statements is related to the ease with which they can be fabricated. 
  Admitting such evidence would be contrary to the principle that no witness should 
  be allowed to create or manufacture evidence to support his or her own case: 
  see John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman &amp; Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence 
  in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) at 313. </p>
<p>
  [13] As with other exclusionary rules, there are recognized exceptions allowing 
  proof of prior consistent statements in certain circumstances. These specific 
  exceptions flow from a more general principle, identified in Toten, supra at 
  p.36: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;Where, however, circumstances render evidence of prior consistent statements 
  of potential significance to the trier of fact, either with respect to the credibility 
  of the declarant/witness or with respect to a fact in issue, the common law 
  admits those statements.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The exceptions relevant to the case at bar are (1) statements necessary to establish 
  the narrative and (2) statements to rebut allegations of recent fabrication. 
  </p>
<p>
  (2) Relevance of the Prior Statement.</p>
<p>
  [14] In the present case, neither party has been consistent with respect to 
  the use of Jack's statements at the hospital. Although defence counsel at trial 
  had clearly suggested that Jack's evidence was a fabrication concocted to avoid 
  disclosure of his involvement in a robbery, the Crown initially took the position 
  that the prior statements were merely used to supplement the narrative. Similarly, 
  although the defence objected to the use of the statements for the truth of 
  their contents, it nevertheless chose to rely on the statements when attempting 
  to plug a potential flaw in its own theory. </p>
<p>
  [15] Before this court, the appellant submits that while that evidence of Jack's 
  conversation with Woodhouse at the hospital was arguably relevant as narrative, 
  it was not admissible for the proof of its contents. Although the Crown did 
  not explicitly tender the evidence for proof of its contents, the appellant 
  submits that Crown counsel used it to that effect when he argued that Jack had 
  been &quot;consistent from the get go&quot;. The appellant further submits that 
  Crown counsel expressly disclaimed reliance on Jack's prior statement for its 
  truth when it was introduced, but then used the prior statement for that purpose 
  in his closing address to the jury. The appellant alleges that prejudice was 
  suffered as a result of the Crown's shift in position. The appellant contends 
  that had had defence counsel known of the use the crown would make of what was 
  said at the hospital, the appellant could have probed and explored that aspect 
  of the evidence differently. Furthermore, the appellant submits that as the 
  Crown's shift in position did not occur until the closing address, the appellant 
  had no chance to respond before the jury. </p>
<p>
  [16] I do not accept the trial Crown's submission that the problem disappears 
  because the jury was not specifically told that Jack identified the appellant 
  at the hospital. I note that before us, counsel for the respondent quite properly 
  did not advance that argument. It is clear from the trial record that Jack had 
  told Detective Woodhouse that the appellant was the shooter, even though Woodhouse 
  did not explicitly state that fact when he testified. Jack's prior statements 
  were before the jury and accordingly, the issues of admissibility and the need 
  for a limiting instruction must be faced.</p>
<p>
  [17] This was not a particularly compelling case for admission of a prior statement 
  as part of the narrative. This was not a case like R. v. F. (J.E.), (1993), 
  85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 at 476 (Ont. C.A.), where the prior statements of a child 
  sexual assault complainant were admitted as part of the narrative to explain 
  why little or nothing was done to stop the assaults or bring the case to the 
  attention of the police. In any event, the defence did not resist admission 
  for the limited purpose of narrative in the present case, and had nothing more 
  been made of the prior statement, this would be a different case.</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, the defence made the crucial tactical move when, in his closing 
  address to the jury, counsel seized upon Jack's prior statements at the hospital 
  to explain why, on the defence theory of the case, Jack named the appellant 
  as his assailant. Specifically, the appellant needed to explain away Crown counsel's 
  contention that under the defence's own theory, a more plausible story would 
  have been for Jack to simply say that he did not know his assailant rather than 
  to identify the appellant as the shooter. The explanation advanced by the appellant's 
  trial counsel was that Jack had to come up with a story very quickly when he 
  saw Detective Woodhouse at the hospital. He was still suffering from the shock 
  and trauma of the shooting and the best he could do was to say that the appellant 
  had shot him. This was not a case of the defence making the best of a bad situation 
  after failing to exclude the evidence. Had the defence not advanced the position 
  that the prior statements made its case more plausible, the Crown would have 
  been limited to using the prior statements for its original purpose, as part 
  of the narrative. However, in view of the argument advanced by defence counsel 
  in his closing address, the Crown was entitled to respond with its own explanation 
  of the significance of Jack's hospital statements. </p>
<p>
  [19] In this light, I cannot accept the appellant's submission that he was unfairly 
  prejudiced. Having himself relied upon Jack's prior statement to bolster his 
  case, the appellant cannot now complain that he would have probed and challenged 
  the evidence of what Jack said at the hospital. Nor can the Crown be accused 
  of unfairly shifting its ground in its closing address to the jury since that 
  was only done in response to the defence's closing arguments and its attempt 
  to explain away the holes in its own theory.</p>
<p>
  (3) Was a Limiting Instruction Required?</p>
<p>
  [20] Ordinarily, where evidence of a prior consistent statement is admitted, 
  the trial judge is required to give the jury a limiting instruction. In R. v. 
  F. (J.E.), supra at 476, Finlayson J.A. described the necessity of the limiting 
  instructions in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all cases where evidence is admitted under the rubric of prior consistent 
  statements, the trial judge is obliged to instruct the jury as to the limited 
  value of the evidence. The fact that the statements were made is admissible 
  to assist the jury as to the sequence of events from the alleged offence to 
  the prosecution so that they can understand the conduct of the complainant and 
  assess her truthfulness. However, the jury must be instructed that they are 
  not to look to the content of the statements as proof that a crime has been 
  committed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [21] Although limiting instructions are generally required in cases involving 
  prior consistent statements, there are circumstances where a limiting instruction 
  may not be required. The adequacy of a trial judge's instructions must be assessed 
  in the context of the particular case on a functional basis. In my view, a limiting 
  instruction regarding the use to be made of the prior consistent statements 
  was unnecessary in this case and, indeed, as the defence was relying on the 
  prior statement to support its theory, a limiting instruction might well have 
  been confusing.</p>
<p>
  [22] It has been held by this court that the usual limiting instruction regarding 
  a prior consistent statement may not be necessary where the defence itself relies 
  on the prior statement (R. v. S. (P.), (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 120 at 129 (Ont. 
  C.A.)), where it was clear to the jury that the prior statement was not offered 
  as proof of the underlying facts (R. v. G.M., [2000] O.J. No. 5007. (C.A.)), 
  or where the concern about self-corroboration is simply not present (R. v. Clark, 
  (1995), 87 O.A.C. 178 (Ont. C.A.)). In my view, these authorities are pertinent 
  to the circumstances of the case at bar.</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant himself made the prior consistent statement an issue by using 
  it in an attempt to explain an implausible aspect of the defence. The defence 
  position, in effect, made the prior statement a relevant fact and the parties 
  joined issue on what inference should be drawn from the fact the statement was 
  made. The defence invited the jury to infer that Jack's identification of the 
  appellant was the product of trauma from the shooting and the immediate pressure 
  of the moment to explain the shooting to Detective Woodhouse. The Crown urged 
  the jury to reject that inference as implausible. The issue presented to the 
  jury was not whether the prior statement bolstered Jack's credibility, but whether 
  it provided the defence with an explanation for what it contended was Jack's 
  lie about the identity of his assailant. </p>
<p>
  [24] In my view, it was also clear to the jury that that prior statement was 
  not offered as proof of the underlying facts. Neither party invited the jury 
  to look to the statement for the proof of its contents. The concern about self-corroboration 
  was simply not present. The prior statement was relevant, not because of what 
  it contained, but simply because it of the fact that it had been made. </p>
<p>
  [25] In view of the manner in which the prior statement was used in this case, 
  it is my view that there was virtually no risk that the jury would use it for
