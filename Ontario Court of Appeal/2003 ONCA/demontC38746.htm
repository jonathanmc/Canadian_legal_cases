<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, there must be a new trial in this matter. </p>
<p>
  [2] The evidence led to explain the absence of Chris Demont was highly prejudicial 
  to the appellant. It left the jury with the erroneous impression that Mr. Demont 
  had helpful evidence to give on behalf of the Crown, that the Crown had unsuccessfully 
  sought his attendance, and that the appellant was somehow responsible for his 
  absence. </p>
<p>
  [3] The truth of the matter is that Mr. Demont, to the knowledge of the Crown, 
  was more likely to give evidence favourable to the defence than to the prosecution. 
  In the circumstances, we think that the evidence concerning Mr. Demont's absence 
  should not have been permitted. Instead, the trial judge should simply have 
  told the jury that it was not to speculate one way or the other on the absence 
  of Mr. Demont and that it was to decide the case based solely on the evidence 
  before it.</p>
<p>
  [4] In our view, the error was serious. Having regard to the weaknesses in the 
  Crown's case, including the credibility problems associated with the complainant, 
  we are of the view that this is not an appropriate case in which to apply the 
  curative proviso. </p>
<p>
  [5] In light of our disposition on this ground of appeal, we find it unnecessary 
  to address the other two grounds raised by the appellant. Also, it is unnecessary 
  to deal with the sentence appeal, which has been abandoned.</p>
<p>
  [6] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are quashed and a 
  new trial is ordered.</p>
