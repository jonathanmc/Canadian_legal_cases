<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Margaret P. Eberhard of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated November 24, 2000.</p>

<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] In the spring of 1984, Carolyn Desautels was accepted as a participant in 
  Katimavik, a national youth volunteer program offering young Canadians the opportunity 
  to combine useful volunteer service with personal development and discovery 
  of their country. Katimavik was operated by OPCAN, a non-profit corporation 
  which in turn received its funding from the federal government.</p>
<p>
  [2] In April 1985, Carolyn Desautels was coming to the end of her placement 
  at Beaver Lodge, Alberta. Lise Mercier was the group leader for the program 
  participants placed there. </p>
<p>
  [3] From time to time, the group planned &quot;active leisure&quot; events in 
  which they all participated. One of these was a trail ride on horseback at a 
  nearby stable, which took place on April 19, 1985.</p>
<p>
  [4] Although she was an inexperienced rider, Ms. Desautels was a keen group 
  member and readily agreed to participate. Tragically, she fell when her horse 
  stumbled, and she was catastrophically injured. She was 21 years old. </p>
<p>
  [5] On February 7, 1991, Carolyn Desautels and her husband sued Ms. Mercier, 
  Katimavik, OPCAN and the federal Crown. They did not sue the operator of the 
  trail ride and discontinued the action against the town of Beaver Lodge.</p>
<p>
  [6] On October 24, 2000, Eberhard J. dismissed the action. She held that while 
  she was required to apply the two-year period provided by Alberta's Limitation 
  of Actions Act, R.S.A. 1980, c.L-15 she would exercise her discretion to relieve 
  against this. She found that Katimavik and OPCAN were vicariously responsible 
  for their group leader Ms. Mercier, and she also appears to have concluded that 
  the Crown was vicariously responsible for OPCAN and Katimavik and therefore 
  for Ms. Mercier. In addition, she concluded that each of these defendants owed 
  a duty of care to Ms. Desautels and had breached the standard of care required 
  of them. However, she found that none of these acts of negligence caused the 
  accident that injured Ms. Desautels and therefore she dismissed the action.</p>
<p>
  [7] The plaintiffs appeal, arguing that the trial judge erred in her finding 
  on causation. Ms. Mercier, Katimavik and OPCAN cross-appeal, saying that the 
  trial judge erred in failing to find that this claim was statute-barred. The 
  Crown also cross-appeals from the finding of liability against it.</p>
<p>
  [8] For the reasons that follow, we are unable to find reversible error in the 
  trial judge's disposition of causation. We must therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [9] We see no error in the legal test for causation used by the trial judge. 
  Contrary to the appellants' assertion, she did not use an &quot;all or nothing&quot; 
  approach but properly assessed whether the negligence attributable to the respondents 
  materially contributed to Ms. Desautels' injury.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellants' main attack on the causation finding of the trial judge 
  is that she erred in failing to find that the respondents' acts of negligence 
  in fact materially contributed to the appellant's injury. This is an attack 
  on the fact-finding by the trial judge. That fact-finding is something to which 
  we must accord significant deference and which we can reverse only on finding 
  palpable and overriding error. See Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 
  577 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellants' first challenge to the trial judge's fact-finding was that 
  she failed to conclude that the trail ride would have been cancelled if Ms. 
  Mercier had properly applied Katimavik policies, particularly one which had 
  temporarily suspended certain kinds of trips.</p>
<p>
  [12] We cannot agree with this argument. The temporary suspension policy related 
  to four-day &quot;out trips&quot;. It did not apply to day trips like this trail 
  ride. The trial judge concluded that had Ms. Mercier checked with her supervisors, 
  the trail ride would still have gone ahead. We see no reason to interfere with 
  that finding.</p>
<p>
  [13] Second, the appellants challenge the finding that the respondents' failure 
  to insist that Ms. Desautels wear a helmet on the trail ride was not shown to 
  contribute to her injury.</p>
<p>
  [14] The answer to this submission is twofold. First, there was no evidence 
  that wearing a helmet would have prevented the injury as it in fact occurred. 
  Indeed, at the conclusion of argument the appellant sought to reopen the case 
  to tender evidence to this effect. The trial judge refused to do so and there 
  is no basis for us to interfere with that exercise of her discretion.</p>
<p>
  [15] More importantly, however, the trial judge found that in 1985, knowledge 
  about riding helmets had not yet reached the point where the respondents could 
  reasonably be expected to have required Ms. Desautels to wear one when on the 
  trail ride. This is a finding which was entirely open to the trial judge and, 
  though it concerns the standard of care, it is also to be accorded deference 
  in this court. See Housen, supra. </p>
<p>
  [16] Third, the applicants argue that having found that Ms. Mercier breached 
  her duty of care to Ms. Desautels by failing to consider in advance the safety 
  of the proposed trail ride, the trial judge erred in finding that this was not 
  a cause of Ms. Desautels' injury.</p>
<p>
  [17] Again we disagree. The trial judge considered this issue and concluded 
  that had Ms. Mercier done so and learned the specific nature of the trail ride 
  and the facility, the activity would still have gone ahead. Moreover, as I have 
  said, she found that there was no established standard that would have led Ms. 
  Mercier to ensure that helmets were worn. Finally, she found that the appellants 
  had not shown that the trail ride itself was operated negligently. Rather, the 
  fall occurred without warning, without any prior instability, unsuitability, 
  difficulty or non-compliance in managing the horse. These findings were all 
  open to the trial judge on the record and there is no basis to interfere with 
  them in this court.</p>
<p>
  [18] Finally, the appellants argue that the trial judge found that Ms. Mercier's 
  duty of care to Ms. Desautels extended to warning her that she need not feel 
  compelled by peer pressure to participate in an activity with which she felt 
  uncomfortable. The appellants say that having found that, the trial judge erred 
  in not concluding that Ms. Mercier's failure to do this materially contributed 
  to the injury.</p>
<p>
  [19] In our view, this argument must also fail. While it is not as clear as 
  the appellants suggest, we are prepared to assume that the trial judge found 
  the applicable standard of care to encompass this warning to Ms. Desautels. 
  What is clear is that the trial judge found Ms. Desautels to be a keen group 
  member and a spunky young woman who did not shrink from new experiences and 
  who, knowing the risk, readily agreed to participate in the trail ride. The 
  trial judge concluded at para. 102: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If Lise Mercier had done everything she should, if Katimavik had done everything 
  it should, the group would have gone riding that day anyway. </p>
<p>
  [20] In other words, the warning would not have changed anything. This finding 
  too was entirely open to the trial judge on this record and we cannot interfere.</p>
<p>
  [21] In summary, the appellants' attack on the trial judge's conclusion about 
  causation must fail. The appeal must therefore be dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [22] It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the cross-appeals and we do not 
  do so.</p>
<p>
  [23] However, we should not be taken as agreeing with the finding of liability 
  against the Crown. In the circumstances of this case, we are very dubious that 
  the funding of Katimavik constitutes sufficient control to make the Crown vicariously 
  liable or sufficiently proximate to impose a duty of care to Ms. Desautels on 
  the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [24] Nor should we be taken to agree with the finding of the trial judge that 
  the court can use its discretion to extend a statutory limitation period. That 
  is the very question that was left open by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ordon 
  Estate v. Grail, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 437.</p>
<p>
  [25] The appeal must therefore be dismissed. Given the tragic circumstances, 
  the respondents fairly and properly do not ask for costs and none are ordered.</p>
<p> Released: August 28, 2003 &quot;RRM&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;S.T. Goudge J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree Roy McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;</p>


<p>
  LASKIN J.A. (concurring in the result): </p>
<p>[26] I have had the benefit of reading my colleague Goudge J.A.'s reasons. 
  Like him, I would uphold the trial judge's dismissal of the action, but I would 
  do so for different reasons. </p>
<p>
  [27] The appeal and the cross?appeal raise these three questions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the trial judge err in finding that the respondents' 
  acts of negligence did not cause Carolyn Desautels' injuries?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Did the trial judge err in concluding that she could exercise 
  her discretion to extend the limitation period under Alberta's Limitation of 
  Actions Act, R.S.A. 1980, c.L-15?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Did the trial judge err in concluding that the federal Crown 
  would be liable for any negligence of Katimavik, OPCAN and Lise Mercier?</p>
<p>
  [28] Goudge J.A. concludes that the trial judge did not err in her treatment 
  of the causation question. In his view her findings on causation are supported 
  by the record. He therefore finds it unnecessary to deal with the second and 
  third questions. </p>
<p>
  [29] In my view, the trial judge's findings on the effect of Ms. Mercier's failure 
  to supervise are unsatisfactory and warrant appellate review. Were causation 
  the only question on this appeal I would order a new trial. But I am also of 
  the view that the trial judge erred in concluding that this action was not barred 
  by s. 59(1) of Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act. Although I agree with the 
  trial judge that the application of s. 59(1) works an injustice for the appellants, 
  regrettably for them, the case law in the Supreme Court of Canada and in this 
  court stand in the way of invoking the court's inherent discretion to extend 
  a statutory limitation period. Because I would dismiss the appeal on the ground 
  that the action is statute barred, like my colleague I need not address the 
  difficult question of whether the Crown could be liable for Katimavik's, OPCAN's 
  and Ms. Mercier's negligence. </p>
<p>
  [30] Goudge J.A. has set out the relevant factual background. I will briefly 
  discuss my conclusions on causation and the limitation period. </p>
<p>1. Did the trial judge err in finding that the respondents' acts of negligence 
  did not cause Carolyn Desautels' injuries?</p>
<p>
  [31] To succeed in her claim, Ms. Desautels had to prove first that the respondents 
  owed her a duty of care; second, that they breached the applicable standard 
  of care; and third, that their conduct caused or materially contributed to her 
  injuries. The trial judge found that Ms. Desautels met the first two components 
  of her claim, but not the third. </p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge found that the group leader, the respondent Lise Mercier, 
  owed Ms. Desautels a duty of care and that she breached her duty of care because 
  she &quot;did not put her mind to the safety of the planned trail ride.&quot; 
  The trial judge found that Katimavik and OPCAN were vicariously liable for Ms. 
  Mercier's acts of negligence, and also breached their own duty to Ms. Desautels 
  because, &quot;having recognized the need for trained leadership, they insert[ed] 
  a leader whom they [had] failed to train.&quot; Finally, the trial judge found 
  that the federal Crown owed a duty of care to Ms. Desautels and would be liable 
  to her if Katimavik were liable. </p>
<p>
  [33] Thus, the success of Ms. Desautels' claim turned on whether she could prove 
  that the respondents' negligence materially contributed to her injuries. The 
  trial judge found that the trail ride itself was not operated negligently. That 
  finding is not challenged on appeal. The trial judge also found that the respondents 
  did not breach any duty of care in not making a riding helmet available to Ms. 
  Desautels, and moreover, that there was no evidence that wearing a helmet would 
  have prevented her injuries. I agree with Goudge J.A. that on the evidence it 
  was open to the trial judge to make these findings. </p>
<p>
  [34] The critical causation issue is whether Ms. Desautels would have gone on 
  the ride but for Ms. Mercier's failure to fulfil her supervisory duties as group 
  leader. In my view the trial judge did not deal adequately with Ms. Mercier's 
  failure to warn Ms. Desautels that she should not feel compelled to participate 
  in the trail ride. </p>
<p>
  [35] Ms. Desautels was an inexperienced horseback rider and she was unhappy 
  with the group's decision to go horseback riding. The trial judge made two important 
  and related findings about why she nonetheless decided to go on the ride. First, 
  the trial judge recognized the peer pressure within the group and found that 
  &quot;[t]he group members had come to understand that failure to participate 
  in an activity chosen by the group was a non?compliance that could result in 
  expulsion from the group. This had occurred already in this particular group 
  resulting in some participants being sent home.&quot; Second, the trial judge 
  found that Ms. Desautels &quot;believed she was compelled by the Katimavik program 
  to participate in what the group decided to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [36] Because of the peer pressure among this group of diverse young people who 
  were making decisions by consensus, the trial judge recognized, in her words, 
  that &quot;there simply ha[d] to be a supervisor who could assess the choices, 
  exercise some discretion and prevent situations that individuals, feeling compelled, 
  [could] not handle.&quot; That supervisor should have been Lise Mercier. Yet, 
  as the trial judge found, Ms. Mercier exercised no supervision or leadership 
  in planning the trail ride, managing peer pressure and ensuring alternative 
  activities were available for those who did not want to go.</p>
<p>
  [37] How then did the trial judge find no causal link between Ms. Mercier's 
  failure to supervise and Ms. Desautels' injuries? The trial judge gave two explanations, 
  neither of which I consider satisfactory. </p>
<p>
  [38] First, she found that Ms. Desautels knew the risk involved in the trail 
  ride and still readily agreed to participate: </p>
<p class="indent">
  People do choose to ride horses and everyone is inexperienced at some time. 
  There are risks. They are obvious. Horses are big and alive and if you fall 
  off you could hurt yourself. That is why Carolyn Desautels was nervous about 
  it. She knew what everyone knew: a person could fall off. Knowing that risk, 
  she readily agreed to participate. She was a spunky young woman who did not 
  shrink from new experiences. The Katimavik program provided the means and opportunity 
  for new experiences. That the horse stumbled and she landed and the horse rolled 
  and she was injured in just such a way is tragic beyond words. It is not, however, 
  the result of any negligence. </p>
<p>
  [39] Similarly, she found that Ms. Desautels did not openly object to going 
  on the ride: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find as a fact that none of the participants, including Carolyn Desautels, 
  objected to going. Carolyn Desautels was known to be a keen group member and 
  her expressed nervousness about riding a horse was accepted by all as a natural 
  sensibility, not a reluctance. </p>
<p>
  [40] These findings, however, are untenable in the light of the trial judge's 
  earlier findings of peer pressure within the group and compulsion to participate 
  in all group activities. I do not see how it can be said that Carolyn Desautels 
  &quot;readily&quot; participated in an activity that she believed she was compelled 
  to join. Peer pressure may well have stopped her from objecting to this activity.</p>
<p>
  [41] Second, the trial judge found that because the duty of care owed to recreational 
  horseback riders in 1985 did not include providing helmets, &quot;the failure 
  of Lise Mercier to address her mind to the safety of the group decision to go 
  riding was inconsequential.&quot; The group would have gone riding that day 
  anyway: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no reason whatever to conclude that if she [Lise Mercier] had known 
  the specific nature of the ride and facility, considered safety and even checked 
  with supervisors, that the activity would not have gone ahead. The activity 
  was well within the range of acceptable active leisure in Canada and the safety 
  elements in the Poole trail ride were up to every known or knowable standard. 
  If Lise Mercier had done everything she should, if Katimavik had done everything 
  it should, the group would have gone riding that day anyway. </p>
<p>
  It seems to me, however, that this reasoning misses the point. If Ms. Mercier 
  had done everything she should have, including warning Ms. Desautels that she 
  did not need to feel compelled to participate, the group might well have gone 
  riding that day but Carolyn Desautels may have chosen not to go. </p>
<p>
  [42] I acknowledge that despite the peer pressure and the compulsion to participate 
  a trier of fact could nonetheless conclude that Ms. Mercier's failure to supervise 
  did not materially contribute to Ms. Desautels' decision to go on the ride. 
  Still, that conclusion requires a fuller appreciation, assessment and analysis 
  of the group dynamics in the Katimavik program than the trial judge's reasons 
  demonstrate. As I said at the beginning of my reasons, if causation were the 
  only issue on this appeal I would order a new trial. In my opinion, however, 
  the action is barred by Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act. </p>
<p>2. Did the trial judge err in concluding that she could exercise her discretion 
  to extend the limitation period under Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act?</p>
<p>
  [43] Ms. Desautels was injured in Alberta on April 19, 1985, and brought her 
  claim in Ontario on February 7, 1991, almost six years after the accident occurred. 
  The applicable limitation period in Ontario is six years. Therefore, if Ontario 
  law applied the action was not stature barred. </p>
<p>
  [44] However, under s. 59(1) of Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act a claim 
  must be brought within two years after the date when the injury occurred or, 
  if a claimant is disabled when the cause of action arises, within two years 
  from the date the claimant &quot;ceases to be under disability.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [45] The trial judge correctly concluded that the governing limitation was that 
  of Alberta (where the accident occurred), not that of Ontario (where the action 
  was started). She also found that &quot;Carolyn Desautels was not disabled from 
  considering necessary steps after her release from hospital in spring 1986&quot;. 
  Indeed, Ms. Desautels consulted a lawyer about her claim in 1988, yet nearly 
  three years from that &quot;demonstration of capacity&quot; passed before her 
  claim was issued. Accordingly, as the trial judge concluded, if the Alberta 
  limitation period applied Ms. Desautels' claim was statute barred.</p>
<p>
  [46] Nonetheless, the trial judge relieved against the effect of the statutory 
  limitation period by exercising her discretion to extend the period: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For these reasons I find that the action is not statute barred because the unfair 
  effect of application of changed rules to the case at bar compels this court 
  to exercise discretion and extend the period to that upon which the Plaintiff 
  had every reason to rely at the time of bringing the claim.</p>
<p>
  [47] The respondents submit that the trial judge had no discretion to extend 
  the limitation period. I agree with that submission. I also do not think that 
  the limitation period can be avoided by applying the law of the forum instead 
  of the law of the place where the accident occurred. </p>
<p>
  [48] The unfairness that prompted the trial judge to exercise her discretion 
  stemmed from the release of the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in Tolofson 
  v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) v. Gagnon, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022 in 
  1994, three years after Ms. Desautels started her action. Until Tolofson was 
  decided, the Supreme Court's judgment in McLean v. Pettigrew, [1945] S.C.R. 
  62 had directed that the applicable limitation period was that of the province 
  where the action was started. Tolofson changed the law in two ways: first, it 
  created a strict rule that the applicable law was that of the province where 
  the tort occurred; and second, it decided that limitation periods were substantive, 
  not procedural. Thus, applying Tolofson, whether Ms. Desautels brought her action 
  in Ontario or in Alberta, the Alberta Limitation of Actions Act applied. </p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge wanted to avoid the injustice for the appellants brought 
  about by the changes in the law. I sympathize with her desire to do so. I am 
  not satisfied, however, that the case law from the Supreme Court and this court 
  permitted her to do so. </p>
<p>
  [50] In holding that the court had an inherent jurisdiction to extend a limitation 
  period to preserve an action the trial judge relied on this court's decisions 
  in Ordon Estate v. Grail (1996), 36 O.R. (3d) 643 and Dreifelds v. Burton (1998), 
  38 O.R. (3d) 393, leave to appeal refused [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 261, and on the 
  Supreme Court's decision in Basarsky v. Quinlan, [1972] S.C.R. 380. In Ordon 
  Estate and Dreifelds, both complex maritime law cases, this court affirmed an 
  inherent jurisdiction to extend a statutory limitation period to prevent an 
  injustice. But the Supreme Court has not adopted this principle. Instead, in 
  Ordon Estate v. Grail, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 437 it concluded that it did not have 
  to decide the point. Moreover, Dreifelds and Basarsky are both distinguishable 
  from this case. In Dreifelds, Goudge J.A. writing for the court relied principally 
  on the statutory discretion to extend a limitation period in s. 2(8) of the 
  Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. Apart from the disability provision, which 
  is not applicable here, the Alberta statute contains no similar statutory discretion. 
  And in the Basarsky case, the Supreme Court held that after the expiry of a 
  limitation period it had a discretion to add a party or a new claim to an action 
  properly commenced within the limitation period. Again, this was not the situation 
  here. </p>
<p>
  [51] It also seems to me that Tolofson precludes avoiding the Alberta limitation 
  period, either by exercising an inherent jurisdiction to extend it or by exercising 
  a discretion to apply the law of the forum instead of the law of the place of 
  the accident. There are three reasons for this. </p>
<p>
  [52] First, the result of applying the statutory limitation period of the province 
  where the accident occurred was as unjust to the claimants in Tolofson as it 
  is to Carolyn and Robert Desautels in this case. In Tolofson the plaintiff, 
  a twelve-year-old boy, was badly injured in a car accident in Saskatchewan. 
  Eight years later he and his father brought an action for damages in British 
  Columbia, the province where they resided. Their action was statute barred by 
  the law of Saskatchewan, which had a one?year limitation period, but not by 
  the law of British Columbia. The British Columbia courts held that the law of 
  the forum, British Columbia, applied because McLean v. Pettigrew governed and 
  additionally British Columbia had the more significant relationship with the 
  parties. Despite the injustice to the plaintiffs the Supreme Court reversed 
  and held that the Saskatchewan law applied, thus barring the lawsuit. </p>
<p>
  [53] Second, La Forest J., who wrote the majority reasons in Tolofson, seemed 
  to dismiss the possibility of invoking the court's inherent jurisdiction to 
  extend a limitation period to prevent an injustice, at least in interprovincial 
  litigation. At para. 89 of his reasons he wrote: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The limitation defence has been properly pleaded in the case at bar and all 
  parties proceeded before us on the assumption that, if Saskatchewan law applies, 
  it is a valid defence. I do not accept that this defence is so repugnant to 
  public policy that a British Columbia court should not apply it. The extent 
  to which limitation statutes should go in protecting individuals against stale 
  claims obviously involves policy considerations unrelated to the manner in which 
  a court must carry out its functions, and the particular balance may vary from 
  place to place. To permit the court of the forum to impose its views over those 
  of the legislature endowed with power to determine the consequences of wrongs 
  that take place within its jurisdiction would invite the forum shopping that 
  is to be avoided if we are to attain the consistency of result an effective 
  system of conflict of laws should seek to foster [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [54] Third, Major J., who wrote the minority concurring opinion in Tolofson, 
  disagreed with La Forest J. only on one point: whether the court in interprovincial 
  litigation has a discretion to depart from the lex loci delicti (law of the 
  place of the wrong) rule to prevent an injustice. La Forest J. recognized the 
  discretion to do so in international litigation. Major J. would have recognized 
  a similar discretion in interprovincial litigation (though he would not have 
  exercised it in Tolofson). Were I free to do so here I would exercise the discretion 
  argued for by Major J.A. His view, however, attracted the support of Sopinka 
  J. alone. The other five members of the Court did not endorse it. </p>
<p>
  [55] Following Tolofson, this court has applied La Forest J.'s majority reasoning 
  and refused to depart from the lex loci delicti rule to prevent a plaintiff's 
  claim from being statute barred. For example, in Somers v. Fournier (2002), 
  60 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.), Cronk J.A. wrote at paras. 42-44: </p>
<p class="indent"> As Tolofson illustrates, denial of the opportunity to claim 
  damages by reason of the expiration of a limitation period does not constitute 
  injustice sufficient to support an exception to the lex loci delicti rule.... 
</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Somers also submits that, when the Action was commenced, 
  prevailing Ontario law provided that the Action would be governed by the laws 
  of Ontario (the lex fori). She asserts, therefore, that it would be unjust now 
  to apply the lex loci delicti rule. That argument, in my view, is defeated by 
  the Tolofson decision.... </p>
<p class="indent">To state the obvious, the actions in Tolofson and in the companion 
  case of Lucas were commenced years prior to the release of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's decision in those cases. Nevertheless, the conflict of laws rule 
  established by Tolofson was held to apply to the rights of the litigants in 
  both actions. </p>
<p>
  See also Wong v. Lee (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 398 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [56] Therefore, on the existing case law I see no alternative but to hold that 
  the Alberta statute bars the appellants' action.</p>
<p>
  [57] I would allow both the appeal and the cross?appeal, and would therefore 
  uphold the trial judge's dismissal of the action. </p>
