<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Louise L. Gauthier of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 26, 2001. </p>
<p> <strong>LASKIN J.A.:</strong></p>
<p><strong> A. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
  [1] The issue on this appeal is whether a preliminary inquiry judge committed 
  a jurisdictional error in discharging the appellant Douglas Deschamplain after 
  a preliminary hearing.</p><p>
  [2] The appellant is an Ontario Provincial Police officer. Following an incident 
  at the school where his son was a student, the appellant was charged with two 
  Criminal Code offences: possession of a prohibited weapon without a licence 
  and obstruction of justice. The prohibited weapon was alleged to be a brass 
  knuckle knife.</p><p>
  [3] At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, Justice Serre of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice discharged the appellant on both counts. She held that the 
  Crown led no evidence that the handle on the knife was made of metal, which 
  was an essential element of the prohibited weapon offence alleged in the information. 
  She also held that because the evidence was insufficient to commit the appellant 
  for trial on the first count, it was necessarily insufficient to commit him 
  for trial on the second count, the obstruction of justice charge. </p><p>
  [4] The Crown's application to set aside the discharge order succeeded before 
  Justice Gauthier. She concluded that the preliminary inquiry judge &quot;failed 
  to consider the cumulative effect of the evidence as required by the Criminal 
  Code&quot;. She directed Justice Serre to commit the appellant for trial on 
  the first count and to reconsider the whole of the evidence on the second count. 
  </p><p>
  [5] Mr. Deschamplain appeals to this court. His appeal raises two questions. 
  First, did the preliminary inquiry judge commit a jurisdictional error by failing 
  to consider several pieces of circumstantial evidence that supported a committal 
  for trial? Second, did the preliminary inquiry judge commit a jurisdictional 
  error by improperly weighing the evidence before her? I would answer no to both 
  questions. Therefore, I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the 
  preliminary inquiry judge discharging the appellant on both counts in the information.</p>
<p> <strong>B. The Incident</strong></p>
<p>
  (i) The Knife</p>
<p>[6] The incident that gave rise to the charges against the appellant took place 
  on May 24, 2000 at the public school where the appellant's son, Chris Deschamplain, 
  was a student. The appellant's wife and another parent found a knife in a box 
  in Chris Deschamplain's desk. Chris had been showing the knife to other students 
  in his class.</p><p>
  [7] The box with the knife in it was turned over to one of the teachers at the 
  school, Guy Campeau. Mr. Campeau took the box back to his office, opened the 
  lid, and looked at the knife. At the preliminary hearing he testified that the 
  knife was &quot;silver with brass knuckle type four rings that you would put 
  your finger through to hold onto the handle&quot;. On cross-examination he acknowledged 
  that he never took the knife out of the box or even touched it. He also acknowledged 
  that although he described the knife as a &quot;brass knuckle type knife&quot; 
  he was not suggesting that it was made of brass. He testified as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And I just want to be clear; your description of 
  the knife is as follows. That in fact what you saw was a handle of a knife, 
  fair enough?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes </p>
<p class="indent">Q. That was silver coloured?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Including the grip area, is that right?</p>
<p class="indent">A. The grip had four rings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Okay.</p>
<p class="indent">A. To put your fingers through.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And that area was silver in colour?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I believe so.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Okay. And when you referred to it in your evidence 
  as a brass knuckle type, I think you said brass knuckle type of knife?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes</p>
<p class="indent">Q. You're not suggesting it was made of brass?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No. My suggestion there was that it - I've never 
  seen brass knuckles before, but from what I know of them, you slide your fingers 
  into a grip and you hold onto it this way. </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Fair enough.</p>
<p class="indent">A. And so that's why I referred to it as brass knuckles. 
</p>
<p>
  [8] Mr. Campeau was not asked, either on direct examination or on cross examination, 
  whether either the four rings or the handle to which they were attached was 
  made of metal.</p><p>
  (ii) The Appellant's Involvement</p><p>
  [9] Because a knife was found at the school, and because he did not consider 
  it an ordinary knife, Mr. Campeau decided to call the police. With Mr. Campeau's 
  permission Ms. Deschamplain called her husband, who was on duty that day. About 
  fifteen minutes later he and his partner arrived at the school.</p><p>
  [10] The appellant was dressed in his police uniform. He went alone to the principal's 
  office to speak to Mr. Campeau. He was told what had occurred - that the knife 
  had been found in his son's desk and that his son had been showing the knife 
  and may have threatened other students with it. The appellant told Mr. Campeau 
  that he had warned his son about bringing the knife to school. He explained 
  that he had recently bought the knife at a flea market and that it was to be 
  used for whittling wood. </p><p>
  [11] Mr. Campeau suggested that the appellant's son go home for the day. He 
  asked the appellant some general questions about laying criminal charges and 
  then asked him in what capacity he had come to the school. The appellant replied 
  that he had come both as a concerned parent and as a police officer. Mr. Campeau 
  decided to give the appellant the knife. Until then it had been on the principal's 
  desk in the box in which it had been found. The appellant took the knife and 
  left the school with his wife and son. The Crown led no evidence about what 
  happened to it.</p><p>
  (iii) The Police Investigation</p><p>
  [12] The day after the incident, the school principal became dissatisfied with 
  the way the matter had been handled. He contacted the police and Detective Sergeant 
  Lalonde was assigned to investigate the incident. </p><p>
  [13] Detective Sergeant Lalonde spoke to the appellant and asked him what kind 
  of knife his son had brought to school. The appellant told him something to 
  the effect that &quot;it's a small jack knife, not a big knife at all&quot;. 
  As far as the appellant was concerned, it did not appear to be a prohibited 
  weapon. Mr. Lalonde later discovered that the appellant had not made any notes 
  about the incident in his police notebook and had not made a police report about 
  having taken the knife. Mr. Lalonde asked the appellant to turn the knife over 
  to the police, but the appellant never did so. </p><p>
  [14] On June 22, 2000, the appellant was arrested and charged with possession 
  of a prohibited weapon without a licence contrary to s. 91(2) of the Criminal 
  Code and with obstruction of justice contrary to s. 139(2) of the Code.</p>
<p> <strong>C. Analysis</strong></p>
<p>
  [15] Several matters are not in dispute on this appeal. First, Justice Serre 
  correctly set out the duty on a preliminary inquiry judge under s. 548 of the 
  Criminal Code. That duty drawn from the judgment of Ritchie J. in U.S.A. v. 
  Shephard (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (S.C.C.) - requires the preliminary inquiry 
  judge to determine &quot;whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable 
  jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty,&quot; and to commit 
  an accused for trial &quot;in any case in which there is admissible evidence 
  which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.&quot; See Shephard, 
  supra, at p. 427.</p><p>
  [16] Second, to obtain the appellant's committal for trial on the first count 
  the prohibited weapon charge the Crown had to adduce some evidence that the 
  handle of the knife to which the four rings were attached was made of metal. 
  Not every knife is a prohibited weapon. Section 84(1) of the Code defines a 
  &quot;prohibited weapon&quot; as &quot;(b) any weapon, other than a firearm, 
  that is prescribed to be a prohibited weapon&quot;. Those weapons prescribed 
  to be prohibited are listed in Regulation SOR/98 462. In this case the relevant 
  provision of the Regulation is part 3, section 15, which prescribes as prohibited 
  &quot;the device known as 'brass knuckles' and any similar device consisting 
  of a band of metal with one or more finger holes designed to fit over the fingers 
  of the band&quot; [emphasis added].</p><p>
  [17] Third, the appellant's committal for trial on the second count the obstruction 
  of justice charge depended on his committal for trial on the first count. The 
  Crown's theory was that the appellant obstructed justice by failing to pursue 
  criminal charges against his son and by failing to keep the knife for evidence 
  in future court proceedings. Unless the knife was a prohibited weapon, the Crown's 
  theory would not support the appellant's committal for obstruction of justice. 
  </p><p>
  [18] Fourth, review of the decision of a preliminary inquiry judge is limited 
  to jurisdictional error. Conversely, an error made within the jurisdiction of 
  a preliminary inquiry judge, even an error of law, is not reviewable. McLachlin 
  C.J.C. reiterated this limited scope of review in R. v. Russell (2001), 157 
  C.C.C (3d) 1 at 20. </p>
<p class="indent"> The scope of review on certiorari is very limited. 
  While at certain times in its history the writ of certiorari afforded more extensive 
  review, today certiorari &quot;runs largely to jurisdictional review or surveillance 
  by a superior court of statutory tribunals, the term 'jurisdiction' being given 
  its narrow or technical sense&quot;: R. v. Skogman, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93 at p. 
  99, 13 C.C.C. (3d) 161, 11 D.L.R. (4th) 161. Thus, review on certiorari does 
  not permit a reviewing court to overturn a decision of the statutory tribunal 
  merely because that tribunal committed an error of law or reached a conclusion 
  different from that which the reviewing court would have reached. Rather certiorari 
  permits review &quot;only where it is alleged that the tribunal has acted in 
  excess of its assigned statutory jurisdiction or has acted in breach of the 
  principles of natural justice which, by the authorities, is taken to be an excess 
  of jurisdiction&quot;: Skogman, supra, at p. 100 (citing Forsythe v. The Queen, 
  [1980] 2 S.C.R. 268, 53 C.C.C. (2d) 225, 112 D.L.R. (3d) 385).</p>
<p>
  [19] I turn now to the two questions on the appeal. </p><p>
  1. Did the preliminary inquiry judge commit a jurisdictional error by failing 
  to consider circumstantial evidence that supported a committal for trial? </p><p>
  [20] The critical issue before the preliminary inquiry judge was whether there 
  was any evidence from which she could reasonably infer that the brass knuckle 
  knife described by Mr. Campeau consisted of a band of metal and finger holes. 
  She considered this issue and concluded that there was no evidence the band 
  was made of metal. </p>
<p class="indent"> Can a Justice draw a reasonable inference from Mr. 
  Campeau's knowledge of brass knuckles that the device was made of metal? Mr. 
  Campeau simply identified the shape of the device; the grip of the knife bore 
  four rings; it was silver in colour and could be used in a manner consistent 
  with brass knuckles.</p>
<p class="indent">To apply, as suggested by the Crown, every-day [sic] 
  meaning to the language on the exchange reproduced above, does not lead to the 
  inference that the device was made of metal. The question on a preliminary inquiry 
  always relates to the ability of the evidence to support a verdict of guilt 
  in the eyes of the dispassionate jury, properly instructed on the law. The absence 
  of evidence on an essential element will result in a discharge.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a distinction to be made between a situation 
  where there is no evidence on an essential element of the charge and one where 
  the evidence proffered suffers from frailties. </p>
<p class="indent">This is a clear situation where there was no evidence 
  that the device was made of metal nor was there any evidence upon which a reasonably 
  instructed jury could infer that the device was a prohibited weapon as defined 
  in the regulations. </p>
<p>
  She therefore discharged the appellant on both counts in the information</p><p>
  [21] The reviewing justice gave three reasons why the preliminary inquiry judge 
  had committed a jurisdictional error in discharging the appellant. First, the 
  reviewing justice was of the opinion that there was not only circumstantial 
  evidence, but direct evidence that the knife was a prohibited weapon. On this 
  point, the reviewing justice was wrong. As Mr. Finley for the Crown fairly acknowledged 
  in this court, there was no direct evidence that any part of the knife was made 
  of metal. The evidence was entirely circumstantial. </p><p>
  [22] Second, the reviewing justice found that the preliminary inquiry judge 
  failed to examine any of the circumstantial evidence relating to the obstruction 
  of justice charge. However, the preliminary inquiry judge did not examine this 
  evidence because she had already concluded that there was no evidence the knife 
  was a prohibited weapon. As I said earlier, both sides agree that if the appellant 
  is properly discharged on the first count, he must necessarily be discharged 
  on the second count. </p><p>
  [23] The third reason given by the reviewing judge for setting aside the order 
  of the preliminary inquiry judge goes to the heart of the first question on 
  appeal. The reviewing judge concluded that the preliminary inquiry judge had 
  failed to examine several items of circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable 
  jury, properly instructed, could infer that the knife was a prohibited weapon. 
  The reviewing justice listed four items of circumstantial evidence that the 
  preliminary inquiry judge had not expressly considered:</p><p>
  <ul><li> The appellant did not make any notes of the incident in his police 
  notebook.</li>
  <li> The appellant did not make a police report about taking the knife.</li>
  <li> The appellant did not turn over the knife though asked to do so by 
  the investigating officer.</li>
  <li> The appellant described the knife as a &quot;jack-knife&quot;.</li></ul>
  
<p>[24] To this list, Mr. Finley added five other items of circumstantial evidence 
  not considered by the preliminary inquiry judge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant's wife arrived at the school upset and became even more upset 
    &quot;as the situation progressed&quot;.</li>
  <li>Mr. Campeau thought that the knife was &quot;no ordinary knife&quot; and 
    that its presence in the school was as serious as if a gun had been found.</li>
  <li>Mr. Campeau insisted that the police be called and later acknowledged that 
    it was &quot;not in every situation that the police would necessarily become 
    involved&quot;.</li>
  <li>Mr. Campeau gave the knife to the appellant because he was a police officer, 
    not because he was a concerned parent.</li>
  <li>The appellant's description of the knife was inconsistent with that given 
    by Mr. Campeau.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [25] In discharging the appellant, the preliminary inquiry judge focussed entirely 
  on the evidence of Mr. Campeau and his description of the knife. As I have said, 
  she held that this evidence was insufficient to commit the appellant for trial 
  on the prohibited weapon charge because of the absence of any evidence from 
  which a jury could infer that the handle or the band of the knife to which the 
  finger holes were attached was made of metal. </p><p>
  [26] Section 548(1)(a) of the Criminal Code requires a preliminary inquiry judge 
  to commit the accused for trial &quot;if in his opinion there is sufficient 
  evidence to put the accused on trial&#133;&quot; ; and section 548(1)(b) of 
  the Code requires a preliminary inquiry judge &quot;to discharge the accused, 
  if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out 
  to put the accused on trial for the offence charged&#133;&quot;</p><p>
  [27] The appellant argues that in finding the evidence sufficient to commit 
  on the first count, the reviewing justice engaged in circular reasoning. If 
  the knife was not a prohibited weapon the appellant was not required to refer 
  to the incident in his notebook, make out a police report, or even return the 
  knife. Therefore, the preliminary inquiry judge had no need to consider this 
  circumstantial evidence once she had concluded the evidence was insufficient 
  to show that the knife could be a prohibited weapon. This argument has merit.</p><p>
  [28] Nonetheless, to test the Crown's position, I am prepared to assume that 
  the preliminary inquiry judge erred in failing to explicitly take into account 
  the body of circumstantial evidence outlined above. I am also prepared to assume 
  that, based on this circumstantial evidence, a reasonable trier of fact, properly 
  instructed, could conclude that the knife was a prohibited weapon. On these 
  assumptions, the narrow but important question is whether the preliminary inquiry 
  judge's error was a jurisdictional error or an error within her jurisdiction. 
  More specifically, does a preliminary inquiry judge commit a jurisdictional 
  error by discharging an accused after considering some of the evidence at a 
  preliminary inquiry, but not other evidence that could support a conviction? 
  The reviewing justice concluded that the preliminary inquiry judge committed 
  a jurisdictional error. I conclude that she did not.</p><p>
  [29] The reviewing justice's conclusion is supported by the following passage 
  from the reasons of Watt J. in R. v. Saunders, [1996] O.J. No 518 at paras. 
  49 and 50 (S.C.J.), a passage she cited in her reasons.</p>
<p class="indent"> Where a justice has ordered an accused to stand trial 
  in respect of an offence and, on review, a judge of the superior court of criminal 
  jurisdiction decides that there was no evidence before the justice upon the 
  basis of which the justice, acting judicially, could form the opinion that the 
  evidence was sufficient to order the accused to stand trial, the order to stand 
  trial may be quashed for want of jurisdiction. Without the necessary evidentiary 
  predicate, s. 548(1)(a), the jurisdiction to order an accused to stand trial, 
  is not implicated. See, Re Martin and R.; Re Nichols and R. (1977), 20 O.R. 
  (2d) 45, 41 C.C.C. (2d) 308 (C.A.), aff'd, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 511, 41 C.C.C. (2d) 
  342; R. v. Tuske, unreported, October 25, 1978 (Ont. C.A.); and, R. v. Seguin 
  (1982), 31 C.R. (3d) 271 (Ont. C.A.)</p>
<p class="indent">It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that, 
  where a justice has discharged an accused in respect of an offence after preliminary 
  inquiry and, on review, a judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction 
  decides that there was evidence on the basis of which the justice, acting judicially, 
  could form an opinion that the evidence was sufficient to order the accused 
  to stand trial, the order discharging the accused may be quashed for want of 
  jurisdiction. Absence of an evidentiary predicate is necessary to engage the 
  jurisdiction to order a discharge. Where there is such an evidentiary foundation, 
  however, there is no jurisdiction to discharge an accused. </p>
<p> [30] However, both Dambrot J. in R. v. McLarty, [2000] O.J. No. 2429 (S.C.J), 
  which the reviewing justice also cited, and Then J. in R. v. Brown, [2001] O.J. 
  No. 4458 (S.C.J) have taken a different view of jurisdictional error. I prefer 
  the reasoning in these two cases. Both Dambrot and Then JJ. held that when a 
  preliminary inquiry judge fails to consider all of the evidence tendered in 
  support of a committal, the judge does not commit a jurisdictional error, but 
  an error within the exercise of the judge's jurisdiction. The error amounts 
  to an error in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence. It is not reviewable. 
</p>
<p>
  [31] In McLarty, supra, after thoroughly reviewing all of the pertinent authorities 
  - an exercise I need not repeat here - Dambrot J. summarised his conclusion 
  at para. 79 in these words, on which I rely:</p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, an error by the preliminary hearing judge 
  in weighing or balancing in the scales, or in measuring or pondering and examining 
  the force of evidence to determine whether or not it is any evidence upon which 
  a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty is an 
  error made within jurisdiction, and is accordingly not susceptible to prerogative 
  review. As a result, although I disagree with the preliminary hearing judge's 
  conclusion that there was no evidence before him upon which a reasonable jury 
  properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty of second degree murder, 
  I would not intervene on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [32] Similarly, in Brown, Then J. wrote at paragraph 35:</p>
<p class="indent"> It follows from these authorities that where there 
  is no evidence to support a committal for trial any committal made by the preliminary 
  judge must be quashed by means of certiorari as the preliminary judge has acted 
  in excess of jurisdiction. However if there is some evidence tendered in support 
  of a committal the preliminary judge must examine the sufficiency of such evidence 
  to determine if a committal is warranted. If he determines that a committal 
  is not warranted his decision is not reviewable by certiorari since even though 
  he may be wrong in law as to the sufficiency of the evidence his error is not 
  a jurisdictional error but an error that has been made within the exercise of 
  his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [33] The corollary proposition, emphasized by Then J., is that review of a committal 
  order must be looked at differently from review of a no-committal order. If 
  a preliminary inquiry judge commits an accused for trial &quot;without any evidence 
  at all&quot; - &quot;in the sense of an entire absence of proper material as 
  a basis for the formation of a judicial opinion that the evidence was sufficient 
  to put the accused on trial&quot; - the error is jurisdictional and thus reviewable: 
  see Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and the Queen (1978), 141 C.C.C. (2d) 308 
  (Ont. C.A.) at 340 aff'd 41 C.C.C. (2d) 342 (S.C.C.). If, however, the preliminary 
  inquiry judge wrongly finds the evidence insufficient to warrant a committal, 
  the error is not jurisdictional. The error is one within the jurisdiction of 
  the preliminary inquiry and thus is not reviewable.</p><p>
  [34] The Crown and the accused stand on a different footing when reviewing the 
  order of a preliminary inquiry judge. This different footing takes into account 
  the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms, as well as the alternative remedy available to the Crown of preferring 
  an indictment. McLachlin C.J.C. addressed these considerations in Russell, supra, 
  at 14:</p>
<p class="indent"> The discrepancy that troubles the Crown is not, in 
  my view, disturbing. As I note above, the governing principle is the same whether 
  an error is challenged by the Crown or by the accused. While it is true that 
  the effect of this principle is that errors as to the essential elements of 
  the crime will, as a general rule, be reviewable when challenged by the accused 
  but not when challenged by the Crown, this disparity reflects the balance of 
  harms: a wrongful discharge does not raise the possibility of a violation of 
  s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; by contrast, I think it 
  clear that committing an individual to stand trial on a charge for which there 
  is no evidence on one of the essential elements would violate the principles 
  of fundamental justice. I note, moreover, that in circumstances such as were 
  at issue in Tremblay, supra, the Crown is free, subject to the requirements 
  of s. 577 of the Criminal Code, to lay a new information or prefer an indictment 
  There is no analogous remedy available to the accused [emphasis in original]. 
</p>
<p>
  [35] The reasoning in McLarty and Brown reflects, perhaps, a more traditional 
  view of jurisdictional error than does the decision in Saunders. In the context 
  of s. 548 of the Code, in my opinion, it reflects a more appropriate view. This 
  view, in general terms, limits the question of jurisdiction to whether the preliminary 
  inquiry judge kept within the bounds of the statutory mandate set out in s. 
  548. It, therefore, accords a broader measure of respect for, or deference to, 
  the decision making authority chosen by Parliament. </p><p>
  [36] I acknowledge that in R. v. Dubois (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 221 at 230 (S.C.C.), 
  Estey J. wrote that &quot;jurisdictional errors are committed where 'mandatory 
  provisions' of the Criminal Code are not followed&quot; and that the requirement 
  in s. 548(1)(b) to consider &quot;the whole of the evidence&quot; before discharging 
  the accused could be characterized as &quot;mandatory&quot;. It seems to me, 
  however, that for several reasons, failing to comply with this kind of provision 
  cannot amount to jurisdictional error. In Dubois, Estey J. explained the kind 
  of mandatory provision he had in mind when he wrote:</p>
<p class="indent"> Jurisdictional error is committed where &quot;mandatory 
  provisions&quot; of the Criminal Code are not followed, and in the context of 
  s. 475, this means at least that there must be some basis in the evidence proffered 
  for the justice's decision to commit. There is no jurisdiction to act &quot;arbitrarily&quot;. 
  However, where there is some evidence, it is clearly within the justice's jurisdiction 
  to come to a decision as to whether that evidence is of sufficient weight to 
  commit. This follows from the statement of Lord Summer in Nat Bell Liquors, 
  supra, at p. 141 C.C.C., p. 13 D.L.R., p. 144 S.C.R.:</p>
<p class="indent15">On certiorari, as far as the presence or absence of 
  evidence becomes material, the question can, at most, be whether any evidence 
  at all was given on the essential point referred to. Its weight is entirely 
  for the inferior Court[.] </p>
<p>
  [37] Moreover, to accept that a failure to consider &quot;the whole of the evidence&quot; 
  is a jurisdictional error risks turning virtually every error of law into a 
  jurisdictional error. This would be contrary to numerous authorities, including 
  Dubois, which have held that many errors of law are not jurisdictional. Indeed, 
  the mere failure to consider relevant evidence has been held by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada not even to amount to an error of law: see R. v. Morin (1992), 
  76 C.C.C. (3d) 193.</p><p>
  [38] Therefore, I conclude that if the preliminary inquiry judge erred in failing 
  to consider the whole of the evidence she erred within her jurisdiction and, 
  therefore, her decision is not reviewable. </p><p>
  2. Did the preliminary inquiry judge commit a jurisdictional error by improperly 
  weighing the evidence?</p><p>
  [39] The Crown has an alternative branch to its argument that the preliminary 
  inquiry judge committed a jurisdictional error in discharging the appellant. 
  It submits that she improperly weighed the evidence she did consider and, therefore, 
  went beyond her limited mandate under s. 548 of the Code. I do not accept this 
  submission. </p><p>
  [40] A preliminary inquiry judge is entitled to &quot;weigh&quot; the evidence 
  in the limited sense of assessing whether it meets the test for committal in 
  Shephard. A. Campbell J. explained this limited weighing function in R. v. McIlwain 
  (1988), 67 C.R. (3d) 393 (H.C.J.) at p. 399:</p>
<p class="indent"> &quot;Weigh&quot; in the context of Dubois must mean 
  to ponder and examine the force of evidence; to see if it registers in the scales 
  as any evidence at all to meet the Shephard test. Having weighed the evidence 
  to determine whether it registers in the scales as any evidence at all within 
  the Shephard test, the task of weighing at the preliminary inquiry is complete. 
  That is the task set by Shephard; to weigh or balance in the scales or to measure 
  or to ponder and examine the force of evidence to determine whether or not it 
  is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return 
  a verdict of guilty. That is the sole and very limited purpose for which one 
  weighs or scrutinizes the evidence at a preliminary inquiry. It is not weighed 
  for competing inferences or for frailties or contradictions, but solely to see 
  if it meets the Shephard test. </p>
<p>
  See also R. v. Campbell, [1999] O.J. No 1203 (Gen. Div.) aff'd, (1999), 140 
  C.C.C. (3d) 164 (Ont. C.A.)</p><p>
  [41] If, however, a preliminary inquiry judge goes beyond this limited mandate 
  and encroaches on the role reserved for the trier of fact at trial, then the 
  judge commits a jurisdictional error. Weighing the evidence, as would a trial 
  judge or a jury, is impermissible. In the words of Estey J. in R. v. Dubois, 
  supra, at 231:</p>
<p class="indent"> In applying the wrong test for sufficiency, a preliminary 
  inquiry judge does not commit jurisdictional error. In deciding an issue reserved 
  to another forum, however, he does.</p>
<p>
  See also R. v. Campbell, supra, and R. v. Montour, [2002] O.J. No. 141 (C.A.).</p><p>
  [42] Mr. Finley points out in his factum that the risk of impermissible weighing 
  may be greater where, as in this case, the critical evidence is circumstantial 
  because circumstantial evidence likely gives rise to competing inferences. Choosing 
  one reasonable inference that leads to a discharge over another that would support 
  a committal may amount to jurisdictional error. As this court explained in R. 
  v. Campbell, supra, at 166:</p>
<p class="indent"> Here the preliminary hearing judge rested his decision 
  to discharge the appellants on his &quot;no evidence&quot; findings. However, 
  these findings are not the only factual conclusions that could reasonably be 
  drawn from this evidence. As McCombs J. points out in the passage quoted above, 
  there are other inferences that could reasonably be drawn from all the circumstantial 
  evidence and upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find the 
  appellants guilty of manslaughter. The preliminary hearing judge, in effect, 
  rejected these other inferences in preference to the factual conclusions which 
  he recited. In doing so he committed jurisdictional error by deciding the question 
  reserved for the trier of fact.</p>
<p>
  [43] That said, in many cases the line between permissible and impermissible 
  weighing may be very hard to draw. The words of Dickson J., though written in 
  a different context, are relevant in assessing whether that line has been crossed. 
  </p>
<p class="indent"> The question of what is and is not jurisdictional is 
  often very difficult to determine. The courts, in my view, should not be alert 
  to brand as jurisdictional, and therefore subject to broader curial review, 
  that which may be doubtfully so. </p>
<p>
  See Canadian Union of Public Employees v. New Brunswick Liquor Corporation, 
  [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227 at 233. In close cases, therefore, a reviewing court should 
  give the benefit of the doubt to the statutory decision maker, here the preliminary 
  inquiry judge. </p><p>
  [44] I am not persuaded that the preliminary inquiry judge improperly weighed 
  the evidence in this case. She expressly asked herself whether she could &quot;draw 
  a reasonable inference&#133; that the device was made of metal&quot;. And, she 
  found that, on the evidence, she could not reasonably do so. In so finding, 
  she did not go beyond her limited mandate. </p>
<p> <strong>D. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
  [45] I conclude that the reviewing justice erred in holding that the preliminary 
  inquiry judge committed a jurisdictional error in discharging the appellant 
  on the two counts in the information. I would therefore allow the appeal, set 
  aside the order of the reviewing justice, and restore the order of the preliminary 
  inquiry judge discharging the appellant on both counts. </p>
