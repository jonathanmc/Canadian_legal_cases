<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On this appeal from the order of MacKinnon J., the appellant raised for 
  the first time, and the respondents replied to, a question that was not raised 
  or argued on the hearing of the original motion: whether the appellant's claim 
  against either or both of the respondents is barred by the expiration of applicable 
  limitation periods under the law of the province of Quebec. </p>
<p>
  [2] Although loss of juridical advantage is but one of the factors for consideration 
  on such a motion, it became clear in argument that the resolution of this question 
  might have a significant bearing on the disposition of this appeal. There was 
  no material filed on this question before MacKinnon J., nor, assuming that it 
  could properly have been adduced, before us. The difficulty with which the lack 
  of any such material presented this court is that we did not feel that we could, 
  or indeed should, appropriately resolve the issue of juridical advantage in 
  the absence of any evidence. </p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, we direct that the order of MacKinnon J. be amended to provide 
  for a conditional stay of the Ontario action pending the final determination, 
  under the law of the province of Quebec, of the question whether there is a 
  limitation period or periods applicable in respect of the appellant's claim 
  against either or both of the respondents. Following the final determination 
  of that question, it will be open to any of the parties to move in this action 
  in the Superior Court of Justice to remove the conditional stay or, conversely, 
  to move to make the stay final and binding, and the parties may advance any 
  and all arguments they consider appropriate to the determination of the motion.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant will pay the costs of the respondent Luc Blais in connection 
  with this appeal in the amount of $2,500. We make no order for costs in favour 
  of the respondent Paul Revere Life Insurance Company. </p>
<p> Signed: &quot;D. O'Connor A.C.J.O.&quot;<br>
