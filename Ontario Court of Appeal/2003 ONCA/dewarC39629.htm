<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for break and enter, breach of probation 
  and breach of recognizance on January 20, 2003 on two bases. The first is that 
  the verdict was unreasonable and the second is that the trial judge used the 
  fact that the appellant did not testify as an inculpatory factor in convicting 
  him. We would reject both these grounds of appeal. </p>
<p>[2] To deal with the first ground of appeal a brief summary of the facts is 
  necessary. The Great Steak &amp; Potato restaurant was broken into as part of 
  a spree of break-ins of the New Sudbury Shopping Centre on the night of June 
  24, 2001. The police seized a bottle of Coke found in the office of Edgar Burton, 
  manager of the restaurant. Mr. Burton told police that employees were not allowed 
  to drink canned pop in the restaurant and there was no way a pop-can would find 
  its way into his office. Mr. Tessarolo, a DNA expert, testified that the DNA 
  on the mouth of the Coke bottle was a mixture of the DNA of the appellant and 
  a co-accused named Scully. Scully pled guilty to the offences with which he 
  was charged arising out of the break-ins and Scully's admission was an agreed 
  fact.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant submits that the trial judge could not be satisfied from 
  the presence of the appellant's DNA on the coke bottle in the restaurant that 
  he was present at the scene of the crime. The trial judge concluded that the 
  Coke was consumed in the shopping centre during the break-in by both the appellant 
  and Scully. He rejected the defence submission that the appellant may have drunk 
  from the coke bottle outside the shopping centre and that Scully then carried 
  it into the shopping centre with him. The trial judge's reasoning was that since 
  so little of the drink was consumed, the drink was not brought in to be consumed 
  while the perpetrators hid within the mall and waited to commit the offences 
  after the mall had closed. The trial judge also found it illogical that someone 
  would bring Coke into the centre and drag it from establishment to establishment 
  when several of the establishments broken into had pop readily available for 
  the taking. The trial judge therefore concluded that the appellant was present 
  at the shopping centre at the time of the break-ins as one of the perpetrators. 
  In our opinion, the trial judge's reasoning was not speculative as alleged. 
  He was entitled to come to the conclusion that he did and the verdict is not 
  unreasonable.</p>
<p>[4] We would also dismiss the second ground of appeal that the trial judge 
  used the appellant's silence to convict him. The trial judge prefaced his comments 
  by saying, "Having arrived at the conclusion that the Crown has proved 
  its case beyond a reasonable doubt&#133;" and thus, it was only after he 
  was satisfied of the appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that he referred 
  to the appellant not testifying. </p>
<p>[5] Accordingly we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
