<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We called upon the respondents to reply only to the argument respecting 
  the size of the general damage award. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, the challenged &#147;lay&#148; evidence adduced by the respondents 
  had relevance, given the theory of the respondent&#146;s claim for loss of future 
  income. If the jury accepted her theory that she would have gone on to work 
  as a hair colourist but for the accident, that evidence could assist in quantifying 
  that claim.</p>
<p>[3] Given that the evidence had some relevance, we are not satisfied that it 
  had a distorting prejudicial effect. The jury&#146;s assessment does not suggest 
  that it was overwhelmed by the size of the numbers given in that evidence. The 
  trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence was factually correct and the charge 
  was adequate, a fact that is substantiated by the absence of any objection by 
  appellants&#146; counsel at trial. </p>
<p>[4] On the question of general damages, we acknowledge that the jury clearly 
  accepted the plaintiff&#146;s evidence about the impact of the accident upon 
  her. Having said that, the amount of the award is, in our view, inordinately 
  high, particularly when viewed against the figures suggested to the jury by 
  counsel and by the trial judge. We would set aside the jury&#146;s award for 
  general damages and substitute an award of $125,000.00.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is allowed to the extent of the reduction in general damages 
  indicated above but is otherwise dismissed. The appellants are entitled to their 
  costs of the appeal but, having regard to the divided success on the arguments 
  advanced before us in the hearing of the appeal, we would fix those costs in 
  the amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
