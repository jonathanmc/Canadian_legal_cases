<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Roydon Kealey of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 2, 1999.</p>
<p>
  WEILER and GILLESE JJ.A.: </p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] In the early morning of February 21, 1996, Hristo Veltchev was murdered 
  in the garage attached to his home. The appellant, a border in the house at 
  the time, was charged with his murder and convicted by a jury of second degree 
  murder. The central issue at the appellant's trial was the identity of the killer. 
  The appellant did not testify. </p>
<p>
  [2] Four people lived at 82 Newport Crescent at the time of the murder: the 
  victim, his wife, Faith Veltchev, and two tenants, Dimitre Tzenev and the appellant. 
  The position of the Crown at trial was that the deceased was killed by one of 
  the persons living in the house and that that person was the appellant.</p>
<p> [3] The evidence on which the Crown relied to show that a person living in 
  the house was involved in the killing is as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>At 7 am on the day of the murder, the victim's boss saw him leave the Ottawa 
    fibre plant where he had worked the night shift. The victim waved goodbye 
    to his boss and headed towards his home at 82 Newport Crescent only a short 
    drive away.</li>
  <li>Only the four persons living in the house had keys to the house.</li>
  <li>There were two entrances into the garage. One entrance was from the front 
    hallway of the house. The second was the main garage entrance to which only 
    the victim had access through a remote control in his vehicle. There were 
    no signs of forced entry into the garage. Nothing was tampered with or stolen 
    from the garage or house.</li>
  <li>Upon initial inspection the garage seemed extremely clean with no evidence 
    of disruption or unusual staining. One police officer testified that the garage 
    smelled of cleaning solvent. Forensic examination of the garage revealed blood 
    on the two wooden steps leading into the house, as well as blood on the wall 
    surface next to the stairs that had been wiped. There were also blood transfer 
    stains and drag marks along the garage floor, and, under a large sand patch 
    on the garage floor at the main entrance, there was a large pool of blood. 
  </li>
  <li>The blood was the blood of the victim. It was apparent that someone had 
    gone to a great deal of trouble to try and clean up the evidence of the murder. 
    At trial, the defence agreed that the location of the murder was the garage. 
    Evidence led at trial was to the effect that it would have taken at least 
    5 hours to effect the clean up in the garage. </li>
  <li>As the victim handled insulation that left irritating fibres on his clothes, 
    it was his habit to change out of his work clothes as soon as he got home. 
    The body of the deceased was found in the trunk of his grey car in a shopping 
    mall parking lot approximately five kilometres away from his home. He was 
    still wearing his work clothes. A bag that the victim normally brought into 
    the kitchen when he returned home was still in his car. His wallet, identification 
    papers and keys were in his pockets. A mail key that usually hung on a hook 
    in the house was also in his pocket. He had no shoes on his feet. </li>
  <li>About a month after the murder, the running shoes that the victim wore to 
    work every day were discovered in the basement, shoved behind the staircase. 
  </li>
  <li>The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. The victim suffered 
    seven blows to the sides and back of his head caused either by an object or 
    repeated banging against a hard surface. The blows may have been struck from 
    behind. There were no defensive wounds. Death would have occurred minutes 
    to an hour after being struck.</li>
  <li>A pair of Eagle Rock winter boots was found inside the front hall closet 
    of the house. They were spattered with the victim's blood. There was no blood 
    on the soles of the shoes. </li>
</ul>
<p> [4] The evidence upon which the Crown relied to prove that, of the persons 
  living in the house, the appellant killed the victim is as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant had the opportunity to commit the offence as he was at home 
    at the time the victim was killed. The appellant told Faith Veltchev that 
    he thought he had heard the garage door open that morning. </li>
  <li>On the day of the murder, the appellant had coffee with two friends, Silvia 
    Beeva and Panel Stankov. Beeva reported that the appellant told her that he 
    had been waiting for the victim to come home from work in the morning to have 
    coffee with him, but that the victim had not arrived. Stankov testified that 
    the appellant told him that he had not seen the victim that morning and that 
    he had not come home from work. </li>
  <li>Neither Faith Veltchev nor Dimitre Tzenev had the opportunity both to commit 
    the offence and clean up immediately afterwards. The appellant was the only 
    resident of 82 Newport Crescent who could have been at home at 10:00 a.m. 
    The victim's wife was at work, having left at 5:50 a.m. Attendance records 
    indicated that Tzenev was at his English as a second language class from 9:00 
    a.m. until 3:00 p.m. after which time he went to work. He ran an errand and 
    returned home about 7:30 p.m.</li>
  <li>Between 8:45 and 10:00 a.m. on the day of the murder, the postman opened 
    the mailbox to place residents' mail in their individual boxes, which were 
    located in a community mailbox, which serviced the entire street. A man was 
    standing near him and waiting as he sorted the mail. After the mail for 82 
    Newport was placed in the box, the man tried to take the mail through the 
    open panel. The postman told him he would have to wait until the panel was 
    closed and use his own key. The man replaced the mail and left without opening 
    the box. He walked away in the direction of 82 Newport. The mailman said that 
    the man's hair was &quot;scruffy&quot; or uncombed and standing up as if he 
    had just arisen from bed. He noted that the man spoke a foreign language that 
    he did not recognize, neither English nor French. The appellant, like the 
    victim and the other boarder, Tzenev, is from Bulgaria and speaks Bulgarian. 
    The tenants did not have their own keys to the mailbox.</li>
  <li>Linda Beland, another resident of Newport Crescent, was waiting for the 
    postman to finish with the mail at about 10 am and watched his interaction 
    with the man. She watched the man return across the street towards 82 Newport 
    Crescent, after he spoke with the mailman. A grey car was running, parked, 
    on the street outside the Veltchev residence. She described the car as a newer 
    car, four-door, dark grey vehicle. The victim's car was a grey 1993 four-door 
    Honda Civic. The man got into the driver's seat. Beland testified that the 
    car she saw the man get into was the same car as in the photo of the victim's 
    car. She described the man's height and build, his hair as &quot;big hair 
    like how cavemen don't cut their hair&quot; and said he had a beard. She said 
    that the man's hair and beard were &quot;like black&quot;. </li>
  <li>The appellant is the only person in the house with a beard. His hair and 
    beard are black. He was unemployed. He tended to stay up late at night and 
    remain in bed when the others left the house. </li>
  <li>The Crown also relied on expert evidence that the Eagle Rock winter boots 
    found in the front closet of the home were &quot;likely&quot; worn by the 
    appellant. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. They are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the trial judge err in warning the jury about the evidence 
  of the witness Beland?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Did the trial judge err in admitting expert evidence of the 
  barefoot impression in the Eagle Rock boots? </p>
<p class="indent">3. Was the verdict unreasonable and contrary to the weight of 
  the evidence?</p>
<p>
  [6] A fourth ground of appeal was raised in the factum, namely, whether the 
  trial judge erred in limiting the cross-examination of Faith Veltchev as to 
  whether she had made a claim for the proceeds of an insurance policy on her 
  husband's life, as well as on the reason the insurer had not paid the policy. 
  This issue was abandoned when the appeal was heard. The defence wanted to elicit 
  evidence that Faith Veltchev had failed a polygraph examination for the truth 
  of its contents and that, as a result, the insurance company had refused to 
  pay her the proceeds of her husband's life insurance policy. Mr. Addario very 
  fairly conceded that, while evidence of the fact that Faith Veltchev had taken 
  a polygraph examination was admissible, the result of the polygraph was not 
  admissible to cast doubt on her credibility as the defence was attempting to 
  do: See R. v. Beland and Phillips (1984), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.); R. v. 
  McIntosh (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) application for leave to appeal 
  to the Supreme Court dismissed [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 81.</p>
<p>
  1. Did the charge on eyewitness identification prejudice the appellant?</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant's first submission on this issue may be summarized in the 
  following way. Linda Beland's description of the man at the mailbox contained 
  two significant dissimilarities from the appellant: they are the colour of his 
  skin and the coat that he wore. As a result, Linda Beland's evidence tended 
  to exculpate the appellant, not to inculpate him. The trial judge's traditional 
  instruction with respect to the frailties of eyewitness identification took 
  away a flaw in the Crown's case and bolstered the inculpatory effect of the 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  a) Linda Beland's description</p>
<p>
  [8] The first dissimilarity alleged is with respect to the skin colour of the 
  appellant. In her examination in chief, Linda Beland described the complexion 
  of the man she saw at the mailbox as &quot;dark&quot;. In cross-examination 
  she was asked if the man she saw was black, and the following exchange ensued: </p>
<p class="indent"> A. &quot;No, more like a Hindu person.&quot; </p>
<p class="indent">Q. A Hindu person?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, it's not -he was not a black man. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [9] The second dissimilarity the appellant alleges relates to the description 
  of the coat that Linda Beland said the man was wearing. She said the man at 
  the mailbox was wearing a knee-length dress coat in a solid colour, green or 
  khaki. (Mr. Deschambault, the postman, testified that the person at the mailbox 
  wore a long, black coat made of a heavy, canvas-like material. He said the coat 
  was &quot;like one they wear out in Calgary&quot;, &quot;a cowboy coat.&quot;). 
  Two Crown witnesses who saw the appellant the day the victim was killed testified 
  that he wore an old, grey, herringbone-print wool coat and that he had only 
  one set of clothes. The appellant wore this coat to the police station. </p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant submits the description Linda Beland provided had a significant 
  dissimilarity from the appellant because she described the man she saw as &quot;Hindu&quot;. 
  An inference was available to the jury that the man at the mailbox was the perpetrator, 
  and that the perpetrator was not the appellant because he is not a &quot;Hindu&quot; 
  nor does he have the complexion of a person from India.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown submits that Ms. Beland did not describe the man she saw as Hindu 
  and that her description is consistent with that of the appellant. We agree 
  with this submission. Ms. Beland was attempting to elaborate on the colour of 
  the skin of the person she saw at the mailbox that she had described in her 
  examination in chief as &quot;dark&quot;. She said the colour was &quot;not 
  black&quot;. When shown a photographic line-up of individuals six days after 
  the murder, all of whom were Caucasian, Ms Beland did not say that the complexion 
  of the persons in the line-up did not match the person she saw because the skin 
  colour of the person she saw was that of a Hindu or East Indian person. Instead, 
  she pointed to one of the photographs of a person in the line-up and said it 
  looked like the person she saw; this was photo A-2. The person in the photo 
  was Caucasian. He had dark hair and a beard. She said that the person she saw 
  had darker hair and a darker beard. The appellant has darker hair and a darker 
  beard than the person in photo A-2. </p>
<p>
  [12] Ms. Beland described the hair and beard of the man she saw at the mailbox. 
  Mr. Deschambault, the postman, corroborated her description of the man's hair 
  and beard. The jury had the photo of the appellant on his arrest; it showed 
  that he had black hair and a beard. Unlike the decisions cited to us by the 
  appellant involving dissimilar features, the value of Ms. Beland's evidence 
  does not lie in the exactitude of her description. Its strength is the way it 
  fits with the other evidence. Given the cogent evidence that a resident of 82 
  Newport committed the murder, evidence that at about 10:30 a.m. a man with black 
  hair and a black beard got into the victim's car was compelling evidence of 
  identity because only one person at 82 Newport had these characteristics.</p>
<p>
  [13] The fact that the appellant's coat was not the colour of the coat described 
  by Mr. Deschambault or Ms. Beland was a piece of circumstantial evidence for 
  the jury to consider. This difference did not, however, render all of the other 
  circumstantial evidence pertaining to the time of the occurrence, what the man 
  did and where he went, as well as what he looked like, inadmissible. These circumstances 
  all contributed to the issue of identification and were properly for the consideration 
  of the jury. </p>
<p>
  b) The photo line-up</p>
<p>
  [14] As indicated, Ms. Beland was presented with a photo line-up consisting 
  of 10 loose photographs. Photo A-7 in the line-up was a photo of the appellant 
  taken upon his arrest three days after the murder. Ms. Beland did not identify 
  the appellant in the photo line-up. She pointed to photo A-2, which was not 
  the appellant, and said &quot;I'm not sure if it's him but it looks like him. 
  This face. The hair wasn't like that. This one got my attention more. His beard 
  and hair were darker.&quot; In cross-examination, she said that the man she 
  saw had darker hair than the man in photo A-2. The appellant had darker hair 
  than the man in photo A-2.</p>
<p>
  c) The trial judge's instruction to the jury</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant submits that the trial Judge erred in the instructions he 
  gave the jury regarding the evidence of identification. The trial Judge gave 
  the following mid-trial limiting instruction regarding Ms. Beland's evidence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The law is very careful when dealing with identification evidence based on observation 
  and recollection of individuals. And the law requires that I instruct you to 
  carefully consider such evidence in any case, and alert you to its inherent 
  frailties. This may be necessary at the end of the case, and I will do that 
  perhaps in my final charge if it becomes necessary. But, now, I tell you that 
  the evidence of the photographs and the photographic line-up do not provide 
  evidence of identification of Mr. Dimitrov.</p>
<p>The same approach to this evidence was repeated in the Judge's final charge 
  to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> You will recall that out of the ten photographs in exhibit 
  32 which were reviewed by Ms. Beland, she selected number A?2, and immediately 
  expressed some caution as to correctness of her choice.</p>
<p class="indent">I repeat that the if [sic] very careful when dealing with identification 
  evidence based on observation and recollection, and it requires that I instruct 
  you carefully to review such evidence and that I alert you to its inherent frailties 
  which experience has shown can be susceptible of so many errors.</p>
<p class="indent">I repeat that the evidence of the photographs and the photographic 
  line-up do not provide evidence of identification of Mr. Dimitrov.</p>
<p class="indent">In both cases, these instructions were delivered over strenuous 
  objection from the defence. </p>
<p>
  d) The appellant's submissions and analysis </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant submits the jury should have been told there was no identification 
  by Ms. Beland both because her evidence consisted of &quot;significant&quot; 
  dissimilarities in her description of the man at the mail-box and because she 
  did not identify the appellant in the photo line-up. As a result, the policy 
  and legal bases for the &quot;frailties&quot; warning were inapplicable and 
  it should not have been given. See Chartier v. Quebec (Attorney General) (1979), 
  48 C.C.C. (2d) 34 (S.C.C.). Considered with the charge concerning the frailties 
  of eye-witness identification, the appellant submits the instruction respecting 
  the photographic line up gave judicial weight to the proposition that Linda 
  Beland made a mistake in not picking the appellant out of the photographic line-up. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] The frailties of eyewitness identification evidence are well known. A warning 
  is customarily given to jurors to educate them that the certainty and conviction 
  with which a purported identification is made cannot be equated with the reliability 
  of the evidence. This warning is designed as a protection against wrongful conviction. 
  R. v. Quercia (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Izzard (1990), 54 
  C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Nikolovski (1997), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (S.C.C.) 
  Hon. Peter Cory, Commissioner, The Inquiry Regarding Thomas Sophonow (Manitoba, 
  September 2001) at 21?34.</p>
<p> [18] There were two aspects to Ms. Beland&#8217;s evidence. The first was 
  her description of the man at the mailbox. In our opinion, the evidence of Ms. 
  Beland was inculpatory and the instruction as to the frailties of eyewitness 
  identification evidence was properly given. The rule in Chartier applies to 
  cases in which there is a clear dissimilarity in the witness&#8217;s identification 
  coupled with a lack of supporting evidence. As we have indicated, we disagree 
  that this is a case of significant dissimilarities with respect to positive 
  eyewitness identification. Further, the evidence of Mr. Deschambault supported 
  the evidence of Ms. Beland in two material aspects and, unlike the situation 
  in Chartier, supra, there was other circumstantial evidence implicating the 
  appellant. The second aspect of Ms. Beland&#8217;s evidence was her non-identification 
  of the appellant from the photographic line-up. The inability of Ms. Beland 
  to identify the appellant in a photo line-up did not render the first aspect 
  of her evidence inadmissible. The trial judge&#8217;s instructions to the jury 
  were appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant further submits that if the warnings as to the frailties 
  of eye-witness identification evidence were proper, the trial judge never linked 
  it to the burden of proof or reasonable doubt standard. The standard of proof 
  beyond a reasonable doubt applies to the whole of the Crown's case not to individual 
  items of evidence. The trial judge did not err in his instructions with respect 
  to identification evidence. We would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  2. Did the trial judge err in admitting expert evidence of the barefoot impression 
  in the Eagle Rock boots?</p>
<p> [20] At trial, the Crown sought to introduce the evidence of Sergeant Robert 
  Kennedy as an expert in footwear and barefoot impressions in shoes. Sergeant 
  Kennedy testified that the areas of footprint and barefoot impression analysis 
  are interconnected. Barefoot impression analysis is an extension of footprint 
  impressions analysis; both rely on an analysis of the weight-bearing areas of 
  a foot.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> </p>
<p>
  [21] Sergeant Kennedy compares the weight-bearing areas in barefoot impressions 
  to determine whether the foot impressions were made by the same person. In the 
  case of barefoot impressions in shoes, Sergeant Kennedy compares the wear areas 
  in shoes, as well as the outsoles and insoles of the shoes. Sergeant Kennedy 
  achieves these comparisons though visual inspection, both with and without the 
  use of a Luma light, UV light, or laser light. Sergeant Kennedy also photographs 
  the shoes and uses enhanced photographs for comparison purposes; he also completes 
  overlay drawings of the barefoot impressions he is comparing. Sometimes Sergeant 
  Kennedy will compare an inked impression of a foot to a worn shoe; however, 
  an inked impression is more helpful for comparison to a footprint in mud, blood 
  or another substance. Sergeant Kennedy does not take or record measurements 
  as he conducts these comparisons. However, he uses callipers in checking to 
  see if a measurement from one footprint matches another. </p>
<p>
  [22] Defence counsel acknowledged Sergeant Kennedy's expertise in the area of 
  footwear impressions but opposed the admission of his testimony relating to 
  barefoot impressions. The defence did not call any evidence to dispute footprint 
  or barefoot impression analysis as an area of expertise nor was any evidence 
  called to refute Sergeant Kennedy's qualifications.</p>
<p>
  [23] After conducting a voir dire, the trial judge held that the evidence met 
  the test established by the Supreme Court of Canada for the admission of expert 
  evidence in R. v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402. He then exercised his discretion 
  and admitted Sergeant Kennedy's evidence. </p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in admitting Sergeant Kennedy's 
  evidence in relation to barefoot impressions because (i) it is not science; 
  and/or (ii) the trial judge gave insufficient weight to its capacity to mislead 
  the jury.</p>
<p>
  [25] After setting out a summary of Sergeant Kennedy's qualifications and testimony, 
  we will consider the admissibility of his evidence. </p>
<p>
  Sergeant Kennedy's Qualifications</p>
<p>
  [26] Sergeant Kennedy's experience and qualifications on the topics of footprint 
  analysis and barefoot impression analysis include extensive research, international 
  lecturing and international board certification. Since 1994, he has worked full 
  time for the R.C.M.P. Forensic Research Services department in the area of barefoot 
  impressions found at crime scenes.</p>
<p>
  [27] Sergeant Kennedy is the past president of the Canadian Identification Society 
  and is the chair of both the Footwear Certification Board and the International 
  Association of Identifications, the latter being the body responsible for the 
  international certification of forensic footwear examiners. He has given expert 
  testimony on both footwear and barefoot impressions in various courts around 
  the world. His expertise in barefoot impressions forms the basis for his certification 
  as a footwear examiner. </p>
<p>
  [28] In the area of barefoot impressions alone, Sergeant Kennedy has been qualified 
  to testify in twenty-five to thirty cases around the world, including approximately 
  five in Ontario. Most of the cases have involved barefoot impressions in shoes, 
  such as the present case. </p>
<p>
  Sergeant Kennedy's Testimony</p>
<p>
  [29] A pair of blood-spattered Eagle Rock boots was discovered inside the front 
  hallway closet of the victim's house. Based on the size and nature of the stains, 
  the bloodstain expert testified that the boots were close to the blood source 
  at the time of the attack. DNA evidence established that the victim's blood 
  was on the boots. There was also DNA on the boots from a second, unidentified 
  person. The appellant's DNA was not found on the boots. </p>
<p>
  [30] Sergeant Kennedy's role in the investigation was to compare the barefoot 
  impressions from various shoes known to belong to the victim, Dimitre Tzenev, 
  Faith Veltchev and the appellant, to the barefoot impressions in the Eagle Rock 
  boots. </p>
<p> [31] Sergeant Kennedy testified that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the victim did not make the impressions in the Eagle Rock boots</li>
  <li>Faith Veltchev did not make the impressions in the Eagle Rock boots</li>
  <li>Dimitre Tzenev did not make the impressions in the Eagle Rock boots </li>
  <li>the appellant likely made the impressions in the Eagle Rock boots.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [32] Sergeant Kennedy testified that it was &quot;likely&quot; that the person 
  who regularly wore the Eagle Rock boots was the same person who regularly wore 
  the green leather shoes seized from the appellant at the time of his arrest. 
  He qualified this conclusion, however, by noting that the impression was &quot;not 
  clear enough to do a high probability or high likelihood&quot;. Although he 
  testified that he could exclude both Dimitre Tzenev and Faith Veltchev as likely 
  wearers of the boots, he agreed that the boots would have fit Tzenev.</p>
<p>
  [33] Sergeant Kennedy also testified that &quot;somebody else could have worn 
  this shoe, but it is not likely somebody else did&quot;. He stated that there 
  was no indication in the impression in the boots that anyone other than the 
  usual wearer of the boots had in fact worn the boots, but admitted that he could 
  not eliminate the possibility that the boots had been worn by someone else for 
  a period of &quot;five or ten minutes to an hour&quot;. Sergeant Kennedy expected 
  to be able to detect that a person other than the usual wearer of the boots 
  had worn the boots after about one hour of wear.</p>
<p>
  [34] Sergeant Kennedy testified that his research suggests that feet leave distinctive 
  impressions inside shoes and boots. His opinions in the instant case were based 
  upon a comparison of the weight-bearing areas from shoes known to belong to 
  each of the victim, Faith Veltchev, Dimitre Tzenev and the appellant to the 
  foot impression in the boots. He compared the shape and placement of each toe, 
  the separation between the large toe and the other toes, the slope and angle 
  of the metatarsal ridge between the toe ball and the ball of the foot, the ball 
  of the foot and its weight-bearing arch, the arch length, and the width of the 
  heel. He testified that the sureness of his opinion varies with the clarity 
  of the foot impression. In this case, the impressions were relatively clean 
  and clear, although not clear enough for a &quot;high likelihood&quot; opinion. 
  </p>
<p>
  [35] Sergeant Kennedy testified that until research is complete, barefoot impression 
  analysis in shoes is not a positive means of identification but it is a valuable 
  tool to establish the likelihood of someone wearing shoes and to eliminate particular 
  individuals as wearers of shoes. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [36] As noted above, the appellant challenges the admissibility of Sergeant 
  Kennedy's evidence on two grounds. The first relates to the general field of 
  barefoot impression analysis and requires the determination of a threshold question, 
  namely, whether such evidence is capable of forming the subject matter of expert 
  testimony. The second involves the application of the Mohan criteria to determine 
  whether, in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge properly exercised 
  his discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>
<p>
  (i) Reliability</p>
<p>
  [37] Novel scientific theories or techniques are subject to &quot;special scrutiny&quot;; 
  so, too, is the novel application of established or recognized scientific techniques. 
  The threshold question that arises in relation to the admissibility of either 
  is well established: the court must be satisfied that the evidence proffered 
  is capable of being the subject of expert evidence. That is, the court must 
  be satisfied, as a threshold matter, that the proposed evidence is, indeed, 
  &quot;science&quot;. The burden is on the party putting forth the expert, in 
  this case the Crown, to establish its reliability on a balance of probabilities. 
  See R. v. Terceira (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 21 (Ont. C.A.); aff'd (1999), 
  142 C.C.C. (3d) 95 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [38] In R. v. J-L.J. (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 487 (S.C.C.) at paras. 34 and 28, 
  respectively, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the admissibility of expert 
  evidence is highly case specific and that the trial judge is to take seriously 
  the role of &quot;gatekeeper&quot;. The court set out the following factors 
  that should be considered in determining threshold reliability: (1) whether 
  the theory or technique can be and has been tested; (2) whether the theory or 
  technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or 
  potential rate of error or the existence of standards; and (4) whether the theory 
  or technique used has been generally accepted within the scientific community.</p>
<p>
  [39] In Terceira, supra, this court also held that threshold reliability must 
  be determined in each case and noted that whether the results presented and 
  the methods used are reasonably reliable are factors that may be considered 
  in determining reliability. </p>
<p> [40] Although footprint impression evidence is routinely accepted by courts<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>, 
  the same cannot be said of evidence of barefoot impressions in shoes. Barefoot 
  impression evidence was admitted in Regina v. L&eacute;g&egrave;re (1994), 95 
  C.C.C. (3d) 139 (N.B. C.A.)<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a>. In L&eacute;g&egrave;re, 
  the appellant appealed from convictions on four counts of first-degree murder. 
  While there was other evidence connecting the appellant to the first three murders, 
  the only evidence connecting the appellant to the fourth murder was barefoot 
  impression evidence. In this case, a bloody footprint was found at the crime 
  scene and a pair of boots that had been thoroughly washed was found at the same 
  motel where the victim's car was found. The Crown sought to introduce evidence 
  to show that the boots belonged to the accused and thus to connect the accused 
  to the crime scene. One of the grounds of appeal was that the trial judge erred 
  in allowing into evidence expert opinions as to the probability that the appellant's 
  feet impressions were in the pair of boots because the expert witnesses could 
  not offer any scientific or mathematical calculation as to the chance the impressions 
  in the boots could have been made by someone other than the appellant. The appellants 
  also argued that the facts upon which the experts based their opinions could 
  only support an opinion that the impressions in the boots were similar to impressions 
  that would be made by the appellant's feet. One of the experts was Sergeant 
  Kennedy. Sergeant Kennedy's evidence was confirmed by Special Agent William 
  Bodziak of the F.B.I. and Dr. Bettles, a podiatrist.</p>
<p>
  [41] In holding the evidence to be admissible, the court stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidence given by the experts was technical, and based upon the knowledge 
  and experience that they had accumulated in their field. It was not put forward 
  on the basis of any unproven scientific theory. It was admissible evidence, 
  again to be weighed by the jury in their determination beyond a reasonable doubt 
  of the guilt of the accused&#133; (p. 161)</p>
<p>
  [42] In L&eacute;g&egrave;re, the court appears to have dealt with the cumulative 
  expertise of all three experts. Further, there were two distinctive facts that 
  connected the accused to the boots in issue: the accused had a callus on his 
  right foot, caused by a cracked sole on the right boot, and there was a small 
  nail protruding in the left boot that caused a mark in the boot and on the appellant's 
  left heel.</p>
<p>
  [43] Such evidence was not ultimately admitted in the recent case of State v. 
  Jones, 541 S.E.2d 813 (S.C. 2001), however. The State wished to lead evidence 
  to connect the appellant to a pair of steel-toed boots that had allegedly left 
  a bloody footprint at the scene of two murders. To this end, the State had both 
  Sergeant Kennedy and Agent Derrick qualified in the area of barefoot impression 
  analysis. The trial judge admitted their evidence; the appellant was convicted. 
  The Supreme Court of South Carolina overturned the conviction on the basis that 
  the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the opinions based on barefoot 
  impression analysis. The court held that the study of barefoot insole impressions 
  was unreliable and that it is premature to accept that there is a science of 
  &quot;barefoot insole impressions&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [44] In rejecting Sergeant Kennedy's evidence, the court noted at para. 5: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While Kennedy testified that he had published several peer-reviewed articles, 
  he also testified that he was still in the process of collecting data in order 
  to determine which standards were appropriate for comparison purposes. Further, 
  he candidly acknowledged that earlier work in this area had been discredited.</p>
<p> [45] The court also held that there was insufficient evidence to show that: 
  (1) the technique had been published and peer-reviewed; (2) the method propounded 
  had been applied to this type of evidence in the past; and (3) the method was 
  consistent with recognized scientific laws and proceedings. In short, the court 
  concluded that &quot;it is premature to accept that there exists a science of 
  'barefoot insole impressions'&quot;.<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> </p>
<p> [46] Barefoot impression evidence must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case 
  basis to determine its admissibility. Based on the current state of the jurisprudence, 
  such evidence may be admissible where there are distinctive features of the 
  barefoot impression that can connect the footwear to the accused's feet, as 
  in L&eacute;g&egrave;re. It may also be admissible to show that an accused person 
  has not worn a particular pair of shoes or to eliminate persons as regular wearers 
  of shoes. The fact, however, that an accused person's footprint is &quot;similar 
  to&quot; the barefoot impression in a boot or shoe ought not to be admissible 
  as positive identification. As Sergeant Kennedy himself acknowledges, his research 
  has not reached the stage where he can make a categorical identification from 
  barefoot impressions. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Relevance</p>
<p> [47] The Mohan test requires that expert evidence meet four criteria in order 
  to be admissible: relevance, necessity, the absence of any exclusionary rule, 
  and a properly qualified expert. Relevance is the only criterion in issue in 
  this appeal.<a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="r6"></a> </p>
<p>
  [48] Relevance is a matter to be decided by the judge as a question of law. 
  In determining relevance, the first step is to determine whether the evidence 
  is logically relevant in the sense that it is so related to a fact in issue 
  that it tends to establish it. If so, the judge must decide, among other things, 
  whether its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, including 
  whether it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact is 
  disproportionate to its reliability. See Mohan at p. 411.</p>
<p>
  [49] When considering the probative value of Sergeant Kennedy's evidence, it 
  is important to keep in mind that the boots themselves were admissible. Their 
  relevance is clear - the boots were found inside the front closet of the victim's 
  home which tends to establish the proposition that someone who lived with the 
  victim was involved in his death or the effort to conceal the evidence of the 
  murder in the garage or both.</p>
<p>
  [50] What fact in issue tends to be established by Sergeant Kennedy's evidence 
  that the appellant was the likely wearer of the Eagle Rock boots?</p>
<p>
  [51] Apart from Sergeant Kennedy's evidence, there is no evidence that the appellant 
  owned the boots or that they belonged to him. Those who testified on this point 
  said that they had never seen the appellant wear the boots. All residents of 
  the home used the front hallway closet in which the boots were found. </p>
<p>
  [52] There is no evidence that the assailant wore the Eagle Rock boots during 
  the attack, as opposed to the boots simply being in the garage when the assault 
  took place. The bloodstains on the upper portion of each boot are inconsistent 
  with the boots being shielded by a pant leg. This suggests that the boots were 
  not worn at the time of the attack. However, when Sergeant Brown was asked about 
  the staining on the upper portions of the boots, he speculated that the staining 
  could have occurred if the assailant wore pants with short legs when committing 
  the assault. It should also be noted that this pattern of spatter staining was 
  also found on another pair of shoes found in the garage, the &quot;L.A. Gear&quot; 
  shoes.</p>
<p>
  [53] Sergeant Kennedy's evidence eliminated the victim and Faith Veltchev as 
  regular wearers of the boots. However, it did not eliminate Tzenev as a wearer 
  of the boots - the boots fit him and, as Sergeant Kennedy himself observed, 
  other persons could have worn the boots for a limited period of time without 
  affecting the patterns he observed. If the killer just borrowed the Eagle Rock 
  boots, the patterns in the boots might still only reveal the foot impressions 
  of the owner. The boots may have been worn by someone else at the time of the 
  murder, or the boots may have been sitting in the garage, unworn, at the time 
  of the murder. Sergeant Kennedy's evidence cannot exclude these possibilities. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] In the absence of evidence that the footwear belonged to the appellant 
  and was worn at the time of the offence, the evidence about the Eagle Rock boots 
  logically could do little to advance the case against the appellant. This fact 
  distinguishes the case at bar from L&eacute;g&egrave;re. In L&eacute;g&egrave;re, 
  there was evidence connecting the accused to the boots in that not only had 
  the accused's feet made a mark or impression on the boots but the boots had 
  made marks on the feet of the accused as well. Further, the bloody footprint 
  in L&eacute;g&egrave;re suggests that the boots had been used in the commission 
  of the offence. </p>
<p>
  [55] In any event, in our view, the slight probative value of Sergeant Kennedy's 
  evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The risk that the jury might 
  be over-awed by Sergeant Kennedy's expertise was a real one in this case. The 
  evidence occupied a day and was augmented by diagrams, a lengthy discussion 
  of the study of barefoot analysis and technical language about anatomy and laboratory 
  procedures. </p>
<p>
  [56] In light of the significant issues as to reliability of the evidence, its 
  lack of logical relevance and the risk of distortion in the fact-finding process, 
  the trial judge erred in principle in admitting Sergeant Kennedy's evidence. 
  Having regard to this conclusion we must decide whether to order a new trial 
  or whether to give effect to the appellant's argument of unreasonable verdict 
  and order an acquittal. </p>
<p>
  3. Was the verdict unreasonable?</p>
<p> [57] With respect to the unreasonableness of the verdict, the appellant relies 
  on the fact that there was no forensic evidence such as DNA or fingerprints 
  linking the appellant to the crime, either in the garage or in the car. There 
  was no evidence of a motive for the appellant to kill his friend and landlord. 
  The appellant also relies on the following elements of the evidence: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Opportunity - The appellant's opportunity to commit the homicide was not 
    exclusive. Tzenev may have been at home when the deceased arrived. Nothing 
    excluded an unknown assailant from either following the deceased into the 
    garage or arriving in his car with him. Tzenev and Faith Veltchev had as much, 
    or greater, opportunity to participate in the cleaning of the garage. </li>
  <li>Motive - In contrast to the appellant, who got along well with the deceased, 
    Faith Veltchev was in an unhappy marriage. She suspected the victim had been 
    carrying on an affair with Stefka Tzeneva, Tzenev's wife. As indicated, Faith 
    Veltchev was the beneficiary of her husband's life insurance policy. </li>
  <li>Linda Beland - Beland's evidence, properly appreciated, did not advance 
    the case against the appellant. Her description suggests someone other than 
    the appellant was at the mailbox.<a href="#7">[7]</a><a name="r7"></a> </li>
  <li>Eagle Rock boots - Sergeant Kennedy's evidence alone linked the appellant 
    to the boots. No other witness (including the housemates and friends) had 
    seen the appellant with these boots. The evidence shows that Sergeant Kennedy's 
    &quot;science&quot; is novel and susceptible to challenge. Even if accurate 
    or reliable, Sergeant Kennedy's evidence showed at best that (a) the boots 
    were most likely regularly worn by the appellant; (b) they were spattered 
    with the deceased's blood; and (c) there was unidentified DNA matter from 
    an unknown person intermingled with the blood of the deceased. No blood was 
    noted on the bottom treads, as might be expected if the boots were worn at 
    the time of the attack. Finally, Sergeant Kennedy could not exclude the possibility 
    that persons other than the usual wearer of the boots had worn the boots briefly.</li>
  <li>Statements - The statements attributed to the appellant by various witnesses 
    (that he waited for the deceased to come home but Veltchev did not arrive) 
    are consistent with the appellant's innocence. </li>
  <li>Other suspects - There was a body of evidence which could support the inference 
    that Faith Veltchev or Dimitre Tzenev (or both) were involved in the murder 
    of Veltchev. Faith Veltchev's motive has been discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [58] If Tzenev also suspected that the victim was having an affair with his 
  wife, Stefka, he would have had a motive to kill him. In addition, a hand drawn 
  map was found in Tzenev's room. It showed the school Tzenev attended and the 
  surrounding area including the mall where the victim's car was located-a six 
  minute walk from the school. Tzenev said the map was a school project. Tzenev 
  also had a visible scratch on his arm. When questioned by police he said it 
  had been caused by a slip and fall as he chased the house cat. Although Tzenev 
  would not have had the opportunity to clean up the garage prior to leaving for 
  school, there is no evidence that the cleanup occurred immediately after the 
  killing. </p>
<p>
  [59] There were inconsistencies between the evidence of Faith Veltchev and Tzenev. 
  Faith Veltchev said that she had called the police to report her husband's disappearance 
  Wednesday night. Tzenev said that she was worried and had begun calling people 
  to ask if they had seen her husband. Faith Veltchev's account is not supported 
  by police communications transcripts; her evidence was also inconsistent with 
  the statement she gave to the police on Thursday night after the victim's body 
  was found. Both Faith Veltchev and Tzenev said that on Thursday they stayed 
  home from work. and school respectively. Tzenev's account of how he passed the 
  day and whether he was alone with Faith Veltchev differed substantially from 
  her evidence. Although Tzenev was initially charged with the murder of the victim, 
  he was discharged at his preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>
  [60] A verdict will be unreasonable if a properly instructed jury acting judicially 
  could not reasonably have reached that verdict. The court, while accepting the 
  advantage that the trier of fact has in hearing and seeing the witnesses, must 
  to some extent re-examine and re-weigh the evidence but is not entitled merely 
  to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trier of fact. In this 
  case, our reweighing of the evidence has taken into consideration the conclusion 
  that the barefoot impression evidence should not have been admitted. </p>
<p>
  [61] An appellate court may scrutinize the evidence more closely in a case involving 
  eyewitness identification evidence as opposed to a case that turns on the credibility 
  of the evidence of witnesses. See for example R. v. Biniaris (2000), 143 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 at 20-25 (S.C.C.); see also R. v. A.G. (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 46 at 
  51. In this case, however, the Crown's case against the appellant is dependent 
  on the totality of the circumstantial evidence and does not depend solely on 
  the positive aspects of the identification evidence of a single witness. Based 
  on the time Ms. Beland said she was at the mailbox, the distinguishing features 
  of black hair and beard of the man she said she saw, and the compelling circumstantial 
  evidence that the killer was a resident of 82 Newport Crescent, Ms. Beland's 
  evidence has the effect of eliminating the other residents in the house as being 
  the person seen driving a grey four-door car away from the vicinity of 82 Newport 
  Crescent. In addition, the evidence of Mr. Deschambault, the postman, corroborated 
  Ms. Beland's evidence with respect to the man having black hair and a beard. 
  Even omitting the barefoot impression evidence the totality of the evidence 
  was such that a reasonable jury properly instructed could convict. If, as the 
  appellant suggests, more than one person may have been involved in killing the 
  victim, that would not render a verdict against the appellant unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [62] For the reasons given, we would allow the appeal, set aside the verdict 
  of guilt and order a new trial. </p>
