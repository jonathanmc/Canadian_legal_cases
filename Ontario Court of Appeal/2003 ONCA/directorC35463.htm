<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Paul Lamek of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated November 7, 2000, reported at (2000), 194 D.L.R. (4th) 527.</p>
<p>DOHERTY J.A.:</p>    <P>
  I</p>    <P>
  OVERVIEW</p>    <P>
  [1] NRS Mississauga Inc. (&quot;NRS&quot;) operated as a real estate broker 
  from 1985 to November 1989 and as such was subject to the provisions of the 
  Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.4 (&quot;REBBA&quot;). 
  Mr. Naeem Puri, the principal and president of NRS, committed suicide on November 
  8, 1989. Subsequent investigation of the affairs of NRS revealed that it was 
  insolvent and that funds which should have been held in trust by NRS for various 
  individuals had been misappropriated and put towards the day-to-day operation 
  of the company. </p>    <P>
  [2] This proceeding concerns the priorities of several claims made on the assets 
  of NRS after it failed. The outcome of this proceeding will determine, who among 
  the various entities with valid claims against NRS, will bear the financial 
  brunt of the failure of the company.</p>    
<P> [3] There are essentially three claimants.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  The Director,<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> acting under the auspices 
  of REBBA, represented twenty-nine individuals (the trust claimants). The trust 
  claimants had deposited funds in trust with NRS in connection with real estate 
  transactions that were pending on November 9, 1989. Section 20 of REBBA required 
  NRS to hold those deposits in a separate trust account pending the closing of 
  the transactions. The Director contended that the trust claimants should recover 
  their entire claims from the proceeds of the various assets of NRS before any 
  payments were made to any other claimants.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a></p>
<P>
  [4] The Toronto Dominion Bank (the &quot;Bank&quot;) had made loans to NRS over 
  the years. When NRS failed, the Bank was owed over $300,000 and held perfected 
  security on virtually all of the assets of NRS, including the accounts receivable. 
  The Bank took the position that funds held in NRS bank accounts designated as 
  trust accounts should be used to pay the trust claimants, but that under the 
  terms of its security, it was entitled to realize on all of the other assets 
  of NRS without regard to the claims made on behalf of the trust claimants. </p>    <P>
  [5] The Queen in Right of Canada represented by the Minister of National Revenue 
  (the &quot;Crown&quot;) alleged that NRS had failed to remit certain deductions 
  taken from its employees for tax purposes to the Crown and had also failed to 
  make certain payments to the Crown required by federal law. The Crown accepted 
  that its claim ranked behind the Bank's claim. It also accepted that the trust 
  claimants had a first claim on any true trust funds. The Crown contended, however, 
  that the funds in the trust accounts were not trust funds. It also argued that 
  after the Bank had been paid in full, the Crown had first claim on the remaining 
  assets of NRS by virtue of the statutory trust provisions of the Income Tax 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985 (5th Supp.) C. 1. Those provisions applied to the deductions 
  taken by NRS but not remitted to the Crown for the 1989 tax year (about $260,000).</p>    <P>
  [6] The application judge held in favour of the trust claimants. He ruled that 
  the funds realized from the collection of the accounts receivable by the Bank 
  were impressed with a constructive trust in favour of the trust claimants. He 
  further held that the funds in the trust accounts were trust funds and were 
  not available to the creditors of NRS. In the result, the trust claimants were 
  to be paid in full and the Bank would first claim on the remaining assets. The 
  Crown would not recover any part of the debt owed to it by NRS. </p>    <P>
  [7] The Bank and the Crown appeal. I would allow both appeals.</p>    <P>
  II</p>    <P>
  (b) The Nature of the Competing Claims</p>    <P>
  [8] NRS was a registered real estate broker under REBBA from 1985 to November 
  1989. It voluntarily surrendered its registration on about November 16, 1989. 
  Pursuant to s. 20 of REBBA, NRS was required to maintain a trust account and 
  a general account. It had both accounts at the same branch of the Bank. NRS 
  was required to place deposits received from individuals in respect of pending 
  real estate transactions in a trust account. As of November 9, 1989, there was 
  a shortfall of about $350,000 in that trust account. That shortfall decreased 
  as transactions closed after November 9. It was eventually determined that the 
  trust claimants were owed $179,423.01 as of the date of the application in 1993. 
  Most of that amount arose out of a few transactions that did not close thereby 
  entitling the putative purchasers to the return of their entire deposit.</p>    <P>
  [9] Four assets of NRS are germane to the claims advanced in this proceeding.</p>    
<ul>
  <li> The accounts receivable collected by the Bank ($138,279.21). <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a></li>
  <li>The funds in the trust account established by NRS ($35,782.17).</li>
  <li>The funds in the special trust account established by government investigators 
    after November 9, 1989 ($11,176.69).</li>
  <li>The surplus held by the Bank after it had liquidated the NRS assets and 
    recovered its indebtedness in full ($69,182.51). <a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a></li>
</ul>
<P> [10] As indicated above the trust claimants were owed $179,423.01.<a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="r6"></a> 
  The Director submitted that the funds in both trust accounts totalling about 
  $47,000 were trust funds or restored trust funds and were, therefore, the property 
  of the trust claimants in accordance with the terms of the trust on which the 
  deposits had been made. The Director further claimed that there was a direct 
  and substantial connection between the misappropriation of the trust funds and 
  the accounts receivable generated by the day-to-day operation of the business 
  justifying the imposition of a constructive trust over the accounts receivable 
  in favour of the trust claimants. Lastly, the Director submitted that when the 
  Bank purported to realize on the accounts receivable, it knew or reasonably 
  ought to have known that the accounts receivable were impressed with the constructive 
  trust in favour of the trust claimants. The Bank was, therefore, a constructive 
  trustee of the proceeds of the accounts receivable and was required to remit 
  to the trust claimants the funds needed to fully pay their claims.</p>
<P>
  [11] The Bank's claim is based on security agreements entered into with NRS 
  in 1985 and 1986. It is undisputed that the Bank had a perfected security interest 
  in the accounts receivable of NRS as of November 9, 1989. The accounts receivable 
  represented monies owing to NRS from other brokers as a result of completed 
  real estate transactions. Under the terms of the Bank's security, any payments 
  received by NRS on account of a debt owed to NRS was to held by NRS in trust 
  for the Bank. The Bank maintained that its charge on the accounts receivable 
  was a fixed charge so that when NRS received payment on an accounts receivable, 
  the Bank had legal title to the funds.</p>    <P>
  [12] The Crown's claim was for some $430,000 owing as of the end of 1989. NRS 
  had failed to remit money deducted from its employees for tax purposes and had 
  also failed to make the required payments under the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. C-8 and to pay the required unemployment insurance premiums. The income 
  tax claim of $260,000 was subject to a deemed statutory trust under s. 227(4) 
  of the Income Tax Act. Based on Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp., 
  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411, the Crown accepted that its claim was behind that of the 
  Bank. The Crown contended, however, that the funds in the two trust accounts, 
  over which the Bank made no claim, were not trust funds, but were rather the 
  proceeds from the operation of the business of NRS. It contended that its claim 
  took priority over any other claim insofar as these amounts were concerned. 
  It made the same argument in relation to the surplus ($69,182.51) remaining 
  after the Bank had recovered the amounts owing to it. </p>    <P>
  III</p>    <P>
  Events Following Mr. Puri's Suicide</p>    <P>
  [13] On November 10, 1989, two days after Mr. Puri's suicide, the Registrar 
  of Real Estate and Business Brokers (the &quot;Registrar&quot;) ordered an inspection 
  of the books and records of NRS pursuant to s. 12 of REBBA. That inspection 
  quickly revealed that trust funds were missing. The Registrar made an investigation 
  order under s. 15 of the Act a few days later.</p>    <P>
  [14] On November 11, 1989, the remaining shareholders of NRS, some of whom were 
  guarantors of the company's indebtedness to the Bank, and had provided collateral 
  security to the Bank, asked the Bank to appoint a receiver over NRS and to realize 
  on its security. The Bank appointed Arthur Anderson Inc. to take possession 
  of the assets of NRS. The Bank made a formal demand for repayment of the loans 
  owed by NRS and on or about November 22, 1989 began the process of collecting 
  the accounts receivable.</p>    <P>
  [15] Within two weeks of undertaking the receivership, Arthur Anderson Inc. 
  reported to the Bank that the books and records of NRS were inaccurate and misleading, 
  NRS was experiencing significant operating losses and there was a substantial 
  shortfall in the NRS trust account. Arthur Anderson Inc. advised that trust 
  funds had been used to pay operating expenses and to prepay commissions to salespersons 
  of NRS. The misuse of trust funds had been going on for up to two years. Arthur 
  Anderson Inc. also advised the Bank that some deposits had never been placed 
  in the trust account, but had been deposited directly into the general account. 
  </p>    <P>
  [16] Inspectors from the Business Practices Division of the Ministry of Consumer 
  and Corporate Relations were conducting their own investigation at the same 
  time that Arthur Anderson Inc. was conducting its review on behalf of the Bank. 
  The investigation by the government regulators included interviews with employees 
  of NRS. The regulators' findings were consistent with those reported by Arthur 
  Anderson Inc. One employee advised that she had been depositing trust monies 
  directly into the general account on the instruction of Mr. Puri. These monies 
  had gone towards the payment of the operating expenses of NRS, including the 
  making of advance payments on commissions to salespersons. </p>    <P>
  [17] On November 22, 1989, the Director, acting under s. 18 of REBBA, issued 
  a &quot;freeze&quot; order directing the Bank:</p>    
<P class="indent"> [T]o hold any and all assets or trust funds on deposit or under 
  control for safekeeping which are or are being or have been kept and maintained 
  by NRS in any account &#133;</p>    
<P>
  [18] Despite the direction, the Bank proceeded to realize on its security. It 
  recovered about $417,500, leaving a surplus of slightly over $69,000 after the 
  Bank had recovered its loans. The Bank did not attempt to seize the money in 
  the NRS trust account or the money in the special trust account.</p>    <P>
  [19] In addition to the security on which it realized, the Bank held personal 
  guarantees from the other shareholders of NRS and collateral mortgages on property 
  owned by those shareholders. The Bank regarded that security as sound and initially 
  anticipated looking to it for recovery. When the assets of NRS proved sufficient 
  to cover the debt to the Bank, it was unnecessary to take any steps to realize 
  on the additional security.</p>    <P>
  IV</p>    <P>
  The Bank's Appeal</p>    <P>
  [20] The Bank's appeal focuses on its claim to the proceeds from the realization 
  of the accounts receivable. If the Bank is entitled to those proceeds, it will 
  be repaid in full and it has no interest in the other assets. The application 
  judge held that the proceeds were impressed with a constructive trust in favour 
  of the trust claimants. He so held based on his finding that the trust funds 
  were improperly used to support the day-to-day operations of NRS and thereby 
  to generate the accounts receivable. The application judge next held that when 
  the Bank realized on the accounts receivable after November 22, 1989, it knew 
  or ought to have known that the proceeds were impressed with a trust. The Bank 
  was, therefore, in the position of a constructive trustee and was required to 
  remit the funds realized from the collection of the accounts receivable to the 
  trust claimants to the extent required to fully satisfy their claims.</p>    <P>
  [21] It is agreed that the deposits were subject to a trust and that NRS breached 
  that trust and its fiduciary duty to the trust claimants when it misappropriated 
  the deposits. The Director also argues that the deposits were subject to a statutory 
  trust created by s. 19(2) and s. 20(1) of REBBA. I disagree. These provisions 
  provide: </p>    
<P class="indent"> 19(2) Every broker shall maintain a trust account for every 
  person from whom trust money is received in which shall be entered full details 
  of all trust money so received and disbursements therefrom.</p>
<P class="indent">20(1) Every broker shall maintain an account designated as a 
  trust account in a bank listed in Schedule I or II to the Bank Act (Canada), 
  loan or trust corporation, credit union, as defined in the Credit Unions and 
  Caisses Populaires Act, or Province of Ontario Savings Office in which shall 
  be deposited all money that come into the broker's hands in trust for other 
  persons in connection with the broker's business, and shall at all times keep 
  the money separate and apart from money belonging to the broker or to the partnership, 
  in the case of a partnership, and shall disburse the money only n accordance 
  with the terms of the trust.</p>
<P>
  [22] Neither section creates a trust. Instead, both assume the existence of 
  a trust and require that the broker maintain appropriate books and records and 
  a separate account designated as a trust account. Nor can I agree with counsel 
  for the Director's submission that REBBA reveals a legislative intent that trust 
  claimants should rank in priority to any other claimant should the broker become 
  insolvent. Nothing in the Act gives the trust claimants any remedies or special 
  status over other creditors in the event of the broker's default: see Ontario 
  (Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations-Business Practices Division) 
  v. Safeguard Real Estate Ltd. (1994), 114 D.L.R. (4th) 546 at 548 (Gen. Div.).</p>    <P>
  [23] Counsel for the Director also relies on the Director's power in s. 18 of 
  REBBA to freeze &quot;assets or trust funds&quot;. While this power is clearly 
  directed to the protection of &quot;clients or customers&quot;, it does no more 
  than preserve the status quo by preventing the dissipation of assets or trust 
  funds. Section 18 does not give a trust claimant, or for that matter anyone 
  else, any right in the assets subject to the freeze order that the claimants 
  did not otherwise have. Similarly, a failure to comply with an order made under 
  s. 18 cannot create or destroy property rights in the assets which are subject 
  to that order.</p>    <P>
  [24] The Director could establish the trust claimant's entitlement to the proceeds 
  of the accounts receivable only if he could demonstrate two things. First, that 
  the accounts receivable were properly made the subject of a constructive trust. 
  Second, that when the Bank realized on the accounts receivable, it was in knowing 
  receipt of trust property in accordance with the principles described in Citadel 
  General Assurance Co. v. Lloyds Bank Canada (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 411 (S.C.C.). 
  </p>    <P>
  [25] The application judge referred to the authorities, including Soulos v. 
  Korkontzilas (1997), 146 D.L.R. (4th) 214 (S.C.C.), governing the determination 
  of whether a constructive trust should be imposed on assets. He also recognized 
  that the trust claimants could not rely on tracing principles to demonstrate 
  that the accounts receivable were trust property. He said at paragraphs 31-32,</p>    
<P class="indent"> [E]ven if strict tracing rules are not to apply here, how does 
  that help the trust claimants as against the Bank?</p>
<P class="indent">In my view, this case has to be considered under the rubric 
  of &quot;knowing receipt&quot; as a variety of potential restitution situations. 
  &#133; </p>
<P>
  [26] With respect, I think the application judge erred in conflating two distinct 
  issues. The question of whether the Bank was in knowing receipt of trust property 
  could only arise after it had been determined that the accounts receivable were 
  properly the subject of a constructive trust. Evidence relevant to the determination 
  of whether the Bank was in knowing receipt of trust property, which the application 
  judge canvassed in detail, was not relevant to the question of whether the accounts 
  receivable should be the subject of a constructive trust. The application judge 
  erroneously turned to the question of whether the bank knew or ought to have 
  known of the existence of the constructive trust without first determining whether 
  the evidence relied upon by the bank justified the imposition of a constructive 
  trust over the accounts receivable. </p>    <P>
  [27] In Soulos, supra, at p. 221 McLachlin J., for the majority, described the 
  constructive trust in these terms:</p>    
<P class="indent"> [T]he constructive trust is an ancient and eclectic institution 
  imposed by law not only to remedy unjust enrichment, but to hold persons in 
  different situations to high standards of trust and probity and prevent them 
  from retaining property which in &quot;good conscience&quot; they should not 
  be permitted to retain. This served the end, not only of doing justice in the 
  case before the court, but of protecting relationships of trust and the institutions 
  that depend on these relationships.</p>    
<P>
  [28] McLachlin J. then divided the circumstances which can give rise to a constructive 
  trust into two broad categories. She said at pp. 227-28:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The first category concerns property obtained by a wrongful 
  act of the defendant, notably breach of fiduciary obligation or breach of duty 
  of loyalty. The traditional English institutional trusts largely fall under 
  but may not exhaust (at least in Canada) this category. The second category 
  concerns situations where the defendant has not acted wrongfully in obtaining 
  the property, but where he would be unjustly enriched to the plaintiff's detriment 
  by being permitted to keep the property for himself. The two categories are 
  not mutually exclusive. Often wrongful acquisition of property will be associated 
  with unjust enrichment, and vice versa. However, either situation alone may 
  be sufficient to justify imposition of a constructive trust.</p>    
<P>
  [29] In Soulos, supra, the plaintiff was the beneficiary of the trust and the 
  defendant was the defaulting trustee. In this case, the contest is between the 
  Director representing the beneficiaries and the Bank, a secured creditor of 
  the trustee. The Bank cannot be said to have acquired the proceeds of the accounts 
  receivable by a wrongful act. While the Director contends that the Bank realized 
  on the assets in violation of the &quot;freezing&quot; order, I can give little 
  credence to this submission given that the Director had full knowledge of the 
  Bank's conduct and did not suggest that it was improper until about six years 
  after the fact. The terms of the &quot;freezing&quot; order also did not speak 
  to the Bank's ultimate entitlement to the proceeds of the accounts receivable. 
  </p>    <P>
  [30] It also begs the question to contend, as the Director does, that the Bank 
  was unjustly enriched by realizing on the accounts receivable. The Bank was 
  unjustly enriched only if the accounts receivable were impressed with a constructive 
  trust. If they were not, the Bank was entitled to the proceeds. To speak of 
  the Bank as being unjustly enriched by realizing on the accounts receivable 
  is to presume the existence of the very fact in dispute, that is the existence 
  of the constructive trust. </p>    <P>
  [31] I think the Director's contention that the proceeds of the accounts receivable 
  should be impressed with a constructive trust should be examined first from 
  the perspective of the relationship between the trust claimants and NRS and 
  the conduct of NRS. Viewed in that way, there is no doubt that NRS, a fiduciary, 
  misappropriated trust property by a wrongful act. </p>    <P>
  [32] In Soulos, supra, at 230, McLachlin J. identified four conditions which 
  were generally necessary before a court would impose a constructive trust based 
  on wrongful conduct:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (1) The defendant must have been under an equitable obligation, 
  that is, an obligation of the type that courts of equity have enforced, in relation 
  to the activities giving rise to the assets of his hands;</p>
<P class="indent">(2) The assets in the hands of the defendant must be shown to 
  have resulted from deemed or actual agency activities of the defendant in breach 
  of his equitable obligation to the plaintiff; </p>
<P class="indent">(3) The plaintiff must show a legitimate reason for seeking 
  a proprietary remedy, either personal or related to the need to ensure that 
  others like the defendant remain faithful to their duties and;</p>
<P class="indent">(4) There must be no factors which would render imposition of 
  a constructive trust unjust in all the circumstances of the case; e.g., the 
  interests of intervening creditors must be protected.</p>
<P>
  [33] The first prerequisite poses no difficulty in this case. NRS owed a fiduciary 
  duty to the trust claimants. That duty required it to hold the trust monies. 
  Instead, NRS used the monies for its own purposes in clear breach of both the 
  terms of the trust and NRS's equitable duty of loyalty.</p>    <P>
  [34] The third prerequisite identified in Soulos is also established in this 
  case. By imposing a proprietary remedy, the court would stress the importance 
  of the relationship between NRS and the trust claimants and seek to maintain 
  the integrity of that relationship by deterring others from violating the terms 
  of their trust.</p>    <P>
  [35] The second prerequisite identified in Soulos, supra, the connection between 
  the assets over which it is sought to impose a constructive trust and the misconduct 
  of the trustee raises considerable difficulties in this case. The evidence offered 
  by the Director speaks at a level of generality that makes it very difficult 
  to draw a direct and clear link between any of the accounts receivable and the 
  misappropriation of trust funds. This disconnect between the constructive trust 
  claim advanced by the Director and the evidence relied on by the Director is 
  explained by the history of the proceedings. When the Director initially brought 
  the application in 1993, he did not claim a constructive trust or any entitlement 
  to any part of the proceeds of the accounts receivable except the surplus. The 
  material the Director filed did not speak to the factual issues relevant to 
  the existence of a constructive trust. The claim for a constructive trust first 
  emerged in 1997. The Director did not file any new material apart from an agreed 
  statement of fact. Consequently, counsel for the Director and the individual 
  claimants were left to cull through evidence filed in reference to one claim 
  to find support for an entirely different claim. Counsel took the court to various 
  exhibits to affidavits filed on the application in an effort to forge a clear 
  link between the misappropriation of trust funds and the accounts receivable 
  collected by the Bank. Those submissions sounded more like evidence that might 
  be given by a forensic accountant than legal argument. </p>    <P>
  [36] The material relied on by the Director does not draw any connection between 
  a specific account receivable and the misappropriated trust funds. Indeed, the 
  material does not reveal when the particular accounts receivable on which the 
  Bank realized came into existence. For example, while the evidence showed that 
  trust funds were used to make advance payments on commissions, there was no 
  attempt to connect any of those commissions to transactions which generated 
  accounts receivable collected by the Bank. Nor, does the material establish 
  the extent of the misappropriation or how much of the misappropriated money 
  was actually used in the operation of the business. Finally, there is no indication 
  as to the extent to which the day-to-day operation of the business was maintained 
  by the use of misappropriated funds. If the business was maintained entirely 
  through the use of trust funds, then the imposition of a constructive trust 
  on the accounts receivable would seem more appropriate than if the misappropriated 
  funds played a relatively small role in maintaining the operation of the business. 
  I agree with the application judge's description of the state of the evidence 
  (para. 31):</p>    
<P class="indent"> The most that they [the trust claimants] can do is show (as 
  I have found they have) that trust monies were used for general business purposes 
  of NRS.</p>    
<P>
  [37] There is merit to counsel for the Bank's submission that considerable commercial 
  uncertainty would result if a constructive trust were to be imposed on all business 
  assets to the full extent of the trust claim upon a showing only that some unspecified 
  amount of trust funds were used at some unspecified time in some unspecified 
  way to assist to some unspecified degree in maintaining the operation of the 
  business. While McLachlin J. in Soulos, supra, was careful to avoid any suggestion 
  that any of the four conditions she described were prerequisites to the finding 
  of a constructive trust, I think the nature of the connection between the misconduct 
  of the trustee and the assets over which it is sought to impose a constructive 
  trust is of significant importance in a commercial context. </p>    <P>
  [38] This record reveals only the most general of connections between the misappropriation 
  of trust funds and the accounts receivable over which the Director seeks to 
  impose a constructive trust. If a constructive trust is properly imposed on 
  this record, it would seem to me that a constructive trust is properly imposed 
  on all business assets whenever it is shown that trust funds of whatever amount 
  were improperly used in the conduct of the business. That result would shift 
  the risk that the trustee might act dishonestly entirely to the shoulders of 
  the trustee's business creditors. </p>    <P>
  [39] In the light of the application judge's finding that the evidence showed 
  no more than that trust monies were used for the general business purposes of 
  NRS, a finding with which I fully agree, it was inappropriate to impose a constructive 
  trust on the accounts receivable. The Bank was entitled, under the terms of 
  its security agreements with NRS, to realize on those accounts receivable. </p>    <P>
  [40] Although I would not impose a constructive trust given the absence of any 
  clear connection between the misappropriation of trust funds and the accounts 
  receivable collected by the Bank, I will consider the fourth prerequisite identified 
  in Soulos, supra, for the sake of completeness. That condition speaks to a consideration 
  of the equities as between the victim of the misconduct and third parties such 
  as creditors. In one sense, the Bank can justifiably claim that the imposition 
  of a constructive trust would be unjust. It had perfected security on the accounts 
  receivable which predated the misappropriation of the trust funds by several 
  years. Realistically speaking, the Bank could not be expected to have guarded 
  against the misconduct of NRS. </p>    <P>
  [41] While this view of the events is not unattractive, I think the equities 
  as between the Bank and the trust claimants would justify the imposition of 
  a constructive trust if a clear connection between the misconduct and the assets 
  over which the trust was sought to be imposed had been established. I say that 
  for three reasons. First, the trust claimants were not, and never intended to 
  be, creditors of NRS in the ordinary sense. By depositing trust funds with NRS, 
  the trust claimants were not accepting any risk of economic harm should NRS 
  become insolvent. They were entitled to expect that their money would be kept 
  separate and apart from the assets of NRS and would be returned to them in its 
  entirety in the event of insolvency. The Bank was a creditor. As such, it must 
  be taken to have assumed the economic risks associated with the potential insolvency 
  of the borrower. </p>    <P>
  [42] Second, while the Bank could reasonably expect to have recourse to the 
  assets of NRS should NRS default on the loan, the Bank could not reasonably 
  expect that the value of those assets would be increased through the misappropriation 
  of trust funds by NRS and the use of those funds to augment the value of the 
  business assets of NRS. In other words, the Bank could not expect its borrower 
  to become a thief in order to enhance or protect the value of the Bank's security.</p>    <P>
  [43] Third, the Bank had recourse to other security in the form of personal 
  guarantees and collateral mortgages. That security was solid and initially the 
  Bank had intended to look to that security for recovery. It is appropriate when 
  considering the equities as between trust claimants and the Bank to bear in 
  mind that the Bank had other security which could have fully satisfied the debt 
  of NRS.</p>    <P>
  [44] In summary, I think the application judge erred in imposing a constructive 
  trust on the accounts receivable. As I would not impose a constructive trust 
  on those assets, the question of whether the Bank was in knowing receipt of 
  trust assets does not arise. Given my conclusion that the Bank was entitled 
  to realize on the accounts receivable, it has no interest in the other assets 
  in issue in this proceeding. I will address those assets in the context of the 
  Crown's appeal.</p>    <P>
  V</p>    <P>
  The Crown's Appeal</p>    <P>
  [45] The application judge dealt with the Crown's claim in short order. He acknowledged 
  that the funds in the trust accounts were not the funds deposited by trust claimants, 
  but were rather earned but unpaid commissions owing to salespersons by NRS. 
  In the case of the trust account existing as of November 9, the funds had not 
  been transferred from that account to the general account when the transactions 
  to which they referred closed. The application judge went on to hold, however, 
  that as the funds were in trust accounts they should be regarded as replacing 
  or restoring trust funds that NRS had improperly removed from the trust accounts 
  prior to November 9, 1989. As I read the reasons, the application judge was 
  satisfied that the mere fact that the funds were in trust accounts was sufficient 
  to hold that they were restored or replaced trust funds. </p>    <P>
  [46] The Crown's claim relates to the funds in the two NRS trust accounts and 
  the surplus left after the Bank had fully recovered its debt. I will address 
  the claim for the surplus first. The surplus, $69,182.51, consists of $12,329.80, 
  left in the NRS general account on November 9, 1989, and about $57,000 representing 
  part of the proceeds from the realization on the accounts receivable. The Director's 
  claim to the $57,000 rested entirely on the assertion that the proceeds of the 
  accounts receivable were subject to a constructive trust. As I would reject 
  that claim, it follows that the Director can claim no priority over the Crown 
  to the $57,000. The Crown's claim, based on the deemed trust provisions in s. 
  227(4) and s. 227(5) of the Income Tax Act, gives it priority over any claim 
  the Director might have once it has been determined that the funds were not 
  subject to a constructive trust. </p>    <P>
  [47] The funds in the general account on November 9, 1989 stand in a different 
  position. Trust funds had been placed directly into the general account on a 
  regular basis for up to two years prior to November 9. It is a safe inference 
  that over $12,000 in trust monies were placed into the general account during 
  that time. Where a trustee mixes its own funds with those of a beneficiary and 
  afterwards withdrawals are made from that mixed fund, the trustee is deemed 
  to have drawn out his own money first: Re Kolari (1981), 36 O.R. (2d) 473 at 
  478 (Dist. Ct.). On this approach, the money in the general account as of November 
  9 was trust money and is properly payable to the trust claimants. </p>    <P>
  [48] The Crown contends that as the funds in the trust accounts were not trust 
  funds, they could only be regarded as replacing or restoring misappropriated 
  trust funds if they were placed in the trust accounts with the intention of 
  replacing misappropriated trust funds. The Crown submits that the application 
  judge erred in relying on Director of Business Practices Division of the Ministry 
  of Consumer and Commercial Relations v. Safeguard Real Estate Ltd., supra, to 
  support the proposition that any funds left in a trust account should be regarded 
  as restored or replaced trust funds.</p>    <P>
  [49] I do not think that the funds in the NRS trust account ($35,782.17) or 
  in the trust account established after November 9 by the government regulators 
  ($11,176.19) can be said to be replaced or restored trust funds. It is clear 
  from the authorities that it is only where the defaulting trustee deposits new 
  funds into a trust account with the intention of restoring or replacing misappropriated 
  trust funds, that the new funds will be impressed with the trust: Re Carson, 
  [1924] 4 D.L.R. 492 at 493-94 (Ont. C.A.); In Re Ridout Real Estate Ltd. (1958), 
  36 C.B.R. 111 at 118-19 (Ont. S.C.). If Director of Business Practices Division 
  of the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations v. Safeguard Real Estate 
  Ltd., supra, can be read as standing for the proposition that the mere fact 
  that funds are in a trust account is enough to give them the status of replaced 
  or restored trust funds, I must disagree with that authority. I would, however, 
  observe that in respect of at least part of the money described in Safeguard, 
  supra, the defaulting trustee elected to place money realized from the collection 
  of accounts receivable into the trust account after a Director's freeze order 
  had been made under REBBA. That conduct could support the inference of an intention 
  to restore trust funds. </p>    <P>
  [50] NRS had nothing to do with the $11,176.19 placed into a trust fund established 
  by the government inspectors after November 9, 1989. There is no basis upon 
  which to hold that NRS intended that those funds should replace the misappropriated 
  trust funds.</p>    <P>
  [51] The $35,782.17 in the trust account as of November 9 was there because 
  NRS had not moved those funds into the general account after the completion 
  of the relevant transactions. There is no evidence as to NRS' intention in respect 
  of those funds. Given the chaotic nature of the business affairs of NRS in November 
  1989, it cannot be reasonably inferred that by leaving the funds in the trust 
  account, NRS intended to restore previously misappropriated trust funds. NRS 
  had simply not moved the money to the general account when the end came suddenly 
  on November 9, 1989. </p>    <P>
  VI</p>    <P>
  [52] I would allow the appeal of both the Bank and the Crown. The Bank was entitled 
  to realize on the accounts receivable. The Crown has first claim on the funds 
  in the two trust accounts and the surplus funds except for the funds in the 
  general account as of November 9, 1989. </p>    <P>
  [53] The Bank and the Crown should serve and file their submissions with respect 
  to costs both on the application and on the appeal within ten days of receipt 
  of these reasons. The Director and the individual claimants who were represented 
  in these proceedings shall serve and file their submissions with respect to 
  costs within ten days of receipt of the submissions of the Bank and the Crown.</p>
