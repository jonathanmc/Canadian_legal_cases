<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants submit that the motions judge erred in failing to find that 
  they were deemed directors and therefore entitled to dispute the petition. The 
  motions judge did not make an express finding on whether or not on the evidence 
  the appellants were deemed directors because he concluded that s. 115(4) of 
  the Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.B-16 (Act) is a provision 
  imposing responsibilities, but not conferring powers or rights. Thus, on the 
  motions judge's view, the appellants had no right to dispute the petition. </p>
<p> [2] The appellants submit that the motions judge erred in his interpretation 
  of s. 115(4) of the Act. They contend that the subsection contemplates powers 
  as well as responsibilities. Even assuming that the appellants are right in 
  their interpretation of s. 115(4) - and we make no finding on this issue - we 
  nonetheless conclude that the appellants are not deemed directors. On the evidence 
  they neither managed nor supervised the management of the business or affairs 
  of the corporation as required by s. 115(4). The business of Diversified no 
  longer exists; it has been wound up by Deloitte and Touche. </p>
<p>
  [3] All the appellants can claim is that they have the companies' books and 
  records and that they propose to begin a derivative action on the companies' 
  behalf, for which they need the leave of the court. </p>
<p>
  [4] In our view this does not amount to managing or supervising the affairs 
  of the corporation. We add that although the motions judge did not expressly 
  make a factual finding on whether the appellants were deemed directors, he did 
  find that they were not de facto directors, a finding that on this record is 
  virtually equivalent and is entirely supported by the record. </p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $2,500. 
  </p>
<p> [6] The cross-appeal is dismissed on the basis that the undertaking in paragraph 
  33 of the respondent's factum is operative given the final paragraph of Farley 
  J.'s endorsement. </p>
