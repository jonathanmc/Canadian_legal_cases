<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Nick Borkovich of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 13, 2001 and from the sentence imposed by Justice 
  Nick Borkovich dated January 18, 2002.</p>
<p>SIMMONS J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] At the conclusion of this appeal, the president of the panel stated that 
  the appeal was allowed for reasons to follow. These are the reasons.</p>
<p>
  [2] The main issue on this appeal was whether the trial judge provided adequate 
  instructions to the jury concerning evidence of discreditable conduct by the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant was charged with incest, sexual assault and sexual exploitation 
  in relation to his daughters Y. and P. He was also charged with assault with 
  a weapon in relation to P.</p>
<p>
  [4] P. was only eight years old at the time of the trial. When called as a witness, 
  she did not respond to questions put to her on the preliminary application to 
  determine whether she could be sworn. Accordingly, P. did not testify. As there 
  was no other evidence to support the charges that the appellant sexually abused 
  P., at the conclusion of the Crown's case, the trial judge dismissed the charges 
  of incest, sexual assault and sexual exploitation relating to P. </p>
<p>
  [5] Subsequently, after finding that there was no evidence that the appellant 
  assaulted P. with a weapon during the time frame alleged in the indictment, 
  the trial judge also dismissed the assault with a weapon charge.</p>
<p>
  [6] Although the trial judge dismissed all of the charges relating to P., there 
  remained evidence before the jury that the appellant physically abused P. outside 
  the time frame alleged in the indictment. In addition, there was evidence before 
  the jury relating to the following matters:</p>
<p>
  i) sexual misconduct by the appellant against Y. outside the time frame alleged 
  in the indictment;</p>
<p>
  ii) physical abuse by the appellant against Y. and the children's mother; and</p>
<p>
  iii) allegations that the appellant smoked marijuana, that he walked around 
  the house unclothed, that he watched pornographic movies, and that he used alcohol 
  and marijuana to entice sexual favours from Y.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant admitted that he smoked marijuana, that he watched pornographic 
  movies, that he occasionally spanked the children and that he had a homemade 
  strap for the purposes of &quot;deterrence&quot;. However, he denied the balance 
  of the allegations of discreditable conduct and the allegations in the indictment.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge's instructions to the jury concerning the foregoing evidence 
  were as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> You recall that the Crown in his address told you to remember 
  [P.] as she clutched the doll in the witness box and invited you to infer that 
  she was frightened and that the reason for that was the presence of her father. 
  You must not do that. You will recall that her attendance in the witness box 
  was for the purpose of determining whether or not she was able to give evidence 
  in the case. She was not. Therefore she was not a witness in this trial and 
  gave no evidence. You must not draw any inference with respect to her in coming 
  to your decision as to guilt or innocence.</p>
<p class="indent">You will recall also the Crown's heated and impassioned address 
  to you on Friday last. The issue you must determine is whether the Crown has 
  proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the sexual offences 
  charged and not that he is a bad person. You must come to your decision in a 
  calm dispassionate and unbiased manner and consider only the evidence and apply 
  the evidence, as you find it, to the law as I give it to you.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown submits that the evidence of discreditable conduct by the appellant 
  was admissible to show the atmosphere in the household and to explain why Y. 
  did not leave before she did and why she initially denied being sexually abused. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] The Crown also submits that the first paragraph of the foregoing instructions 
  amounted to a general instruction to the jury to disregard the evidence relating 
  to P. and that the second paragraph was an adequate, albeit imperfect, instruction 
  concerning discreditable conduct. In particular, the Crown contends that the 
  second paragraph was one of many instructions designed to focus the jury's attention 
  on the real issues in the trial, and that it was sufficient to make it clear 
  to the jury that the question of whether the appellant was a bad person should 
  not enter their deliberations.</p>
<p>
  [11] I reject the Crown's submissions concerning the adequacy of the foregoing 
  instructions. In my view, the instruction relating to P. was solely a response 
  to comments made by the Crown during his closing address. As such, it was not 
  sufficient to make it clear to the jury that, in deciding the case, the jury 
  was obliged to disregard the evidence concerning abuse of P., including evidence 
  of sexually inappropriate behaviour by P. while in the company of her mother.</p>
<p>
  [12] As for the second paragraph of the foregoing instructions, in my view, 
  it was insufficient to eliminate the risk of prejudice arising from the evidence 
  of other discreditable conduct for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [13] First, the evidence of other discreditable conduct adduced at trial created 
  a significant risk of prejudice. In particular, Y's evidence alleging sexual 
  misconduct by the appellant outside the period of the indictment amounted to 
  similar fact evidence. Although not as serious as the conduct alleged in the 
  indictment, given that Y.'s mother corroborated at least some of it, there was 
  a substantial risk that the jury would misuse it to reason that the appellant 
  had also committed the acts alleged in the indictment. The very nature of this 
  evidence required a careful instruction concerning the permissible and impermissible 
  uses of the evidence. No such instruction was given. </p>
<p>
  [14] Second, the instruction also lacked the following important components:</p>
<p class="indent"> i) it failed to specifically caution the jury against using 
  the evidence of discreditable conduct to reason that the appellant is the type 
  of person who would commit the offences charged; </p>
<p class="indent">ii) it failed to caution the jury that they could use the disputed 
  evidence of discreditable conduct only if they were satisfied that the disputed 
  conduct occurred; and </p>
<p class="indent">iii) it failed to caution the jury that they must not use the 
  evidence of discreditable conduct to conclude that the appellant was deserving 
  of punishment and therefore convict him of the offences charged.</p>
<p>
  [15] The first omission was particularly serious. Despite the instruction that 
  the question of whether the appellant is a bad person was not an issue in the 
  case, the nature and extent of the evidence of discreditable conduct created 
  a real risk that the jury would, in any event, draw the common sense inference 
  that the appellant was the type of person to commit the offences charged.</p>
<p>
  [16] During the course of argument, Crown counsel fairly conceded that, in the 
  event we found the trial judge's instructions to be inadequate, this is not 
  a case in which the proviso can properly be applied. I agree. </p>
<p>
  [17] In my view, the appeal must be allowed. Accordingly, I would set aside 
  the convictions and order a new trial on the charges for which the appellant 
  was convicted.</p>
