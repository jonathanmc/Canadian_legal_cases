<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Edward G. McNeely of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated May 15, 2001.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.:</p>
<p>
  Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The Appellant, Do, was charged and convicted of one count of possession 
  of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. His co-accused, the appellant Vo, 
  was also charged with one count of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking 
  of which he was convicted and one count of trafficking in heroin of which he 
  was acquitted. Both Do and Vo appeal their conviction. </p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] On March 2, 2000, the police conducted surveillance on apartment 905 at 
  1105 Westlodge Avenue, after receiving a tip from a reliable informant that 
  heroin was being sold from that residence. An officer observed Do knock at the 
  door of the apartment, which was answered by Vo. Vo and Do spoke briefly and 
  then Vo went back inside the apartment. Vo returned a short time later and, 
  according to the surveilling officer, Do gave what appeared to be cash to Vo. 
  Vo was observed having hand to hand contact with Do. Based on the information 
  in the tip, the officer believed that the interplay was a drug deal. </p>
<p>
  [3] Do then exited the building and entered the driver's seat of a vehicle. 
  His brother, Thinh Do, was in the passenger's seat. Officers followed the car 
  until the vehicle was stopped in Hamilton. Police arrested Do, and found 13 
  grams of heroin in the centre console of the car. Following Do's arrest, the 
  Westlodge apartment was searched and police seized approximately 110 grams of 
  heroin, which was concealed in a pair of jeans and in a laundry basket. Vo had 
  possession of the keys to the apartment. </p>
<p>
  [4] Do and Vo and Thinh Do testified at trial. They all had criminal records. 
  Do testified that he and Vo had planned to go out that evening to a local nightclub. 
  Vo was visiting his friend Quy Nguyen at the Westlodge apartment. Vo arrived 
  at 8:30 p.m. and then Nguyen left the keys to the apartment on the table and 
  left. Vo testified that he watched television and fell asleep. Do went to pick 
  up Vo at 10:30 p.m., who then told him that he was too tired to go out. While 
  speaking to Do, Vo's cell phone rang. After Vo took the phone call, he returned 
  to the door and they shook hands and Do left. </p>
<p>
  [5] At trial, Vo denied selling drugs to the co-accused Do. Vo also testified 
  that he did not reside at the Westlodge apartment and had no knowledge of the 
  heroin secreted in the apartment. Vo also testified in cross examination that 
  he was physically assaulted by four to seven officers for approximately 20-30 
  minutes.</p>
<p>
  [6] Do testified that the heroin found in the car upon his arrest belonged to 
  his brother Thinh Do, a heroin addict. Thinh Do confirmed this evidence. Thinh 
  Do testified that he had purchased the heroin earlier that night, without his 
  brother's knowledge, when they stopped at a restaurant. Thinh Do said he placed 
  the heroin in the console of the car under some paper napkins while Do was in 
  the building speaking to Vo. Constable Theriault testified that the heroin was 
  in the console in plain view. Constable Chase testified that when he got into 
  the vehicle to move it the appellant Do's cell phone was in the console.</p>
<p>
  Issues on the appeal </p>
<p>
  1.) Did the trial judge err in allowing cross examination on alleged police 
  brutality respecting Vo?</p>
<p>
  [7] At the outset of the appeal, Do's counsel abandoned the ground of appeal 
  raised in Do's factum relating to the alleged error by the trial judge in allowing 
  the Crown to cross-examine Vo on allegations of police brutality and in his 
  instructions to the jury regarding that evidence. </p>
<p>
  2.) Did the trial judge err in dismissing the applicant's motion to exclude 
  the heroin found in the Westlodge apartment pursuant to ss. 8 and 24(2) of the 
  Charter?</p>
<p>
  [8] This ground of appeal turns on whether the search warrant for the Westlodge 
  apartment was validly issued. We are of the opinion that although the police 
  conduct in obtaining the search warrant was improper because the affidavit sworn 
  in support of the warrant contained false and, in some cases, misleading information, 
  the trial judge did not err in principle in concluding that once the offending 
  parts of the affidavit were excised there existed sufficient grounds to believe 
  that heroin was contained inside the apartment. We did not call upon the Crown 
  to respond to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  3.) Did the trial judge err in his instructions respecting the correct burden 
  and standard of proof?</p>
<p>
  [9] The case law is very clear. As long as the charge when read as a whole makes 
  clear the correct burden and standard of proof the court should not order a 
  new trial. </p>
<p>
  [10] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge made the following comments: 
  </p>
<p class="indent"> The accused never has to&#133; it is not up to the accused 
  and the accused is under no obligation to give evidence or give an explanation. 
  If, of course, he chooses to do so, then, of course, you assess his evidence 
  and weigh his evidence as you do the evidence of other witnesses. But the onus 
  always remains on the Crown to prove the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">Now in this particular case, each of the two accused has given 
  evidence and has denied any knowledge of the heroin, any possession of the heroin 
  or any trafficking in the heroin. If you believe the accused, of course you 
  must acquit. But even if you are not able to say, &quot;I believe the accused,&quot; 
  you must still take into account the statement of the accused along with all 
  of the other evidence in reaching your decision as to whether or not the Crown 
  has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  Counsel for the defence and Crown objected to this part of the charge, by suggesting 
  that the trial judge had failed to put the second step of the model charge in 
  R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), to the jury; namely, even 
  if the jury did not accept the defence evidence but it left them with a reasonable 
  doubt they must acquit. The trial judge re charged the jury as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;as I told you, in this case the accused, both of the 
  accused, have given evidence that they did not&#133; had no knowledge of heroin 
  and nothing to do with it, and so on. As I told you, if you believe their evidence, 
  of course you must acquit. If you are not able to say that you believe their 
  evidence, but you have a reasonable doubt as to whether they are telling the 
  truth, in other words, you say, &quot;well, I have a reasonable doubt that it 
  is false. Maybe it's true,&quot; that can raise a reasonable doubt. In other 
  words, if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they are lying 
  when they say they did not have this heroin or did not traffic in the heroin, 
  then of course you must acquit because, if you have a reasonable doubt as to 
  their truthfulness, then you would have a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, of course, if you disbelieve their evidence 
  and you do not believe their evidence, then of course you can disregard their 
  evidence if you do not believe it. But even in that case, you then have to look 
  at all of the other evidence to see whether that other evidence satisfies you 
  beyond a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. </p>
<p class="indent">In other words, the mere fact that you find someone has lied, 
  it does not mean that they are guilty. You still have to consider the evidence, 
  all of the evidence, then to see whether you are satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the offence has occurred [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [11] There is no doubt that the instruction in the charge and the recharge is 
  confusing. Neither the charge nor the recharge contained the classic formulation 
  of the second step suggested by Cory J. in W.(D.), supra, that if the members 
  of the jury did not believe the testimony of the accused but were left in reasonable 
  doubt by it, they must acquit. Unlike in W.(D.), supra, however, the trial judge 
  did not set up the evidence of the police and the appellants as a credibility 
  contest. The jury was at no time instructed to evaluate each piece of evidence 
  on its own, independent of the rest of the evidence, or to make a decision only 
  on evidence that the jury found credible. He did not reverse the burden of proof.</p>
<p>
  [12] In his recharge the trial judge told the jury that, &quot;If you believe 
  their evidence, of course you must acquit.&quot; This was the first step in 
  the W.(D.) instruction and there is no complaint respecting it. </p>
<p>
  [13] The model instruction of the second step is, &quot;If you do not believe 
  the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you 
  must acquit.&quot; In relation to the second step the trial judge told the jury 
  that, &quot;If you are not able to say that you believe their evidence, but 
  you have a reasonable doubt as to whether they are telling the truth, in other 
  words you say&#133; 'Maybe it's true' that can raise a reasonable doubt.&quot; 
  He then added to the second step, &quot;In other words, if you are not satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that they are lying&#133;then of course you must acquit.&quot; 
  This addition maintained the burden of proof on the Crown in relation to the 
  appellants' evidence. </p>
<p>
  [14] The third step of the W.(D.) instruction is, &quot;Even if you are not 
  left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, 
  on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a 
  reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.&quot; In this 
  third step, the jury would no longer be considering the evidence of the accused 
  because they would be considering whether &quot;on the basis of the evidence 
  [they did] accept&quot; they were satisfied of the guilt of the accused. Here, 
  in relation to the third step, the trial judge said, &quot;[I]f you disbelieve 
  their evidence and you do not believe their evidence, then of course you can 
  disregard their evidence&#133; But even in that case, you then have to look 
  at all of the other evidence to see whether that other evidence satisfies you 
  beyond a reasonable doubt as to their guilt.&quot; Here, at the third stage 
  of the W(D) instruction, it was implicit and the jury would have understood, 
  that only if they rejected the evidence of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, 
  they would go on to consider whether the other evidence satisfied them that 
  the Crown had proven the guilt of the accused. Having regard to the instruction 
  that preceded the third step, it was not necessary that after the trial judge 
  said, &quot;If you disbelieve their evidence&quot;, he had to again add the 
  words &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;: See R. v. Roberts (1975), 24 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 539 at 550 approved by Cory J. in W.(D.), supra, at 410. </p>
<p>
  [15] In addition the trial judge told the jury: </p>
<ul>
  <li> What the presumption of innocence is and defined reasonable doubt;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That it was only &quot;having considered all of the evidence&quot; that 
    they could find that the accused had been proved guilty beyond a reasonable 
    doubt;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That the Crown always has the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt 
    that the offence has been committed;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That the standard of proof in a criminal case is more than probable guilt;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That it was important that the jury weigh and give full consideration to 
    the arguments and submissions of the defence;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That the defence submitted that the members of the jury should accept the 
    evidence of Vo and Thinh Do as to what transpired and that, &quot;even if 
    you do not accept it, you should have, and you must have, a reasonable doubt 
    as to their [the accuseds'] guilt.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That Do gave evidence that he did not know anything about any drugs and 
    that &quot;even if you do not believe Do's brother's account [which was the 
    same as Do's] or if you have any doubt about it, even then it is the submission 
    of the defence that you cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
    Do is guilty of the offence charged.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That they could only convict Do of possession of heroin for the purpose 
    of trafficking if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had 
    the heroin in his possession and that he had it in his possession for the 
    purpose of trafficking and that if they were not so satisfied or if they had 
    a reasonable doubt they were to find him not guilty;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That they could only convict Vo if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable 
    doubt that he not only had possession of the heroin but had it for the purpose 
    of trafficking and that if they were not so satisfied or if they had a reasonable 
    doubt they were to find him not guilty;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That they were to consider the evidence against each accused separately 
    and each charge separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [16] In my view, reading the charge as a whole the jury would not have been 
  under any misapprehension as to how to apply the burden of proof in assessing 
  the credibility of Do and Vo. </p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant Do also submits that the trial judge failed to refer to the 
  evidence of Do's brother in the recharge on W.(D.). In the trial judge's initial 
  charge to the jury, he reviewed in detail all the defence evidence, including 
  the evidence given by Thinh Do and the submissions of the defence that Thinh 
  Do's evidence could raise a reasonable doubt even if they rejected it. Nothing 
  in the recharge detracted from this. </p>
<p>
  [18] Accordingly, we would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  4.) Did the trial judge err in not instructing the jury that a reasonable doubt 
  can arise from the absence of evidence?</p>
<p>
  [19] In relation to Vo, counsel concedes that having regard to the jury's acquittal 
  of Vo on the trafficking charge, the trial judge's alleged failure to instruct 
  that reasonable doubt can arise from the absence of evidence is not, of itself, 
  a ground for allowing the appeal. In addition, we note that in his charge the 
  trial judge clearly explained the defence position concerning the lack of evidence 
  connecting Vo to the apartment in which the drugs were found.</p>
<p>
  [20] Do submits that the trial judge ought to have more clearly instructed the 
  jury that a reasonable doubt can be founded on an absence of evidence. Neither 
  defence counsel at trial objected to the charge on this basis. The trial judge 
  instructed the jury, &quot;If you do not have enough evidence or if, when you 
  consider the evidence, you cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, of 
  course you will find the accused not guilty.&quot; This was an instruction to 
  the jury to acquit if some area of evidence was lacking and, given the instructions 
  in the balance of the charge, no further instruction was necessary. We would 
  dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  5.) Was the jury's verdict unreasonable in relation to Do?</p>
<p>
  [21] The evidence of Constable Theriault was that he found the drugs in the 
  console in plain view and the evidence of Constable Chase was that the appellant's 
  cell phone was also in the console. Counsel for Do conceded that if it was open 
  to the jury to accept this evidence the verdict could not be unreasonable. In 
  our opinion it was open to the jury to accept this evidence and the verdict 
  was not unreasonable in relation to Do. </p>
<p>
  [22] Accordingly, the appeal as to Do's conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  6.) Was the jury's verdict unreasonable in relation to Vo?</p>
<p>
  [23] The circumstantial evidence in relation to Vo's possession of the heroin 
  in the apartment consisted of the following:</p>
<p>
  (a) the informant's information was that a young Asian person of about twenty 
  with short dark hair was selling heroin out of apartment 905 in the Westlodge 
  apartment. Vo had a blond streak in his hair and his description did not match 
  the description given by the informant in this respect.</p>
<p>
  (b) the appellant was in possession of a key to the apartment upon his arrest 
  but did not reside at apartment 905;</p>
<p>
  (c) there was positive evidence both from the appellant and independent sources 
  that other persons rented apartment 905;</p>
<p>
  (d) the appellant was only visiting the apartment;</p>
<p>
  (e) there were no documents connecting the appellant to the apartment; </p>
<p>
  (f) there was no evidence that the appellant's prints were on any items in the 
  apartment;</p>
<p>
  (g) there was no evidence that the jeans in which the heroin was found belonged 
  to Vo or would have fit him; and </p>
<p>
  (h) there was no evidence that the clothes in the laundry hamper in which the 
  heroin was found belonged to Vo.</p>
<p>
  [24] In our opinion the facts in this case are similar to those in R. v. Grey 
  (1996), 47 C.R. (4th) 40 at 41 (Ont. C.A.), in which the case against the appellant 
  rested principally on his regular occupancy of his girlfriend's apartment and 
  on the presence of his clothing and other belongings in the bedroom where crack 
  cocaine was found. Laskin J.A. held in the circumstances of that case that the 
  trial judge was not entitled to infer knowledge of the drugs in the apartment 
  from the appellant's occupancy because there was no other evidence connecting 
  him to the drugs, other persons frequented the apartment, and the appellant 
  was not a permanent occupant. Those same considerations apply here.</p>
<p>
  [25] The Crown submits that the evidence of the hand to hand contact between 
  Vo and Do at the door must be considered by us in deciding whether there is 
  evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that Vo had knowledge 
  of the drugs in the apartment. The Crown submits that if Vo had not been charged 
  with trafficking the evidence of the hand contact was relevant and admissible 
  with respect to the count of possession for the purpose of trafficking. While 
  this is true, having regard to the jury's verdict of acquittal of Vo in relation 
  to the count of trafficking, it was unreasonable for the jury to convict him 
  on the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p>
  [26] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal with respect to the appellant Vo's 
  conviction, set aside the conviction and enter an acquittal.</p>
