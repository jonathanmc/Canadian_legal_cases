<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In granting summary judgment dismissing the counterclaim, the motions judge 
  erred in two ways. First, he appeared to reverse the onus of proof on a motion 
  for summary judgment. Thus, for example, he held that &quot;There would have 
  to be some evidence or information that the plaintiffs were aware of the activities 
  of the third parties before there could be some cause of action brought against 
  them.&quot; And, later, he held that &quot;The defendant has failed to convince 
  the court that it has a valid counterclaim&quot;. Yet it was the respondents 
  who had the burden of showing that there was a genuine issue of material fact 
  requiring trial. The respondents, however, failed to meet their onus because 
  they filed no evidence addressing the appellant's allegations in the counterclaim.</p>
<p>
  [2] Second, the motions judge effectively treated the motion as one brought 
  under rule 21.01(1). In doing so, however, he failed to give effect to the well-recognized 
  principle that unless it is plain and obvious the claim cannot succeed it should 
  be permitted to go to trial. Although it might be said that the counterclaim 
  puts forward a rather novel claim, we are not persuaded that it is destined 
  to fail. </p>
<p>
  [3] Therefore, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set aside and the respondents' 
  motion for summary judgment is dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs 
  of the appeal and the motion, which we fix in the amount of $5,000, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
