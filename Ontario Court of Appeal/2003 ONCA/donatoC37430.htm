<p>On appeal from the conviction of Justice John D. Bark of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated October 22, 2001 and on appeal from the sentence imposed by 
  Justice John D. Bark on December 10, 2001.</p>  <p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>  <p>
  [1] The appellant appeals his convictions for wilfully attempting to obstruct 
  justice and failing to comply with a recognizance. He also seeks to appeal his 
  sentence of 60 days in jail.</p>  <p>
  [2] Both convictions rest on three conversations which the appellant had with 
  John Apostolis on March 22, 2000.</p>  <p>
  [3] On that day, the appellant and Mr. Apostolis were at the Newmarket Courthouse 
  awaiting the appellant's trial on a charge of breaking and entering. Mr. Apostolis 
  was to be a Crown witness. At that time the appellant was bound by a recognizance 
  that prohibited him from communicating with Mr. Apostolis.</p>  <p>
  [4] The breach of recognizance charge required the Crown to establish not only 
  the act of noncompliance but that the appellant intended to violate the recognizance. 
  </p>  <p>
  [5] In deciding the mens rea issue, the trial judge was required to address 
  the appellant's evidence that, because he was acting for himself, he believed 
  he could talk to the witnesses just as the Crown Attorney did, and therefore 
  he did not believe that he was breaching his recognizance when he spoke to Mr. 
  Apostolis.</p>  <p>
  [6] The trial judge did not do so. While the Crown argues that, in effect, he 
  simply disbelieved the appellant's explanation, we do not think his reasons 
  can be read that way. Rather, his language makes clear that he eliminated any 
  possibility of the appellant's explanation providing a defence to this charge.</p>  <p>
  [7] In removing this defence as a matter of law, he erred. It was incumbent 
  on him to critically assess the appellant's credibility and make proper findings 
  of fact as to his intention in approaching Mr. Apostolis. </p>  <p>
  [8] Thus, the conviction on this count must be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>  <p>
  [9] For similar reasons, the same result is required for the conviction for 
  wilfully attempting to obstruct justice.</p>  <p>
  [10] In assessing the appellant's intention in conversing with Mr. Apostolis, 
  the trial judge relied in significant measure on his finding that Mr. Apostolis 
  felt that he was being intimidated not to testify. In so doing, the trial judge 
  misapprehended the evidence. There was no evidence that Mr. Apostolis felt intimidated, 
  as the Crown fairly concedes, or that he sought out a police officer to report 
  that he felt that way.</p>  <p>
  [11] While intimidation is not an essential element of this offence, it is required 
  that there be a proper assessment of the evidence, to determine, inter alia, 
  the appellant's intention in conversing with Mr. Apostolis.</p>  <p>
  [12] We do not agree with the appellant that, properly assessed, the evidence 
  before the trial judge could not have supported a conviction. Thus, this conviction 
  must also be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>  <p>
  [13] In the result the convictions appeal is allowed, the convictions set aside 
  and a new trial is ordered. There is therefore no need to deal with the sentence 
  appeal.</p>  <p>
