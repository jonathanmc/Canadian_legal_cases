<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In the particular circumstances of this case, it is our view that it was 
  incumbent upon the sentencing judge to inquire further into the availability 
  of suitable programs to address the appellant's drug addiction. It was clear 
  from the submissions of the Crown and duty counsel that the plea had been entered, 
  and the joint submission fashioned, on the sole basis that the appellant would 
  receive the treatment that he needed in the penitentiary system. </p>
<p>
  [2] While we take no issue with the sentencing judge's concern that a sentence 
  in the penitentiary might not be appropriate for this offender, the record was 
  insufficient to allow the court to address the concerns for rehabilitation that 
  were raised in this case. The appellant has now served 9 months of his sentence. 
  This court has the benefit of fresh evidence filed on the appeal indicating 
  that a placement is immediately available with the &quot;Turning Point Program&quot;, 
  a drug rehabilitation program in Toronto, and the appellant is willing to participate 
  in this program that includes a 4-month residential component. </p>
<p> [3] In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the sentence varied as 
  follows: the term of imprisonment is reduced to a total of 9 months, attributed 
  to the various offences as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>theft of the motor vehicle: 2 months</li>
  <li>theft of gas: 2 months concurrent</li>
  <li>theft of guitar: 2 months concurrent</li>
  <li>food fraud: 2 months concurrent</li>
  <li>pursuit: 7 months consecutive.</li>
</ul>
<p> [4] The terms of probation are modified to accord with the requirements that 
  the appellant participate in and complete the residential drug treatment program, 
  as per terms agreed upon by counsel.</p>
