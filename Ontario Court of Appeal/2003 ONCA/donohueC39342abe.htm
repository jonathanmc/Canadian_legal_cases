<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It is not in dispute that everyone involved in the matter acted out of 
  concern for Mr. Crozier.</p>
<p> [2] The application judge cannot be faulted for granting the order of guardianship 
  which was being requested with consent of the Public Guardian.</p>
<p> [3] The order was obtained without notice and steps may or should have been 
  taken to set it aside. However at this time, we see no other appropriate remedy 
  except to set the order aside to permit a new hearing if the parties are so 
  advised. The appeal is allowed. In the meantime, this court orders that the 
  status quo be maintained and that the appellant is not to be moved from his 
  present residence without further court order.</p>
<p> [4] No order as to costs.</p>
