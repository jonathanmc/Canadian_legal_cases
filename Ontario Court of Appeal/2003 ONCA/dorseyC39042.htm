<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Harvey M. Salem of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated September 10, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of robbery on September 10, 2002 after a trial 
  before a judge without jury. The conviction was based solely on the eyewitness 
  identification of the complainant. The appellant appeals his conviction on the 
  basis that the verdict was unreasonable. </p>
<p>[2] The complainant is a taxi driver. On August 26, 2000, at about 2:00 p.m., 
  he picked up two people. The male passenger sat in the front seat and the female 
  passenger in the back. The complainant estimated that the taxi ride lasted for 
  ten minutes, with the man sitting next to him. On arrival at their destination, 
  the man brandished a knife and demanded money from the complainant. There was 
  a brief struggle, during which the complainant managed to escape. The man and 
  woman then both fled into a nearby building and the police arrived within five 
  to ten minutes. </p>
<p>[3] The complainant initially described his assailant to the police as &quot;somewhat 
  white looking&quot; and then revised this to &quot;olive skinned.&quot; At trial, 
  the complainant's testimony was that he had initially described his assailant 
  as being &quot;Hispanic colour&quot;. The appellant is black. He also told the 
  police that the man weighed 195 pounds, while the appellant is closer to 160-165 
  pounds. At trial, the complainant testified that his attacker was 170-180 pounds. 
  Two days after the robbery, the complainant selected the appellant from a photo 
  line-up stating: &quot;this guy looked like him a lot&quot;. He picked out the 
  appellant after about five minutes. When asked by the police, &quot;on a scale 
  of 1 to 10, would you say that this is him or that it looks like him a lot?&quot; 
  he answered &quot;99.9 per cent. If I see him again, I will recognize him even 
  ten years from now.&quot; The complainant later identified the appellant in 
  the prisoner's box as his assailant, stating that now that he saw the appellant, 
  he was 110% sure that he was the assailant.</p>
<p>[4] The complainant also testified that his attacker had a prominent tattoo 
  on his arm. No description of any tattoo had been given in the earlier description 
  to the police. When asked why he had not given this information to the police, 
  the complainant responded that he had not been asked. The appellant had a prominent 
  tattoo on his arm that was clearly visible on the appellant in the prisoner's 
  box. </p>
<p>[5] The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable and unsupported 
  by the evidence, given the frailties in the identification evidence of the complainant. 
  Close appellate scrutiny is required where a conviction is based solely upon 
  honest put potentially mistaken eyewitness evidence. R. v. Miaponoose (1996), 
  110 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Harvey (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 52 (Ont. 
  C.A.). In this case, there are a number of difficulties with the identification 
  evidence which, taken together, support a finding that the conviction was unreasonable 
  and cannot stand. </p>
<p>[6] First, the deficiencies in the complainant's opportunity to observe his 
  assailant before and during the attack appear not to have been fully considered 
  by the trial judge. The trial judge did note that the incident took place in 
  daylight and that the complainant had the opportunity to observe his assailant 
  for ten minutes before the actual confrontation took place. There was, however, 
  no evidence that the complainant had paid any attention to his assailant before 
  the attack commenced. The attack was a brief and violent one, in which the complainant 
  was punched twice in the head. Evidence of the complainant's efforts to observe 
  his assailant apart from this stressful encounter was therefore an important 
  factor in evaluating the reliability of his identification evidence. </p><p>
  [7] Second, the descriptions given by the complainant to the police and at trial 
  were limited and described no distinguishing characteristics of the assailant. 
  The description given during the examination-in-chief was simply that his attacker 
  was muscular and was wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans and running shoes. 
  While the Crown did not call the officer or officers who took the initial description 
  from the complainant, details about the initial description elicited during 
  cross-examination related only to the weight, height and skin colour of the 
  assailant. Accordingly, the descriptions were of little value for measuring 
  the reliability of both the in- court and the photo line-up identification of 
  the appellant.</p>
<p>[8] Even more problematic is the fact that the complainant's description of 
  his assailant at trial was inconsistent with his initial description. As set 
  out above, there were discrepancies regarding the assailant's weight and skin 
  colour. There was also confusion about whether the complainant had observed 
  a tattoo on his attacker's arm. That the descriptions given at trial more closely 
  resembled the appellant as he appeared in the prisoner's box undermines the 
  reliability of both the in-court identification of the appellant and the pre-trial 
  description of the assailant. </p>
<p>[9] The strongest aspect of the Crown's case was the positive identification 
  of the appellant in the photo line-up. The appellant submits that the line-up 
  was flawed, as several of the photos were not sufficiently similar in appearance 
  to the appellant. We note that the officer who conducted the line-up agreed 
  at trial that at least three of the photographs were unsatisfactory. </p>
<p>[10] The trial judge also failed to consider the qualified nature of the complainant's 
  initial identification of the appellant in the line-up. It took the complainant 
  five minutes to select the appellant's photo, after which the complainant initially 
  gave a qualified identification, &quot;this guy looks like him a lot&quot;. 
  This initial, qualified statement cannot, without more, be elevated into a positive 
  identification. By focusing on the complainant's subsequent statement that he 
  was &quot;99.9%&quot; certain he had selected his assailant, the trial judge 
  failed to consider the frailty of the initial photo identification. The tenuous 
  initial identification, coupled with the problems with the composition and conduct 
  of the photographic line-up, undermine the reliability of this aspect of the 
  evidence against the appellant.</p>
<p>[11] The Crown's case rested entirely on the identification evidence of the 
  complainant. For the reasons outlined above, the identification is not sufficiently 
  reliable to support a conviction. </p>
<p>
  [12] The appeal is therefore allowed, the conviction is set aside, and an acquittal 
  is entered.</p>
