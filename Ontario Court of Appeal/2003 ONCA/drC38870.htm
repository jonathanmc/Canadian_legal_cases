<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice C. B. Marchand of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on September 5, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: February 18, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The Crown seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, appeals against 
  the conditional sentence imposed by Marchand J. of the Ontario Court of Justice 
  on the respondent D. R. following his plea of guilty to one count of sexual 
  assault and one count of sexual exploitation. For the reasons that follow, we 
  are satisfied that the conditional sentence imposed at trial was demonstrably 
  unfit. </p>
<p>
  [2] The offences here involved the prolonged sexual abuse by the respondent 
  of his 15 year-old daughter in their home, while she was asleep in bed at night. 
  They involved the fondling of the victim's breasts, buttocks and thighs underneath 
  her clothes 3 to 4 times per month over a period of approximately 14 months. 
  On one occasion, the victim awoke in her bed to find the respondent with his 
  head between her legs near her crotch area. She believed that the respondent 
  had been performing oral sex on her. Although the respondent denied the performance 
  of oral sex, he admitted that he did place his head between the victim's legs. 
  On another occasion, when the victim again awoke in her bed, she discovered 
  the respondent lying behind her. From his sounds and movements, she believed 
  that he was masturbating. The respondent denied that he did so. On yet another 
  occasion, the respondent told the victim that he would allow her to go out with 
  her friends on condition that she let him rub his penis on her body. She refused. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] The respondent's criminal record dates from 1974. It consists of approximately 
  17 prior convictions, including a prior sexual assault conviction in 1995. The 
  victim in that case was the respondent's son's 16 year-old girlfriend, who had 
  been babysitting the respondent's children at the time of the incident. The 
  respondent received a sentence of 90 days imprisonment in addition to 3 months 
  pre-trial custody, and probation for 2 years in respect of that offence. His 
  term of probation for that offence ended just a few months before he started 
  sexually abusing his daughter. In addition, the respondent breached the terms 
  of his recognizance on two occasions pending disposition of the charges on the 
  current offences.</p>
<p>
  [4] Although the respondent has been diagnosed as suffering from symptoms of 
  attention deficient hyperactivity disorder, asthma and diabetes, he does not 
  suffer from a mental disorder or illness, or pedophilia. He was described in 
  a psychiatric evaluation as an individual who is impulsive and inattentive, 
  has trouble concentrating, shows poor judgment, and displays aggressive and 
  anti-social behaviour. While his psychiatric evaluation suggests that future 
  treatment holds some prospect for rehabilitation, he has also been assessed 
  as being at moderate risk of re-offending, that is, at a 40% to 70% risk of 
  re-offending. </p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent entered a plea of guilty to the current charges. However, 
  he did not do so until after his daughter had been required to testify at a 
  preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>
  [6] At trial, Crown counsel proposed a sentence of 18 months to 2 years less 
  a day imprisonment, in addition to pre-trial custody credited at approximately 
  12 months, followed by probation. Defence counsel sought a conditional sentence, 
  including a term which contemplated house arrest except for treatment and employment 
  requirements. Notwithstanding that Crown counsel at trial also sought a term 
  of house arrest, the trial judge declined to impose such a term on the basis 
  that the respondent was not the type of youthful offender requiring house arrest 
  as a form of monitoring. He sentenced the respondent to an 18 month conditional 
  sentence, followed by 3 years probation.</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondent concedes on this appeal that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to impose a curfew term as part of the terms of the conditional sentence. However, 
  in light of the respondent's pre-trial custody and his alleged involvement in 
  the on-going care of his other children, the respondent submits that the terms 
  of his sentence should reflect his counselling and family obligations. In our 
  view, while there are cases where the needs of a dependent family will affect 
  mitigation of sentence, that is not this case. </p>
<p>
  [8] While sentences imposed by sentencing judges attract considerable deference 
  from this court, on the facts of this case, we conclude that the governing principles 
  of denunciation and deterrence, both specific and general, cannot be satisfied 
  by a conditional sentence. This court has repeatedly indicated that a conditional 
  sentence should rarely be imposed in cases involving the sexual touching of 
  children by adults, particularly where, as here, the sexual violation is of 
  a vulnerable victim by a person in a position of trust. In addition, circumstances 
  that involve multiple sexual acts over an extended period of time and escalating 
  in intrusiveness generally warrant a severe sentence. See R. v. Cromien (2002), 
  155 O.A.C. 128 (C.A.); R. v. Bedard (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 216 (Ont. C.A.); 
  R. v. Stuckless (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. G.O. (1997), 
  99 O.A.C. 234 (C.A.). See also R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132. The trial 
  judge, with respect, failed in this case to give adequate or any consideration 
  to those controlling principles. Moreover, the trial judge's error in imposing 
  a conditional sentence was exacerbated by his further error of failing to impose 
  a house arrest term as part of that conditional sentence. In all of those circumstances, 
  the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate. </p>
<p>
  [9] In our view, denunciation and specific deterrence in this case require a 
  period of actual incarceration. However, the respondent must be given credit 
  for that part of his conditional sentence already served. </p>
<p>
  [10] Accordingly, leave to appeal against sentence is granted, and the appeal 
  is allowed to increase the sentence to a term of imprisonment of 2 years less 
  a day, credit of 6 months to be given for that portion of the conditional sentence 
  already served. The term of probation is to remain in effect with all terms 
  unchanged. The sentence shall commence on the day that the respondent surrenders 
  into custody. A warrant shall issue if required. </p>
