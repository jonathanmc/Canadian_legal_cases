<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant was convicted of three counts of sexual assault and three 
  counts of indecent assault involving four different young boys. The facts relating 
  to a fifth boy were also considered for the purpose of sentencing.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The sexual assaults involved a serious breach of trust and were committed 
  over a period of 12 years between 1980 and 1992.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] The appellant had previously been convicted of indecent assault on five 
  different child victims, committed prior to 1979 for which he received conditional 
  sentences in September 2001.<br>
</p>
<P>[4] The trial judge reviewed all the mitigating and aggravating factors. He 
  considered the Victim Impact Statements. He also considered the applicable principles 
  of sentencing in cases of sexual abuse of young children.<br>
</p>
<P>[5] It is conceded that the sentence of 7 years is within the appropriate range 
  for similar cases.<br>
</p>
<P>[6] We see no basis to interfere. Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal 
  is dismissed.</p>
