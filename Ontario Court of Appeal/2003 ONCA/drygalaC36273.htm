<h1>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h1>
<p>RE: ANJA MARIA DRYGALA (Petitioner/Respondent) - and - ANTHONY JOHN PAULI (Respondent/Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE: LASKIN, BORINS and GILLESE JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL: David A. Sloane for the appellant, Steven F. McMurray for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD: April 11, 2002</p>
<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Allan C.R. Whitten of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 4, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Reasons for decision in this matter were released on October 2, 2002 [reported 
  [2002] O.J. 3731]. Counsel sought and received permission to make further written 
  submissions on three matters: disposition of a $6,000 payment into court made 
  by the appellant, the validity of the costs award made at trial and a determination 
  of costs of the appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>The Payment Into Court<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Before the appeal was heard, the respondent brought a motion to stay the 
  appeal until the appellant had honoured his child support obligation or, alternatively, 
  requesting security for costs of the appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] On March 15, 2002, Justice Laskin granted a stay of the appeal on these 
  terms: &quot;The hearing of Mr. Pauli's appeal is stayed until he pays $6,000 
  into court on account of his child support obligation or until further order 
  of this court.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In accordance with the terms of the order of March 15, 2002, the $6,000 
  payment into court by the appellant shall be paid out to the respondent to be 
  applied first to arrears of child support and, if any funds remain, the remaining 
  funds shall be applied against the costs award of $1,500 made by this court 
  in favour of the respondent in connection with the stay motion. <br>
</p>
<p>Costs Award at Trial<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Whitten J. gave three reasons for awarding the respondent costs of the 
  trial fixed in the amount of $15,000 plus GST and disbursements. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] He first noted that the parties enjoyed &quot;mixed success&quot; at trial. 
  In our view, the respondent enjoyed greater success at trial than did the appellant 
  as she was awarded sole custody of the child and child support. The appellant 
  was awarded less generous access than that which he had sought. He had not disputed 
  the respondent's claim to custody but had maintained throughout that he had 
  no obligation to pay child support while attending university. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] On appeal, the amount of child support to be paid by the appellant was 
  reduced. After taking that reduction into consideration, in our view, the respondent 
  remains the more successful of the two parties as she remains entitled to child 
  support.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] Whitten J. found that the offer of the respondent more closely approximated 
  the result at trial than did the offer of the appellant. This remains so after 
  factoring in the result of the appeal, as the child support ordered is higher 
  than that proposed by the appellant in his offer to settle. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] Whitten J. also found that the appellant's position on child support was 
  &quot;rather unrealistic&quot;. We share his view. It is unrealistic for a parent 
  with a substantial income and no debt to take the position that he need not 
  pay child support. The appellant maintained this position on appeal, arguing 
  that he should pay no support or, alternatively, that any support ordered be 
  for a nominal sum only.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] After taking into consideration the results of the appeal, the reasons 
  given by the trial judge for the cost award remain valid. We see no basis for 
  interfering with the costs award at trial. <br>
</p>
<p>Costs of the Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Costs of the appeal are awarded on a partial indemnity basis to the respondent, 
  fixed in the amount of $9,500 plus GST and disbursements. Our reasons for this 
  award are as follows. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] Success on appeal was mixed. While the appellant achieved a reduction 
  in the quantum of child support, the respondent remained successful in obtaining 
  an order for child support. (The matters of custody and access were not appealed.) 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[13] The matter of costs in family matters is approached somewhat differently 
  than in other civil litigation. Discretionary factors including the ability 
  to pay and conduct of the parties prior to the litigation can play a more significant 
  role. (Tauber v. Tauber, [2000] 48 O.R. (3d) 577, Andrews v. Andrews (1980), 
  32 O.R. (2d) 29).<br>
</p>
<p>[14] In the case at hand, based on the sworn financial statements, the appellant 
  has a greater ability to pay than does the respondent. In this regard we note 
  that the appellant disclosed expenses of over $48,000 per year and that he is 
  debt-free. <br>
</p>
<p>[15] In terms of conduct prior to the commencement of litigation, it is relevant 
  to note that the appellant failed to provide financial support for his daughter 
  despite a significant income stream and absence of debt. Whitten J. found that 
  the appellant had made only two payments of child support prior to trial. The 
  appellant has not yet voluntarily made any payments on account of child support 
  during litigation despite the order of the court below.<br>
</p>
<p>Enforceability<br>
</p>
<p>[16] As directed by Whitten J. in his endorsement of April 4, 2001, the costs 
  award at trial is to be enforced in its entirety by the Family Responsibility 
  Office.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] Similarly, as contemplated by section 1(1) of the Family Responsibility 
  and Support Arrears Enforcement Act, 1986, S.O. 1986, c. 31, as am., costs on 
  this appeal are a &quot;support order,&quot; and are fully enforceable by the 
  Family Responsibility Office.</p>
