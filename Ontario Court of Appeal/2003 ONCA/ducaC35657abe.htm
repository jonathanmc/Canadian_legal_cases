<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The trial judge was alive not only to the gaps and contradictions in the 
  evidence, but to the questionable conduct it revealed. Nonetheless, she concluded 
  that the claim of conspiracy had not been made out, a conclusion available to 
  her on this record.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The trial proceeded solely as a conspiracy trial. The appellant sought 
  to argue, for the first time on appeal, that this record gave rise to violations 
  of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act and the Assignment and Preferences Act. These 
  matters should have been argued at trial so that we would have had the benefit 
  of the trial judge's review and analysis. In the absence of such prior scrutiny, 
  it would not be appropriate for us to entertain these arguments at this time. 
  <br>
</p>
<P>[3] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs. The respondents are to submit 
  their Bills of Costs by May 21, 2003.</p>
