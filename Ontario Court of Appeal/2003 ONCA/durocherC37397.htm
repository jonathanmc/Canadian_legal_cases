<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by Mr. Lauzon from the judgment of Justice Brockenshire 
  where he dealt with several aspects of spousal support and ancillary orders. 
  At the opening of the trial, the appellant's pleadings were struck for his failure 
  to provide undertaken information to the respondent. He was not allowed to participate 
  in the trial. There is no appeal from that ruling. I am going to deal with the 
  points raised by counsel on behalf of Mr. Lauzon briefly, as follows.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The first point is with respect to the amount of spousal support. We are 
  satisfied that based on the evidence that was presented, the amount of $1,515 
  that was reached by Justice Brockenshire was not in error and was not an amount 
  that could be successfully challenged in this court or amended by us. That amount 
  was, it is conceded, misstated in paragraph 8 of the judgment and should read 
  $1,515. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] With respect to whether Justice Brockenshire had the authority to make 
  an order higher than the $700 a month claimed in the Notice of Application, 
  given that the pleadings were struck out and Mr. Lauzon was not entitled thereafter 
  to participate in the trial. We are satisfied, after reviewing the financial 
  statements of the respondent that had been filed at the commencement of the 
  process as well as the financial statement that was filed at the opening of 
  trial, that it was clear throughout that the deficit that was being experienced 
  by Ms. Durocher was in excess of $1,600 at all times so that the amount of $1,515 
  was below the amount that Mr. Lauzon always knew was in issue. In the result, 
  we are satisfied that even though no formal amendment was made, Mr. Lauzon was 
  on notice throughout that an amount at least up to $1,600 was in issue in respect 
  of spousal support. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] With respect to the issue of not making a time-limited order, we are also 
  satisfied that it was within Justice Brockenshire's discretion to not make a 
  time-limited order, that he considered all of the evidence that he heard and 
  the appropriate factors, and was well aware of the duration of the relationship 
  and of the fact that spousal support had been paid for three years up until 
  the time of trial. He was therefore entitled to not time-limit the order. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] With respect to the issue of any review of the spousal order being deferred 
  for three years, we are also satisfied that that order was within his discretion. 
  Whether the issue of spousal support can be reconsidered by a court on a date 
  earlier than the three years in any circumstances, is a matter between the appellant 
  and his counsel. <br>
  [6] With respect to the issue of access, we are satisfied that Justice Brockenshire 
  was entitled to change the final order to allow for access to be made not at 
  the drop off points but at the respondent's home. He was not functus at the 
  time he signed the order and he was therefore entitled to make that order. We 
  would not disturb it. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] With respect to access at holiday times, that is not a matter for this 
  court. It is a matter for the appellant to pursue, if so advised, at the appropriate 
  time if he wishes to seek further access. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] On the issue of the medical and related benefits, we are also satisfied 
  that Justice Brockenshire dealt with that matter in an appropriate manner. If, 
  in fact, the benefits are not available to a former common-law spouse by the 
  insurance policy, then the appellant is at liberty to provide that evidence 
  either to the respondent or, if necessary, to a court and the matter will be 
  dealt with in accordance with that evidence. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] With respect to the pension, it would appear that although Justice Brockenshire 
  would have had jurisdiction to deal with the pension, he had no evidence upon 
  which to make such an order. We would therefore set aside this aspect of his 
  order which is the second part of paragraph 6 of the judgment, in which there 
  is a reference to pension plan benefits of the respondent. We would set aside 
  that portion of the order. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] Finally, we would not interfere with Justice Brockenshire's discretion 
  with respect to the issue of costs. <br>
</p>
<p>[11] Therefore, the appeal is allowed to the extent of the amendment of the 
  order with respect to pension benefits, and correction of the misstated amount 
  of spousal support to $1515. In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] After hearing submissions with respect to costs of this appeal, we award 
  costs to the respondent in the amount of $3,000.<br>
