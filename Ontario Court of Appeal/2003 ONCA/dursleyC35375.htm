<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: September 15, 2003</p>
<p> MACPHERSON and CRONK JJ.A.:</p>
<p> [1] In the context of comprehensive reasons for sentence the trial judge misused 
  the rehabilitation factor by using it as a reason for imposing a custodial sentence. 
  This error requires us to impose a fit sentence.</p>
<p> [2] We agree with the trial judge that a custodial sentence was appropriate 
  in this case. See: R. v. Cromien (2002), 155 O.A.C. 128 and R. v. D. R. (2003), 
  169 O.A.C. 55. </p>
<p> [3] However, in light of the time the appellant has already spent in custody 
  (53 days), we would reduce his sentence to time served plus an additional six 
  months in custody. The probation components of the sentence would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>"J. C. MacPherson J.A."<br>
  "E. A. Cronk J.A." </p>
<p> BORINS J.A. (Dissenting):</p>
<p> [4] I agree with the majority that a custodial sentence was appropriate. However, 
  it has been two and three-quarter years since the appellant was released on 
  bail pending the hearing of the appeal. Through no fault of his, it has taken 
  this period of time for the appeal to be argued. </p>
<p> [5] Because of this lengthy delay, in my view, this is a case in which it 
  would not be appropriate to require that the appellant be returned to jail, 
  if only for a short time. I would, therefore, reduce the sentence to time served 
  (53 days), without disturbing the terms of the probation order.</p>
