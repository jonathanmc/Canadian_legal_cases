<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice W.J. Lloyd Brennan of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 19, 1999. </p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the order of Brennan J. dated October 19, 1999 awarding 
  the respondents $485,000.00 for economic loss and, in addition, general damages 
  and damages for family law claims which are not the subject of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants appeal the award of $485,000.00 on three separate bases. 
  First, they submit that they were deprived of a fair trial because the trial 
  judge spread the 36 days of testimony over seven months and then reserved judgment 
  for close to two years. Second, they also submit that the trial judge failed 
  to provide reasons sufficiently intelligible to permit appellate review and 
  that he made contradictory findings which suggest he misapprehended the evidence. 
  Third, they submit that when a loss of business profits is alleged it is required 
  that the lost profits must be proved with precision and that the trial judge 
  erred with respect to the standard of proof to be applied by estimating such 
  damages.</p>
<p>
  [3] As to the first argument, a lengthy delay in trial and in releasing reasons, 
  without more, will not automatically amount to a denial of a fair trial. The 
  fairness of a trial must be determined by the particular circumstances of each 
  case so that generally some evidence of active prejudice must be shown. Delay 
  insofar as it affected the trial judge's capacity to assess and determine the 
  issues is another matter and is addressed in the context of their second argument. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants' second argument is that the reasons of the trial judge are 
  not sufficiently intelligible to permit appellate review. The appellants state 
  that the lengthy delay in delivering judgment affected the reasons for judgment 
  because the trial judge was no longer in a position to remember the demeanour 
  of the witnesses and that this should affect the extent of deference afforded 
  to his reasons. The appellants further submit that the trial judge ignored or 
  placed insufficient weight on evidence adduced by the defence on the question 
  of how much time the respondents devoted to the Questar project are, instead, 
  in one line, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondents without 
  further elaboration. The appellants submit that the trial judge's acceptance 
  of the respondents' evidence is a vague boilerplate statement as in R. v. Sheppard 
  (2002), 210 D.L.R. (4th) 608 (S.C.C.) and not sufficient to address a significant 
  issue on which there was contradictory evidence. </p>
<p>
  [5] We do not accept this argument. The principal finding of the trial judge, 
  which the appellant has not appealed, is that the respondents suffered significant 
  injuries and that those injuries affected the respondents' earning capacity. 
  The appellants' argument relates solely to the method by which the trial judge 
  addressed the amount to be attributed to loss of earning capacity. Although 
  his reasons on this question were brief, there was evidence in the record to 
  support each of the conclusions he reached, and we are not persuaded that he 
  ignored or misapprehended evidence in reaching those conclusions. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellants' third argument is that the trial judge erred with respect 
  to the standard of proof to be applied with respect to the calculation of the 
  respondents' claim for economic loss. We do not agree. The calculation of the 
  respondents' damages in the context of this case necessarily proceeded on the 
  estimate of the profits that would have been derived from the operation of their 
  business had they not suffered their injuries. This calculation was supported 
  by the evidence of the respondents, of customers, and of an expert business 
  valuator. It was open to the trial judge to accept this evidence, as he did, 
  in putting a figure on the respondents' economic loss. Significantly, he reduced 
  the figure presented by the respondents' valuator by 50% to reflect a number 
  of contingencies, including the fact that the respondents devoted some time 
  to the development of the Questar project.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed in the amount of 
  $15,000. </p>
