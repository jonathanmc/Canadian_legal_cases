<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted pursuant to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code 
  commonly referred to as driving over 80. The issue in this appeal is whether 
  the breathalyzer test was administered as soon as practicable as required by 
  s. 258 (1)(c) (ii). <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The evidence is that the appellant was taken to the police station at 3:16 
  a.m. and was then &quot;paraded&quot; before the officer in charge. The arresting 
  officer testified that the attendance before the officer in charge was five 
  to ten minutes maximum and was at the upper end of that range. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] At 3:59 a.m., a telephone call was placed to duty counsel who returned 
  the call at 4:04 a.m. The first breath test was then administered. On the evidence 
  there is a gap of at least 33 minutes between the attendance before the officer 
  in charge and the call to duty counsel. The only explanation on the record for 
  this gap is that the appellant was seated in the report room while the arresting 
  officer processed some paperwork. It is this gap of 33 minutes which the appellant 
  alleges the trial judge failed to consider in his assessment of whether the 
  breath test had been administered within the time required by s. 258 (1)(c) 
  (ii) of the Criminal Code. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge in his brief reasons stated:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As far as the times are concerned, he was brought to the station, 
  there was some delay at the scene getting the cab and getting the tow truck, 
  which is understandable. He's brought to the station. He was paraded. That takes 
  time. There was discussion about his using the phone. The officer got him the 
  phone. He spoke to the duty counsel. It may not have been done as quickly as 
  possible, but I believe the times have been satisfied in this instance and there 
  will be a conviction. The Crown being entitled to the presumption.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The summary appeal court judge simply accepted the trial judge's reasons. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[6] In our view, the trial judge did err in law in failing to direct his mind 
  to the 33 minute gap and to apply that evidence to the test articulated by this 
  court in R. v. Phillips (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 150 and R. v. Letford (2000), 
  150 C.C.C. (3d) 325 which is that the test should be administered &quot;within 
  a reasonably prompt time under the circumstances&quot;. The summary appeal court 
  judge failed to identify this error of law.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] We would therefore allow the appeal. The conviction is quashed and a new 
  trial is ordered.<br>
