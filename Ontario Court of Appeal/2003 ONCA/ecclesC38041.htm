<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice C. Raymond Harris of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 8, 2002.</p>
<p>
  ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Terrence and Maria (Mary) Eccles were married in 1979. They separated in 
  1989 and were divorced in 1999. There are two children of the marriage: Laura 
  and Paul who, at the time of separation, were aged 4 years and 6 months respectively.</p>
<p>
  [2] The divorce judgment, granted by Festeryga J. on March 16, 1999, ordered 
  Mr. Eccles to pay spousal support to Mrs. Eccles in the amount of $3,500 per 
  month, subject to review by either party after February 1, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Eccles moved to terminate or, in the alternative, to reduce his obligation 
  to pay spousal support. He also moved for an order rescinding outstanding arrears 
  in respect to spousal support. In addition, he sought an order for child support 
  in respect of the children who were in his custody as a result of the divorce 
  judgment.</p>
<p>
  [4] The motion to vary was heard by Harris J. (the motions judge) who ordered 
  inter alia: (i) spousal support for Mrs. Eccles in the amount of $3,500 to continue 
  and maintenance of extended health benefits for Mrs. Eccles; (ii) payment to 
  Mrs. Eccles of 10% of any employment bonus received by Mr. Eccles; (iii) payment 
  of the arrears of spousal support to Mrs. Eccles; (iv) payment to Mrs. Eccles 
  of a lump sum of $10,000; and (v) payment by Mrs. Eccles to Mr. Eccles of $350 
  per month for child support. </p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Eccles appeals the order of the motions judge in respect of: (i) the 
  continuation of spousal support in the amount of $3,500 per month; (ii) the 
  failure to rescind the outstanding arrears; (iii) the payment of a lump sum 
  in the amount of $10,000; and (iv) the payment of 10% of any bonus received 
  by Mr. Eccles. </p>
<p>
  The Background</p>
<p>
  [6] The parties first met when they were students at Humber College in Toronto. 
  Mrs. Eccles has a Grade 12 education and completed one year of a two-year legal 
  secretarial programme at Humber College prior to the marriage. After their marriage, 
  they resided in Toronto where Mr. Eccles became a funeral director. Mrs. Eccles 
  was employed as a secretary. </p>
<p>
  [7] Prior to the marriage, Mrs. Eccles had told her husband that she did not 
  want to move away from Toronto. However, within two years of their marriage, 
  Mr. Eccles sought employment in Hamilton. The motions judge found that Mr. Eccles 
  did so without consulting his wife. Mrs. Eccles found it difficult to find suitable 
  employment in Hamilton. Having obtained employment as a secretary in a real 
  estate office, she was requested by her manager to work weekends. Mr. Eccles 
  did not want his wife working on weekends and, as a result, she terminated her 
  employment. </p>
<p>
  [8] Mrs. Eccles then attended the Mohawk College of Nursing, but because she 
  had difficulty with certain chemistry courses, she left and at the suggestion 
  of her husband they began to have a family. Their daughter, Laura, was born 
  in 1984. From that time on, Mrs. Eccles became what the motions judge described 
  as a &quot;homemaker in all the traditional ways&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [9] Mrs. Eccles stayed at home and looked after the children although she did 
  some minor income-producing work from home, such as babysitting, sewing and 
  making rag dolls. Mr. Eccles pursued his career in the funeral business with 
  considerable success. He was promoted to regional director, responsible for 
  14 funeral homes in southwestern Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [10] The parties separated in 1989. The children continued to live with their 
  mother. Mr. Eccles began a serious relationship with another woman in 1992, 
  whom he married after the parties divorced in 1999. Mr. Eccles was awarded custody 
  of the children in the divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [11] After separation, it was apparent that the husband's standard of living 
  improved significantly while the standard of living of Mrs. Eccles went into 
  decline.</p>
<p>
  [12] At the time of the hearing before the motions judge, Mr. Eccles agreed 
  that he and his children and new wife were enjoying &quot;a pretty comfortable 
  lifestyle&quot;. They live in a four-bedroom home adjacent to a park. Mr. Eccles 
  was at that time driving a brand new Mercedes Benz automobile provided by his 
  employer. He had a family membership in the Southern Pines Golf Club where the 
  annual fees were $1,800. Mr. Eccles estimated that he spent $2,400 a year for 
  vacations. </p>
<p>
  [13] The evidence established that Mr. Eccles' income for the years 1998 through 
  2001 was as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1998 $129,000</p>
<p class="indent">1999 $162,000</p>
<p class="indent">2000 $106,000</p>
<p class="indent">2001 $122,400</p>
<p>
  The above figures included performance bonuses in some years. They also included 
  a generous car allowance and a clothing allowance of $2,500 each year. </p>
<p>
  [14] Mrs. Eccles, on the other hand, could not be said to approach the standard 
  of living of her former husband. She lived in a small three-bedroom bungalow 
  and continued to drive a 1989 Ford Tempo car with a gas tank that leaked when 
  more than one-half full. Her attempts to find meaningful and financially secure 
  employment were not successful. At the hearing, she filed a 70 page brief of 
  job applications made between 1999 and 2001. The motions judge concluded that 
  she had made 350 attempts to find employment over the previous three years. 
  The week before the hearing in this matter, Mrs. Eccles had accepted a job working 
  in a warehouse as an order-taker for a nutritional food supplier at a rate of 
  pay of $9 per hour and with no benefits whatsoever. Her new job pays her $18,720.00 
  gross annually.</p>
<p>
  [15] For the years 1998 through 2001, Mrs. Eccles earned employment income as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1998 $ 1,900.00</p>
<p class="indent">1999 $ 3,900.00</p>
<p class="indent">2000 $ 3,800.00</p>
<p class="indent">2001 $10,000.00</p>
<p>
  [16] It is clear that the aftermath of the separation and in particular, the 
  loss of custody of the children, had a devastating effect on Mrs. Eccles. The 
  divorce trial and the loss of her children caused her to revisit her own youth 
  and as found by the motions judge &quot;awakened the trauma of her childhood 
  abuse&quot; at the hands of her father. The motions judge concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The consequence of this was that she became depressed to the point that she 
  could not get out of bed. Ultimately, she needed and received counselling which 
  is continuing. This unexpected turn of events in her life was debilitating and 
  among other things, delayed her ability to become self sustaining in the job 
  market.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, there is also a causal connection between her underlying 
  emotional difficulties which for some time impaired her ability to be self sufficient. 
  This was a trauma and a frailty that she disclosed to the applicant prior to 
  marriage and he accepted that as part of his marriage. Subsequently, as a result 
  of the breakdown of the marriage, and in particular the loss of custody of her 
  children, she was, for a period disabled from employment.</p>
<p>
  The Findings of the Motions Judge</p>
<p>
  [17] The motions judge accepted the evidence of Mrs. Eccles without qualification. 
  He found her to be open and sincere. </p>
<p>
  [18] The motions judge was not similarly impressed with Mr. Eccles as a witness. 
  He noted that at the divorce trial, there had not been full disclosure by Mr. 
  Eccles until his cross-examination of a $60,000 bonus paid in respect of the 
  1999 fiscal year. The motions judge concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> There were parts of the applicant's testimony in this trial 
  that left me uncomfortable with his credibility. He testified in- chief that 
  his credit line indebtedness of $9,987.00 at the bank was for &quot;basic things&quot;, 
  however, on cross-examination he conceded that $5,700.00 of that amount was 
  used to obtain wedding jewellery for his recent marriage. Not a lot turned on 
  this amount, however, his initial evidence was misleading to his benefit. This 
  added to my general feeling that his evidence on material matters was not reliable. 
</p>
<p class="indent">The applicant's financial statements in this proceeding are 
  uncomfortably over-stated on his expenses and did not stand up well under scrutiny.</p>
<p>
  [19] The motions judge found that Mrs. Eccles devoted her time and energies 
  over the course of 20 years to the role of homemaker to the detriment of any 
  other career for herself. He characterized her situation as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> There is a wide and meaningful chasm between the employment 
  abilities of the applicant and those of the respondent and this disparity flows 
  directly from the marriage. The respondent's financial dependence on the marriage 
  was complete.</p>
<p class="indent">The times that the respondent did attempt employment or training 
  during her marriage those initiatives were, for the most part, either thwarted 
  or discouraged by the applicant husband.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic impact of the divorce on the respondent's life 
  has been profoundly demoralizing and all the while the applicant has a significantly 
  better life style than the respondent.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to her stark economic hardship, the respondent had 
  always counted on the mutual enjoyment of her husband's pension at the close 
  of his career. The applicant husband continues to be the beneficiary of that 
  pension, the respondent does not.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  (i) Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant must meet a high threshold to set aside the support order. 
  He must show that the motions judge misapprehended the evidence of the appellant's 
  income, or the award was so perverse as to exceed the generous ambit within 
  which reasonable disagreement is possible. See Silver v. Silver (1985), 54 O.R. 
  (2d) 591 (C.A.); Andrews v. Andrews (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (ii) Spousal Support</p>
<p>
  [21] Counsel for Mr. Eccles submitted that the motions judge misapprehended 
  his client's current income as $122,000 yearly, including a $20,000 bonus. He 
  argued that Mr. Eccles' income was $105,500 per year. He further argued that 
  a spousal support award of $42,000 per year constituted a &quot;rough and ready&quot; 
  equalization of incomes, which was unreasonable as it fails to take into consideration 
  Mr. Eccles' financial responsibility for the two children. He also submitted 
  that the motions judge erred in including the clothing allowance of $2,500 and 
  the car allowance of $10,000 in the calculation of income available to pay spousal 
  support.</p>
<p>
  [22] Counsel for Mr. Eccles submitted that the combination of the increase in 
  Mrs. Eccles' employment income and the decrease in Mr. Eccles' income should 
  have resulted in a reduction in spousal support. He relied on a number of judgments 
  from other courts in support of his argument that an award of $3,500 per month 
  is outside the range of similarly situated spouses. He suggested that the appropriate 
  range was $1,000 to $2,000 a month. See Thorndycraft v. Thorndycraft, [1996] 
  M.J. No. 427 (C.A.); Wallace v. Wallace, [1999] O.J. No. 4513 (S.C.J.); Petrocco 
  v. Petrocco, [1996] O.J. No. 1451 (Gen. Div.); Chalmers v. Chalmers, [1997] 
  A.J. No. 433 (Q.B.); Petrocco v. Von Michalofski, [1998] O.J. No. 200 (Gen. 
  Div.); Farrus v. Farrus, [2000] A.J. No. 680 (Q.B.); Doty v. Doty, [2001] A.J. 
  No. 573 (Q.B.); Armstrong v. Ternan, [1996] M.J. No. 310 (Q.B.). </p>
<p>
  [23] The motions judge concluded that the combined income of Mr. Eccles and 
  his present wife approximated $155,000 per year including a bonus and other 
  benefits. Although the motions judge did not set out the details of his calculation, 
  it appears he arrived at the approximate figure of $155,000 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">Base salary of Mr. Eccles $ 93,000.00Clothing allowance $ 2,500.00</p>
<p class="indent">Car allowance $ 10,000.00</p>
<p class="indent">Annual bonus (average over 7 years) $ 17,000.00</p>
<p class="indent">Total $122,500.00</p>
<p class="indent">Income of present wife $ 34,000.00</p>
<p class="indent">Grand Total $156,500.00</p>
<p>[24] A real problem for the motions judge was how to treat the bonus. It was 
  Mr. Eccles' position that since he had not received a bonus every year, no credit 
  should be given to it at all. I have read Mr. Eccles' evidence and it was not 
  helpful on this point. After a number of questions from both the judge and counsel, 
  it emerged that over a seven-year period prior to the hearing, Mr. Eccles received 
  $120,000 in bonuses which produced an average of about $17,000 per year. </p>
<p>
  [25] I find no fault in the approach taken by the motions judge in attributing 
  a bonus of $17,000 to Mr. Eccles. Similarly, I am unable to find any error on 
  the part of the motions judge in considering the total package of employment 
  benefits for Mr. Eccles, including his clothing allowance and generous car allowance 
  that gave him a very comfortable standard of living. In regard to his new wife's 
  income, the motions judge found that she made a contribution to the household 
  of about $10,000 a year.</p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, all of the above demonstrates that Mr. Eccles was in a position 
  to pay his former wife spousal support in the amount fixed by the motions judge 
  of $3,500 per month. Moreover, I am satisfied that the amount fixed by the motions 
  judge was appropriate for Mrs. Eccles, given her present circumstances and the 
  great disparity that exists between the standard of living enjoyed by her and 
  her former husband. In this respect, I rely on the judgment of L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. in Moge v. Moge (1992), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 456 at 494 (S.C.C.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Although the doctrine of spousal support which focuses on equitable sharing 
  does not guarantee to either party the standard of living enjoyed during the 
  marriage, this standard is far from irrelevant to support entitlement. Furthermore, 
  great disparities in the standard of living enjoyed by spouses in the absence 
  of support are often a revealing indication of the economic disadvantages inherent 
  in the role assumed by one party. As marriage should be regarded as a joint 
  endeavour, the longer the relationship endures, the closer the economic union, 
  the greater will be the presumptive claim to equal standards of living upon 
  its dissolution.</p>
<p>
  [27] The cases relied upon by the appellant as to the appropriate range for 
  spousal support are not particularly helpful in that they are distinguishable 
  on their facts. </p>
<p>
  [28] In concluding the spousal support issue, I cannot come to the view that 
  the motions judge misapprehended the evidence of the husband's income or that 
  the award was so perverse as to exceed the generous ambit within which reasonable 
  disagreement is possible. </p>
<p>
  (iii) The Failure to Rescind the Outstanding Arrears</p>
<p>
  [29] A review of Mr. Eccles' evidence provides no explanation from him as to 
  why he did not meet his obligation to pay his former wife's spousal support. 
  He simply admitted that he was in arrears. I find nothing in the record and 
  nothing in the findings of the motions judge which would suggest that the motions 
  judge erred in failing to rescind the arrears in spousal support.</p>
<p>
  (iv) The Lump Sum Payment of $10,000</p>
<p>
  [30] The motions judge gave no reasons for his award of a lump sum of $10,000. 
  In Mannarino v. Mannarino (1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 309, this court held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The law is clear that lump sum maintenance should be awarded only in very unusual 
  circumstances, where there is a real risk that periodic payments would not be 
  made. Such awards should not constitute a redistribution of family assets in 
  the guise of support.</p>
<p>
  [31] In this case, the motions judge did not say that there was a real risk 
  that periodic payments would not be made. Arguably he found the opposite, in 
  that he both ordered monthly payments to continue and the arrears to be paid. 
  The judgment of the motions judge clearly proceeds on the assumption that Mr. 
  Eccles will pay both the arrears and the continuing support payments. The motions 
  judge does not provide an explanation as to why a lump sum is necessary in addition 
  to the monthly payments. In the absence of any explanation, I am unable to find 
  any unusual circumstances which would suggest that a lump sum payment is appropriate 
  in this case. </p>
<p>
  (v) The Payment of 10% of any Bonus Received by Mr. Eccles</p>
<p>
  [32] It is apparent that in the calculation of the annual income of Mr. Eccles, 
  the likeli-hood of Mr. Eccles to earn a bonus was taken into account and valued 
  at $17,000 per year. This was a factor in setting the spousal support award 
  at $3,500. It would therefore appear that there is an element of double-counting 
  if Mrs. Eccles were to receive 10% of any future bonus, in addition to her spousal 
  support of $3,500. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [33] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with respect to spousal support 
  in the amount of $3,500 per month and with respect to the failure to rescind 
  the outstanding arrears of spousal support. I would allow the appeal in respect 
  of the payment of the lump sum of $10,000 and the payment of 10% of any future 
  bonus received by Mr. Eccles. </p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [34] The parties should make their submissions in writing as to the costs of 
  this appeal within 10 days of the release of this judgment. The parties may 
  reply to each other's submissions on costs within 10 days of receiving each 
  other's submissions.</p>
