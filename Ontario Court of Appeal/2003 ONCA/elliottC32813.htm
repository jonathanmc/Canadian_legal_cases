<p>On appeal by the Crown against the order of Justice Paul J. Cosgrove of the 
  Superior Court of Justice dated September 7, 1999.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  I. Overview</p>
<p> [1] On September 7, 1999, Cosgrove J. stayed Julia Elliott's trial on charges 
  of second-degree murder and interfering with a dead body as an abuse of process 
  and ordered that the Crown pay her legal costs from the outset of the proceedings. 
  In particular, the trial judge found that police officers, Crown counsel and 
  senior officials of the Ministry of the Attorney General had committed over 
  150 violations of the respondent's rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, thereby compromising her 
  right to a fair trial. In addition, the trial judge concluded that the misconduct 
  of the Crown and the police delayed the respondent's trial and therefore violated 
  her s. 11(b) Charter right to a trial within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>
  [2] In response to the Crown's appeal against the stay of proceedings, the respondent 
  concedes that the Charter breaches found by the trial judge including the trial 
  judge's finding of a s. 11(b) breach, are not sustainable and that the finding 
  of an abuse of process and the costs award were unwarranted. However, she asks 
  that this court uphold the stay of proceedings on the sole alternative basis 
  that her lead counsel at trial (not the same as appellate counsel) was incompetent 
  and that his actions led to a violation to her s. 11(b) Charter right to a trial 
  within a reasonable time. </p>
<p>
  [3] The respondent claims that her lead counsel derailed her trial for almost 
  two years by bringing countless meritless motions. In addition, she submits 
  that the trial judge was incompetent, and that he contributed to the delay by 
  mismanaging the trial and by accepting defence counsel's arguments. </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent asserts that the trial record makes it clear that she was 
  not receiving competent legal advice and therefore that the resulting delay 
  cannot be attributed to her. She claims that the Crown is responsible for the 
  delay because, knowing what was taking place, the Crown failed, either through 
  incompetence or as part of it its trial strategy, to take appropriate action 
  to prevent the violation of her rights. </p>
<p>
  [5] After reviewing the record, we agree that the trial judge's findings of 
  multiple Charter breaches amounting to an abuse of process and his findings 
  concerning a s. 11(b) Charter breach cannot stand. However, we reject the respondent's 
  submission that the trial record, standing alone, demonstrates that she was 
  not receiving competent advice. As the respondent failed to adduce any evidence 
  on appeal concerning the advice that she received, we find no merit in her submission 
  that we should uphold the stay of proceedings on the alternative basis that 
  she suggests. For the reasons that follow, we would allow the Crown's appeal, 
  set aside the order staying the charges and the order for costs, and order a 
  new trial.</p>
<p>
  II. Background </p>
<p>
  (a) The Crown's case against the respondent </p>
<p>
  [6] A basic overview of the Crown's case against the respondent will be helpful 
  to appreciating the issues on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [7] On August 19, 1995, two fishermen discovered the severed thighs of 64-year-old 
  Larry Foster floating in the Rideau River near Kemptville, Ontario. Over the 
  course of the next few days, police recovered Mr. Foster's head, arms and hands, 
  and lower legs and feet from various river locations in the vicinity of the 
  original discovery. Mr. Foster's torso has never been recovered.</p>
<p>
  [8] Police arrested the respondent in connection with Mr. Foster's death on 
  August 25, 1995. She was subsequently charged with second-degree murder and 
  interfering with a dead body. </p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown's case against the respondent consisted of three main components: 
  circumstantial evidence of opportunity, D.N.A. evidence linking her to the victim 
  and the disposal of his body, and evidence of post offence conduct.</p>
<p>
  [10] Mr. Foster first met the respondent in the spring of 1993 during a vacation 
  in the Barbados. At the time, Mr. Foster was recovering from leukemia and was 
  plagued with back problems. He met the respondent in a local massage parlour 
  where she was working as a masseuse. They developed a personal relationship 
  and, in July of 1993, while vacationing in Canada, the respondent stayed with 
  Mr. Foster for about a month. During this visit, she became indebted to Mr. 
  Foster for about $5,000. Mr. Foster was not a wealthy man, and following this 
  visit, he made ongoing efforts to have the respondent repay the money that she 
  owed him.</p>
<p>
  [11] On a subsequent trip to Canada in 1994, the respondent met another man, 
  Jean Yves Momy, through a dating service. She would later implicate Mr. Momy 
  in Mr. Foster's murder.</p>
<p>
  [12] In late July 1995, the respondent returned to Canada. She spent the initial 
  part of her visit staying with Mr. Momy in Ottawa and then went to Brooklyn 
  to visit her sister, and from there made trips to Toronto and Montreal. She 
  returned to Mr. Momy's apartment on the morning of Friday, August 18, 1995. 
  Mr. Momy says that he went out for the day and that the respondent was not there 
  when he returned at around 6 p.m. </p>
<p>
  [13] Mr. Foster was last seen alive outside his apartment in Kemptville between 
  3:00 and 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon of Friday, August 18, 1995. His body parts 
  were discovered in the Rideau River at approximately 1:00 p.m. the following 
  day. A combination of witnesses and telephone records link the respondent to 
  Mr. Foster's apartment and to the Kemptville area during significant portions 
  of the intervening period. </p>
<p>
  [14] At approximately 9:00 p.m. on August 18, 1995, two of Mr. Foster's neighbours 
  saw a black woman entering their apartment building. The woman was carrying 
  a box and walked up the stairs in the direction of Mr. Foster's apartment. One 
  of the neighbours gave a description of the woman's clothing. It matched a description 
  of clothing the respondent was seen wearing later that night.</p>
<p>
  [15] Another neighbour recalled seeing Mr. Foster's car backed-in towards the 
  entrance of the building on August 18, 1995, just after 9:00 p.m. The neighbour 
  saw a person make several trips between the car and the building, and then drive 
  away. During one of the trips, the person put a rolled-up piece of carpeting 
  in the back seat of the car. The neighbour could not identify the person, but 
  gave a description of the person's clothing that also matched a description 
  of clothing the respondent was seen wearing later that night. </p>
<p>
  [16] Mr. Foster's telephone records disclose a five-minute telephone call to 
  the respondent's residence in the Barbados on August 18, 1995 at 9:36 p.m. The 
  respondent shares her residence with a female partner, Gillian Lowe. Ms. Lowe 
  told the police that she recalled a telephone conversation with the respondent 
  at around that time.</p>
<p>
  [17] At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 18, 1995, Constable Laderoute of 
  the Kemptville Police stopped the respondent less than one kilometre from Mr. 
  Foster's apartment as part of a R.I.D.E. program. Constable Laderoute would 
  later testify that the respondent was driving Mr. Foster's car, a blue Ford 
  Taurus, licence number 301-HOM. Constable Laderoute noted that the car was packed 
  with a variety of boxes and other items. </p>
<p>
  [18] At 11:30 p.m. on August 18, 1995, the respondent was involved in a car 
  accident in Ottawa. She was driving Mr. Foster's car and produced Mr. Foster's 
  ownership and insurance. Those documents were later found in Mr. Foster's apartment. 
  Constable Denis of the Ottawa Police attended the accident. He too noticed that 
  there were many items in Mr. Foster's vehicle.</p>
<p>
  [19] Mr. Momy's sister lives in the same building in Ottawa where Mr. Momy lives. 
  On August 19, 1995 at approximately 1:30 a.m. she was dealing with a family 
  emergency. While doing so, she noticed the respondent making several trips to 
  Mr. Momy's apartment, bringing various belongings inside. She provided a description 
  of the respondent's clothing matching those of Mr. Foster's neighbours and Constable 
  Denis.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Momy states that he arrived home on August 19, 1995 at approximately 
  4 a.m. to find Ms. Elliott waiting inside his apartment. He told police that 
  the respondent had with her two knives, a duffle bag, various plastic shopping 
  bags, and two barbeque grills. He said that, shortly after he arrived, she left 
  his apartment wearing a brown dress with a whitish design. </p>
<p>
  [21] After executing a search warrant at Mr. Momy's residence, police discovered 
  two knives, one of which was stained with traces of Mr. Foster's blood; a suitcase 
  tag bearing Mr. Foster's name; and two barbeque grills belonging to Mr. Foster. 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] Mr. Foster's telephone records disclose a further telephone call from his 
  apartment to the respondent's residence in the Barbados at 7:32 a.m. on August 
  19, 1995. </p>
<p>
  [23] At approximately 8:45 a.m. on August 19, 1995, a witness noticed a person 
  wearing a brown dress leaning into a car stopped on the Lewes bridge, near where 
  the victim's severed head was found. Bloodstains consistent with Mr. Foster's 
  blood were subsequently found on the side of the bridge.</p>
<p>
  [24] At approximately 9 a.m. on August 19, 1995, three of Mr. Foster's neighbours 
  saw a black woman at their building. Two of the witnesses observed the woman 
  carrying boxes. One of the witnesses said it was the same woman she had seen 
  the night before. That witness said the woman carried some boxes downstairs, 
  put them in Mr. Foster's car, and drove away at around 9:30 a.m. In addition, 
  the witness said that she saw the woman return and enter their building about 
  a half hour later. A third witness saw the woman get into Mr. Foster's car and 
  arrange some parcels at around 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. The first two witnesses gave 
  a description of the woman's clothing that was consistent the descriptions given 
  by Mr. Momy and the witness at the Lewes bridge. </p>
<p>
  [25] Police subsequently found a bundle of items wrapped in a shower curtain 
  alongside a local road. The shower curtain contained a piece of the victim's 
  flesh, along with a variety of bloodstained items originating from Mr. Foster's 
  apartment, including the pieces of carpet referred to above. Also included was 
  an unrolled blue condom with traces D.N.A. consistent with that of Mr. Foster 
  and a pair of women's panties with traces of menstrual blood consistent with 
  that of the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [26] Mr. Momy said that the respondent called him from Kemptville at around 
  11:00 or 11:30 a.m. on August 19, 1995 and asked to be picked up. </p>
<p>
  [27] On the afternoon of August 25, 1995, two police officers saw the respondent 
  in Kemptville and took her to the police station where she was eventually arrested. 
  She made three different statements to the police over the course of the evening 
  of August 25, 1995 and the early morning hours of August 26, 1995. </p>
<p>
  [28] In her only statement to the police that the trial judge ruled admissible, 
  the respondent said that she met Mr. Foster on the evening of Friday, August 
  18,1995 and decided to stay the night at his apartment. She borrowed Mr. Foster's 
  car to drive to Mr. Momy's residence to retrieve her belongings. However, Mr. 
  Momy trailed her secretly when she returned and followed her inside Mr. Foster's 
  apartment. Once inside the apartment, Mr. Momy and Mr. Foster began to fight. 
  The respondent claimed that she watched as Mr. Momy strangled Mr. Foster. She 
  told him to stop but he would not listen. She fled the apartment but returned 
  shortly after daybreak on Saturday morning. Mr. Foster was lying on the floor. 
  She checked for a pulse but did not feel anything. She called the Barbados and 
  then called Mr. Momy but he did not answer. She attempted to drive to Ottawa 
  but could not, as she was trembling too much so she returned Mr. Foster's vehicle 
  and then called Mr. Momy and asked him to pick her up.</p>
<p>
  [29] On the strength of this account, the respondent was charged with being 
  an accessory to murder and Mr. Momy was arrested and charged with murder. However, 
  the police released Mr. Momy after questioning him.</p>
<p>
  [30] Significantly, post mortem examination of Mr. Foster's head and neck revealed 
  no evidence of strangulation.</p>
<p>
  [31] Mr. Momy told the police that sometime after August 19, 1995, the respondent 
  took a room at the Ottawa YWCA. The police executed a search warrant at this 
  room and seized a sports bag and brown floral print dress. Forensic testing 
  revealed that both items were stained with Mr. Foster's blood. </p>
<p>
  [32] In addition, police determined that, following the murder, the respondent 
  used Mr. Foster's VISA card to obtain cash advances totalling $1,000, that she 
  had arranged to ship several items from his apartment to her home in the Barbados 
  (including his stereo, microwave oven, camera and hair dryer), and that she 
  had attempted to obtain an earlier flight home, by claiming falsely that her 
  daughter was ill.</p>
<p>
  (b) The history of the proceedings against the respondent</p>
<p>
  (i) Overview </p>
<p>
  [33] As already noted, police arrested the respondent in connection with Mr. 
  Foster's death on August 25, 1995. Following a bail hearing on September 15, 
  1995, the respondent was detained in custody. She remained in custody until 
  a stay of proceedings was entered four years and two weeks after her arrest.</p>
<p>
  [34] Prior to the commencement of pre-trial motions on September 29, 1997, the 
  case proceeded relatively uneventfully. However, shortly before the commencement 
  of pre-trial motions, the respondent discharged lead defence counsel and Mr. 
  Kevin Murphy assumed carriage of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [35] Based on the original time estimates, it was anticipated that pre-trial 
  motions would last about two weeks and that, by the end of 1997, the trial would 
  be completed. However, Mr. Murphy brought further pre-trial motions in addition 
  to those that were originally planned with the result that pre-trial motions 
  were not completed until December 17, 1997. </p>
<p>
  [36] The trial proper commenced in Brockville on January 27, 1998. However, 
  on February 13, 1998, after less than nine full days of evidence in front of 
  the jury, defence counsel embarked on a voir dire relating to an unproduced 
  original will-say statement from Constable Laderoute. The trial proper never 
  resumed.</p>
<p>
  [37] Between February 13, 1998 and September 7, 1998 defence counsel brought 
  three mid-trial applications for a stay of proceedings and numerous sub-applications 
  in pursuit of an evolving theory that, at the behest of O.P.P. case-manager 
  Detective Inspector Lyle MacCharles and with the tacit approval of Crown counsel, 
  police investigators engaged in a conspiracy to concoct evidence and develop 
  a case that could result only in the respondent being convicted. The respondent 
  now concedes that the evidence adduced during the course of the proceedings 
  not only failed to establish defence counsel's theory, but it also did not justify 
  embarking on many of the applications that ensued. However, on September 7, 
  1999, after nineteen months of voir dires, the trial judge accepted defence 
  counsel's theory and entered a stay of the proceedings. </p>
<p>
  [38] It is the almost two-year period commencing on September 29, 1997, on which 
  the respondent relies as amounting to unreasonable delay. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Preliminary proceedings prior to the commencement of the trial </p>
<p>
  [39] Following her arrest, the respondent retained Michael Neville as lead counsel 
  with Mr. Murphy assisting as junior counsel. Within approximately one year of 
  the respondent's arrest, the defence team had obtained pre-trial disclosure 
  and completed the preliminary inquiry, which proceeded over the course of 16 
  days. </p>
<p>
  [40] On September 18, 1996, the respondent was ordered to stand trial. The trial 
  was scheduled to commence on September 29, 1997 and was estimated to last five 
  to six weeks. </p>
<p>
  (iii) Pre-trial motions</p>
<p>
  [41] On September 23, 1997, the Crown was advised that Mr. Neville had been 
  discharged and that Mr. Murphy had taken over as lead counsel for the defence. 
  Mr. Ian Cadieux joined the defence team as junior counsel.</p>
<p>
  [42] Pre-trial motions commenced on September 29, 1997. There were four defence 
  motions before the court on that day, including a motion to adjourn the trial 
  for two weeks because of the change in counsel and because all of the transcripts 
  from the preliminary inquiry were not yet available. </p>
<p>
  [43] However, between September 29, 1997 and December 17, 1997, defence counsel 
  brought thirteen additional motions. In addition to the motion for an adjournment, 
  the defence motions included: two requests to the trial judge to recuse himself 
  because he had conducted the respondent's bail hearing; a request for a mistrial 
  because of comments made by the trial judge, three challenges to the array; 
  a request to challenge individual jurors for cause; a request for a change of 
  venue, two requests relating to the respondent's place of incarceration; three 
  applications for a stay of proceedings; two Charter motions for the exclusion 
  of evidence (a statement motion and a search warrant motion); an application 
  to relieve the police case manager of his courtroom security duties; and a request 
  for an order for the release of exhibits for scientific testing. </p>
<p>
  [44] Several of the defence motions had to be adjourned on their original return 
  date because defence counsel had not given proper notice. The Crown consented 
  to the challenge for cause motion and to the adjournment request. Of the contested 
  motions, the defence succeeded in excluding some of the respondent's statements 
  to the police, in ensuring that the respondent remained in custody in Ottawa 
  and in obtaining the release of an exhibit for scientific testing. One of the 
  applications for a stay of proceedings was adjourned. The remainder of the defence 
  motions were dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [45] Two of the pre-trial applications for a stay of proceedings are noteworthy 
  because of the significance they acquired later in the proceedings. The first 
  of these applications related to the potential unavailability of Detective Inspector 
  MacCharles to give evidence. </p>
<p>
  [46] On October 2, 1997, Detective Inspector MacCharles suffered a heart attack. 
  His doctor recommended that he remain off-duty during his recovery, which was 
  estimated at three to six months. Defence counsel maintained that a stay was 
  necessary because of the importance of Detective Inspector MacCharles's evidence 
  to two issues: first, the defence pre-trial application to exclude the respondent's 
  statements to the police; and second, to the trial issue relating to Constable 
  Laderoute's contact with the respondent concerning the August 18, 1995 R.I.D.E. 
  stop. Defence counsel was successful in excluding the relevant portions of Ms. 
  Elliott's statements without Detective Inspector MacCharles giving evidence. 
  However, that portion of the stay application relating to Detective Inspector 
  MacCharles's availability to give trial evidence was adjourned and would later 
  be revisited during the third mid-trial application for a stay of proceedings. 
  </p>
<p> [47] The second noteworthy pre-trial stay application related to disclosure. 
  In particular, the defence alleged that the Crown had not disclosed the following 
  items: </p>
<ul>
  <li>copies of O.P.P. or Kemptville police occurrence reports pertaining to Mr. 
    Foster; and</li>
  <li>copies of telephone records of ingoing and outgoing calls made at Mr. Foster's 
    residence, prior to and following August 18, 1995. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [48] In order to put subsequent events in context, we will briefly describe 
  the substance of this pre-trial application.</p>
<p>
  [49] The undisclosed occurrence reports related to two incidents: first, a complaint 
  Mr. Foster made to the police on June 21, 1995 concerning silent telephone calls 
  that he was receiving; and, second, a December 1991 incident in which Mr. Foster 
  was alleged to have threatened one of his neighbours. The request for telephone 
  records related, at least in part, to the silent telephone calls. </p>
<p>
  [50] General information about the silent telephone calls had been disclosed 
  to the defence prior to the preliminary inquiry, and defence counsel cross-examined 
  some of the witnesses about the silent telephone calls. However, for reasons 
  that are unclear, Detective Constable Ball (the officer co-ordinating disclosure) 
  did not receive the actual occurrence report relating to the police attendance 
  at Mr. Foster's home and therefore did not provide it to the defence. Moreover, 
  in late October 1997, in response to a follow-up request by defence counsel 
  for occurrence reports, Detective Constable Ball advised Mr. Flanagan, one of 
  the trial Crowns, that there were no undisclosed occurrence reports. Relying 
  on Detective Constable Ball's advice, Mr. Flanagan wrote a letter to defence 
  counsel confirming that information. Following Mr. Flanagan's letter, the occurrence 
  report relating to the June 21, 1995 attendance was discovered and disclosed 
  to the defence. </p>
<p>
  [51] Although defence counsel did not pursue this matter further on the pre-trial 
  stay application, he raised it again on the mid-trial stay applications, claiming, 
  in particular, that the failure of police to investigate Mr. Foster's use of 
  an automatic call tracing feature (the &quot;*57 feature&quot;) prejudiced the 
  defence. In the result, on September 7, 1999, the trial judge concluded that 
  the failure of police to adequately investigate the silent calls and Mr. Flanagan's 
  letter to defence counsel were breaches of the respondent's Charter rights. 
  </p>
<p>
  [52] As for the incident involving Mr. Foster and his neighbour, defence counsel's 
  primary concern appeared to be that he had not received complete information 
  about Mr. Foster's criminal record. However, the evidence adduced on the pre-trial 
  stay application established that although Mr. Foster was charged with uttering 
  a threat in early January 1992, the charge was withdrawn after Mr. Foster entered 
  a peace bond. </p>
<p>
  [53] In addition, other evidence indicated that the police did not have a computer 
  system for occurrence reports in December 1991; that the paper record of such 
  a charge would be destroyed within two years after the year in which it was 
  laid; and that charges (as opposed to convictions) are not always recorded on 
  the CPIC system. Accordingly, prior to completing the pre-trial application, 
  defence counsel advised the court that any remedy for non-disclosure had been 
  &quot;rendered academic&quot; by the information that he had obtained on the 
  pre-trial application. </p>
<p>
  [54] Despite these developments, the trial judge permitted defence counsel to 
  re-open this issue and eventually found, in his September 7, 1999 ruling, that 
  &quot;the apparent deliberate destruction by unknown O.P.P. officers &#133; 
  of computerized records pertaining to criminal charges&quot; against Mr. Foster 
  amounted to a breach of Ms. Elliott's Charter rights [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  (iv) The first mid-trial stay application </p>
<p>
  [55] Presentation of evidence to the jury commenced on January 27, 1998 and 
  continued until February 12, 1998. Although the pre-trial motions took longer 
  than anticipated, the real turning point in the trial was on February 13, 1998 
  when, after cross-examining Constable Laderoute about the August 18, 1995 R.I.D.E. 
  stop, defence counsel embarked on a voir dire relating to the non-disclosure 
  of a handwritten will-say statement. Although defence counsel obtained the information 
  he said that he required about the handwritten will-say, the disclosure motion 
  quickly evolved into a mid-trial stay application that lasted until March 13, 
  1998. </p>
<p>
  [56] The thrust of the mid-trial stay application became an assertion that police 
  investigators had engaged in &quot;unprofessional, incompetent, negligent, improper 
  and unlawful conduct&quot;, and that both trial Crowns &quot;were involved in 
  the police misconduct, were aware of police misconduct and failed to stop it; 
  or, were wilfully blind to the police misconduct&quot;. During the course of 
  the stay application, defence counsel expanded it to include approximately three 
  dozen alleged Charter violations encompassing six basic areas: breach of disclosure 
  obligations (including the matters raised on the pre-trial stay application 
  relating to non-disclosure); failure to investigate alternate theories of responsibility 
  for the murder (&quot;tunnel vision&quot;); alleged loss or destruction of exhibits 
  and other documents; alleged fabrication by Constable Laderoute of his August 
  18, 1995 R.I.D.E. stop notebook entry; alleged false statements made by Detective 
  Constable Ball concerning information he had received from other officers; and 
  alleged witness tampering. </p>
<p>
  [57] Although police investigators denied the allegations of witness tampering 
  and no civilian or police witnesses substantiated counsel's complaint, defence 
  counsel sought, and was granted the right, to compel both trial Crowns to testify 
  based solely on that allegation. In addition, the trial judge ordered that Crown 
  counsel brought in to assume carriage of the stay application have no contact 
  with the trial Crowns who were compelled to testify. </p>
<p>
  [58] A basic understanding of how the original voir dire commenced will assist 
  in understanding the unusual nature of what subsequently occurred.</p>
<p>
  [59] On February 11, 1998, the Crown called Constable Laderoute as a witness 
  on the trial proper. Constable Laderoute testified that, on August 18, 1995, 
  he stopped the respondent while conducting a R.I.D.E. program in Kemptville 
  close to Mr. Foster's home. He said the respondent was not wearing a seatbelt 
  and that the only identification she could produce was her passport. However, 
  he permitted the respondent to leave on the understanding that she would produce 
  her driver's licence and the ownership and insurance documents for the vehicle 
  she was driving the following day. He recorded the respondent's name, date of 
  birth, her address and the licence number of the vehicle at the back of his 
  notebook, out of chronological sequence: Aug. 18/95 10:05 p.m. Barbasos D.O.B. 
  - 60/06/17 Julia Elliott New Orleans Apt. 430 Donald Street Lic. Plate - 301- 
  HOM [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [60] In cross-examination, defence counsel suggested to Constable Laderoute 
  that he did not make the R.I.D.E. stop notebook entry on August 18, 1995, but 
  rather that he did so a week later, on the evening of August 24, 1995, at the 
  suggestion of Detective Inspector MacCharles, after Mr. Foster's body was identified 
  and after Constable Laderoute saw a photograph of Mr. Foster's girlfriend while 
  taking a missing person report at Mr. Foster's residence. </p>
<p>
  [61] At one point in his cross-examination, Constable Laderoute was asked the 
  following question and gave the following answer: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And I suggest to you that you were playing catch-up, sir, 
  and you were playing damage control, and you were instructed by MacCharles or 
  another senior investigator to make a note of your encounter on August 18th, 
  because you didn't at the time.</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir. That would be correct.</p>
<p>
  [62] That question and answer became a focal point of defence counsel's submissions 
  that Constable Laderoute fabricated his notebook entry relating to the August 
  18, 1995 R.I.D.E. stop and that the police were engaged in a conspiracy to convict 
  the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [63] During the course of the stay application, Constable Laderoute testified 
  that Detective Inspector MacCharles did in fact tell him to &quot;make notes&quot; 
  but explained that in saying, &quot;[y]es sir&#133;[t]hat would be correct&quot;, 
  he was simply responding to one of the suggestions in defence counsel's question. 
  Constable Laderoute said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  At that time, I had already made my note on the first encounter with Ms. Elliott. 
  &#133;I was making my notes for the missing person report, which I had already 
  started. He just made that brief statement, &quot;[m]ake notes&quot;. </p>
<p>
  Moreover, the presence of the word &quot;Barbasos&quot; and the respondent's 
  date of birth on page three of her passport demonstrate the likelihood that 
  Constable Laderoute copied part of his notes from her passport. Significantly, 
  police did not obtain the respondent's passport until searching her room at 
  the Ottawa YWCA on August 27, 1995. </p>
<p>
  [64] Despite these factors, in his March 16, 1998 ruling, the trial judge concluded 
  that Constable Laderoute did not record the licence plate number on the evening 
  of August 18, 1995, but rather &quot;somehow&quot; subsequently obtained that 
  information and inserted it into his notebook on August 24, 1995, thereby breaching 
  the respondent's Charter rights [emphasis in the original]. In his September 
  7, 1999 ruling, the trial judge expanded his original finding by holding that 
  Constable Laderoute misled R.C.M.P. investigators when he told them that he 
  copied information from the respondent's passport on August 18, 1995 and not 
  on August 24, 1995.</p>
<p>
  [65] Defence counsel also led evidence from Constable Laderoute during the trial 
  proper that one of Constable Laderoute's two will-say statements was produced 
  to the defence in typed form only. Defence counsel maintained that the handwritten 
  draft was important because the typed copy did not indicate the date on which 
  the second will-say was prepared and because that date could assist in determining 
  when Constable Laderoute made his notes. He accordingly embarked on a voir dire 
  aimed at obtaining disclosure in relation to the unproduced draft will-say. 
  </p>
<p>
  [66] At the outset of the voir dire, defence counsel acknowledged that there 
  was no issue that Constable Laderoute did in fact stop the respondent on August 
  18, 1995. However, he submitted that the police &quot;used Constable Laderoute 
  &#133; in effect to forge a link between Ms Elliott and the vehicle they wanted 
  to search&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [67] The second witness called on the voir dire was a police case management 
  officer who may have submitted the original will-says for typing. The case management 
  officer produced a previously undisclosed police statement register, which set 
  out particulars of witness statements and which included the date of Constable 
  Laderoute's draft will-say. However, rather than abandoning the voir dire upon 
  discovering that information, defence counsel stated that he was expanding its 
  scope to an application &quot;pursuant to sections 7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter&quot;, 
  and began questioning the case management officer about a to-do list. </p>
<p>
  [68] The case management officer confirmed that the to-do list was generated 
  following a September 10, 1995 meeting at the home of Mr. Flanagan and that 
  it identified a need to re-interview certain witnesses. As part of his motion, 
  defence counsel submitted that police investigators pressured those witnesses 
  to modify their statements. In addition, defence counsel asserted that, given 
  the temporal connection between the meeting and generation of the to-do list, 
  Mr. Flanagan was a necessary witness on his motion. Although there was no evidentiary 
  basis for the allegation that Mr. Flanagan was a necessary witness, the trial 
  judge embarked on a hearing to determine whether he was compellable.</p>
<p>
  [69] Three aspects of the compellability hearing are noteworthy. First, the 
  trial judge refused to permit a senior Ottawa Crown to address the compellability 
  issue, therefore requiring the attendance of Mr. Ramsay, counsel from the Crown 
  law office, to assume carriage of the stay application. Second, when Mr. Ramsay 
  appeared, defence counsel moved to disqualify him, asserting that the entire 
  Ministry of the Attorney General was in a conflict of interest because of Mr. 
  Flanagan's actions. Defence counsel also made the absurd submission that Mr. 
  Ramsay was an accessory after the fact to murder, because he was enabling the 
  real murderer to escape. Although the trial judge called on Mr. Ramsay to respond, 
  he declined to disqualify him. Third, during the course of the application, 
  the trial judge prohibited Mr. Ramsay from communicating with the trial Crowns 
  (the compellability of both original trial Crowns was eventually put in issue). 
  </p>
<p>
  [70] On March 16, 1998, the trial judge ruled that a stay of proceedings was 
  not warranted. However, he found seventeen breaches of the respondent's Charter 
  rights and granted a variety of remedies arising from those breaches. In addition, 
  he declared a mistrial, released the jury, and on his own motion directed that 
  the trial be moved to Ottawa. </p>
<p> [71] Some examples of the Charter breaches found by the trial judge include 
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>premature tunnel vision on the part of the lead investigator in conducting 
    the investigation;</li>
  <li>inaccurate and misleading testimony by a police officer at the respondent's 
    bail hearing (referring to the fact that Detective Constable Ball gave evidence 
    in-chief of certain inferences he drew from information he received from other 
    officers rather than stating what the officers told him);</li>
  <li>deliberate non-disclosure of Mr. Foster's criminal record;</li>
  <li>denial of the existence of any police reports pertaining to the threatening 
    telephone calls received by Mr. Foster;</li>
  <li>failure of police investigators and the Crown to submit or resubmit various 
    items of evidence for testing, including a used condom found on the opposite 
    side of the road to the shower curtain that was submitted to the Centre of 
    Forensic Sciences for testing but returned untested and a broken silver necklace 
    found on the floor of Mr. Foster's bedroom;</li>
  <li>deliberate destruction of an original handwritten draft case synopsis; and 
  </li>
  <li>failure of Crown counsel to re-interview Constable Denis with a view to 
    reconciling an inconsistency in his trial preparation interview with his earlier 
    statements. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  (v) The second mid-trial stay application</p>
<p>
  [72] Following the March 16, 1998 ruling, proceedings continued in Brockville 
  so that the remedies ordered by the trial judge could be implemented. Several 
  witnesses testified as part of that process.</p>
<p>
  [73] The trial was then scheduled to resume in Ottawa with jury selection to 
  take place on April 14, 1998. However, on that day, defence counsel served a 
  renewed notice of application to stay the proceedings alleging over forty additional 
  Charter violations. Although the Crown submitted that the application should 
  not be heard until after evidence at trial had been taken, the trial judge declined 
  to hear submissions on that point and proceeded with the application. </p>
<p>
  [74] In advising the court that he proposed to bring a further application for 
  a stay, defence counsel indicated that he relied, in part, on the delivery, 
  days earlier, of two additional witness statements from the Crown, both taken 
  on April 6, 1998. The statements were from Mr. Foster's sister and her son. 
  Defence counsel characterized the statements as &quot;highly suspicious&quot; 
  because they related to one of the issues raised on the first application for 
  a stay. Without hearing from the Crown, the trial judge characterized the statements 
  as &quot;spectacular&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [75] The second mid-trial application for a stay was heard between April 14, 
  1998 and May 21, 1998. The issues canvassed included: whether the recently delivered 
  witness statements had been concocted; failure of the police investigators to 
  follow up on the June 1995 silent telephone calls to Mr. Foster; whether Bell 
  Canada employees were being forthright in their evidence on the application 
  concerning how long records of Mr. Foster's use of the *57 feature would have 
  been retained; various issues relating to the police investigation of Mr. Momy, 
  and whether Mr. Ramsay had contravened a direction not to speak to Mr. Findlay, 
  one of the original trial Crowns, during the first mid-trial application for 
  a stay.</p>
<p>
  [76] On May 27, 1998 the trial judge found eleven further breaches of the respondent's 
  Charter rights but reserved his decision on the appropriate remedy until at 
  least the conclusion of the Crown's case. </p>
<p>
  [77] In particular, the trial judge found that Mr. Ramsay's contact with Mr. 
  Findlay during the first mid-trial stay application was &quot;a deliberate contravention 
  of the trial process&quot; and a breach of the respondent's Charter rights. 
  The trial judge made this finding even though he had earlier declined to disqualify 
  Mr. Ramsay on that basis, saying &quot;the Court recognized that counsel may 
  have legitimately interpreted the order in another way&quot;. </p>
<p> [78] Other examples of Charter breaches found by the trial judge include the 
  following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>failure of the police to ensure that they had gathered all of Mr. Momy's 
    handwritten journal entries when they executed a search warrant at his residence 
    on August 27, 1995;</li>
  <li>failure of O.P.P. investigators to disclose the &quot;witness statement 
    register&quot; until February 1998; and </li>
  <li>failure of the police to follow up on Mr. Foster's use of the *57 feature 
    on his telephone in relation to the June 1995 telephone calls. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [79] Following the trial judge's ruling, the case was adjourned to August 17, 
  1998 for jury selection. That date was selected despite Crown counsel's statement 
  that he was prepared to proceed with the trial during the summer months. After 
  consulting with the respondent, defence counsel supported the trial judge's 
  suggestion to adjourn until August 17, 1998. </p>
<p>
  (vi) The third mid-trial stay application </p>
<p> [80] For some time prior to August 17, 1998, the O.P.P. had been conducting 
  an internal investigation into allegations that an officer had disposed of a 
  handgun that he received from a Crown witness in an unrelated homicide case 
  (&quot;the Cumberland case&quot;)<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>. Detective 
  Inspector MacCharles was the O.P.P. case manager for both the Elliott case and 
  the Cumberland case. On August 11, 1998, Detective Inspector MacCharles admitted 
  instructing another officer to &quot;get rid of&quot; a gun the officer had 
  received in relation to the Cumberland case and thereafter to deny the incident. 
</p>
<p>
  [81] When proceedings resumed on August 17, 1998, defence counsel indicated 
  that he intended to renew his application for a stay of proceedings based on 
  this recently disclosed information. The Crown led evidence indicating that 
  the O.P.P. investigation into the matter would soon be complete and might result 
  in the matter being referred to an independent police agency for further investigation. 
  As a result of these developments, the case was adjourned until September 8, 
  1998. </p>
<p>
  [82] On September 3, 1998, Crown counsel Mr. McGarry, who now had carriage of 
  the prosecution, wrote to defence counsel and informed him that the MacCharles 
  investigation (including MacCharles' conduct in the Elliott case) had been referred 
  to the R.C.M.P. for further investigation.</p>
<p>
  [83] On September 8, 1998, Mr. McGarry informed the court of the developments 
  and indicated that, although he thought it would be difficult to proceed with 
  the stay application without knowing the results of the R.C.M.P. investigation, 
  he was prepared to proceed if that was defence counsel's wish. The new O.P.P. 
  case manager, Detective Inspector Bowmaster, was then called to give evidence 
  concerning the likely completion date of the R.C.M.P. investigation. </p>
<p>
  [84] Detective Inspector Bowmaster advised the court that he did not think the 
  R.C.M.P. investigation would begin for another three weeks and estimated that 
  it would likely take between three and six months. During the course of his 
  evidence, he referred to a meeting he attended on August 20, 1998 with Ottawa-Carleton 
  Crown Attorney Mr. Berzins, Acting Regional Crown Mr. Pelletier and O.P.P. officials. 
  He said that at the conclusion of that meeting everyone present agreed that 
  the MacCharles investigation should be referred to the R.C.M.P. </p>
<p>
  [85] At the request of defence counsel, the trial judge decided to proceed immediately 
  with the renewed stay application. However, as a result of Detective Inspector 
  Bowmaster's evidence concerning the August 20, 1998 meeting, rather than focussing 
  on Detective Inspector MacCharles's involvement in the Elliott investigation, 
  much time was spent dealing with evidence about when the trial Crowns were aware 
  that Detective Inspector MacCharles was &quot;dirty&quot;, what decisions were 
  reached at the August 20, 1998 meeting, who was advised of the results of the 
  meeting, and when they were advised. </p>
<p>
  [86] In pursuit of these inquiries, defence counsel was permitted to lead evidence 
  from Mr. Berzins, Mr. Pelletier, and the two lead trial Crowns in the Cumberland 
  case. In addition, as a result of evidence that O.P.P. officials told the Elliott 
  trial Crowns of the outcome of August 20, 1998 meeting after it concluded, defence 
  counsel was permitted to call Elliott trial Crowns Mr. McGarry and Mr. Cavanagh 
  and to advance an allegation that they misled the court concerning when they 
  learned of the decision to refer the MacCharles investigation to the RCMP.</p>
<p>
  [87] Following the trial judge's decision to permit the defence to call the 
  Elliott trial Crowns as witnesses, Mr. Hoffman, an assistant Crown attorney 
  from Windsor, appeared for the Crown on an interim basis while the Crown attempted 
  to retain independent counsel. The trial judge instructed Mr. Hoffman not to 
  have any contact with Messrs. McGarry and Cavanagh.</p>
<p>
  [88] The Ministry of the Attorney General was eventually successful in retaining 
  two members of the private bar to represent it on the stay application. The 
  two new counsel, Mr. Strosberg and Mr. Humphrey, appeared before the trial judge 
  on December 23, 1998. Despite defence counsel's original submission that someone 
  from outside the Ministry of the Attorney General should be retained as independent 
  counsel, he questioned the authority of the two new counsel acting for the Crown. 
  On January 18, 1999, the trial judge accepted that the two new counsel had authority 
  to appear for the balance of the stay application. Despite this ruling, in his 
  September 7, 1999 stay ruling, he concluded that their retainer had been without 
  legal authority and amounted to a breach of the respondent's Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  [89] The renewed mid-trial stay application was expanded over time by at least 
  five additional notices of application. The proceedings were also marked by 
  several citations for contempt and threatened citations for contempt. </p>
<p>
  [90] Final submissions on the stay application were adjourned to March 1999, 
  to allow the new Crown counsel to obtain transcripts and to accommodate written 
  submissions. However, proceedings were ultimately adjourned pending completion 
  of the R.C.M.P. investigation. </p>
<p> [91] In late March 1999, the lead R.C.M.P. investigator was required to attend 
  and provide a status report. During his attendance, the trial judge directed 
  that he turn over his investigative file to the court. The file was sealed, 
  copied and returned to the R.C.M.P. Defence counsel then brought an O'Connor<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  application for disclosure of the file. That application was eventually adjourned 
  pending completion of the R.C.M.P. investigation. </p>
<p>
  [92] On June 21, 1999, the lead R.C.M.P. investigator provided the trial judge 
  with two reports, one relating to the Elliott investigation and one relating 
  to the Cumberland investigation. Copies of both reports were turned over to 
  the defence. The R.C.M.P. concluded that there was no evidence that Detective 
  Inspector MacCharles had in any way tainted the Elliott investigation. Final 
  argument on the stay application commenced on July 28, 1999 and was completed 
  on August 5, 1999. </p>
<p>
  [93] Examples of other issues explored during the course of the third mid-trial 
  stay application include the following: whether and when Detective Inspector 
  MacCharles would be available to testify and at what points he had previously 
  been available throughout the course of the proceedings; Detective Inspector 
  MacCharles's role in the Elliott investigation, in particular, his instructions 
  to Constable Laderoute on August 24, 1995 and his involvement in selecting a 
  police officer to conduct the April 6, 1998 interview of Mr. Foster's sister 
  and her son; the propriety of the Crown conducting further witness interviews 
  of Barbadian witnesses; alleged perjury by police officers relating to travel 
  plans for the additional witness interviews; allegations that the police and 
  correctional officials were harassing the respondent; whether various police 
  officers had complied with a defence request that they produce updated notes 
  from September 28, 1997; whether comments made by an Elliott trial Crown at 
  the time of withdrawing an impaired driving charge in an unrelated matter impacted 
  on the ability of that Crown to continue the Elliott prosecution; and whether 
  an ongoing summary prepared by one of the Elliott trial Crowns of alleged incidents 
  of judicial bias should be produced. </p>
<p>
  [94] As previously noted the trial judge delivered his decision on September 
  7, 1999. In doing so, in addition to finding a breach of the respondent's right 
  to a trial within a reasonable time, he found two additional Charter breaches 
  stemming from Constable Laderoute's actions and testimony, fifteen Charter breaches 
  arising from alleged perjured, false or misleading evidence of other police 
  officers; forty-eight Charter breaches arising from issues connected with Detective 
  Inspector MacCharles; five Charter breaches arising from the inclusion of &quot;faulty&quot; 
  information in search warrants; over forty Charter breaches arising from alleged 
  deficiencies in the conduct of the police investigation; seven Charter breaches 
  arising from alleged deficiencies in disclosure; nine Charter breaches relating 
  to immigration issues; two Charter breaches arising from alleged interferences 
  with defence counsel; two Charter breaches arising from alleged &quot;tunnel 
  vision&quot; on the part of the Crown; four Charter breaches relating to subpoenaing 
  Crown counsel; one Charter breach based on an alleged violation of a non-communication 
  order by Crown counsel; and one Charter breach arising from the retainer of 
  members of the private bar. </p>
<p> [95] Some examples of the specific findings are noteworthy: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a finding that Crown counsel breached the respondent's Charter rights by 
    failing to disclose the decision to refer the MacCharles investigation to 
    the R.C.M.P. at the earliest opportunity; </li>
  <li>a finding that Crown counsel and the Ministry of the Attorney General breached 
    the respondent's Charter rights by failing to disclose the fact or extent 
    of their involvement in the August 20, 1998 decision to refer the MacCharles 
    investigation to the R.C.M.P.; </li>
  <li>a finding that senior Crown counsel and senior O.P.P. officers breached 
    the respondent's Charter rights and deceived the court by purporting to isolate 
    the trial Crowns from involvement in or knowledge of the August 20, 1998 meeting 
    while informally apprising them of it the same day;</li>
  <li>a finding that R.C.M.P. investigators breached the respondent's Charter 
    rights by advising Crown witnesses that their investigation was brought about 
    as a result of &quot;allegation raised by defence counsel&quot;; and </li>
  <li>findings that the Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Murray Segal, breached 
    the respondent's Charter rights by instructing various Crown counsel &quot;to 
    oppose&quot; subpoenas served on other Crown counsel on the basis that the 
    subpoenaed counsel had no material or relevant evidence to give knowing that 
    representation was false.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  (c) Other Relevant Events </p>
<p>
  (i) The Crown's recusal applications </p>
<p>
  [96] During and soon after the first mid-trial stay application, the Crown requested 
  that the trial judge recuse himself. The trial judge dismissed the first application 
  and declined to hear the second.</p>
<p>
  [97] On March 6, 1998, Mr. Ramsay submitted that the trial judge should recuse 
  himself on two bases: first, because he had descended into the arena by his 
  examination of police witnesses, and second, because he had expressed the view, 
  during an exchange with counsel, that Constable Laderoute acknowledged making 
  his August 18, 1995 notebook entry at a later time. The trial judge dismissed 
  the application. </p>
<p>
  [98] Subsequently, on April 8, 1998, after the matter had reconvened in Ottawa, 
  Mr. Ramsay indicated that Mr. McGarry, Mr. Cavanagh and Ms. McNally would continue 
  with the trial but that he proposed to deal with any further applications arising 
  out of proceedings in Brockville and to bring an application to have the trial 
  judge recuse himself. </p>
<p>
  [99] The trial judge declined to hear from Mr. Ramsay, saying &quot;if there's 
  any business to be placed before this court, it should be the new prosecution 
  team that the court has been advised is now in place&quot;. When Mr. McGarry 
  subsequently appeared he indicated that he would not be pursuing the application 
  for recusal.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The Cadieux letter</p>
<p>
  [100] On September 21, 1998, Mr. Murphy advised the court that Mr. Cadieux would 
  no longer be acting as junior counsel. Subsequently, on September 23, 1998, 
  Mr. Murphy introduced Mr. Jeffrey Meleras as Mr. Cadieux's replacement. Following 
  Mr. Meleras' introduction, both the trial judge and Crown counsel indicated 
  that they had received a sealed envelope from Mr. Cadieux. </p>
<p>
  [101] After a meeting with Mr. Murphy, the respondent confirmed that she had 
  read a letter from Mr. Cadieux that was contained in the envelopes and agreed 
  that the trial judge and the Crown could review the letter. Counsel and the 
  trial judge then adjourned to chambers.</p>
<p> [102] Once in chambers, Crown counsel submitted that Mr. Cadieux's letter 
  raised concerns about Mr. Murphy's fitness to conduct the defence and that it 
  was incumbent on the court to look into the matter. In particular, Crown counsel 
  referred the court to four paragraphs of Mr. Cadieux's letter expressing the 
  following concerns: (i) that Mr. Murphy had dismissed Mr. Cadieux despite the 
  respondent's recent advice that she wanted Mr. Cadieux to remain on the case; 
  (ii) that Mr. Murphy's emotional state was affecting his judgment; (iii) that 
  Mr. Murphy's decision to dismiss Mr. Cadieux was irrational, leaving Mr. Cadieux 
  with no option but to sue him; and (iv) that Mr. Murphy's dismissal letter made 
  it apparent that Mr. Murphy intended to lie to the court regarding the reason 
  for Mr. Cadieux's non attendance.<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> </p>
<p>
  [103] In response to crown counsel's submissions, the trial judge stated that 
  he found no merit in the suggestion that the court &quot;should be alerted to 
  the competency of counsel for the accused&quot;. In particular, the trial judge 
  noted that Mr. Cadieux's had raised his concerns only after he was dismissed, 
  and said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;I have already commented on the record that I have disapproved of some 
  of the presentation and posture by counsel for the accused. This is a highly 
  emotional, highly charged case, so I am aware that there have been emotional 
  outbursts. I am aware that there have been strenuous, strenuous arguments made 
  to the court. None of that gives the court pause to even commence a consideration 
  of the competency of counsel to represent his client. </p>
<p>
  [104] Nothing further was said about the Cadieux letter when proceedings resumed 
  in court.</p>
<p>
  III. The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</p>
<p>
  (a) The Crown</p>
<p>
  [105] The Crown's original position on appeal was that the stay of proceedings 
  that was granted is not sustainable for three reasons. First, the trial judge 
  demonstrated actual bias against the Crown or, in the alternative, a reasonable 
  apprehension of bias, and ought to have disqualified himself. Second, various 
  orders permitting defence counsel to call the trial Crowns as witnesses and 
  precluding Crown counsel from communicating with one another resulted in a breach 
  of natural justice and a denial of procedural fairness to the Crown. Third, 
  the Charter breaches found by the trial judge, including the s. 11(b) breach, 
  are not supportable as a matter of fact and law; moreover, even if some of the 
  Charter breaches are supportable they do not justify the extraordinary remedy 
  of a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [106] In response to Ms. Elliott's submission on appeal that a stay is warranted 
  under s. 11(b) of the Charter on different grounds than those relied upon by 
  the trial judge, the Crown submits that the trial record demonstrates that Mr. 
  Murphy adopted a trial strategy of attempting, at all costs, to obtain a stay 
  of the proceedings, regardless of the delay that that strategy might entail. 
  Further, on the record before this court, there is no basis for concluding that 
  the respondent was not aware of her Charter right to a trial within a reasonable 
  time and that she did not fully endorse the trial strategy that Mr. Murphy adopted. 
  In the circumstances, the Crown contends that a traditional s. 11(b) analysis 
  is appropriate and the respondent cannot avoid responsibility for the delay 
  that is attributable to the defence. </p>
<p>
  (b) The respondent </p>
<p>
  [107] The respondent submits that a traditional s. 11(b) analysis is not appropriate 
  in this case for three reasons. First, the trial record makes it abundantly 
  clear that her lead trial counsel was incompetent and therefore incapable of 
  providing her with effective assistance. In light of defence counsel's ineffective 
  assistance, it cannot be said that the respondent knowingly waived her s. 11(b) 
  right to a trial within a reasonable time, nor can she be held responsible for 
  any of defence counsel's actions that may have caused or contributed to delay. 
  </p>
<p>
  [108] Second, the trial judge demonstrated a clear inability to manage the trial, 
  a blatant misunderstanding of the legal principles applicable to defence counsel's 
  meritless arguments, and frequently misunderstood the evidence that was before 
  him. Accordingly, the trial judge too was incompetent and either caused, or 
  contributed to, much of the delay and failed to take appropriate action to protect 
  her against the ineffective assistance of her counsel.</p>
<p>
  [109] Third, knowing of these problems and of the risk to the respondent's right 
  to a trial within a reasonable time, the Crown failed, either through incompetence 
  or as a matter of trial strategy, to take steps available to it alone to prevent 
  the violation of her rights. </p>
<p>
  [110] In these circumstances, the almost two year period from September 29, 
  1997 until September 7, 1999 amounts to unreasonable delay attributable to the 
  Crown and violates the respondent's right to a trial within a reasonable time. 
  </p>
<p>
  IV. Analysis of the Charter Violations</p>
<p>
  [111] As we have said, the respondent now concedes that the stay of proceedings 
  cannot be sustained. The respondent concedes that the evidence does not support 
  most of the Charter violations found by the trial judge and that, in any event, 
  none of the violations was of a nature to warrant the remedy of a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [112] We agree with those concessions and the respondent's position before this 
  court relieves us of the need to review all of the 150 alleged Charter breaches. 
  We nevertheless wish to deal with some of the issues that arose at trial, and 
  particularly those that could conceivably arise at the new trial. We also think 
  it may be helpful to comment on some of the orders that were made by the trial 
  judge since it would seem that there is still some confusion about the scope 
  of Charter remedies and the procedure to be followed. We also think it necessary 
  to record our concern with some of the facts found by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  (a) Calling counsel as witness</p>
<p>
  [113] Several of the procedural and other errors committed by the trial judge 
  revolve around his allowing the defence to call Crown counsel as witnesses. 
  The trial judge permitted defence counsel to call eight Crown counsel on the 
  various motions; four of the counsel prosecuting the respondent, and four Crown 
  counsel prosecuting or otherwise involved with the Cumberland case. There was 
  no basis for permitting defence counsel to do so. In addition, the trial judge 
  hampered Crown counsel in their conduct of the case by making unwarranted non-communication 
  orders that effectively prevented successor counsel from preparing these Crown 
  counsel as witnesses and preparing for the prosecution of the motions and the 
  trial proper. The trial judge also made unfounded findings against the Assistant 
  Deputy Attorney General because he allegedly instructed counsel to oppose applications 
  to have Crown counsel testify. We intend to very briefly deal with each of these 
  areas.</p>
<p>
  (i) The test for calling counsel as witnesses</p>
<p>
  [114] It is only in exceptional circumstances that Crown or defence counsel 
  will be permitted to call opposing counsel as a witness. It is not sufficient 
  that the counsel may have material evidence to give. The party seeking to call 
  opposing counsel must lay an evidentiary foundation for showing that the counsel's 
  evidence is likely to be relevant and necessary. This stringent test applies 
  whether it is defence counsel seeking to call Crown counsel or Crown counsel 
  seeking to call defence counsel. This rule has been laid down in many decisions 
  of the Superior Court. Craig J. expressed the test, in part, as follows in R. 
  v. Stupp, Winthrope and Manus (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 206 at 219 (Ont. H.C.J.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my opinion, when a subpoena or the right to call a witness is challenged 
  as here, it is not sufficient for the party proposing to call the witness to 
  merely allege that the witness can give material evidence; but rather the onus 
  is on the accused in this case to establish that it is likely that Brian Johnston 
  can give material evidence. That is particularly applicable where, as here, 
  the accused takes the extraordinary step of seeking to call Crown counsel as 
  a witness. If Brian Johnston is called, he obviously cannot continue as counsel 
  at the preliminary hearing and other counsel will be required to pick up the 
  pieces of a long and complicated preliminary hearing. It is an interference 
  with the judicial process which can only be contemplated in unusual cases. In 
  my opinion, an accused person should not be permitted to call Crown counsel 
  to conduct a fishing expedition or to examine in the hope that something might 
  turn up that would assist him on the issue; but rather counsel must satisfy 
  the judge that there is a real basis for believing that it is likely the witness 
  can give material evidence. If it is otherwise, preliminary hearings and trials 
  can be interrupted at random; and the administration of criminal justice could 
  be seriously impaired. That is particularly so where, as in this case, there 
  are extensive police investigations. If the investigating officers seek legal 
  advice during the course of the investigation, then Crown counsel in all such 
  cases may be put under subpoena in an attempt to establish abuse of process 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [115] In R. v. Sungalia et al., [1992] O.J. No. 3718, Campbell J. held as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Crown counsel and defence counsel are subject to the process 
  of the court. They are not immune from subpoena.</p>
<p class="indent">As a practical matter, however, criminal litigation would be 
  impossible if Crown counsel had the unrestricted right to call defence counsel 
  as a witness or if defence counsel had the unrestricted right to call Crown 
  counsel as a witness.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a persuasive burden on the lawyer who seeks to force 
  opposing counsel to go into the witness box and relinquish his role as counsel. 
  The persuasive burden is to show relevance and necessity.</p>
<p class="indent">As a general rule neither relevance nor necessity is shown simply 
  because opposing counsel, accompanied by an assistant interviews a witness whose 
  statement becomes the subject of cross-examination. If Crown counsel or defence 
  counsel could be routinely called as a witness simply because she had previously 
  interviewed one of her own witnesses then no lawyer, Crown or defence, could 
  ever prepare properly for trial [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [116] We agree with these statements. In particular, we stress the necessity 
  part of the test. In this case, the trial judge permitted defence counsel to 
  call several of the Crown counsel because they had attended meetings at which 
  many others, including police officers, were present. There was no basis shown 
  that the evidence of the Crown counsel was necessary in such circumstances. 
  There was nothing to show that the police officers who attended the meetings 
  could not adequately convey what occurred. The defence counsel's vague suspicions 
  that Crown counsel might say something different from the police officers was 
  not enough to overcome the threshold for calling counsel as witnesses.</p>
<p>
  [117] Moreover, the evidence sought from counsel was immaterial. It related 
  to matters that on any view of the facts could not substantiate an abuse of 
  process. For example, considerable time was spent pursuing the issue of when 
  exactly various Crown counsel knew of the decision to call in the R.C.M.P. to 
  investigate Detective Inspector MacCharles's misconduct relating to the Cumberland 
  case. This was not simply a fishing expedition. It was an attempt to pursue 
  an issue that was of no consequence to the litigation. On any reasonable basis 
  of the facts the exact date when the decision was made, whether on August 20, 
  1998 or within a week or two thereafter, was completely irrelevant. Moreover, 
  the fact that a police officer may have conveyed the information to Crown counsel 
  in the Elliott matter was also totally irrelevant. There was no version of this 
  issue that on any realistic view could ever support an abuse of process or a 
  stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [118] Moreover, once Crown counsel, Mr. McGarry and Mr. Cavanagh in particular, 
  were called the trial judge permitted a wide ranging cross-examination that 
  established beyond doubt that defence counsel was engaged in little more than 
  a fishing expedition. </p>
<p>
  (ii) The test for calling witnesses in general</p>
<p>
  [119] Strictly speaking the necessity test did not apply to the Crown counsel 
  from the Cumberland case. However, it was incumbent on defence counsel to show 
  that these counsel had material evidence to give. Ordinarily, a subpoena will 
  go as a matter of course upon the statement by counsel that a witness has material 
  evidence to give. However, where the subpoena or the right to call a witness 
  is challenged, a mere allegation that the proposed witness has material evidence 
  to give is not sufficient. The party must establish that the witness can give 
  material evidence. Defence counsel made no such showing with respect to the 
  Cumberland Crown counsel.</p>
<p>
  [120] We also note that Crown counsel offered to prepare an agreed statement 
  of facts as to the proposed testimony of the two Cumberland Crown counsel, Ms. 
  Bair and Mr. Cooper, to avoid their having to testify. This offer should have 
  been pursued in the absence of some real indication that no agreement could 
  be reached.</p>
<p>
  [121] When the Cumberland Crown counsel did testify, it became clear that they 
  had no material evidence to give. They were not involved in the respondent's 
  trial and only provided information about when they became concerned about Detective 
  Inspector MacCharles's conduct related to the Cumberland case. There was no 
  reasonable basis for thinking that their conduct could have led to a breach 
  of the respondent's rights. </p>
<p>
  (iii) Non-communication orders</p>
<p>
  [122] The trial judge made various orders prohibiting Crown counsel from discussing 
  the case with their predecessors who had been removed from the case because 
  of the rulings of the trial judge that they testify at the proceedings. These 
  orders frustrated attempts by the new counsel to prepare for the continuing 
  motions and for the trial proper. They seemed to have been made because of the 
  trial judge's suspicion that the former Crown counsel would somehow taint the 
  new counsel or would fabricate evidence. These suspicions were unfounded. Crown 
  counsel are officers of the court. They are expected to conduct themselves honourably 
  and in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. The trial judge had 
  no basis for assuming that Crown counsel would act otherwise and his non-communication 
  orders were ill advised. </p>
<p>
  (iv) Opposing defence applications to call witnesses</p>
<p>
  [123] The trial judge found four Charter breaches based on the conduct of the 
  Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Murray Segal, for example, in instructing 
  counsel to move to quash defence subpoenas to Crown counsel and instructing 
  counsel to make submissions opposing the defence applications to call Crown 
  counsel as witnesses. These findings of the trial judge were typical of other 
  Charter breaches in that they shared these common elements: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. There was no factual basis for the findings.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge made a bare finding of a Charter breach without 
  explaining the legal basis for the finding.</p>
<p class="indent">4. In any event, there was no legal basis for the finding.</p>
<p class="indent">5. The trial judge misunderstood the reach of the Charter.</p>
<p class="indent">6. The trial judge proceeded in a manner that was unfair to 
  the person whose conduct was impugned.</p>
<p>
  [124] Since these findings were typical of the trial judge's approach in general, 
  we propose to use them as an example of the errors made by the trial judge. 
  The trial judge found that the Assistant Deputy Attorney General instructed 
  counsel to make various submissions and that these submissions or representations 
  to the court were inconsistent, deliberately false, untrue and calculated to 
  mislead the court. </p>
<p>
  [125] It is a serious matter to find that a counsel has given instructions to 
  mislead the court. The trial judge made this finding against the Assistant Deputy 
  Attorney General in the absence of hearing from him and in the absence of any 
  evidence that he had anything to do with the instructions to Crown counsel. 
  This finding was completely without foundation and gives the appearance of a 
  failure by the trial judge to conduct the proceedings impartiality and fairly.</p>
<p>
  [126] The finding by the trial judge that Crown counsel made false or misleading 
  submissions or representations calculated to mislead the court is not supported 
  by the record. It is not necessary to analyze the evidentiary record to demonstrate 
  the errors by the trial judge in his appreciation of the evidence. The positions 
  taken by the various Crown counsel in opposing the orders compelling Crown counsel 
  to testify were reasonable based on the paucity of information provided in the 
  subpoenas and the submissions of Mr. Murphy. The trial judge seems to simply 
  have misunderstood the positions taken by counsel since his findings bear little 
  relationship to the actual submissions and representations made by Crown counsel. 
  One example will suffice. The trial judge found that the Assistant Deputy Attorney 
  General breached the respondent's Charter rights because he instructed Crown 
  counsel, Mr. Sotirakos, to appear on October 10, 1998 to oppose subpoenas served 
  on Mr. McGarry and Mr. Cavanagh on the basis that neither had any relevant or 
  material evidence to give concerning the August 20, 1998 meeting, &quot;knowing 
  that representation was deliberately false and misleading&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [127] In fact, Mr Sotirakos did not appear to oppose the subpoenas. He appeared 
  to seek an adjournment so that other counsel, Mr. Thompson, could appear to 
  argue the issue. There was no suggestion in his submissions that he was informed 
  about the case or was purporting to inform the court about the evidence that 
  Crown counsel could provide. He set out the Crown's general position as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I can indicate as well that my understanding is that the motion 
  the Crown wishes to proceed on really has two prongs to it: One, would be that 
  the Crown would be requesting of this court that, should the issuance of a subpoena 
  have been in issue, that the court not grant such a subpoena. The second prong 
  is, of course, that, given the position of the Crown regarding the subpoena, 
  that Your Honour excuse Messrs. McGarry and Cavanagh from the requirement of 
  testifying, quite simply because, a) there is, with all due respect, nothing 
  relevant that either Mr. Cavanagh or Mr. McGarry could provide to this court; 
  and b) that there is nothing material or necessary that requires them to testify.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, I think that would be the basis with respect to the motion 
  in the broadest sense, without getting into the details as to why that argument 
  is made.</p>
<p>
  [128] Later on, it became abundantly clear that Mr. Sotirakos had not discussed 
  the details of the case with Mr. Segal, and did not have any knowledge of the 
  evidence that Crown counsel might be able to give. He was completely candid 
  with the trial judge that he had only been contacted by Mr. Segal the previous 
  day to try and find a counsel to respond to the latest application by the defence 
  to call trial counsel. He indicated that he knew very little about the case 
  and was simply laying out what would be the prosecution's argument. He was not 
  making that argument and was not purporting to set out the evidence the trial 
  counsel might or might not be able to provide. The comments by the trial judge 
  at the time make it clear that he understood Mr. Sotirakos's limited role.</p>
<p>
  [129] The Charter of Rights and Freedoms is part of the fundamental law of this 
  country. It contains important protections for accused persons. But, it brings 
  the Charter and the administration of justice into disrepute when, as here, 
  it is used to &quot;remedy&quot; baseless and frivolous claims. The trial judge 
  never explained how making submissions to a court could constitute a breach 
  of the Charter. He did not explain what provision of the Charter was engaged 
  by this conduct or what legal principle was involved.</p>
<p>
  [130] We can assume that the trial judge had in mind the fundamental justice 
  rights in s. 7 or the fair trial rights in s. 11(d). In Reference re: Section 
  94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 at 503, Lamer J. held that 
  the principles of fundamental justice &quot;are to be found in the basic tenets 
  of our legal system&quot;. But, as Sopinka J. said in Rodriguez v. British Columbia 
  (Attorney General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 at 591, these principles must not be 
  so broad &quot;as to be no more than vague generalizations about what our society 
  considers to be ethical or moral&quot;. Either under s. 7 or s. 11(d) an accused 
  has a right, for example, to disclosure and to make full answer and defence. 
  As an element of the right to make full answer and defence an accused has a 
  right to adduce relevant and admissible evidence. As McLachlin J. said in R. 
  v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at 608: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The right of the innocent not to be convicted is dependent on the right to present 
  full answer and defence. This, in turn, depends on being able to call the evidence 
  necessary to establish a defence and to challenge the evidence called by the 
  prosecution.</p>
<p>
  [131] The Charter has not, however, changed the way in which courts determine 
  the admissibility of evidence. Courts make those determinations by hearing submissions 
  and sometimes hearing evidence, as on a voir dire. The fact that Crown counsel 
  make submissions about the admissibility of evidence, does not infringe an accused's 
  right to call evidence and challenge the evidence called by the prosecution. 
  The submissions made by Mr. Sotirakos and the other Crown counsel did not infringe 
  the respondent's rights nor threaten to impair those rights. They were simply 
  submissions, nothing more. In the case of Mr. Sotirakos, it was a submission 
  for an adjournment of a few days so that properly instructed counsel could attend.</p>
<p>
  (v) Questioning the independence of counsel</p>
<p>
  [132] The trial judge came to believe that Crown counsel arguing the various 
  motions had to be &quot;independent&quot;. Thus, counsel who might have some 
  knowledge of the case or participated in some of the tactical decisions in the 
  case were not qualified to appear. We are unaware of any such rule. The trial 
  judge was wrong to disqualify Crown counsel for these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [133] One of the more peculiar findings by the trial judge related to the Crown's 
  decision to retain counsel from the private bar. Earlier in the case, the trial 
  judge had been of the view that &quot;independent&quot; counsel could be counsel 
  &quot;from the Ministry or otherwise&quot;. Not surprisingly, in view of the 
  trial judge's view about the need for independent counsel and the difficulties 
  that were being encountered in Crown counsel being forced to testify, the Ministry 
  of the Attorney General eventually sought counsel from the private bar. However, 
  when these counsel, Mr. Strosberg and Mr. Humphrey, appeared, the trial judge 
  doubted that they had status to act on behalf of the Crown. Eventually, he became 
  persuaded that the counsel from the private bar could be retained and they had 
  carriage of the prosecution until the stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [134] However, in his ruling on the stay of proceedings, the trial judge made 
  the following findings: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that the retainer of private counsel by the Crown in the middle of a 
  continuing murder trial is without constitutional, statutory or common law basis 
  or precedent and has created further unreasonable delay in the proceedings, 
  and is a breach of the applicant's Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  [135] The factual premise underlying the trial judge's finding, that the retainer 
  of private counsel caused delay, is not supported by the record. Mr. Humphrey, 
  who eventually took over most of the in-court work, proceeded with dispatch. 
  He was prepared and his submissions were to the point and helpful. His attendance 
  at last seemed to put an end to the trial counsel having to be removed because 
  they were required to testify. </p>
<p>
  [136] Further, the legal premise underlying the trial judge's finding is erroneous 
  and displays a misunderstanding of the role of the Attorney General. At common 
  law and by statute (Ministry of the Attorney General Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.17, 
  s. 5), the Attorney General of Ontario has all the powers that belong to the 
  Attorney General and Solicitor General of England by law or usage. While Ontario 
  now has a professional prosecution service largely made up of full-time employees 
  of the Ministry, it has always been open to the Attorney General to retain any 
  counsel to conduct litigation on behalf of the Crown. Originally, in both England 
  and Upper Canada, barristers, who were not employees of the Attorney General, 
  were retained to prosecute cases on an ad hoc basis on behalf of the Crown. 
  See for example, Philip C. Stenning, Appearing for the Crown (Cowansville, Quebec: 
  Brown, 1986) c. 7. While the practice has diminished in the Superior Court of 
  this province, the Attorney General of Ontario and the Attorney General of Canada 
  regularly employ private counsel on an ad hoc basis to prosecute cases in both 
  the Ontario Court of Justice and, on occasion, in the Superior Court of Justice. 
  In other provinces, especially British Columbia, it is not uncommon for defence 
  counsel to regularly be retained by the Attorney General of that province to 
  act in major prosecutions. We see no basis in law or in principle for any distinction 
  because in this case the accused was charged with murder.</p>
<p>
  [137] When Mr. Strosberg and Mr. Humphrey represented to the trial judge as 
  officers of the court that they had authority from the Attorney General to conduct 
  the prosecution, that should have been the end of the matter. There is nothing 
  to indicate that these counsel failed to carry out their instructions or that 
  they were incapable of prosecuting the case in accordance with the ethical and 
  legal obligations of counsel acting as agents of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>
  (b) Allegations of deliberately misleading the court</p>
<p>
  [138] One of the many troubling findings by the trial judge was that senior 
  police officers, Crown counsel and the Assistant Deputy Attorney General deliberately 
  misled the court about events surrounding the August 20, 1998 meeting and decision 
  to refer the Detective Inspector MacCharles investigation to the R.C.M.P. He 
  further found that this deliberate deception violated the respondent's Charter 
  rights. Like the other findings made against Crown counsel and the police these 
  were not supported by the record. However, we deal with this issue in particular 
  because it demonstrates a fundamental misapplication of the Charter. The following 
  is an example of the kind of finding the trial judge made: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that the deliberate deception of this Court by the Crown and senior O.P.P. 
  officers-including Regional Senior Crown Pelletier, Senior Crown Berzins, Det. 
  Supt. Edgar, Det. Insp. Grasman, and Det.Insp. Bowmaster-in purporting to formally 
  &quot;isolate&quot; trial Crowns McGarry and Cavanagh from evident involvement 
  in or knowledge of the August 20th, 1998, decision-while &quot;informally&quot; 
  apprising them of it the same day-so they could disavow responsibility for its 
  non-disclosure to the Court and to defence counsel is a breach of the applicant's 
  Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  [139] The defence has a constitutional right to disclosure of all relevant material 
  and the information must be disclosed with reasonable dispatch. That said, the 
  defence does not establish a Charter violation simply by showing that there 
  has been delay in disclosing a piece of information. More importantly, there 
  can be no Charter violation where the alleged delay or non-disclosure relates 
  to irrelevant matters. As L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. said in R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 
  4 S.C.R. 411 at para. 74: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where the accused seeks to establish that the non-disclosure by the Crown violates 
  s. 7 of the Charter, he or she must establish that the impugned non-disclosure 
  has, on the balance of probabilities, prejudiced or had an adverse effect on 
  his or her ability to make full answer and defence. It goes without saying that 
  such a determination requires reasonable inquiry into the materiality of the 
  non-disclosed information. Where the information is found to be immaterial to 
  the accused's ability to make full answer and defence, there cannot possibly 
  be a violation of the Charter in this respect. I would note, moreover, that 
  inferences or conclusions about the propriety of the Crown's conduct or intention 
  are not necessarily relevant to whether or not the accused's right to a fair 
  trial is infringed. The focus must be primarily on the effect of the impugned 
  actions on the fairness of the accused's trial [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [140] Information as to the exact date when the R.C.M.P. were called in to investigate 
  Detective Inspector MacCharles's misconduct in the Cumberland investigation 
  and who made the decision and who knew about the decision was immaterial to 
  the respondent's ability to make full answer and defence. Moreover, within days 
  of the decision being made, the respondent's counsel was informed of the decision. 
  No one, least of all the trial judge, was misled about the relevant facts, that 
  a decision had been made and that it would take some time to complete the R.C.M.P. 
  investigation.</p>
<p>
  [141] For the trial judge to build this immaterial matter into Charter violations 
  and find without any reasonable basis that the court had been deliberately misled 
  is troubling. There is no version of the events surrounding the August 20 meeting 
  that could lead to a violation of the respondent's Charter rights sufficient 
  to merit any remedial action.</p>
<p>
  (c) Abuse of the contempt power</p>
<p> [142] Although abuse of the contempt power was not a matter that gave rise 
  to any erroneous findings of Charter violations, we are concerned about the 
  manner in which the trial judge used his contempt jurisdiction. There are several 
  occasions where it appears that the trial judge may have misunderstood the purpose 
  of the contempt power. For example, on one occasion one of the counsel who had 
  appeared for the R.C.M.P. was unavailable as she had commitments in northern 
  Ontario. This counsel, Ms. Proulx, had seen the R.C.M.P. file concerning the 
  investigation of Detective Inspector MacCharles, but the trial judge had ordered 
  her not to discuss its contents with anyone. Another counsel for the R.C.M.P., 
  Mr. Ward, appeared for Ms. Proulx. The understanding by counsel for the R.C.M.P. 
  was that submissions were not going to be made on that occasion on the O'Connor 
  application; rather the R.C.M.P. reports would just be filed and a date set 
  for argument. In any event, the trial judge had been advised two months earlier 
  that either Mr. Ward or Ms. Proulx would be attending on this date. The trial 
  judge made a disparaging and unfair comment about Ms. Proulx<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> 
  and then made an order that her superior Eugene Williams, Q.C. attend that afternoon.</p>

<p>
  [143] Mr. Williams testified and explained his understanding of the proceedings. 
  The trial judge stated that he found his explanation unsatisfactory and said: 
  &quot;I am contemplating citing you for contempt of Court&quot;. He then reserved 
  on whether Mr. William's action was contempt in the face of the court and dismissed 
  Mr. Williams without giving Mr. Ward an opportunity to remind the trial judge 
  of what had been said on the earlier occasion. The trial judge never did cite 
  Mr. Williams for contempt of court. </p>
<p>
  [144] The power of a superior court to cite a person for contempt of court is 
  a very important power but it is to be used with restraint. It is a serious 
  matter to threaten anyone, let alone an officer of the court, with contempt 
  of court. We can see no basis upon which it would have been open to the trial 
  judge to find Mr. Williams in contempt of court. Contempt of court implies conduct 
  that is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or 
  the lawful process of the courts. It is conduct that seriously interferes with, 
  or obstructs, the administration of justice. See for example R. v. Glasner (1994), 
  19 O.R. (3d) 739 (Ont. C.A.). At worst, in this case there may have been a misunderstanding 
  as to what was to occur when the R.C.M.P. reports were filed with the court. 
  That does not approach the kind of conduct that can properly be stigmatized 
  as contempt of court. A reasonable observer might be concerned that the trial 
  judge appeared to be biased against the police and their counsel because of 
  this unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>
  (d) Findings related to testimony concerning the August 18, 1995 R.I.D.E. stop 
  of the respondent</p>
<p>
  [145] The trial judge made numerous findings that police officers had committed 
  perjury or given false or misleading evidence in the course of testifying at 
  the trial and on the various voir dires and therefore had breached the respondent's 
  Charter rights. The evidence supports none of these findings. A fair reading 
  of the record shows that the officers did not give deliberately false evidence. 
  At worst, on some occasions, sometimes due to the complexity of defence counsel's 
  questions, officers may have given mistaken evidence. None of these occasions 
  could have amounted to a breach of the respondent's Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  [146] One example will suffice to show the trial judge's erroneous approach 
  to these issues. The trial judge made findings against Constable Laderoute based 
  on the August 18, 1995 R.I.D.E. stop of the respondent when she was driving 
  the deceased's motor vehicle. The R.C.M.P. as part of the MacCharles investigation 
  looked into the defence allegation that Constable Laderoute had altered his 
  notebook. They concluded that he did not. A fair review of the evidence supports 
  that conclusion. What is of particular concern with the trial judge's approach 
  to this issue is that there was never any dispute that Constable Laderoute did 
  stop the respondent and at a time when she was driving the deceased's vehicle. 
  Any controversy about the notebook could not have impaired the respondent's 
  right to a fair trial. </p>
<p>
  [147] This was not a case where the police had deliberately destroyed material 
  evidence. Even if the defence allegation was borne out by the evidence, the 
  defence at most might have been able to persuade the trial judge to remove the 
  reference to the licence plate from the information to obtain the search warrant 
  for the YWCA search. This would not, however, have affected the validity of 
  the warrant in view of the abundance of other material in the warrant that confirmed 
  the identity of the vehicle. In any event, complete success on that issue for 
  the defence would at most have led to exclusion of evidence from the YWCA search, 
  not a stay of proceedings for abuse of process. Neither the trial judge nor 
  defence counsel recognized that misconduct or even serious errors in the course 
  of the investigation are not remedied by a stay of proceedings. In particular, 
  mistakes or misconduct in the collection of evidence will almost invariably 
  be dealt with under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  (e) Findings relating to Crown counsel statements or tactics</p>
<p>
  [148] The trial judge made a number of findings that Crown counsel had breached 
  the respondent's Charter rights because of certain statements made by counsel 
  in the course of proceedings. Again, we do not find it necessary to deal with 
  all of the errors made by the trial judge. We will, however, consider some of 
  these findings because they indicate some misunderstanding of the role of the 
  Charter and especially of remedies for Charter violations. We are also concerned 
  about some of these findings because of the misapprehension of the role of Crown 
  counsel.</p>
<p>
  (f) Expressions of personal opinion by Mr. McGarry</p>
<p>
  [149] The trial judge made several findings of Charter violations based on the 
  conduct of Mr. McGarry. For example, he found as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that repeated expressions of personal opinion as to the guilt of the 
  applicant made to this Court by Crown McGarry during the renewal of the abuse 
  of process voir dire and, specifically, his comment on September 10th, 1998 
  that he would not be prosecuting the applicant if he didn't &quot;believe she 
  was guilty of murder&quot; is a violation of the applicant's right to be presumed 
  innocent until proven guilty under section 11(d) of the Charter, and of his 
  duties as a Crown prosecutor.</p>
<p>
  [150] There are several concerns with this finding. It is factually incorrect. 
  Our review of the record simply does not bear out the finding that Mr. McGarry 
  repeatedly expressed a personal opinion about the guilt of the applicant. The 
  one comment referred to by the trial judge has, unfortunately, been taken out 
  of context. The impugned comments were not made in the presence of the jury 
  and were in response to intemperate remarks by defence counsel culminating in 
  a demand that the Crown stay the proceedings against the respondent. In the 
  course of those remarks, defence counsel improperly expressed the opinion that 
  the trial was a miscarriage, that &quot;we are being asked to embark on the 
  conviction train&quot; by the Crown and that the &quot;carriage master is the 
  Attorney General, and we're being asked: Do we want to get the train rolling 
  again?&quot; He expressed the opinion that the process is &quot;corrupted and 
  &#133; tainted&quot; to &quot;an unprecedented degree&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [151] In response, Mr. McGarry said, &quot;the Crown is not in the habit of 
  staying proceedings against people who are guilty of murder, and I am confident 
  that I can prove this woman guilty of murder and, therefore I would not be staying 
  these proceedings.&quot; He also took up defence counsel's analogy to a train 
  and pointed out that there is &quot;on this track, an acquittal train and &#133; 
  if [the] evidence, as he keeps saying, is so weak and so bad, he would be taking 
  his acquittal train out of the station. But the reality is, Your Honour, it 
  has no wheels&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [152] These comments by Mr. McGarry if made in the presence of the jury would 
  have been improper. But they were made in submissions before the trial judge 
  and in response to provocative and intemperate remarks by defence counsel. An 
  expression of opinion by a prosecutor that he or she is able to prove the guilt 
  of the accused in that context is not a violation of the accused's Charter rights 
  and not a breach of the prosecutor's duty. The prosecutor is entitled to seek 
  a conviction provided that he or she does not resort to unfair means to do so. 
  As this court said in R. v. Gayle (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 36 at para. 61: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is not appropriate for Crown counsel to seek a conviction at all costs. Counsel's 
  duty is to lay credible and relevant evidence before the trier of fact, assisting 
  the trier to ensure that justice will be done. In this sense, it is said that 
  the Crown's responsibilities are &quot;quasi-judicial&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [153] The Honourable Michel Proulx and David Layton expressed the prosecutor's 
  duty as follows in Ethics and Canadian Law, (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001) at 697: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The prosecutor has a dual role in the justice process. On the one hand, Crown 
  counsel must seek to act fairly to achieve a just result in the furtherance 
  of the public interest. On the other hand, the prosecutor can legitimately act 
  as an advocate in striving to obtain a just conviction. Probably the greatest 
  challenge for a prosecutor is reconciling the frequent tension involving these 
  duties [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [154] Finally, even if Mr. McGarry's expression of opinion was improper, that 
  did not translate into a Charter violation. As we have pointed out, the statement 
  was not made in the presence of the trier of fact. It could not have affected 
  the respondent's right to a fair trial under s. 11(d). There was no evidence 
  that Mr. McGarry's belief that he was prosecuting the right person for the death 
  of the deceased improperly influenced any decisions he was called upon to make. 
  The trial judge did not identify any decisions or actions taken that could have 
  impacted on the respondent's right to a fair trial. Crown counsel must retain 
  their objectivity: R. v. Regan, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297 at para. 70. However, an 
  honest and reasonably held belief that the accused is guilty of the offence 
  being prosecuted is not inconsistent with this duty. See Nelles v. Ontario, 
  [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170 at 193.</p>
<p>
  (g) Disclosure</p>
<p>
  [155] The trial judge made numerous findings that the respondent's rights were 
  infringed because of a failure by the Crown to make adequate disclosure. We 
  have touched upon some of them above and it is unnecessary to review all of 
  those findings. There were, however, certain common features upon which we intend 
  to comment.</p>
<p>
  [156] The Crown's obligation to make disclosure in accordance with R. v. Stinchcombe, 
  [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, is to disclose all relevant material in its possession. 
  The Supreme Court expressed the relevancy requirement in R. v. Eggar, [1993] 
  2 S.C.R. 451 at 467 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  One measure of the relevance of information in the Crown's hands is its usefulness 
  to the defence: if it is of some use, it is relevant and should be disclosed: 
  Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 345. This requires a determination by the reviewing 
  judge that production of the information can reasonably be used by the accused 
  either in meeting the case for the Crown, advancing a defence or otherwise in 
  making a decision which may affect the conduct of the defence such as, for example, 
  whether to call evidence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [157] Thus, the disclosure obligation is a broad one. But, the obligation is 
  only to disclose relevant information. Crown counsel may as a matter of prudence 
  err on the side of caution and produce everything in its possession. See R. 
  v. Dixon, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at para. 28. There is no breach of the obligation, 
  however, unless the trial judge determines that what was not disclosed was relevant. 
  The trial judge failed to do that in this case. He accepted at face value the 
  allegations by defence counsel that material or information that was not disclosed 
  was relevant. While there are several examples of this error, two will suffice. 
  </p>
<p>
  [158] The trial judge held that the respondent's Charter rights were violated 
  because Mr. Ramsay did not provide to the defence a copy of a letter he wrote 
  to Detective Inspector MacCharles asking that he appoint an officer to obtain 
  witness statements from certain witnesses. The witness statements obtained as 
  a result of this part of the investigation would be relevant and would have 
  been disclosed. However, Crown counsel's letter was not relevant to any legitimate 
  issue in the defence. Its disclosure would not have assisted the defence in 
  meeting the Crown's case or in advancing the defence case or making any relevant 
  decision. </p>
<p>
  [159] The trial judge also found that the Crown had breached its disclosure 
  obligations because Mr. Findlay failed to disclose that he intended to reinterview 
  a Crown witness, Constable Denis. The trial judge did not explain how the failure 
  to disclose an intention to conduct an interview could be a breach of the Charter 
  of Rights and Freedoms and we can see no basis for such a finding.</p>
<p>
  [160] The trial judge also found Charter violations because of delay in making 
  disclosure. Those findings are not borne out by the evidence. But, even if there 
  was some delay, that did not translate into a Charter violation or entitle the 
  respondent to a remedy. For example, the trial judge found that the failure 
  of the Crown to make prompt disclosure of the deceased's medical records was 
  a violation of the respondent's rights. However, if the defence wanted those 
  third-party records, they had to follow the procedure in R. v. O'Connor, supra. 
  There was no obligation on the Crown to attempt to obtain the records. When 
  the Crown was able to obtain the records, with the consent of the deceased's 
  son, the records were turned over to the defence. In any event, the trial had 
  not commenced when the records were turned over to the defence. The respondent 
  was not hampered in her ability to make full answer and defence.</p>
<p>
  [161] Another common mistake by the trial judge was in failing to critically 
  analyze the defence claims that they were prejudiced by the non-disclosure or 
  delayed disclosure. It is not necessary for the defence to prove prejudice in 
  order to establish a breach of the Charter because of non-disclosure. See R. 
  v. Carosella, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80 at para. 37. However, before an accused is 
  entitled to a remedy such as a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter, 
  the accused &quot;must establish on a balance of probabilities that the failure 
  to produce or disclose what he seeks has impaired his right to make full answer 
  and defence or was so oppressive as to amount to an abuse of process&quot;: 
  R. v. Stinchcombe (No. 2) (1994), 149 A.R. 167 at 174 aff'd [1995] 1 S.C.R. 
  754. </p>
<p>
  [162] Thus, even if the trial judge was entitled to find violations of the disclosure 
  obligations, since those violations had no impact on the respondent's right 
  to a fair trial, they could not have been the basis for any remedy of the kind 
  granted by the trial judge. For example, the trial judge found a Charter violation 
  because of the &quot;failure or refusal&quot; of Crown counsel to disclose that 
  Detective Inspector MacCharles had returned to work and would therefore be available 
  to testify. However, it became clear that defence counsel's position on having 
  MacCharles testify shifted depending on his availability. When it seemed the 
  officer would not be available to testify, his presence was crucial to the defence 
  and would prevent the respondent from having a fair trial. When the officer 
  was available, the defence showed no interest in having him testify.</p>
<p>
  [163] The same thing happened with respect to items that the defence sought 
  for independent testing. When the items, such as a blue condom found on the 
  road near some items associated with the killing, seemed to have been lost or 
  unavailable, the inability of the defence to have them tested &quot;irrevocably 
  prejudiced&quot; the right to make full answer and defence. When the items were 
  eventually located, the defence lost interest and did not seek release of the 
  items for independent testing or respond to a Crown request for consent to have 
  items resubmitted for testing. In those circumstances, the evidence did not 
  support a finding that the defence had been prejudiced at any time.</p>
<p>
  (h) Charter breaches relating to immigration matters</p>
<p>
  [164] The trial judge made several findings of Charter violations based on conduct 
  by immigration authorities or contact between the Crown and immigration authorities. 
  The evidence did not support the various findings and so the impugned conduct 
  could not have been the basis for a stay of proceedings. However, we mention 
  this matter because it was symptomatic of a more serious problem with this trial. 
  At times, the proceedings completely lost their focus as the trial judge permitted 
  defence counsel to delve into areas that had no possible impact on the respondent's 
  right to a fair trial. On occasion, the proceeding seemed to resemble nothing 
  so much as a wide-ranging commission of inquiry into matters that were wholly 
  irrelevant to the criminal trial. </p>
<p>
  [165] The Charter of Rights and Freedoms has introduced additional complexity 
  into our system. Trials can take longer and put greater demands upon the administration 
  of justice. That is the price we must pay for ensuring that accused are dealt 
  with fairly and in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. However, 
  the Charter has not so transformed our system of justice that a criminal trial 
  becomes an excuse for inquiring into all the ills of society. The trial judge 
  should not, for example, have permitted forays into the immigration system, 
  funding for halfway houses, funding for the Centre of Forensic Sciences and 
  the relationship between the Crown and Bell Canada. And, needless to say, the 
  trial judge was in error in finding that the respondent's Charter rights were 
  violated because of perceived misconduct in relation to these extraneous matters.</p>
<p>
  (i) Conclusion on the Charter breaches</p>
<p>
  [166] We conclude this part of our reasons as we began. The evidence does not 
  support most of the findings of Charter breaches by the trial judge. The few 
  Charter breaches that were made out, such as non-disclosure of certain items, 
  were remedied before the trial proper would have commenced had the trial judge 
  not entered the stay of proceedings. The trial judge made numerous legal errors 
  as to the application of the Charter. He made findings of misconduct against 
  Crown counsel and police officers that were unwarranted and unsubstantiated. 
  He misused his powers of contempt and allowed investigations into areas that 
  were extraneous to the real issues in the case.</p>
<p>
  V. The Respondent's Revised s. 11(b) Argument</p>
<p>
  [167] The trial judge ordered that the proceedings against the respondent be 
  stayed for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [168] First, he concluded that the prosecution amounted to an abuse of process, 
  in violation of the respondent's rights under s. 7 of the Charter. In that regard, 
  he found that in the course of the proceedings, various police officers and 
  Crown attorneys were responsible for breaching the respondent's Charter rights 
  on no less than 150 occasions. In the opinion of the trial judge, these breaches 
  were serious. All in all, they lent credence to the defence position that the 
  respondent had been the victim of a one-sided police investigation skewed by 
  tunnel vision and a prosecution tainted by a lack of objectivity. That being 
  so, the trial judge was of the view that the respondent could not possibly receive 
  a fair trial and that the proceedings against her thus constituted an abuse 
  of process, warranting a stay. </p>
<p>
  [169] Second, the trial judge concluded that the respondent's right to be tried 
  within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Charter had been violated. In 
  that regard, he held that by virtue of their misconduct, the police and Crown 
  counsel were responsible for a host of inexcusable delays, as a result of which 
  the respondent was deprived of her right to be tried within a reasonable time 
  period. Accordingly, for that reason as well, the trial judge stayed the proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [170] As we have said, on appeal, the respondent expressly disavows the reasons 
  of the trial judge, both as they relate to his s. 7 abuse of process analysis 
  and his s. 11(b) analysis. She nonetheless seeks to uphold his conclusion on 
  the s. 11(b) issue for reasons that differ dramatically from those advanced 
  by her trial counsel and accepted by the trial judge. </p>
<p>
  [171] In a nutshell, the respondent now concedes that her trial counsel was 
  responsible for most of the delay occasioned after the commencement of her trial 
  in the Superior Court. She seeks, however, to disassociate herself from his 
  conduct and urges us to find her blameless. How does she do that? Quite simply, 
  she maintains that unbeknownst to her, her trial counsel was incompetent and 
  it would thus be unfair to characterize his actions as her actions. To the extent 
  that she may have instructed him to proceed as he did, she should not be held 
  responsible because her instructions were given under the mistaken belief that 
  she was receiving effective legal assistance. Had she known that the motions 
  brought by him were, for the most part, frivolous and vexatious and utterly 
  without merit, she would not have countenanced them; nor would she have acquiesced 
  in the long delays occasioned by these motions at the expense of her right to 
  be tried within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>
  [172] Along these lines, the respondent asks rhetorically how she should have 
  been expected to know that her counsel was incompetent when the trial judge 
  appeared to be endorsing his conduct and Crown counsel did little, if anything, 
  to put an end to it. The following excerpt from pp. 802-803 of the respondent's 
  factum captures the essence of her position: </p>
<p class="indent"> In the case at bar, the record discloses that the Respondent's 
  counsel was woefully uninformed about the state of the law. The record also 
  discloses that the learned trial judge shared many of Mr. Murphy's misapprehensions 
  of law and fact. The incompetence of Mr. Murphy was thus officially endorsed 
  by the Court. Meanwhile, the Crown never sought summary judgement of these unmeritorious 
  motions and, instead, generally argued against the applications with prolix 
  submissions of their own, thus giving the impression that the applications were 
  actually meritorious and deserving of a reply.</p>
<p class="indent">Make no mistake, this case was a three ring circus, with three 
  ringmasters; and the three ringmasters cloaked these bizarre proceedings with 
  the appearance of normality. How could a lay person possibly understand the 
  impact of the proceedings on her s. 11(b) rights in this context? The situation 
  not only suggests a lack of an informed waiver, it suggests an officially induced 
  error of law [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [173] In these circumstances, the respondent maintains that if anyone is to 
  be held accountable for the unreasonable delay occasioned by her counsel's incompetence, 
  it should not be her. Rather, it should be the Crown and the trial judge, each 
  of whom bore the responsibility of preserving and protecting her right to be 
  tried within a reasonable time period. The Crown and the judge, she maintains, 
  were uniquely positioned to recognize and deal with her counsel's incompetence; 
  and yet, neither did anything about it. On the contrary, the trial judge sanctioned 
  it and Crown counsel took an active part in the charade.</p>
<p>
  [174] In sum, the respondent maintains that she was the victim of a system that 
  failed her. But for the ineptness of her counsel, Crown counsel and the trial 
  judge, she would have been tried within a reasonable time. As it is, through 
  no fault of her own, she was deprived of that right. Accordingly, she requests 
  that this court uphold the order of the trial judge staying the proceedings.</p>
<p>
  (a) Analysis</p>
<p>
  [175] Although the respondent raises issues of theoretical interest, we would 
  not give effect to her position. In our view, her argument suffers from two 
  fatal flaws. </p>
<p>
  [176] First, the respondent invites us to consider the record and make a finding 
  of incompetence against her trial counsel based upon the manner in which he 
  conducted the defence. To that end, she points to his unprofessional conduct 
  and his persistent pursuit of motions, now described as frivolous and vexatious, 
  and she submits that on any test, his conduct amounted to incompetence.</p>
<p>
  [177] With respect, we disagree. The respondent's argument rests on the faulty 
  premise that a reprehensible trial strategy necessarily equates with incompetence. 
  That simply is not true.</p>
<p>
  [178] Much as we deplore the tactics employed by trial counsel in this case, 
  they do not necessarily equate with incompetence. On the contrary, they can 
  just as easily be attributed to a trial strategy modelled on the belief that 
  &quot;the best defence is a strong offence&quot;. In view of the strength of 
  the Crown's case, it is certainly conceivable that the respondent and her counsel 
  discussed the matter and formulated a strategy designed to try the police and 
  the victim and avoid a trial on the merits at all costs. To the extent that 
  such a strategy had a downside, it was that the respondent was likely to remain 
  in custody while the proceedings dragged on. That prospect, however, was bearable 
  considering that if the plan failed and she was tried and convicted of second-degree 
  murder, the time spent in pre?trial custody would count toward her parole eligibility. 
  </p>
<p>
  [179] On the plus side, even if the plan was not entirely successful, there 
  was always a chance that it could result in a negotiated plea to a lesser charge. 
  Alternatively, at the very least, it was likely to provide her counsel with 
  ammunition to cross-examine the police and other Crown witnesses before the 
  jury.</p>
<p>
  [180] In concluding, as we have, that the strategy just outlined may realistically 
  have been the strategy adopted by the respondent and her counsel, we have not 
  ignored the fact that such a strategy will normally fail. And so it should. 
  In a word, we consider it to be deplorable. The fact that it succeeded in this 
  case, at least temporarily, ought not to be taken as an indication that it or 
  other like strategies should be pursued in the future. Regrettably, the strategy 
  succeeded here because the trial judge failed in his duty to put a halt to it. 
  Whether his failure stemmed from a misunderstanding of the basic principles 
  that govern the Charter and its application or from his bias toward the Crown 
  or both, we need not finally decide. For present purposes, all that need be 
  said is that we are far from persuaded that the strategy employed by defence 
  counsel necessarily showed that he was incompetent. </p>
<p>
  [181] In turn, that exposes the second flaw in the respondent's argument. In 
  a nutshell, it involves the failure on her part to file any evidence in support 
  of her present position that she was in fact misled by her counsel whom she 
  now claims was incompetent. Apart from her bald, unsubstantiated assertion, 
  there is no reason to think that she was not fully aware of and complicit in 
  a strategy that was designed, if at all possible, to avoid a trial on the merits. 
  Accordingly, her argument cannot succeed.</p>
<p>
  (b) Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [182] There is no basis for finding that the respondent was not fully aware 
  of and complicit in the conduct of her counsel. Accordingly, she cannot succeed 
  in her argument that she should not be held responsible for the delays occasioned 
  by her counsel due to the manner in which he conducted the defence. In short, 
  she has not met her onus of establishing a breach of her rights under s. 11(b) 
  of the Charter. That is the sole basis upon which she seeks to uphold the order 
  below staying the proceedings. Manifestly, that order cannot stand. </p>
<p>VI Disposition</p>
<p>
  [183] In the result, we would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial 
  judge staying the proceedings and order a new trial. The respondent does not 
  seek to uphold the costs order imposed against the Crown. Accordingly, it too 
  is set aside.</p>
