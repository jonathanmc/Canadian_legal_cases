<p>On appeal from the order of Justice A. Panet of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated July 22, 2003.</p>
<p> CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p> [1] This is an appeal from the order of Panet J. of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated July 22, 2003 granting the respondents&#8217; summary judgment 
  motion under rule 20.01(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure on the basis that 
  the appellants&#8217; action was statute barred under s. 269(1) of the National 
  Defence Act, R.S.C. c. N-4 (the &#8220;NDA&#8221;).</p>
<p> [2] The background facts of this dispute are set out in the motions judge&#8217;s 
  decision and need not be repeated in detail here. As relevant to this appeal, 
  the following facts are significant: (i) the appellant Jason Elliott allegedly 
  sustained personal injuries on December 26, 1997 in his home at a Canadian Forces 
  base in Kingston, when stairs he was descending collapsed; (ii) as a result 
  of those injuries, Mr. Elliott applied for pension benefits under s. 21(2) of 
  the Pension Act, R.S.C. 1995 c. P-6. His pension claim was denied on June 18, 
  2002; (iii) Mr. Elliott next appealed the denial of his pension claim to the 
  Entitlement Appeal Division of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, with the 
  assistance of a Pensions Advocate from the Bureau of Pensions Advocates of the 
  Government of Canada; (iv) on October 9, 2002, Mr. Elliott and his wife, Kerri 
  Elliott, commenced this action against the Canadian Forces Housing Agency Kingston, 
  the agency that provided their housing accommodation on the Canadian Forces 
  base, and the Attorney General of Canada, claiming damages for Mr. Elliott&#8217;s 
  injuries based on the respondents&#8217; alleged negligence and breach of the 
  Occupiers Liability Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2; and (v) the respondents moved 
  for summary judgment concerning the appellants&#8217; action on the basis that 
  it was statute barred under s. 269(1) of the NDA because it was not commenced 
  within six months of the act, neglect or default alleged.</p>
<p> [3] The motions judge held that the Crown was entitled to rely on the limitation 
  period defence afforded by s. 269(1) of the NDA, that the appellants&#8217; 
  claim against the respondents fell within the ambit of that statutory provision, 
  and that the six month limitation period applied to bar the appellants&#8217; 
  action. Accordingly, he concluded that there was no genuine issue for trial 
  and granted summary judgment dismissing the action.</p>
<p> [4] Although the appellants mount several attacks on that decision, I need 
  address only one of their grounds of appeal. In responding to the summary judgment 
  motion, the appellants filed an affidavit in which Mr. Elliott swore:</p>
<p class="indent"> I have been told by the Canadian Forces that I was not permitted 
  to bring an action against the military forces as I was entitled to a military 
  pension.</p>
<p class="center"> &#8230;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Given the negative decision of the Veteran Review and Appeal 
  Board [dated June 18, 2002], I became concerned that I would not receive a pension. 
  I therefore retained the services [of a solicitor] on September 27, 2002 and 
  a Statement of Claim was issued on October 9, 2002.</p>
<p class="indent">I can indicate that it was my strong understanding throughout 
  that I was not permitted to commence litigation action against the Canadian 
  Forces. This understanding was provided to me by members of the Canadian Forces 
  and my Pension Advocates [sic] [emphasis added]. </p>
<p> [5] That evidence was not challenged by the respondents, who neither cross-examined 
  Mr. Elliott on his affidavit, nor filed affidavit evidence to the contrary. 
</p>
<p> [6] Although Mr. Elliott&#8217;s affidavit evidence did not identify the exact 
  source and timing of the advice that he allegedly received, and thus was not 
  as fulsome as is desirable on a summary judgment motion, absent challenge of 
  that evidence by the respondents, his uncontradicted sworn evidence established 
  that he understood &#8220;throughout&#8221;, based on advice provided, in part, 
  by his Pensions Advocate, that he was unable to sue the Canadian Forces because 
  he was entitled to a military pension. </p>
<p> [7] Mr. Elliott&#8217;s understanding, and the advice which he claimed to 
  have received, was in error. In fact, he was not precluded from commencing a 
  civil suit because determination of a pension claim was pending. On the record 
  before the motions judge, however, Mr. Elliott was unaware of potential recourse 
  in an action for damages, he had specifically been told both by the Canadian 
  Forces and his Pensions Advocate that it was unavailable, and he understood 
  &#8220;throughout&#8221; that he had no cause of action. No mention of those 
  uncontested facts is made in the reasons of the motions judge.</p>
<p> [8] In those circumstances, there is a genuine issue for trial concerning 
  whether the discoverability principle applies to postpone the commencement of 
  the limitation period under s. 269(1) of the NDA and as to whether Mr. Elliott 
  honestly and reasonably understood, as a result of the advice that he had received 
  from representatives of the respondents, that the appellants had no legal recourse 
  against the respondents in civil proceedings for the injuries that he suffered 
  in December 1997: Clay v. Yassin (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 676 (S.C.J.) and Peixeiro 
  v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549. Although these issues, and their consequences, 
  may ultimately be decided against the appellants, it is not appropriate that 
  they be determined, or that Mr. Elliott&#8217;s unchallenged evidence be weighed, 
  on a summary judgment motion.</p>
<p> [9] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the decision of the 
  motions judge. The appellants are entitled to their costs of this appeal and 
  of the proceedings before the motions judge on a partial indemnity basis, which 
  I would fix in the total amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods 
  and Services Tax.</p>
