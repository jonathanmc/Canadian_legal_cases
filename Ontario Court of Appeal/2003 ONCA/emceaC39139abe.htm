<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In our opinion the motions judge did not err in granting summary judgment. 
  When the appellant asked that the bills be sent to it directly, it was the intention 
  and understanding of the parties that the respondent was entitled to look to 
  the appellant and not the Titan group for payment.</p>    <P>
  [2] The motions judge also did not err in granting summary judgment on the evidence 
  before him. All the relevant evidence was before him. </p>    <P>
  [3] On the issue of costs, while we might have come to a different view with 
  respect to costs there is no basis for us to interfere with the award of costs. 
  </p>    <P>
  [4] The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed in 
  the amount of $3,000, all inclusive.</p>
