<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There are several grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>[2] We do not agree that the trial judge accepted the complainant's evidence 
  because the appellant did not testify and contradict the complainant's version 
  of the relevant events. The trial judge did take into consideration the absence 
  of any evidence contradicting the complainant's version of the crucial events, 
  particularly the conversation with the appellant. He was entitled to take the 
  absence of any evidence to the contrary into consideration in assessing the 
  complainant's evidence.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant next alleges that the trial judge misapprehended the complainant's 
  evidence as to the nature of the representation made by the appellant to induce 
  the complainant to lend the appellant the money. Counsel very carefully took 
  us through several passages of the complainant's evidence. To the extent that 
  those passages address the representation allegedly made to the complainant 
  by the appellant, they confirm the accuracy of the trial judge's recollection 
  of the evidence.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant also alleges a misapprehension of the evidence concerning 
  the repayment of capital on other loans made to the appellant. Even if the trial 
  judge misapprehended this evidence, it could not have affected the verdict. 
  The alleged misstatement by the trial judge was made in the course of his consideration 
  of whether the appellant appreciated that the complainant's economic interest 
  was put at risk by the misrepresentation made by the appellant. As counsel frankly 
  and quite accurately acknowledged on the appeal, if the finding of the misrepresentation 
  stood, it followed inevitably that the complainant suffered economic deprivation 
  as a result. This realization could not have escaped the appellant.</p>
<p>[5] Since we would affirm the conviction on the basis that the trial judge's 
  finding of fraud by misrepresentation cannot be disturbed, we need not deal 
  with the grounds of appeal that relate to the alternative finding by the trial 
  judge of fraud based on omission.</p>
<p>[6] The appellant has abandoned part of his application to adduce fresh evidence. 
  With respect to the one remaining witness whose evidence is tendered by way 
  of fresh evidence, we are satisfied that the appellant has not met the criteria 
  governing the admissibility of fresh evidence on appeal. </p>
<p>[7] The appeal is dismissed. </p>
