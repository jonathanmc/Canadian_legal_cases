<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence regarding certain professional 
  conduct by the plaintiff's trial expert witness, some of which ultimately culminated 
  in his plea of no contest before the Discipline Committee of the College of 
  Physicians and Surgeons to professional misconduct resulting in a six-month 
  suspension from practise. </p>
<p>
  [2] At the time of the trial, the Complaints Committee of the College had dismissed 
  a complaint against the witness and no appeal had yet been taken of that decision. 
  Therefore, nothing different could have been done at the trial of this matter 
  in respect of his testimony. </p>
<p>
  [3] The real issue is that prior to the hearing of the appeal, the doctor pleaded 
  no contest to misconduct by breaching an undertaking he gave to the Ministry 
  of Health in connection with the earlier discipline proceedings. Arguably, this 
  misconduct may have affected the favourable view the trial judge took of the 
  expert's evidence. </p>
<p>
  [4] We do not, however, find it necessary to decide whether to admit the fresh 
  evidence, because we are satisfied that even if the evidence of the expert witness 
  had not been accepted by the trial judge, the other evidence led by the plaintiff, 
  together with the fact that the appellant led no evidence, leads us to conclude 
  that the result on appeal would not be affected. Taking the evidence that the 
  trial judge accepted from the plaintiff herself, from Dr. Rahal and the opinion 
  letter of Dr. Weatherhead, there was evidence of causation, of failure to obtain 
  informed consent of the risk, and of the trial judge's conclusion that the plaintiff 
  would not have taken the risk of what occurred had she been informed. </p>
<p>
  [5] Therefore the finding of liability by the trial judge, although bolstered 
  by the evidence of the expert, was grounded in the record aside from that evidence. 
  As the defence called no evidence, expert or otherwise, to refute the evidence 
  of the plaintiff, it would, in our view, be inappropriate in the circumstances 
  to set aside the findings of the trial judge in this case and to order a new 
  trial. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant also asked this court to find that the trial judge erred in 
  the quantum of damages awarded. We decline to do so. The trial judge took into 
  account the relevant principles of law as to the assessment of damages and the 
  plaintiff's evidence of loss of enjoyment of life. It cannot be said that the 
  award was outside the appropriate range in this regard. </p>
<p>
  [7] We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $17,000 on the 
  partial indemnity scale.</p>
