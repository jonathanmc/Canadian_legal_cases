<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant concedes that the trial judge was entitled to make a finding 
  of duress and to set aside paragraph 5 of the separation agreement as a consequence 
  of that finding. He asks this court to hold, however, that the trial judge erred 
  in law in granting the respondent child support retroactive to March 1, 1992, 
  the date of separation.</p>
<p>[2] We see no error in the trial judge's determination of this matter. The 
  evidence is clear that, in the relevant period, the appellant enjoyed substantial 
  income ($100,000 - $156,000 annual income) and had the ability to pay; the respondent 
  mother struggled financially with a fraction of that income ($20,000 annual 
  income), cashing in her RRSPs in order to pay bills, improve accommodation for 
  the child and herself and to provide for the child's ongoing expenses; and, 
  the child Jason suffered need due to the appellant's lack of financial support. 
  The retroactive order was appropriate in light of these findings and the trial 
  judge's additional finding, which was fully justified on the record, that the 
  appellant completely avoided his child support obligation by re-characterizing 
  his repayment obligation as child support and that the respondent, therefore, 
  bore all costs of maintaining the child. In the circumstances of this case, 
  we are satisfied that there were good reasons for the respondent's delay in 
  bringing the child support proceedings.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant submits that paragraph 12 of the separation agreement cannot 
  stand given the trial judge's order to strike paragraph 5 of that agreement. 
  We reject this submission. The effect of the order is to leave the $100,000 
  repayment obligation in place; paragraph 5 is struck solely for the purpose 
  of making it clear that repayment could not be characterized as child support.</p>
<p>[4] Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge was obliged to set child 
  support based on the appellant's reduced income in 2001. We disagree. The trial 
  judge was entitled to set child support based on the evidence before her, including 
  an assessment of whether the annual income for 2001 provided the fairest determination 
  of income. If the appellant actually received or receives income that is less 
  than the amount used as the basis for calculating child support, he is entitled 
  to take steps to request that the child support obligation be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>[5] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent 
  fixed in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
