<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The motions judge concluded that the order of Lax J. dated July 23, 2003 
  was not an order for the payment of money attracting an automatic stay pending 
  appeal under rule 63.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Her conclusion was 
  based on the decision of Rosenberg J. in Lee v. Lee, [1995] O.J. No. 1196 (Div. 
  Ct.). </p>
<p>[2] With respect to the motions judge, we conclude that Lee v. Lee is distinguishable 
  on two grounds: (1) unlike this case, the holder of the funds in Lee was an 
  independent third party; there was no lis between the holder of the funds and 
  the claimant to the funds; and (2) more importantly, on the record before us, 
  it appears that there may have been a dispute before Lax J. concerning the legitimacy 
  and quantum of the debt alleged to be owing. </p>
<p>[3] In addition, in practical terms, the order of Lax J. required the payment 
  of money by one party to the dispute to the other party to the dispute, through 
  the solicitors of the payee. </p>
<p>[4] For these reasons, we allow the appeal from the order of Gillese J.A. dated 
  July 31, 2003, set aside that order and direct, in its stead, that the order 
  of Lax J. is stayed pending appeal. The costs award of Gillese J.A., in the 
  amount of $2,000, is also set aside. The applicant is entitled to its costs 
  of this appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount of $2,000, 
  inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
