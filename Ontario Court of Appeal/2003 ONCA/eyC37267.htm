<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Joseph F. Kenkel of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated August 28, 2001, and the sentence imposed by Justice 
  Kenkel dated January 30, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] We called on the Crown to respond to the appellant's submission that the 
  trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the complainant, her sister and her 
  mother and, that therefore, he did not fairly assess the credibility and reliability 
  of their testimony. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] In our view, the trial judge was alive to the frailties in the complainant's 
  evidence. In convicting the appellant, the trial judge did not rely on the complainant's 
  evidence alone, but also took into account three pieces of confirmatory evidence: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The evidence of the complainant's sister; </li>
  <li>The actions of the appellant after being confronted with the allegation 
    of sexual abuse; and </li>
  <li>His admissions to the police. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>[3] Moreover, we do not think the trial judge erred in his assessment of the 
  evidence of either the complainant's sister or her mother. The trial judge was 
  aware of the sister's animus towards the appellant. He was nonetheless entitled 
  to discount it, as he did, in his assessment of her credibility and reliability. 
  Moreover, the trial judge did not ignore the sister's outburst in the courtroom 
  but was entitled, as he did, to give it no weight. The trial judge's failure 
  to accurately specify when the mother came to disbelieve her daughter did not 
  undermine his conclusion that the mother's evidence gave little support to the 
  defence. We, therefore, do not give effect to this ground of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] We found no merit in the other grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant. 
  The trial judge did not err in finding that the remainder of the therapist's 
  notes were not likely relevant. The appellant had a copy of the note of the 
  therapist's first meeting with the complainant, a copy of the complainant's 
  first statement to the police and the records of the Children's Aid Society. 
  The affidavit in support of the motion for production of the rest of the therapist's 
  notes did not lay an evidentiary foundation to show that the other notes of 
  the therapist contained information not already available to the defence or 
  had potential impeachment value.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the appellant's after the 
  fact conduct. That conduct was capable of supporting the conclusion drawn by 
  the trial judge that the appellant was attempting &quot;to control the process 
  of disclosure and portray himself as a concerned parent with a troubled daughter 
  who was making false accusations while he was trying to get her help.&quot; 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[6] We are not persuaded that the verdict was unreasonable. The complainant's 
  evidence alone is reasonably capable of supporting the verdict. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] For these reasons the conviction appeal is dismissed. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] We decline to interfere with the sentence of eighteen months in custody. 
  Even if the trial judge erred inprinciple, a custodial sentence for a step?father's 
  repeated acts of sexual abuse of a step?daughter is fit. Accordingly, although 
  leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is also dismissed.<br>
