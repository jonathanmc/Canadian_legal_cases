<p>On appeal from the final order of Justice Lydia M. Olah of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 20, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This appeal raises issues related to the valuation of the parties' assets 
  for the purpose of equalization of net family property and to the husband's 
  entitlement to spousal support. The parties were husband and wife. They were 
  married on November 10, 1989 when they were both in their mid-fifties. Each 
  had been married previously. They separated approximately ten years later, on 
  May 28, 1999. Although they are now divorced and the husband has since remarried, 
  I will nonetheless refer to the parties as husband and wife for the sake of 
  convenience. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] In April 2000, the husband commenced this application under the Divorce 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2nd supp.) and the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3 
  claiming, among other relief, a divorce, spousal support and an equalization 
  of net family properties. The wife, by cross-application, also claimed an equalization 
  of net family properties. A wide range of issues remained outstanding between 
  the parties at the commencement of the trial in April 2001. A number of those 
  issues were resolved during the course of the trial and, by the end of the trial, 
  the only outstanding issues related to the valuation of some of the parties' 
  assets and to spousal support. Among other relief, the trial judge ordered the 
  wife to pay the husband a net family property equalization payment of $62,026.86 
  and a lump sum support payment of $12,000. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The wife appeals from the trial judgment. Her appeal essentially raises 
  the same valuation and spousal support issues that were left for determination 
  by the trial judge at the conclusion of the trial. The issues relate to the 
  following: a) an alleged procedural unfairness arising from the trial judge's 
  requirement at the end of the trial that further evidence be presented; b) the 
  valuation of the husband's two pensions; c) the wife's entitlement to survivor 
  benefits under the husband's pensions; d) the valuation of the wife's interest 
  in her former husband's pension; and e) the husband's entitlement to spousal 
  support. I will deal with each ground of appeal in turn and review the relevant 
  facts in the context of my analysis on each issue. <br>
</p>
<p>1) Procedural fairness<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The principal valuation issues at trial concerned the husband's two pension 
  plans and the wife's survivor benefits under those plans. Two valuation experts 
  were called at trial. The issue of procedural fairness raised by the wife relates 
  to the trial judge's direction to counsel at the conclusion of the trial that 
  she be provided with further expert evidence to assist her in the valuation 
  of the pension assets. Further evidence was provided including actuarial recalculations 
  by the husband's expert based on additional medical evidence of the husband's 
  reduced life expectancy. The trial judge accepted the recalculations which had 
  the effect of substantially changing the values attributed to the various pension 
  assets. The wife takes the position that the trial judge overstepped her proper 
  role in directing the parties to obtain this additional evidence and submits 
  that this court should adjust the valuations to accord solely with the evidence 
  called in the trial proper. The relevant facts relating to this ground of appeal 
  are the following.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] At the time of separation, the husband was 65 years old and his health 
  was very poor. He suffered from coronary artery disease and severe congestive 
  heart failure. His physician, Dr. Newton, testified that statistically, in 1999, 
  he was in a category of patients of which half are not expected to survive six 
  months. His medical condition was essentially the same at the time of trial 
  two years later. Dr. Newton considered the fact that the husband continued to 
  live to be &quot;a miracle&quot;. Not surprisingly, the husband's state of health 
  and consequent reduced life expectancy became relevant in the valuation of the 
  pension assets. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] Prior to trial, both parties initially retained the same actuary, Mr. B.B. 
  Dibben, to provide a valuation of their various pension and survivor benefit 
  interests. At the time of trial, however, Mr. Dibben testified on behalf of 
  the husband, and the wife called her own expert, Mr. G. Edmund Burrows, a chartered 
  accountant. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] During the course of Mr. Dibben's testimony, counsel for the husband questioned 
  the witness on the appropriateness of using the standard mortality tables, which 
  showed a life expectancy of 17.5 years for the husband, given the medical evidence 
  to the contrary. Although Mr. Dibben had been advised of the medical evidence 
  by counsel prior to trial, he testified that he had not made his calculations 
  on that basis as he felt that Dr. Newton's prognosis was so dramatic that any 
  valuation based on that evidence &quot;would be bordering on the speculative.&quot; 
  From an actuarial standpoint, he found it more appropriate to base his calculations 
  on the standard mortality tables because they took into account a large sample 
  of the population, which presumably would include persons such as Mr. Farrar. 
  However, in his report, he added the following comment: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the actuarial assumptions and methods that I selected are appropriate 
  for the purposes of the calculations I have made.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the foregoing, there could be other factors and contingencies 
  that have not been taken into account which could have positive or negative 
  impacts on the values quoted. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">If, for example, the health of either party on the valuation date was impaired 
  to the extent that life expectancy was reduced, it may be appropriate to modify 
  the above values.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] In his testimony, he agreed that, if the husband's reduced life expectancy 
  were to be taken into account, the resulting valuations for the various pension 
  assets would change considerably. The value of the husband's pension assets 
  would be reduced and the value of the wife's survivor benefits would be increased. 
  However, the value of the husband's Scotiabank pension plan would not be affected 
  by the reduced life expectancy as its value was nil in any event. The valuation 
  of that particular asset will be dealt with later in this judgment in relation 
  to another ground of appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] At the conclusion of Mr. Dibben's cross-examination and prior to re-examination, 
  the trial judge asked the witness a number of questions. In particular, she 
  queried him on the possibility of doing an actuarial calculation based on the 
  assumption that there would be a reduced life expectancy. The witness agreed 
  that this could be done if a further medical opinion on Mr. Farrar's life expectancy 
  was obtained from a specialist in medical underwriting. He agreed that he could, 
  if asked by the court, provide a recalculation based on the husband's reduced 
  life expectancy. The trial judge then invited counsel to ask questions arising 
  out of the witness's answers to her questions. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] In re-examination, counsel for the husband asked the witness whether he 
  could do the recalculation overnight. Opposing counsel objected to any recalculation 
  being done at this late stage of the proceedings. In response to the objection, 
  counsel for the husband argued that there would be no prejudice to the wife 
  since her expert, Mr. Burrows, had yet to testify and that he could comment 
  on any new figures resulting from the recalculation. <br>
</p>
<p>[11] The trial judge indicated that she was inclined to allow the husband to 
  reopen his case on this issue and admit the evidence of any recalculation provided 
  that the wife would have the chance to deal with the new evidence. She adjourned 
  the trial briefly to allow counsel to consider the matter further. Upon resuming 
  the hearing, counsel for the husband indicated that her client had instructed 
  her &quot;not to prolong the proceeding and to in effect drop this issue.&quot; 
  Counsel for the wife agreed that the matter should not be pursued. The trial 
  therefore continued without further discussion on this issue. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] The next morning, Mr. Burrows testified for the wife and provided his 
  opinion on the value of the various pension assets. He acknowledged that he 
  used the standard mortality tables in his calculations and that he had not been 
  provided with any medical information with respect to the husband's reduced 
  life expectancy. He agreed in cross-examination that the significant reduction 
  in the husband's life expectancy would substantially affect his calculations. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[13] At the conclusion of the evidence and prior to final submissions, the 
  trial judge revisited the question of the mortality tables. She voiced her concern 
  that, given the evidence from both valuation experts that an individual's particular 
  mortality rate would significantly affect the valuation of the pension assets, 
  she did not have the proper actuarial evidence to enable her to accurately effect 
  the net family property equalization. She indicated that she was not an actuary 
  and that she would require valuations based on the medical evidence relating 
  to the husband's health. She directed that the necessary medical evidence be 
  obtained and provided to both valuators for the purpose of making their recalculations. 
  She asked counsel for their input on the procedure that should be followed. 
  Given that the wife had now moved to British Columbia, the parties agreed that 
  the additional evidence would be subject to written interrogatories and followed 
  by written submissions. Consequently, the trial judge made the following order: 
  <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. Trial completed subject to the Court's direction to both counsel to provide 
  the following evidence which shall be filed as Exhibits to the trial:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) The applicant husband and respondent wife's experts to review the pensions 
  and survivor benefits that they previously valued and provide a fresh capitalized 
  value, based on the application of the appropriate mortality rates as a result 
  of the evidence at trial of the husband's and wife's health. Such valuation 
  reports to be filed with the Court within 7 days of today, namely on or before 
  April 27, 2001 at 4:00 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Written interrogatories to be exchanged and filed on the valuations and 
  mortality rates on or before May 4, 2001 at 4:00 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Written submissions on the values of the pensions and survivor benefits 
  to be made and the net family property figures, on or before May 11, 2001 at 
  4:00 p.m., with a written reply by the applicant husband by May 15, 2001 at 
  4:00 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. Matter to be directed to Barrie for completion of reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Although the wife's state of health had not been raised as an issue at 
  trial, the trial judge, at the suggestion of the wife's counsel, left it open 
  to the wife to submit further information with respect to her own state of health, 
  if so advised. <br>
</p>
<p>[15] As directed, counsel for the husband obtained a letter of opinion as to 
  the husband's life expectancy from a medical underwriter, Dr. Empringham. Dr. 
  Empringham based his opinion on Dr. Newton's evidence at trial. In his view, 
  based on that evidence, it would be reasonable to give the husband a life expectancy 
  of one year from that date. Accordingly, Mr. Dibben provided new calculations 
  that resulted, as expected, in a reduction in the value of the husband's pensions 
  and an increase in the value of the wife's survivor benefits. The calculations 
  provided at trial by Mr. Dibben and his recalculations based on the new evidence 
  are as follows: </p>

<p>[16] Mr. Dibben made the following comment in his report with respect to the 
  recalculations:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I would point out that the above methods are not those 
  which would normally be used in carrying out an actuarial valuation.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">After discussing the situation in this case with an 
  actuarial colleague, however, we concluded that, in view of the very considerably 
  shortened life expectancy, it would be reasonable to apply the above method 
  in these circumstances. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] Mr. Burrows also provided a new report but without any recalculations 
  based on life expectancy. Rather, his report provided calculations in the event 
  that the court adopted the &quot;if and when&quot; approach advocated by the 
  wife in her written submissions. Essentially, under that approach, the pension 
  assets would not be equalized as of the date of separation but, rather, would 
  be subject to division between the parties, if and when the benefits under the 
  various plans came into payment. It is not necessary to describe the approach 
  that was advocated by the wife in further detail as it was not accepted by the 
  trial judge and is not raised as an issue on this appeal. <br>
</p>
<p>[18] In her written submissions, the wife argued that the post-trial evidence 
  should not be admitted. In particular, she submitted that Dr. Empringham was 
  not sufficiently qualified as an expert. She further submitted that the answers 
  to the written interrogatories of both Dr. Empringham and Mr. Dibben had not 
  been provided directly by them but, rather, indirectly by reporting letter from 
  opposing counsel. The trial judge ultimately admitted the additional evidence 
  without reference in her reasons to the concerns raised by counsel for the wife. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[19] The trial judge adopted the recalculations provided by Mr. Dibben in the 
  calculation of the equalization payment. This resulted in the wife owing the 
  husband a net equalization payment of $62,026.86. Had the trial judge accepted 
  the valuations provided by Mr. Dibben at trial without adjustment for the reduced 
  life expectancy, the net equalization payment owing by the wife would have been 
  $8,102.34.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] The wife submits that the trial judge's intervention in the trial process 
  resulted in procedural unfairness. She argues that the onus was on the husband 
  to provide his valuator with the necessary information about his life expectancy 
  before trial and, having failed to do so, the husband should have been bound 
  by the figures that were provided at trial. The wife further submits that the 
  trial judge improperly came to the assistance of the husband, to the prejudice 
  of the wife, when she required that further valuations be produced based on 
  a revised mortality rate. Finally, she argues that she was not given any real 
  opportunity to test the new evidence. The wife does not suggest, however, that 
  the whole process was vitiated as a result of this procedural unfairness. She 
  submits, rather, that the unfairness arose solely from the use of the additional 
  evidence and therefore asks that this court vary the judgment to accord solely 
  with the evidence called on the trial proper. <br>
</p>
<p>[21] I find merit to the wife's argument. While the trial judge's intervention 
  on this issue was legitimate to a degree, it is my respectful view that, in 
  the end result, she overstepped her proper role and usurped the function of 
  counsel. This resulted in unfairness to one of the parties. I come to this conclusion 
  for the following reasons. <br>
</p>
<p>[22] The possible use of actuarial mortality tables to address the husband's 
  reduced life expectancy in the valuation of his pension assets was certainly 
  a relevant issue. Hence it was entirely open to the trial judge to question 
  the expert witness further on this issue, particularly given the comment in 
  his report that it may be appropriate to modify the values attributed to the 
  pension assets if the health of either party on the date of valuation was impaired 
  to the extent that life expectancy was reduced. A trial judge is always entitled 
  to intervene in the trial where there is need for clarification. In seeking 
  such clarification, a trial judge may well obtain evidence from a witness in 
  addition to that brought out by counsel. This is not objectionable so long as 
  counsel are permitted to further examine the witness on the additional evidence. 
  The trial judge followed this procedure when she questioned Mr. Dibben at the 
  end of his testimony. Hence there is nothing objectionable in her intervention 
  up to that point. <br>
</p>
<p>[23] As noted earlier, after questioning Mr. Dibben on the possible recalculation 
  of the valuations based on further medical expert evidence, the trial judge 
  inquired from counsel whether this potential evidence could be made available 
  during the course of the trial. Counsel for the wife strenuously objected to 
  the admission of any additional evidence of this nature so late in the trial 
  process and, in light of this objection, it was the husband's clear position 
  that the matter be &quot;dropped&quot;. At this point, the issue was properly 
  dropped and the balance of the evidence was called as envisaged by both counsel. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[24] However, as noted earlier, the trial judge, on her own motion, revisited 
  the issue at the end of the trial and directed the parties to obtain the additional 
  evidence. It is my respectful view, in all the circumstances, that she erred 
  in doing so. I find the following circumstances particularly noteworthy in arriving 
  at this conclusion:</p>
<li> It was clear at the time the trial judge directed the parties to obtain the 
  further evidence that the additional evidence could only benefit one party, 
  the husband.
<li> The husband was represented by counsel and there was no basis for the trial 
  judge to intervene on his behalf.
<li> If the husband had intended to rely on evidence of this nature, the onus 
  was on him to obtain it prior to trial and to adduce it in evidence at the trial. 
  He chose not to do so. In addition, when the suggestion that further evidence 
  be obtained was put squarely to him during the course of the trial, his position 
  was that the issue should be dropped.
<li> The reliability of the proposed evidence was not beyond controversy. When 
  Mr. Dibben was asked by counsel for the husband prior to trial to provide actuarial 
  calculations based on the medical evidence of her client's reduced life expectancy, 
  he refused to do so on the basis that it would border on the speculative. Further, 
  Mr. Dibben still expressed reservations about the actuarial soundness of the 
  recalculations in his additional report.
<li> The wife had no realistic opportunity to test the additional evidence. The 
  written interrogatories proved unsatisfactory.
<li> The additional evidence had the effect of dramatically changing the valuations 
  of the pension assets. 
  <p>[25] I am not unmindful of, or unsympathetic to, the view expressed by the 
    trial judge at the end of the trial that she needed additional evidence to 
    assist her in making a proper calculation of each party's net family property. 
    Undoubtedly, her request was made in good faith and with a view of achieving 
    a just and correct result. However, in our adversarial system, litigants have 
    the right to have their case submitted to the trial court, as they and their 
    counsel see fit and in accordance with well-established and recognized rules 
    of evidence; the trial judge does not have the right to take the case away 
    from counsel and into his or her own hands. See Boran v. Wenger, [1942] 2 
    D.L.R. 528 (Ont. C.A.) referred to more recently in Lennox v. Arbor Memorial 
    Services Inc. (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 795 (C.A.). It is important that litigants 
    reasonably know the case they have to meet so that they can govern themselves 
    accordingly before they decide to embark upon a trial. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[26] I find the following observation of Evans J.A. in Majcenic v. Natale, 
    [1968] 1 O.R. 189 at 204 particularly helpful on this issue: <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">When a Judge intervenes in the examination or cross-examination 
    of witnesses, to such an extent that he projects himself into the arena, he 
    of necessity, adopts a position which is inimical to the interests of one 
    or other of the litigants. His action, whether conscious or unconscious, no 
    matter how well intentioned or motivated, creates an atmosphere which violates 
    the principle that &quot;justice not only be done, but appear to be done.&quot; 
    Intervention amounting to interference in the conduct of a trial destroys 
    the image of judicial impartiality and deprives the Court of jurisdiction. 
    The right to intervene is one of degree and there cannot be a precise line 
    of demarcation but if it can be fairly said that it amounted to the usurpation 
    of the function of counsel it is not permissible. [Emphasis added.]<br>
  </p>
  <p>[27] In my respectful view, the trial judge's intervention did amount to 
    the usurpation of the function of counsel and was impermissible. Although 
    the trial judge may have considered the evidence presented by counsel as incomplete 
    or imperfect, she was bound to make a determination of the issues on the basis 
    of the evidence before her. This case was not one, for example, where the 
    best interests of a child may be at stake giving rise to different considerations 
    that may allow for the gathering of further evidence at the direction of a 
    trial judge. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[28] The question becomes what remedy is appropriate. As indicated earlier, 
    it is my view that the trial judge did not exceed her proper role during the 
    course of the examination and cross-examination of the witnesses. The line 
    of demarcation was crossed, rather, at the end of the trial when she entered 
    the arena and directed counsel to obtain the additional evidence. I therefore 
    agree with the position of both counsel that a new trial need not be ordered 
    on this ground of appeal. The additional evidence was restricted to a discrete 
    issue in the trial, albeit an important one, and this court has the ability 
    to dispose of the appeal on the basis of the evidence adduced on the trial 
    proper. In addition, it is in the interest of both parties at this point to 
    bring finality to the proceedings. Hence I think the preferable course is 
    for this court to vary the judgment to accord with the evidence adduced at 
    trial. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[29] It is clear that the trial judge accepted the evidence of Mr. Dibben 
    and rejected that presented by Mr. Burrows in the valuation of the pension 
    assets. Her preference for Mr. Dibben's approach is reasonable and amply supported 
    by the evidence. (The next ground of appeal also relates to the experts' differential 
    approach on another issue and the trial judge's acceptance of Mr. Dibben's 
    evidence.) Further, the trial judge's clear preference for Mr. Dibben's approach 
    could not reasonably have been affected by her consideration of the additional 
    evidence. Hence, it is my view that the pension assets in question should 
    be valued in accordance with the calculations presented by Mr. Dibben at trial. 
    While it is arguable, on the basis of his report, that those values could 
    have been adjusted in some way to reflect the reduced life expectancy of the 
    husband, this alternative approach was not canvassed by counsel for the husband 
    during the course of the experts' testimony, nor was it advanced as an alternative 
    argument on appeal. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[30] Consequently, I would give effect to this ground of appeal and vary 
    the judgment with respect to the net equalization payment to accord with the 
    calculations presented by the husband at trial in respect of the relevant 
    assets. Hence, I would reduce the net equalization payment owed to the husband 
    from $62,026.86 to $8,102.34.<br>
  </p>
  <p>2) Valuation of the husband's Scotiabank pension <br>
  </p>
  <p>[31] At the time of separation, the husband was receiving three pensions. 
    Issues were raised at trial and on this appeal with respect to the valuation 
    of his Scotiabank pension and his pension under the Public Service Superannuation 
    Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.419 (the &quot;PSSA pension plan&quot;). The third pension, 
    from IBM, was not significant and was of no concern to the parties. The issue 
    raised with respect to the PSSA pension plan is related solely to the trial 
    judge's acceptance of the revised calculations. Hence this issue has effectively 
    been disposed of. I will now deal with the remaining issue with respect to 
    the Scotiabank pension plan. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[32] The husband retired from Scotiabank in October 1982, several years before 
    the marriage. His pension of $535.00 per month came into pay on December 27, 
    1997, prior to separation. The parties did not agree at trial on the value 
    of this pension. As noted by the trial judge at the commencement of her analysis 
    on this issue at para. 14:<br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">&#133;The debate between the pro-rata and value-added 
    methods, relating to the valuation of pensions in this case resurfaced despite 
    the Supreme Court's ruling in Best v. Best, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 868.<br>
  </p>
  <p>[33] The trial judge reviewed the evidence of both experts. Mr. Burrows, 
    who testified for the wife, described the pension plan as a &quot;deferred 
    annuity&quot; and, as such, gave the opinion that the value-added, rather 
    than the pro rata, method of valuation was appropriate. Reliance was placed 
    on the following statement found in Best v. Best (at para. 58): <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">It is true that the present value calculation used 
    by the value- added method imitates the common method used in valuing other 
    assets such as annuities or bonds. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  [34] Under that approach, two values are calculated - the pension's present 
  value as of the date of separation and its value as of the date of marriage. 
  The latter value is then deducted from the former to arrive at the value representing 
  the pension's growth during the marriage. It is this differential in value that 
  becomes subject to equalization between the parties upon separation. Using this 
  method, Mr. Burrows valued the husband's Scotiabank pension plan for net equalization 
  purposes at $66,593.<br>
  <p>[35] Mr. Dibben disagreed with this approach. He testified that the Scotiabank 
    plan was a defined benefit pension plan and not a deferred annuity. Mr. Dibben 
    relied on the finding in Best v. Best that the pro rata approach was preferred 
    for this type of plan. On this point, the Supreme Court concluded as follows 
    at para. 87: <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">&#133;Generally speaking, however, the pro rata method 
    yields a valuation of a defined benefit pension that is fairer than the valuation 
    produced by the value-added method. Since the Family Law Act's primary goal 
    is a division of assets that is fair to both spouses, I believe that the pro 
    rata method is the preferable method of valuation under Ontario law. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[36] Under the pro rata approach, the net family property value of the pension 
    is also arrived at by calculating the value of the pension at the date of 
    separation and deducting its value at marriage, but the latter calculation 
    is done differently. The value at the date of marriage is calculated by multiplying 
    the present value at the date of separation by a fraction dividing the years 
    of pensionable service prior to marriage by the years of pensionable service 
    prior to separation: see para. 51 in Best v. Best. Mr. Dibben testified that 
    in accordance with that approach, since the husband's pension was entirely 
    earned before marriage, its value at the date of marriage is the same as on 
    the date of separation and hence this asset's value for net equalization purposes 
    was nil.<br>
  </p>
  <p>[37] The trial judge rejected Mr. Burrows' testimony. She found that the 
    plan was indeed a defined benefit pension and that any attempt to describe 
    it as an annuity failed. She found that Mr. Burrows referred to the plan as 
    a deferred annuity in a strained attempt to link up the above-noted comment 
    at para. 58 in Best v. Best to this case. Accordingly, the trial judge concluded 
    that the approach followed by Mr. Dibben prevailed. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[38] On appeal, the wife argues that the trial judge erred in failing to 
    recognize that the facts in this case are sufficiently different from those 
    in Best v. Best to justify a departure from the pro rata valuation approach. 
    She relies mainly on the following distinctions: first, the husband's pension 
    in this case was earned entirely before the marriage, and secondly, it was 
    in pay before the date of separation. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[39] In my view, neither distinction would justify a departure from the preferred 
    approach adopted in Best v. Best. Indeed, on the first point, the Supreme 
    Court specifically addressed the situation where the employee spouse's pension 
    would be entirely earned before the marriage as exemplifying a major weakness 
    in the value-added method as compared to the favoured pro rata approach. Major 
    J., in writing for the majority, stated as follows (at paras. 70-71): <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">70 This is highlighted by an example. Suppose the 
    appellant had actually terminated his employment on the date of marriage, 
    and that, at that time, he had 20 years of service and the average of his 
    five best-paid salaries was (hypothetically) $60,000. Under the benefit formula, 
    he would have earned an annual pension benefit of $24,000 (2 percent x 20 
    x $60,000). Twelve years later, at the date of separation, since he had quit 
    his job and not accumulated any more years of service or reached a higher 
    salary level, his annualized pension benefit would still be $24,000. (The 
    effect of pre-retirement indexing is ignored for purposes of simplicity.) 
    Common sense would suggest that, since the interest in the pension has not 
    changed over the course of the marriage, none of it should be considered &quot;net 
    family property&quot; for equalization purposes.</p> 
  <p class="indent"> 71 Under the value-added method, however, the actuary 
    would calculate (a) the lump sum that, if invested in risk-free assets on 
    the date of separation, would produce an annual income of $24,000 at retirement. 
    Assume the applicable discount rate and actuarial assumptions yielded a present 
    value at separation of $100,000. Then the actuary would determine (b) the 
    lump sum that, if invested in risk-free assets on the date of marriage, would 
    produce the same stream of income ($24,000 annually) beginning on the date 
    of retirement. Discounting $100,000 over the 12-year marriage period at a 
    3 percent interest rate yields a present value on the date of marriage of 
    $70,138. Under the value-added method, the difference between the values of 
    (a) and (b) - in the example, $100,000 minus $70,138, i.e. $29,862 - will 
    be considered &quot;net family property&quot;. This is so even though the 
    annualized benefit to be paid - which is a defined benefit pension's only 
    meaningful value - did not change at all after the marriage. The result is 
    that the employee spouse (here, the appellant) must equalize a growth in assets 
    that did not actually take place. I do not see any equity in that result. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[40] Hence, it is clear that the Supreme Court of Canada viewed the pro rata 
    approach as the better approach even in a situation where the pension would 
    have been completely earned before the marriage. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[41] The wife's second basis for distinguishing Best v. Best is the fact 
    that the pension was in pay at the time of separation. It is difficult to 
    understand from the evidence, or from the argument, why this fact would justify 
    a departure from the principle in Best v. Best. Mr. Burrows was not specifically 
    asked for his opinion on the matter although he did allude to the fact that 
    the pension was in pay in his application of the value-added approach. It 
    would appear from his testimony that, in applying this method, he attributed 
    a higher value to the pension at the time of separation than at the time of 
    marriage in part because it was in pay at the later date. On this point, the 
    husband argues that, if this approach were adopted, a lesser value should 
    be attributed to the pension at the time of separation, given his reduced 
    life expectancy. Mr. Dibben was specifically asked whether the fact that the 
    pension was in pay would be a consideration. He answered that it might be 
    a relevant consideration with respect to the valuation of any capital fund, 
    such as a bank account. For example, if the pension payments received by the 
    husband prior to separation had been put in a bank account, he queried whether 
    the value of that account should not also be excluded since it was generated 
    from a pension that was entirely earned before marriage. However, such an 
    issue does not arise in this case. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[42] In my view, the trial judge was correct in finding that there was no 
    basis to depart from the principle in Best v. Best. I would not give effect 
    to this ground of appeal.<br>
  </p>
  <p>[43] The wife advances an alternative argument in the event that the pro 
    rata approach is to be adopted with respect to the Scotiabank pension. She 
    submits that a similar reasoning should be adopted in respect of her own interest 
    in her ex-husband's pension. Since her interest in that asset entirely pre-dated 
    the marriage, she submits that the value attributed to that asset should also 
    be nil for equalization purposes. Therefore, I will deal with the valuation 
    of that asset next.<br>
  </p>
  <p>3) Valuation of the wife's interest in her former husband's pension<br>
  </p>
  <p>[44] The wife entered into a separation agreement dated July 4, 1986 with 
    her former husband. By the terms of this agreement, the wife became entitled 
    to an interest in her former husband's pension with York University. The agreement 
    provided that she was entitled to &quot;one half of the husband's pension 
    as at December 31, 1984, as well as accrued interest on that portion of the 
    pension from August 31, 1986&quot; until she received payment of the pension. 
    York University was directed to hold the wife's share in trust and to pay 
    to her the amount to which she was entitled in accordance with the terms of 
    the pension plan, without any further authorization by the employee spouse. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[45] In valuing this asset, Mr. Burrows adopted a value-added approach. He 
    determined the amount of money the wife would have received from her former 
    husband's pension if it had been paid at the date of separation from Mr. Farrar 
    and he deducted from that amount the amount that she would have received if 
    it had been paid at the date of marriage. The differential in value, after 
    making a deduction for taxes, was $94,574.00. Mr Burrows testified that whether 
    the York University plan was a defined contribution or defined benefit plan 
    did not affect the valuation of that asset. It was a simple matter of obtaining 
    the account balance from York University in respect to each relevant date 
    and calculating the growth in value over the time of marriage. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[46] Mr. Dibben was not asked to value this asset but he was asked to comment 
    on Mr. Burrows' approach. He testified that the York University plan was a 
    hybrid plan that had both defined benefit and defined contribution elements 
    to it. Under that plan, the pension that becomes payable is the greater of 
    a) the pension defined by formula under a defined benefit arrangement and 
    b) the pension that can be generated by an account balance together with investment 
    earnings credited to each member. He indicated that in practice, largely because 
    of the favourable investment earnings, it is the account balance that gives 
    the higher value. Because of these factors, Mr. Dibben took no issue with 
    the approach adopted by Mr. Burrows and the resulting valuation. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[47] The trial judge accepted the $94,574 value for equalization purposes. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[48] The wife argues that, while the valuation of this asset at $94,574 may 
    have been sound from an actuarial standpoint, it led to an inequitable result 
    in this case given the approach adopted in respect of the husband's interest 
    in the Scotiabank pension plan. She submits that both assets, each having 
    been earned entirely before the marriage, should have been valued at nil. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[49] It is my view that the wife's position is not tenable. The fact that 
    ownership of, or entitlement to, an asset pre-dates the marriage, of course, 
    provides no basis for its exclusion from the calculation of net family property. 
    Hence that common factor between the two assets cannot be determinative of 
    the valuation issue. It is clear from the analysis in Best v. Best that the 
    choice of the preferred method of valuation is a legal question, not an actuarial 
    one. The choice should be based on a consideration of the nature of the asset 
    in question and it should be made with a view to achieving its fair apportionment. 
    In this case, it is clear from both experts' testimony that the wife's interest 
    in her former husband's pension is different in nature from the husband's 
    interest in his Scotiabank defined benefit pension plan. As noted in Best 
    v. Best in the excerpt reproduced earlier, the inequity that would result 
    from the adoption of the value-added method, in respect of a defined benefit 
    pension plan that is entirely earned before the marriage, is that &quot;the 
    employee spouse &#133; [would have to] equalize a growth in assets that did 
    not actually take place&quot; (at para. 71). However, the evidence is clear 
    in respect of the wife's interest in her former husband's pension that the 
    value of the asset in fact grew over the period of her marriage to the respondent. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[50] In any event, it is my view that it is not open to the wife to question 
    the valuation of this asset for the first time on appeal. The record is clear 
    that both parties and their respective valuation experts agreed that the value 
    of the wife's interest in her former husband's pension plan should be valued 
    at $94,574 for equalization purposes. I would therefore not give effect to 
    this ground of appeal.<br>
  </p>
  <p>4) The wife's entitlement to survivor benefits under the Scotiabank plan 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[51] An issue was raised at trial and on appeal as to whether the wife was 
    eligible to receive survivor benefits under the Scotiabank plan in the event 
    of the husband's death. The evidence at trial was clear that the husband had 
    assigned the survivor benefits to the wife. However, the issue was raised 
    whether the assignment survived the divorce of the parties and the subsequent 
    remarriage of the husband. The issue is one that depends both on the applicable 
    legislation and the provisions of the plan. In this respect, the parties noted 
    the provisions of s. 25(4) of the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 R.S.C. 
    1985, c.32 (2nd Supp.). It reads as follows:<br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">25. (4) Notwithstanding anything in this section or 
    in provincial property law, a member or former member of a pension plan may 
    assign all or part of that person's pension benefit, pension benefit credit 
    or other benefit under the plan to that person's spouse, former spouse, common-law 
    partner or former common-law partner, effective as of divorce, annulment, 
    separation, or breakdown of the common-law partnership, as the case may be, 
    and in the event of such an assignment the assignee shall, in respect of the 
    assigned portion of the pension benefit, pension benefit credit or other benefit, 
    be deemed for the purpose of this Act, except subsections 21(2) to (6),<br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent10">(a) to have been a member of that pension plan, and<br>
    (b) to have ceased to be a member of that pension plan as of the effective 
    date of the assignment,<br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">but a subsequent spouse or common-law partner of the 
    assignee is not entitled to any pension benefit, pension benefit credit or 
    other benefit under the pension plan in respect of that assigned portion.<br>
  </p>
  <p>[52] Conflicting and incomplete evidence was given at trial with respect 
    to the terms of the Scotiabank pension plan. Each party presented opposing 
    arguments on this issue. In the result, having found both arguments compelling, 
    the trial judge included the value of the survivor pension in the calculation 
    of the net equalization payment on the assumption that the wife would be entitled 
    to receive this benefit. However, she provided the wife with a charge against 
    the husband's estate in an amount equal to the differential in equalization 
    payment in the event that she was not so entitled. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[53] The husband sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal in the form 
    of a letter from a pension analyst for Scotiabank confirming the wife's entitlement 
    to survivor benefits under the terms of the plan. The wife objected to the 
    admission of this letter because it was not in proper form. Absent consent 
    of the parties, it is my view that the fresh evidence should not be admitted 
    in the form in which it was presented. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[54] Nonetheless, in my view, the trial judge did not err in including the 
    valuation of this benefit in the net family property based on the legislative 
    provision and the evidentiary record before her relating to the particular 
    terms of the plan. Further, the wife is fully protected by the charging order 
    in the event that she does not become entitled to the benefits. I would therefore 
    not give effect to this ground of appeal. <br>
  </p>
  <p>5) Spousal support<br>
  </p>
  <p>[55] The husband's claim for spousal support is related to the period of 
    time between the date of separation in May 1999 and the wife's retirement 
    in June 2000. In the year that followed the separation, the husband lived 
    in a one-bedroom basement apartment with his new partner. He was 65 years 
    old and his income, entirely derived from pension benefits from Scotiabank, 
    PPSA and IBM, was approximately $37,000 annually. At the time of separation, 
    the wife was 63 years old and still working as a teaching instructor at Seneca 
    College. Her annual income from all sources was approximately $74,000. After 
    the separation, she decided to take early retirement and retired at the end 
    of June 2000. Her income was substantially reduced after retirement. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[56] The trial judge ordered lump sum support in favour of the husband in 
    the amount of $12,000. Her reasons on this issue were brief. She stated as 
    follows at paras. 54-55: <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">The husband argued that he was entitled to spousal 
    support, it being a 10-year marriage. Further, Bernice Farrar's income was 
    greater than his, certainly for six months prior to separation, when his sole 
    source of income was his pension income. Despite the fact that the husband 
    initiated no motion for interim support, he was in need and Bernice Farrar 
    had the ability to pay, to her date of retirement. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">Accordingly, the respondent wife shall pay the applicant 
    husband lump sum spousal support in the amount of $12,000, non-taxable or 
    deductible.<br>
  </p>
  <p>[57] The wife appeals from the award of spousal support. She submits that 
    the trial judge erred in failing to consider all relevant factors and principles 
    with respect to spousal support. In particular, she submits that there was 
    no evidence to support the trial judge's finding that the husband was in need. 
    Rather, the husband's claim for support was advanced solely on the basis of 
    the differential in income between the two parties during the first year after 
    separation. She further submits that the husband failed to make full disclosure 
    with respect to his present spouse's financial circumstances. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[58] In response, the husband disputes the allegation of non-disclosure. 
    Further, he submits that despite the brief reasons for judgment, this court 
    should defer to the trial judge's finding. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[59] I do not find it necessary to deal with the question of non-disclosure. 
    In my view, the record supports the wife's position on the lack of a proper 
    evidentiary basis for the lump sum award. The record shows that the only evidence 
    relied on by the husband to base his claim for support was the differential 
    in the income of the parties during the year following separation. When asked 
    in his testimony on what basis he was claiming support, the husband expressly 
    stated that is was &quot;[b]ased on the total discrepancy of income between 
    the two of us. Her income at that point, in that period of time was approximately 
    double mine.&quot; He advanced no other ground for his claim in his evidence. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[60] In my view, the differential in income alone did not provide a basis 
    for awarding spousal support. I would give effect to this ground of appeal 
    and set aside the award of $12,000. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Disposition and costs<br>
  </p>
  <p>[61] I would allow the appeal and vary the judgment in respect of the net 
    equalization payment and spousal support award to accord with these reasons. 
    Hence, I would vary paragraph 2 of the judgment by reducing the amount of 
    the net equalization payment from $62,026.86 to $8,102.34. I would likewise 
    vary paragraph 3 to reflect the different amount owed by way of net equalization 
    payment; nothing in this judgment affects the amount owed by the husband to 
    the wife by way or reimbursement. I would delete paragraph 4 in respect of 
    the spousal support. I would confirm the balance of the judgment. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[62] Because of the husband's success at trial, the trial judge awarded him 
    costs of the trial, fixed at $25,000. However, she recognized that the husband's 
    success was due in large part to the additional evidence on the valuation 
    of the pension assets. In light of his failure to present this evidence at 
    trial, the trial judge reduced the award to just over $11,000. <br>
  </p>
  <p>[63] In light of the result on appeal, I would set aside the award for trial 
    costs and make no order in its place. I would award the wife her costs of 
    the appeal in the amount of $15,000. </p>
