<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Silia S. Seppi of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 18, 2001.</p>    <P>
  BY THE COURT:</p>    <P>
  [1] The issue in this appeal (as it was in the application below) is whether 
  the letter agreement of February 18, 1999 can be said to remove the tenant's 
  renewal right in the original lease.</p>    <P>
  [2] In our view it does not do so. We disagree with the conclusion of the application 
  judge and would allow the appeal.</p>    <P>
  [3] The letter agreement does not refer to the renewal clause let alone expressly 
  set it aside. However, the respondent says that the sentence &quot;the tenant 
  in good faith has agreed to negotiate a five year net lease for the premises&quot; 
  in the letter agreement carries that necessary implication because it must mean 
  a five year lease starting April 1, 2000, which is the very period that would 
  be covered by a renewal.</p>    <P>
  [4] We do not agree.</p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant says this sentence refers to a lease to commence April 1, 
  2005. This makes commercial sense given that the good faith negotiating obligation 
  would give the respondent leverage to negotiate favourable terms over an additional 
  five years at a time when it was seeking to sell the property.</p>    <P>
  [6] This interpretation of the letter agreement leaves in place the renewal 
  clause in the original lease. Indeed the evidence on the application shows that 
  the tenant's understanding was consistent with this interpretation as were his 
  actions. The evidence that for some months after the purported renewal the landlord 
  took no steps suggesting the contrary is equally consistent with this interpretation. 
  Moreover, the respondent put no evidence before the application judge to support 
  the alternative interpretation it now puts forward.</p>    <P>
  [7] At the very least the disputed sentence in the letter agreement is ambiguous. 
  Having been drafted by the respondent the doctrine of contra proferentum can 
  properly be applied.</p>    <P>
  [8] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order below and grant 
  the declaration sought.</p>    <P>
  [9] We cannot leave this matter without noting that the application judge gave 
  absolutely no reasons for reaching her conclusion. This is less than the parties, 
  the public, and this court are entitled to expect.</p>    <P>
  [10] Costs of the application to the appellant fixed in the amount of $5,500 
  plus G.S.T. Costs of the appeal to the appellant fixed in the amount of $5,000 
  plus G.S.T.</p>    <P>
  Released: April 22, 2003 &quot;JWM&quot;</p>
