<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raised numerous grounds of appeal against conviction and 
  sentence. In response, Crown counsel grouped the grounds respecting the conviction 
  appeal into three categories. </p>
<p>
  CONVICTION</p>
<p>
  [2] The first ground relates to the duration of the trial. The appellant represented 
  himself at the trial. He says that the trial was originally scheduled for ten 
  days but was reduced to five days. He says that he was prejudiced because he 
  had intended to call 15 jail guards but only called two because of the limited 
  time available, and that the trial judge drew inferences about his opportunity 
  to make phone calls from the fact that not all of the people who guarded him 
  over the entire relevant period were called.</p>
<p>
  [3] A review of the transcript of the opening of the trial discloses that the 
  trial judge specifically checked on the time that had been originally set for 
  the trial and confirmed her understanding that it was five days. She further 
  offered to re-attend at the end of August if the appellant required more time 
  to present his defence at the end of the scheduled period. At the end of the 
  evidence portion of the trial, the appellant confirmed that only three of his 
  witnesses had not testified and that it appeared that they were not going to 
  show up. The matter was put over to the following week for submissions. It is 
  clear that the appellant was not precluded from calling any relevant evidence 
  or witnesses by the time scheduled for the trial and that the trial judge made 
  every effort to accommodate him.</p>
<p>
  [4] The second ground relates to the sufficiency of the evidence and the trial 
  judge's findings based on the evidence. We agree with the Crown that the trial 
  judge was extremely thorough in considering all of the evidence and in making 
  her findings. In several cases she agreed with the appellant that the evidence 
  did not support a finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and dismissed those 
  counts as a result. The trial judge was entitled to find that the complainant 
  feared for her safety. We are satisfied that the trial judge drew reasonable 
  inferences from the evidence and that there is no basis for interfering with 
  her findings.</p>
<p>
  [5] Many of the appellant's grounds relate to matters which arose on previous 
  charges which were not before the trial judge and are not before this court 
  on the appeal. The appellant also complains about an allegedly unlawful arrest 
  in respect of which the charges were withdrawn and are not before the court.</p>
<p>
  [6] Crown counsel brought to the court's attention an error made by the trial 
  judge with respect to count 9, breach of probation. The trial judge held that 
  the appellant was in breach of a term of his probation not to call the complainant 
  when he called her from prison, where he remained on other charges when his 
  probation period would otherwise have commenced. Because probation does not 
  commence until the person is released from prison (s. 732.2(1)(b)), his probation 
  period had not commenced at the time of the charge and the conviction is in 
  error. </p>
<p>
  [7] The conviction for count 9 will therefore be quashed. In all other respects, 
  the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  SENTENCE</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant objected that the Crown had changed its requested sentence 
  from two years one month before the trial, to five years following conviction. 
  In support, he filed a pretrial screening form which contained the Crown's position 
  on sentence if a guilty plea were entered prior to a date for trial or a preliminary 
  hearing being set. This offer did not bind the Crown following a trial.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant had counsel assist him at the sentence. Counsel proposed a 
  sentence of two years after credit of 12 months for pretrial custody of five 
  months, part of which was served in difficult conditions during the OPSEU strike. 
  The Crown asked for a sentence of 50 months after credit of 10 months for the 
  pretrial custody. </p>
<p>
  [10] In imposing sentence, the trial judge was particularly concerned that the 
  appellant did not appear to understand the impact of his actions on the complainant 
  and on other persons. The trial judge was concerned about the repetitive nature 
  of the appellant's offences in the face of court orders, and noted the need 
  to provide some peace for the complainant. The trial judge concluded that an 
  appropriate sentence was 33 months. She then reduced that by the pretrial custody, 
  using only a one for one basis, because the appellant continued to make the 
  harassing calls from prison during that period. The appellant was therefore 
  required to serve a further 28 months.</p>
<p>
  [11] In our view the trial judge made no error in her determination of the appropriate 
  sentence and there is no basis to interfere with it.</p>
<p>
  [12] The only issue remaining is whether the removal of the conviction for the 
  breach of probation count should result in a reduction of the sentence. It is 
  clear that the trial judge imposed a global sentence of 28 months for all of 
  the conduct, which she made concurrent on each count. In our view, in all the 
  circumstances of these offences, there is no basis to reduce this global sentence.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appeal against sentence is therefore dismissed.</p>
