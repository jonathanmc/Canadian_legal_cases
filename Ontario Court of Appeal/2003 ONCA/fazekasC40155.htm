<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Duty counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of appeal against conviction:</p>
<p>[2] The appellant submits that the conviction for uttering a death threat was 
  unreasonable. We disagree.</p>
<p>[3] Both the trial judge and the summary conviction appeal court judge grappled 
  with the differences in wording to which the three witnesses testified. In our 
  view, they correctly concluded that despite these differences the import was 
  the same: each witness was consistent in describing words that conveyed a threat 
  to kill a Crown Attorney. The conviction therefore was not unreasonable. </p>
<p>[4] Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to apply the 
  correct test for the mens rea for uttering a threat set out by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in R. v. Clemente. We do not accept this submission. </p>
<p>[5] The trial judge found that the appellant had considerable animosity for 
  the police and that the witnesses took his threat seriously. From these findings 
  we can reasonably infer that the trial judge concluded the threat was intended 
  to be taken seriously. </p>
<p>[6] Finally, the appellant submits that in the light of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada&#146;s decision in R. v. Lohnes the conviction for causing a disturbance 
  cannot be supported. Again, we disagree. </p>
<p>[7] The appellants&#146; yelling and shouting took place throughout the day 
  and were so significant that they caused the Crown to close her case and the 
  court reporter to leave the courtroom. The conviction for this offence was reasonable. 
</p>
<p>[8] For these brief reasons the conviction appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>[9] Although we think that the sentence for threatening was at the high end 
  of the range we are not persuaded that it was demonstrably unfit. Accordingly, 
  although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
