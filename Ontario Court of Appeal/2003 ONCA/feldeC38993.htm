<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Katherine E. Swinton of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated September 26, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Dr. G. Castillo, is a medical doctor. On January 6, 1997, 
  he performed cosmetic surgery on the lower right eyelid of the respondent, Judith 
  Felde. The surgery involved the removal of a small white deposit under Ms. Felde's 
  right eye.</p>
<p>
  [2] Post-operatively, complications arose. After consulting with four other 
  specialists, Ms. Felde returned to Dr. Castillo and on June 26, 1997, he performed 
  revisionary surgery to remove some cysts that had developed under her right 
  eye. More complications arose following that surgery and after consulting with 
  a number of specialists, Ms. Felde underwent further revisionary surgery on 
  November 18, 1998. This time, the surgery was performed by Dr. Oestreicher, 
  one of the leading experts in the field. In addition to the revisionary surgery, 
  Dr. Oestreicher performed cosmetic surgery on Ms. Felde's upper eyelids. Following 
  that surgery, complications arose once again. In the end, Dr. Oestreicher was 
  required to perform two more revisionary operations on Ms. Felde, one in late 
  November 1998, the other in October 1999.</p>
<p>
  [3] In June 1998, Ms. Felde issued a claim against Dr. Castillo and others. 
  With respect to Dr. Castillo, she sought damages for negligence as follows - 
  one, that he fell below the requisite standard of care in his post-operative 
  care of Ms. Felde and two, that he failed in his duty to disclose to Ms. Felde 
  the material risks associated with the initial surgery.</p>
<p>
  [4] At the time of the initial surgery in January 1997, Ms. Felde was 52 years 
  old and single. She was in the final stages of a two-year sabbatical that she 
  had taken after retiring in January 1995 from her lengthy employment as a flight 
  attendant with Air Canada. It was her plan, in 1997, to enrol in a retraining 
  program and then commence a new part-time career selling cosmetics. Financially, 
  Ms. Felde was not well?off. Her only sources of income were a small pension 
  from Air Canada and her Registered Retirement Savings Plan.</p>
<p>
  [5] Ms. Felde's medical history was relatively uneventful. It did, however, 
  reveal four prior procedures between 1967 and 1996, three of which were cosmetic. 
  None, however, reached the magnitude or risk level of the surgery performed 
  by Dr. Castillo in January 1997.</p>
<p>
  [6] The only other evidence of significance relates to Ms. Felde's apprehension 
  of Dr. Castillo and the procedures he followed. Specifically, she testified 
  that on the day of the surgery, when she met Dr. Castillo for the first time, 
  she felt uneasy about a number of things. These included the type of clothing 
  that he and his assisting physicians were wearing, the nature of the operating 
  room and the gruff manner in which she was treated by the anaesthetist. In short, 
  Ms. Felde felt uncomfortable about the situation and it was only after the anaesthetist 
  asked her, in an impatient tone, whether she &quot;wanted the operation or not&quot; 
  that she agreed to proceed. </p>
<p> [7] The trial judge dismissed Ms. Felde's claim in negligence against Dr. 
  Castillo insofar as it alleged improper post-operative care. She allowed the 
  claim, however, on the basis of an absence of informed consent to the surgery 
  as a result of Dr. Castillo's failure to warn Ms. Felde of the material risks 
  associated with the surgery. Dr. Castillo challenges that finding on appeal, 
  but only insofar as it relates to the issue of causation, not his failure to 
  advise Ms. Felde of the material risks. Specifically, he submits that the trial 
  judge's conclusion on the issue of the absence of informed consent is suspect 
  because she applied the wrong test with respect to causation. Expressed differently, 
  Dr. Castillo submits that had the trial judge applied the correct test, the 
  result would not necessarily have been the same. Accordingly, he seeks a new 
  trial.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [8] Although the case is a close one, in the end, I would not interfere with 
  the result. The trial judge gave detailed reasons for judgment. On two occasions, 
  she properly stated the test to be applied when negligence, resulting from a 
  lack of informed consent, is alleged. The first of those statements is found 
  at pp. 14 and 15: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Liability in negligence for the breach of the duty of disclosure arises only 
  if the breach of the duty is found to have caused damage to the patient. In 
  determining the test for causation, Laskin C.J.C. adopted a modified objective 
  test in Reibl v. Hughes [[1980] 2 S.C.R. 880] (at 898-9). The question that 
  must be determined is whether the reasonable person in the patient's position 
  would have consented to the operation, had the duty of disclosure been met.</p>
<p>
  [9] The second correct statement is found at p. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The question here is whether an average, prudent person in the plaintiff's circumstances 
  would have consented to this procedure, if the material risks had been disclosed.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant acknowledges that in those two instances, the trial judge 
  accurately stated the test. He maintains, however, that elsewhere in her reasons, 
  she misstated the test and that in arriving at her conclusion, she applied the 
  wrong test.</p>
<p>[11] Commencing with the misstatement of the test, the appellant points to 
  the following excerpt at p. 25 of the reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The remaining issue is whether the lack of informed consent actually caused 
  her injury. The test for causation set out in Reibl v. Hughes requires the trier 
  of fact to determine &quot;whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position 
  would have declined surgery at the particular time&quot; (at 928) [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [12] In support of his position that the trial judge applied that test in arriving 
  at her conclusion, the appellant points to the following two passages at pp. 
  25 and 28 of her reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> Nevertheless, the fact that Ms. Felde agreed to these procedures 
  does not lead me to conclude that she was the type of person who would have 
  consented to a blepharoplasty on January 6, 1997, had she been properly informed 
  of material risks. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, a reasonable person in her situation, presented 
  with a full discussion of the material risks associated with blepharoplasty, 
  would not have proceeded with the operation that day with Dr. Castillo. A reasonable 
  person would, in my view, have asked for time to consider whether to proceed 
  with the operation. There was no rush to proceed that day, and there was reason 
  for uneasiness in the setting - for example, where the surgeon does not wear 
  full hospital greens while operating, and where the whole lead-up to the operation 
  seems rushed. I find that a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances, 
  properly informed, would not have proceeded on January 6 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [13] Returning to the test with which the appellant takes issue, namely - whether 
  a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would have declined surgery 
  at the particular time - the appellant submits that if the trial judge, in defining 
  the test that way, was purporting to state that the timing of the surgical procedure 
  will, in all cases, be a material consideration on the issue of causation, she 
  was in error. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [14] Timing of the surgical procedure may or may not be a significant factor 
  with respect to the issue of causation. Whether it is or not will depend on 
  the particular circumstances of the case. Thus, as the appellant points out, 
  on the facts in Reibl v. Hughes, supra, the timing of the surgery was central 
  to the issue of causation because the plaintiff maintained that had he been 
  informed of the material risks associated with the surgery, he would have postponed 
  the operation for a period of about 18 months in order to solidify his financial 
  position. That explains why Laskin C.J. laid stress on the timing of the surgery 
  in his analysis of the causation issue. As the Chief Justice pointed out at 
  p. 928: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Relevant in this case to the issue whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff's 
  position would have declined surgery at the particular time is the fact that 
  he was within about one and one-half years of earning pension benefits if he 
  continued at his job; that there was no neurological deficit then apparent; 
  that there was no immediate emergency making the surgery imperative; that there 
  was a grave risk of a stroke or worse during or as a result of the operation, 
  while the risk of a stroke without it was in the future, with no precise time 
  fixed or which could be fixed except as a guess of three or more years ahead. 
  Since, on the trial judge's finding, the plaintiff was under the mistaken impression, 
  as a result of the defendant's breach of the duty of disclosure, that the surgery 
  would relieve his continuing headaches, this would in the opinion of a reasonable 
  person in the plaintiff's position, also weigh against submitting to the surgery 
  at the particular time [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [15] Returning to the causation issue in the case at hand, while I do not believe 
  that the timing of the surgery reaches the same critical level as it did in 
  Reibl v. Hughes, I am nonetheless satisfied that it was a factor the trial judge 
  could take into account in determining whether a reasonable person, in Ms. Felde's 
  position, would have refused the surgery had Dr. Castillo made her aware of 
  the material risks. By that, I am not referring to a postponement of the surgery 
  to enable Ms. Felde to find a doctor in whom she reposed more confidence and 
  with whom she was as likely as not to proceed with the surgery regardless of 
  the risks. Rather, I have in mind a postponement of some considerable length 
  to enable Ms. Felde to stabilize her life and obtain a level of economic self-sufficiency 
  that would better equip her to cope with the type of complications that could 
  arise from the initial surgery.</p>
<p>
  [16] Having considered the reasons of the trial judge, in the last analysis, 
  I am satisfied that she had the second of these scenarios in mind in arriving 
  at her ultimate conclusion. At pp. 27 and 28 of her reasons, after rejecting 
  the notion that Ms. Felde was someone &quot;who was committed to changing her 
  appearance regardless of risks&quot;, the trial judge continued as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances 
  would have had concerns about proceeding with the surgery, had the risks of 
  ectropion, lid retraction, and the possibility of further revisionary surgery 
  been disclosed. Ms. Felde was then 57 years old, single, and about to start 
  a new career as a cosmetics advisor, after taking a two year sabbatical following 
  her retirement with Air Canada. She does not have much money, and had been living 
  on a combination of pension and RRSP's.</p>
<p class="indent">The small mass or lump below her eyelid was a minor cosmetic 
  problem that she did not need to have addressed at that time - or ever. While 
  a satisfactory operation might have improved her appearance and made her look 
  younger, there was a risk of about 15% that she would have eyelid problems and 
  a 10% chance that she would need revisionary surgery within the year. Each time, 
  the operation would cause swelling and bruising and, therefore, disruption to 
  her life. There was also the risk, which had been disclosed by Dr. Castillo, 
  that she would be dissatisfied with the results, because the surgeon would have 
  to determine how much skin, fat and muscle he could remove and the patient might 
  want more removed than he thought appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">The benefits from the surgery, then, might be an improved appearance 
  if all went well. However, what Ms. Felde sought to correct was not a major 
  problem; rather, it was a minor blemish. Weighed against that possible benefit 
  were the risks of dissatisfaction with the aesthetic result and complications 
  with her eyelids, as well as the possibility of revisionary surgery, with attendant 
  disruption to her life and pain.</p>
<p>
  [17] Had the trial judge stopped there, I would not have hesitated to dismiss 
  the appeal. It is the next paragraph, however, that causes concern and leads 
  me to question whether the trial judge may have gone astray in her causation 
  analysis. The passage in question has already been transcribed at para. 12 above. 
  For convenience, it is repeated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, a reasonable person in her situation, presented with a full discussion 
  of the material risks associated with blepharoplasty, would not have proceeded 
  with the operation that day with Dr. Castillo. A reasonable person would, in 
  my view, have asked for time to consider whether to proceed with the operation. 
  There was no rush to proceed that day, and there was reason for uneasiness in 
  the setting - for example, where the surgeon does not wear full hospital greens 
  while operating, and where the whole lead-up to the operation seems rushed. 
  I find that a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances, properly informed, 
  would not have proceeded on January 6.</p>
<p>
  [18] That passage leaves me with a concern that in addressing the issue of causation, 
  the trial judge may have focussed her analysis on the particular day (January 
  6, 1997) and the particular doctor (Dr. Castillo), rather than considering it 
  from the point of view of what Ms. Felde would have done had she been told of 
  the risks and taken some time to consider whether she wished to proceed with 
  the surgery or not. In other words, having posed the legitimate question as 
  to what Ms. Felde would have done had she been made aware of the risks and reflected 
  upon them, the trial judge did not provide a direct answer to the critical question, 
  namely, whether a reasonable person, in Ms. Felde's position, would have declined 
  the surgery. </p>
<p>
  [19] That said, when the reasons for judgment are read fairly as a whole, I 
  think it is apparent, from the findings made by the trial judge at pp. 27 and 
  28 (reproduced at para. 16 above), that the answer to the critical question 
  would necessarily have been &quot;yes&quot;. In other words, had a reasonable 
  person in Ms. Felde's position been informed of the risks, she would have declined 
  surgery, if not altogether, at least for a considerable period of time in order 
  to stabilize her life and obtain a level of economic self-sufficiency that would 
  better equip her to cope with the potential complications of surgery. </p>
<p>
  [20] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $15,000.00 
  inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>

<p>
  Signed: &quot;M. Moldaver J.A."<br>
  "I agree J.C. MacPherson J.A.&quot;</p>


<p>
  BORINS J.A. (Concurring): </p>
<p>
  [21] I have read the reasons of my colleague, Moldaver J.A., and while I agree 
  that this appeal must be dismissed, I differ substantially from him in how I 
  reach that outcome. Although I appreciate that restraint should be exercised 
  before concurring reasons are written, I find it necessary to write brief reasons 
  to explain the grounds on which I believe the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [22] Reading the trial judge's reasons for judgment in their entirety, I am 
  satisfied that she understood the modified objective test for causation adopted 
  by Laskin C.J. in Reibl v. Hughes, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880 at 898?900, and properly 
  applied it to the facts that she found. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [23] The only issue presented by this appeal, and, indeed, the only significant 
  issue at trial, is whether Dr. Castillo's failure to adequately explain the 
  risks of the surgery caused the damages sustained by Ms. Felde. In her causation 
  analysis the trial judge was required to determine whether Ms. Felde would have 
  opted for the surgery had she been fully and adequately informed of its risks. 
  This involved the weighing of the underlying facts that related to Ms. Felde's 
  unique personal circumstances. The trial judge was then required to apply to 
  the facts the legal standard, which she described as &quot;whether the reasonable 
  person in the patient's position would have consented to the operation, had 
  the duty of disclosure been met&quot;. Applying the legal standard, as her ultimate 
  finding of fact she found that Dr. Castillo had caused Ms. Felde's damages.</p>
<p>
  [24] Whether one characterizes the product of the trial judge's causation analysis 
  as a finding of fact or the determination of a question of mixed fact and law, 
  her carefully considered reasons for judgment disclose neither a palpable and 
  overriding error nor an error in law. In applying this standard of review, I 
  have been guided by the following statement of Weiler J.A. in John E. Dodge 
  Holdings Inc. v. 805062 Ontario Ltd. (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 304 at 306 (Ont. C.A.); 
  leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, 2003 S.C.C.A. No. 145: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The standard of review of a judge's factual findings and inferences drawn from 
  the facts is palpable and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaison (2002), 211 
  D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.). Questions of mixed fact and law involving the application 
  of a legal standard to a set of facts and [sic] are generally also subject to 
  a standard of palpable and overriding error. If, however, it is clear that the 
  trial judge made some extricable error in principle with respect to the characterization 
  of the standard or its application, the error may amount to an error of law, 
  and a standard of correctness will apply.</p>
<p>
  [25] The Supreme Court of Canada revisited the modified objective test developed 
  in Reibl in Smith v. Arndt, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539. The test was thoroughly and 
  carefully discussed on behalf of the majority by Cory J. and in concurring reasons 
  by McLachlin J. There are several passages from their reasons for judgment that 
  are instructive.</p>
<p>
  [26] After setting out Laskin C.J.'s lengthy discussion of the rationale for 
  a modified objective test in Reibl at pp. 898?900, Cory J. went on to comment 
  at p. 547: </p>
<p class="indent">
  These words are as persuasive today as they were when they were written. The 
  test enunciated relies on a combination of objective and subjective factors 
  in order to determine whether the failure to disclose actually caused the harm 
  of which the plaintiff complains. It requires that the court consider what the 
  reasonable patient in the circumstances of the plaintiff would have done if 
  faced with the same situation. The trier of fact must take into consideration 
  any &quot;particular concerns&quot; of the patient and any &quot;special considerations 
  affecting the particular patient&quot; in determining whether the patient would 
  have refused treatment if given all the information about the possible risks 
  [emphasis in the original].</p>
<p>
  [27] Cory J. continued at pp. 549?50: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Some of the criticisms directed at the Reibl test may stem from confusion as 
  to what Laskin C.J. intended in his adoption of a modified objective test. The 
  uncertainty surrounds the basic premise that the test depends upon the actions 
  of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's circumstances. Which aspects of the 
  plaintiff's personal circumstances should be attributed to the reasonable person? 
  There is no doubt that objectively ascertainable circumstances, such as a plaintiff's 
  age, income, marital status, and other factors, should be taken into consideration. 
  However, Laskin C.J. did not stop there. He went on and stated that &quot;special 
  considerations&quot; affecting the particular patient should be considered, 
  as should any &quot;specific questions&quot; asked of the physician by the patient. 
  In my view this means that the &quot;reasonable person&quot; who sets the standard 
  for the objective test must be taken to possess the patient's reasonable beliefs, 
  fears, desires and expectations. Further, the patient's expectations and concerns 
  will usually be revealed by the questions posed. Certainly, they will indicate 
  the specific concerns of the particular patient at the time consent was given 
  to a proposed course of treatment. The questions, by revealing the patient's 
  concerns, will provide an indication of the patient's state of mind, which can 
  be relevant in considering and applying the modified objective test [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [28] In her concurring reasons, McLachlin J. explained the modified objective 
  test at pp. 573?74: </p>
<p class="indent"> Having rejected both a purely subjective and a purely objective 
  approach, Laskin C.J. crafted a test that fell between the two, the &quot;modified 
  objective&quot; test. While approaching the issue of what the patient would 
  have done objectively, the judge should take into account &quot;special considerations 
  affecting the particular patient&quot; (p. 898). This would, in his view, avoid 
  the problem of leaving the matter of causation entirely in the surgeon's hands: 
  &quot;The patient's particular situation and the degree to which the risks of 
  surgery or no surgery are balanced would reduce the force, on an objective appraisal, 
  of the surgeon's recommendation&quot; (p. 899). At the same time, consideration 
  of all factors that might have &quot;reasonably&quot; affected the decision 
  avoids exclusive reliance on the plaintiff's assertion at trial.</p>
<p class="indent">While &quot;the patient's particular concerns&quot; at the time 
  should be considered (pp. 899-900) (for example, the judge might consider specific 
  questions which the patient may have asked, evincing specific concerns (p. 899)), 
  they must be &quot;reasonably based&quot; to avoid excessive subjectivity. Thus 
  &quot;fears which are not related to the [undisclosed] material risks would 
  not be causative factors&quot;. Summing up, Laskin C.J. stated (at p. 900): 
</p>
<p class="indent"> In short, although account must be taken of a patient's particular 
  position, a position which will vary with the patient, it must be objectively 
  assessed in terms of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="indent">There is little profit in debating whether the test Laskin C.J. 
  had in mind should be labelled objective or subjective. Suffice it to say it 
  contains elements of both the subjective and objective and has been read in 
  different ways. Two assertions can, however, be ventured. First, the Court was 
  concerned to ensure that the plaintiff's particular concerns and circumstances 
  be considered. To hold otherwise would be to virtually place the outcome of 
  the causation inquiry in the hands of the physician. Second, the Court was concerned 
  to ensure that the plaintiff's subjective assertion of what she would have done 
  had she been properly advised be tested &quot;in terms of reasonableness&quot;. 
  To hold otherwise would give undue weight to the plaintiff's hindsight assertion 
  that she would have acted in a way that supports her claim for damages. The 
  approach suggested above -- that causation is a question of fact for the trial 
  judge to determine on all the evidence including the plaintiff's assertion at 
  trial examined in the light of her circumstances, mind-set and the medical advice 
  she would have received at the time -- satisfies both these concerns [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [29] In my view, it is significant that both Reibl and Arndt recognize that 
  &quot;special considerations affecting the particular patient&quot; may play 
  a significant role in the causation analysis. Indeed, in Reibl, as pointed out 
  by Laskin C.J., the relatively short time in which Mr. Reibl's pension would 
  vest constituted a special consideration that properly led the court to conclude 
  that had Mr. Reibl been adequately informed of the risks of the surgery, he 
  would not have opted for it at the time that it was performed. As I will explain, 
  in this case the trial judge recognized that there were special circumstances 
  unique to Ms. Felde that led her to conclude that had Ms. Felde been adequately 
  informed of the risks of surgery, &quot;a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances 
  would not have proceeded on January 6&quot;. In conducting her analysis and 
  in applying the test, it is apparent that the trial judge recognized the similarity 
  between the facts of this case and those of Reibl. She applied the analysis 
  employed by Laskin C.J. in Reibl. As well, she adopted the language that he 
  used in finding as a fact that Dr. Castillo caused Ms. Felde's damages.</p>
<p>
  [30] Throughout her reasons for judgment, the trial judge made a number of findings 
  of fact relevant to her causation analysis. She found that Ms. Felde had retired 
  on January 1, 1995 with a small pension from Air Canada, on which she had lived 
  for two years together with drawing from her RRSPs while she took a sabbatical. 
  She had planned to start a new career selling cosmetics part?time at the end 
  of her sabbatical, which coincided with the time of the surgery. As a result 
  of the complications from the surgery, she was unable to start her new career 
  thereby sustaining damages in the form of lost income.</p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge also found that Ms. Felde was &quot;a nervous person&quot; 
  and that she was nervous on the day of the surgery. She also found that Ms. 
  Felde came across &quot;as somewhat unsure of herself, deferential and wanting 
  to please&quot;. In addition, the trial judge found that Ms. Felde was neither 
  aggressive nor combative. These characteristics led the trial judge to conclude 
  that Ms. Felde was &quot;uncertain&quot; about her decision to proceed with 
  the surgery.</p>
<p>
  [32] In para. 103 the trial judge, who had earlier discussed the test of causation 
  adopted in Reibl and affirmed in Arndt, quoted from Reibl at p. 928 and stated 
  that the test required that she determine &quot;whether a reasonable person 
  in the plaintiff's position would have declined surgery at the particular time&quot;. 
  In the next paragraph the trial judge noted: </p>

  Ms. Felde testified that she would not have gone ahead with surgery that day, 
  had she known of the risks of eyelid problems and the possible need for revisionary 
  surgery, since the blemish was too minor.</p>
<p>
  It was the manifestation of the risks of which Ms. Felde had not been informed 
  that prevented her from earning the income that she had planned on earning in 
  her new career at the conclusion of her sabbatical.</p>
<p>
  [33] The trial judge's principal factual findings are in paras. 112?117 of her 
  reasons for judgment. I find it helpful to reproduce these findings so that 
  they can be considered contextually: </p>
<p class="indent"> [112] The question here is whether an average, prudent person 
  in the plaintiff's circumstances would have consented to this procedure, if 
  the material risks had been disclosed. Ms. Felde was not a sophisticated consumer 
  of cosmetic surgery. She had had a patch of skin removed in 1967, electrolysis 
  to remove some unwanted hair, and laser treatments to repair a resulting scar 
  in 1997. Otherwise, her surgical treatments (removal of a cyst on the eyelid 
  and a hysterectomy) were for medical reasons. This does not suggest a person 
  who was committed to changing her appearance regardless of risks. Although it 
  is clear that she cares about how she looks, a blepharoplasty is cosmetic surgery 
  at a different level of magnitude and risk from the cosmetic procedures that 
  she had had before.</p>
<p class="indent">[113] In my view, a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances 
  would have had concerns about proceeding with the surgery, had the risks of 
  ectropion, lid retraction, and the possibility of further revisionary surgery 
  been disclosed. Ms. Felde was then 52 years old, single, and about to start 
  a new career as a cosmetics advisor, after taking a two year sabbatical following 
  her retirement with Air Canada. She does not have much money, and had been living 
  on a combination of pension and RRSP's. </p>
<p class="indent">[114] The small mass or lump below her eyelid was a minor cosmetic 
  problem that she did not need to have addressed at that time - or ever. While 
  a satisfactory operation might have improved her appearance and made her look 
  younger, there was a risk of about 15% that she would have eyelid problems and 
  a 10% chance that she would need revisionary surgery within the year. Each time, 
  the operation would cause swelling and bruising and, therefore, disruption to 
  her life. There was also the risk, which had been disclosed by Dr. Castillo, 
  that she would be dissatisfied with the results, because the surgeon would have 
  to determine how much skin, fat and muscle he could remove and the patient might 
  want more removed than he thought appropriate. </p>
<p class="indent">[115] The benefits from the surgery, then, might be an improved 
  appearance if all went well. However, what Ms. Felde sought to correct was not 
  a major problem; rather, it was a minor blemish. Weighed against that possible 
  benefit were the risks of dissatisfaction with the aesthetic result and complications 
  with her eyelids, as well as the possibility of revisionary surgery, with attendant 
  disruption to her life and pain. </p>
<p class="indent">[116] In my view, a reasonable person in her situation, presented 
  with a full discussion of the material risks associated with blepharoplasty, 
  would not have proceeded with the operation that day with Dr. Castillo. A reasonable 
  person would, in my view, have asked for time to consider whether to proceed 
  with the operation. There was no rush to proceed that day, and there was reason 
  for uneasiness in the setting - for example, where the surgeon does not wear 
  full hospital greens while operating, and where the whole lead-up to the operation 
  seems rushed. I find that a reasonable person in Ms. Felde's circumstances, 
  properly informed, would not have proceeded on January 6.</p>
<p class="indent">[117] However, Ms. Felde did have the operation that day, and 
  she experienced well-known complications that are material risks of the surgery 
  - lid retraction, scleral show and the need for revisionary surgery - which 
  were not properly disclosed. Therefore, I find that Dr. Castillo is liable to 
  her for damages caused by the breach of his duty of disclosure on January 6, 
  1997 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [34] From a contextual examination of the trial judge's causation analysis, 
  it is clear that her principal finding of fact is in para. 113 where she pointed 
  out the negative effect on Ms. Felde's financial situation should the undisclosed 
  risks of the surgery occur. Reading the trial judge's reasons in their entirety, 
  it is apparent that she equated Ms. Felde's financial situation to that of Mr. 
  Reibl. Just as Laskin C.J. did in Reibl, she believed that Ms. Felde's financial 
  situation, and her intended career change, fell into the category of &quot;special 
  circumstances&quot;. In the result, in concluding her causation analysis she 
  took into account Ms. Felde's financial situation as it existed on the day of 
  the surgery in finding that Dr. Castillo caused Ms Felde's damages. Indeed, 
  in articulating her finding, the trial judge adopted the language of Laskin 
  C.J. in Reibl. In finding that Dr. Castillo caused Ms. Felde's damages, I am 
  satisfied that she understood and correctly applied the modified objective test 
  to the circumstances of this case and that she attached proper weight to the 
  subjective aspect of the test.</p>
<p>
  [35] In summary, I am satisfied that the trial judge understood and properly 
  applied the modified objective test in concluding that Dr. Castillo caused Ms. 
  Felde's damages. As in Reibl, she identified &quot;special circumstances&quot; 
  unique to Ms. Felde's situation and applied the test in the context of those 
  circumstances in her reference to the date of the surgery. Just as the timing 
  of the surgery in Reibl was significant to Mr. Reibl because of the potential 
  impact of the risks of the surgery on his financial circumstances, the timing 
  of the surgery was also significant in view of Ms. Felde's financial situation. 
  Had she been adequately informed of the risks, she would have opted against 
  the surgery rather than undergoing it at the particular time.</p>
<p>
  [36] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs as proposed by Moldaver 
  J.A.</p>

  appellant concedes that had the trial judge applied the correct test, she could 
  have found negligence on the basis of a lack of informed consent. Accordingly, 
  he does not press for a dismissal of the claim.</p>
