<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Eugene G. Ewaschuk of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated October 3, 2000, and the 
  sentence imposed by Justice Ewaschuk dated October 6, 2000.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises three grounds of appeal in connection with the portion 
  of the trial judge's charge to the jury relating to aggravated assault and the 
  accused's defence of self defence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge failed to link the evidence 
  of the prior assaults on the appellant to the appellant's apprehension of death 
  or grievous bodily harm. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge told the jury that they were entitled to assess the reasonableness 
  of the accused's apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm and belief in 
  light of his prior experience with the complainant. In his review of the evidence 
  the trial judge also reviewed the two prior occasions where the complainant 
  assaulted the appellant. In his recharge to the jury the trial judge told the 
  jury that with respect to apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, there 
  was both a subjective and objective component and that the subjective component 
  related to the accused's belief. In our opinion the trial judge's charge to 
  the jury sufficiently linked the evidence of the prior assaults on the appellant 
  to the accused's apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm.</p>
<p>
  [4] In connection with the issue of grievous bodily harm, the appellant also 
  complains that the trial judge failed to define grievous bodily harm. The trial 
  judge referred to &quot;grievous&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; bodily harm throughout 
  his charge. The first ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The second ground of appeal is that the trial judge did not charge the jury 
  on the availability of s. 37 of the Code. We agree with the submission in the 
  respondent's factum that section 37 could not have helped the appellant because 
  it permits only the use of proportional force and would have undermined the 
  defence put forward under section 34(2). Defence counsel did not ask the trial 
  judge to charge on section 37 and there was no objection to the charge on this 
  basis.</p>
<p>
  [6] The final ground of appeal is whether the trial judge erred in his instructions 
  on the burden of proof. We disagree that the trial judge made remarks throughout 
  the charge which could only diminish the burden of proof. The trial judge's 
  charge stressed the burden of proof upon the Crown, and he related it to the 
  essential elements of each offence and to the defence of self-defence. Nothing 
  in the charge diluted the burden of proof, especially when the charge is read 
  as a whole.</p>
<p>
  [7] We also disagree that in his charge the trial judge improperly collapsed 
  the three parts of R. v. W(D) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) into two parts, 
  thereby eliminating the middle part, that if the jury rejected the accused's 
  evidence but had a reasonable doubt about it they must acquit the accused. In 
  our opinion the trial judge's charge read as a whole does not take away the 
  middle ground and the jury would have understood the proper burden of proof. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>
