<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Hugh R. McLean, of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated June 20, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The central issue in this appeal is whether it is open to a sentencing judge 
  to take into account pre-sentence custody in determining whether the sentence 
  to be imposed falls within the range of sentences that engages the conditional 
  sentencing regime. The respondent Lynn Fice pled guilty to aggravated assault, 
  fraud over $5,000, personation, forgery, and breach of recognizance. At the 
  time of her sentencing, Ms. Fice had spent approximately 16 months in pre-sentence 
  custody. Treating this time as equivalent to almost three years imprisonment, 
  the sentencing judge determined that a global sentence of 14 additional months 
  would be appropriate. The sentencing judge then determined that, in the circumstances 
  of the case, the sentence should be served conditionally. The Crown appeals 
  on the grounds that the sentencing judge erred in principle in determining that 
  it was open to him to impose a conditional sentence, or alternatively, that 
  he erred in finding that a conditional sentence was appropriate in the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] In June 2000, Ms. Fice used the name of her mother, Barbara Taylor, to obtain 
  a lease of an automobile without Ms. Taylor's knowledge or permission, forging 
  her mother's signature on the lease application. She also used her mother's 
  bank account in order to pay for the lease. Later, when Ms. Fice had an accident 
  involving the car, she identified herself to the investigating officer as Barbara 
  Taylor. Ms. Taylor only learned about her daughter's activities when she received 
  a phone call from her insurance broker on August 10, 2000. The next day, while 
  the two women were in Ms. Taylor's bedroom, Ms. Fice swung a baseball bat, striking 
  her mother on the back of the head. Further strikes with the bat followed, and 
  a struggle ensued, in the course of which Ms. Fice grabbed a telephone cord 
  and tried to wrap it around her mother's neck. Ms. Taylor eventually convinced 
  her daughter to stop, and Ms. Fice ultimately called 9-1-1 and told the operator 
  that she had hit her mother with the baseball bat. With the help of the operator, 
  Ms. Fice administered first aid. Medical personnel who subsequently arrived 
  on the scene assessed Ms. Taylor's wounds as life-threatening.</p>
<p>
  [3] Ms. Fice was arrested at the scene. She provided a videotaped statement, 
  in which she admitted striking her mother several times with the baseball bat, 
  but she claimed it had been an accident. She was initially denied bail, but 
  was later released into the custody of the Elizabeth Fry Society after a bail 
  review in September 2001. On October 22, 2001, Ms. Fice pled guilty to aggravated 
  assault, fraud over $5,000, personation and forgery. The proceedings were adjourned 
  pending completion of a psychiatric assessment. In March 2002, Ms. Fice was 
  rearrested and returned to custody for breaching a condition of her release 
  by failing to comply with house rules relating to keeping medication. The proceedings 
  continued before the sentencing judge over the course of several days in June 
  2002, during which Ms. Fice renewed her guilty pleas, and also pled guilty to 
  the count of breach of recognizance. Two experts in forensic psychiatry, one 
  for the Crown and one for the defence, were called to testify as to Ms. Fice's 
  mental condition. In particular, they were asked to give opinions on Ms. Fice's 
  mental state at the time of the aggravated assault and on the likelihood that 
  she would re-offend.</p>
<p>
  [4] By this time approximately 22 months had passed since Ms. Fice's arrest, 
  of which she had spent a total of 16 in custody: 13 months until her release 
  on bail under the supervision of the Elizabeth Fry Society, and 3 additional 
  months since her re-arrest. Counsel for the Crown proposed that an appropriate 
  sentence on the assault charge would be a further 3 to 5 years in the penitentiary, 
  arguing that the assault was a brutal attack that warranted denunciation. Because 
  in the Crown's submission the matter clearly merited a penitentiary disposition, 
  counsel argued that it was not open to the sentencing judge to impose a conditional 
  sentence, even if, by virtue of the pre-sentence custody, the resulting sentence 
  would be less than two years. Counsel argued alternatively that a conditional 
  sentence was inappropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [5] Defence counsel, on the other hand, took the position that pre-sentence 
  custody could be taken into account in determining whether a conditional sentence 
  was available. Although he conceded that a penitentiary sentence would have 
  been appropriate if imposed at the time of Ms. Fice's arrest, counsel submitted 
  that the sentencing judge must consider the pre-sentence time served, and that 
  it was open to the judge to conclude that an appropriate sentence as of the 
  date of sentencing would be a sentence of less than two years. If the judge 
  so concluded, it was then open to the judge to consider a conditional sentence. 
  Counsel submitted that the assault was an unplanned, spontaneous, out-of-character 
  act prompted by pent-up feelings of anger toward Ms. Taylor arising from historical 
  wrongs. He argued that the time spent in pre-sentence custody was ample for 
  the purposes of general deterrence. He sought a sentence on the assault count 
  of time served, or alternatively, a conditional sentence. He also submitted 
  that Ms. Fice's time under the supervision of the Elizabeth Fry Society was 
  akin to house arrest, and that she should receive one-for-one credit for those 
  six months in addition to credit for the pre-sentence custody.</p>
<p>
  [6] In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge did not address the Crown's 
  argument that it was not open to him to as a matter of law to impose a conditional 
  sentence. Considering Ms. Fice's pre-sentence custody to be the equivalent of 
  almost three years, he determined that a sentence of one year on the aggravated 
  assault was appropriate. He also concluded that Ms. Fice should serve two further 
  months on the breach of recognizance count, and six months concurrently on each 
  of the other counts. The sentencing judge then went on to consider whether this 
  sentence might be conditionally served. After noting the circumstances of the 
  case, including Ms. Fice's remorse, her plea of guilty and the psychiatric evidence 
  indicating that she was not a danger to the public generally, the sentencing 
  judge determined that the test for a conditional sentence had been met. He imposed 
  a sentence of 14 months to be served in the community on certain conditions, 
  including limitations on the circumstances under which Ms. Fice would be permitted 
  to leave her residence and a prohibition on contact with Ms. Taylor. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [7] Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code sets out the criteria that must be met 
  before a conditional sentence may be imposed: </p>
<p class="indent"> 742.1 Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an 
  offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court</p>
<p class="indent">(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, 
  and </p>
<p class="indent">(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community 
  would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with 
  the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 
  to 718.2,</p>
<p class="indent">the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's 
  behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the 
  community, subject to the offender's complying with the conditions of a conditional 
  sentence order made under section 742.3. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [8] Section 719(3) is the relevant provision of the Criminal Code dealing with 
  pre-sentence custody. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, 
  a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result 
  of the offence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [9] The question that arises is whether a sentencing judge may take pre-sentence 
  custody into account under s. 719(3) in determining whether the sentence to 
  be imposed is one &quot;of imprisonment of less than two years&quot; within 
  the meaning of s. 742.1(a). Crown counsel fairly acknowledged at the hearing 
  that, on a plain reading of the two provisions, this approach appears to be 
  open to the sentencing court. The Crown takes the position, however, that such 
  an interpretation runs contrary to the principles set out in R. v. Proulx (2000), 
  140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) and violates the intent of the legislation. </p>
<p>
  [10] In Proulx, the Supreme Court of Canada outlined the principles governing 
  the application of the conditional sentencing regime. The Court rejected the 
  interpretation that s. 742.1 prescribes a rigid two-step process, in which a 
  sentencing judge must first impose a term of imprisonment of fixed duration 
  before considering the possibility of a conditional sentence. Such an approach, 
  the court concluded, gave rise to an inherent contradiction because the duration 
  of a sentence cannot be determined separately from the determination of its 
  venue. In arriving at a fixed period of imprisonment as an appropriate sentence 
  at the first step, the sentencing judge would have had to consider the purpose 
  and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. It might then be difficult 
  for the judge to reconcile a conditional sentence of an equivalent duration 
  with those same principles under s. 742.1(b), since a conditional sentence is 
  generally more lenient than a jail term of the same length. Hence this approach 
  could lead to unfit sentences. </p>
<p>
  [11] To avoid these difficulties, the Court adopted a different approach. The 
  sentencing judge should first determine which range of sentence would be appropriate: 
  a period of probationary measures, imprisonment for less than two years, or 
  imprisonment for two years or more, i.e. a penitentiary term. If the judge concludes 
  that the second category is the most appropriate, he or she may then consider 
  whether the sentence may be served conditionally. Lamer C.J.C. described this 
  process in the following terms at para. 58: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, the requirement that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment 
  of less than two years can be fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the 
  appropriate range of available sentences. Thus, the approach I suggest still 
  requires the judge to proceed in two stages. However, the judge need not impose 
  a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration at the first stage of the analysis. 
  Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a) 
  probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term. If either of these sentences 
  is appropriate, then a conditional sentence should not be imposed.</p>
<p>
  [12] Counsel for the Crown argues that, in following this analysis, it is not 
  open to a sentencing judge to take pre-sentence custody into account at the 
  first stage of the process. To permit a sentencing judge to take pre-sentence 
  custody into account in determining the appropriate range could lead to a situation 
  that in the Crown's submission is absurd: an offender who, absent pre?sentence 
  custody, would normally receive a sentence in the penitentiary range, and therefore 
  would not be able to serve any portion of it conditionally, could receive a 
  conditional sentence simply due to the passage of time spent in pre-sentence 
  custody. Counsel for the Crown argues that such a result would be inconsistent 
  with the intention of Parliament that the conditional sentencing regime apply 
  only to a certain category of offenders who commit less serious offences that 
  call for a term of imprisonment of less than two years. He submits further that 
  the absence of any reference to s. 719(3) in s. 742.1 indicates Parliament's 
  intention to exclude pre-sentence custody from the consideration of the availability 
  of a conditional sentence. </p>
<p>
  [13] Effectively, the Crown's position is that the proper approach is for a 
  sentencing judge first to determine the appropriate range of sentence for the 
  offence, without regard to pre-sentence custody. If the appropriate range is 
  a penitentiary term, then a conditional sentence is not available, and the pre-sentence 
  custody may only serve to reduce the duration of the custodial sentence. In 
  this case, the sentencing judge was clearly of the view that a penitentiary 
  sentence was warranted on the aggravated assault count. Hence the Crown argues 
  that he should have concluded that a conditional sentence was not available. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] The Crown finds support for this position in R. v. Predenchuk (2000), 199 
  Sask. R. 264, 2000 SKCA 122, where the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held as 
  follows at para. 6: </p>
<p class="indent">
  ...[T]he trial judge must first of all determine whether a penitentiary term 
  is appropriate. In our view, a judge cannot calculate the amount of time that 
  the accused has spent on remand and deduct it to determine whether the conduct 
  in question would normally merit the imposition of imprisonment within a penitentiary. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] See also R. v. Runns (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 217, 2002 SKCA 48 at paras. 
  20-1 where the same court followed its decision in Predenchuk. </p>
<p>
  [16] The British Columbia Court of Appeal, without expressly addressing the 
  issue, appeared to hold the contrary view in R. v. Harris (2002), 167 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 246, 2002 BCCA 152. In its reasons for upholding the conditional sentence 
  imposed on Mr. Harris, the court commented as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The first condition is that a sentence of incarceration of not more than two 
  years less a day be an appropriate sentence. At the time of sentencing, Mr. 
  Harris had served eight months in pre-trial custody. A custodial sentence of 
  say, 40 months (less a day), giving 16 months credit for the pre-trial custody, 
  would have resulted in a sentence of two years less a day. Thus, I am unable 
  to say that the first condition could not be satisfied. </p>
<p>
  [17] Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, argues that nothing in the 
  Criminal Code or in Proulx prohibits such an approach. He submits that in determining 
  the appropriate range of sentence, a sentencing judge may take pre-sentence 
  custody into account, either as a general principle of sentencing, or pursuant 
  to s. 719(3). He maintains that there is no evidence of a clear intention by 
  Parliament to exclude pre-trial custody from the sentencing judge's consideration 
  of the appropriate range of sentence.</p>
<p>
  [18] With respect for the opposite view, I find that the respondent's position 
  is to be preferred. It is more consonant with the language of the Criminal Code. 
  The first criterion that must be met under s. 742.1(a) is that &quot;the court 
  imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years&quot;. In &quot;determining 
  the sentence to be imposed&quot;, s. 719(3) allows the court to count pre-sentence 
  custody. This court considered s. 719(3) in the context of minimum sentences 
  in R. v. McDonald (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 57. Rosenberg J.A., in writing for 
  the court, held that s. 719(3) was not merely a principle of sentencing; rather, 
  it gives the sentencing judge a substantive power to count pre-sentence custody 
  in fixing the length of a sentence. His analysis on this point was expressly 
  endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455. 
  Hence, the fact that s. 742.1 expressly refers to the &quot;principles of sentencing 
  set out in sections 718 to 718.2&quot; without including s. 719(3) does not 
  assist the Crown, as contended. I would conclude, rather, that if Parliament 
  had intended to curtail the court's power to consider pre-sentence custody in 
  the application of s. 742.1, it could have done so in express language. </p>
<p>
  [19] It is my view that the language of s. 742.1 and s. 719(3) is not ambiguous 
  and that it does allow the sentencing judge to take into account pre-sentence 
  custody in determining the range of sentence under the conditional sentence 
  regime. However, even if one were to conclude that these provisions are ambiguous 
  as to the proper role of pre-sentence custody in the conditional sentencing 
  context, the result should be the same. Where provisions in penal statutes affecting 
  the liberty of a person are ambiguous, the proper approach is to interpret the 
  legislation in a manner favourable to the accused: R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 
  S.C.R. 686 at para. 29, per Lamer C.J.C. In this case, that approach leads to 
  the conclusion that there is no impediment to the consideration of pre-sentence 
  custody in the determination of the appropriate range of sentence for the purposes 
  of the conditional sentencing regime. </p>
<p>
  [20] Further I do not agree with the Crown's contention that this interpretation 
  is contrary to the purposive approach adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Proulx. The issue before us was not before the Supreme Court in Proulx, and 
  it therefore was not an explicit consideration in the Court's reasons. Moreover, 
  there is nothing in Proulx that suggests that a sentencing judge may not take 
  pre-sentence custody into account at the first stage of the process in determining 
  whether a penitentiary term is appropriate. </p>
<p>
  [21] This methodology may of course result in situations in which an offence 
  that would normally merit a penitentiary sentence instead garners a conditional 
  sentence because of the effect of pre-sentence custody. I do not accede to the 
  Crown's view that this result is unacceptable. It is not in my view absurd to 
  allow that the appropriate range of sentence may change depending on the presence 
  of pre-sentence custody. There are many factors to be taken into account in 
  sentencing, of which pre-sentence custody may be one pursuant to s. 719(3), 
  and a variation in any of the factors may result in a different appropriate 
  range of sentence. Where a particular offender has served a substantial amount 
  of time in pre-sentence custody, it might not be appropriate, in the view of 
  the sentencing judge, for that offender to receive a sentence in the penitentiary 
  range. For example, the sentencing judge might conclude, given that pre-sentence 
  custody is often served in harsher circumstances than the punishment ultimately 
  calls for (see R. v. Wust, supra at para. 28), that a penitentiary term would 
  no longer be proportionate to the offence.</p>
<p>
  [22] The Crown's concern that this approach could lead to the imposition of 
  conditional sentences for classes of offenders to which the conditional sentencing 
  regime was not intended to apply is unfounded in light of the further requirements 
  set out in s. 742.1(b). Even after concluding that the appropriate range of 
  sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years, a sentencing judge 
  would still have to be satisfied that a conditional sentence would not endanger 
  the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose 
  and principles of sentencing. This result will be less likely where the offence 
  is one that would merit a penitentiary term, absent the pre?sentence custody. 
  Indeed, in R. v. Persaud (2002), 26 M.V.R. (4th) 41, this court, without deciding 
  the issue now before us, noted at para. 1 that &quot;it will be the rare and 
  exceptional case that a trial judge, who is otherwise of the view that a penitentiary 
  sentence is warranted, will ultimately impose a conditional sentence after factoring 
  in time spent in pre-trial custody.&quot; In my view, however, there is no principled 
  basis upon which to conclude that such an option should never be available. 
  It should therefore be open to a sentencing judge as a matter of principle to 
  consider pre-sentence custody in determining the appropriate range of sentence 
  for the purposes of the conditional sentencing regime.</p>
<p>
  [23] This brings me to the Crown's alternative submission that if a conditional 
  sentence was legally available, it was not appropriate on the facts of this 
  case. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown did not press this 
  issue, more or less conceding that this court may not wish to interfere with 
  the sentence having regard to the lengthy passage of time since its imposition. 
  </p>
<p>
  [24] Having regard for the deference required in respect of sentences imposed 
  at trial, I would not interfere with the sentencing judge's decision to impose 
  a conditional sentence in this case. Although unusual, given the violent nature 
  of one of the offences, it cannot be said that the imposition of a conditional 
  sentence, in and of itself, resulted in an unfit sentence. This court's review 
  of the length of the sentence poses more difficulty. The matter is complicated 
  by the fact that the sentencing judge appears first to have determined a fixed 
  term for the sentence to be imposed, which was not the approach recommended 
  in Proulx. It is difficult to ascertain from the record whether this irregularity 
  may have impacted on his ultimate decision on the length of the sentence. However, 
  as was anticipated by Crown counsel, I find that the passage of time, when considered 
  in the context of all the circumstances of this case, militates against appellate 
  intervention. I would therefore grant leave to appeal the sentence but dismiss 
  the appeal.</p>
