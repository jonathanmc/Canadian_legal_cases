<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Roland J. Haines, sitting 
  with a jury, on June 30, 2000 and from the sentence imposed by Haines J. on 
  August 3, 2000. </p>
<p>
  ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] After a trial before Justice Roland J. Haines and a jury, the appellant 
  appeals his conviction for taking the child, Chantelle Rose Henry (&quot;Chantelle&quot;), 
  in contravention of a custody order with the intention of depriving the legal 
  guardian of possession of the child contrary to s. 282 (1)(a) of the Criminal 
  Code. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal his sentence in regard to the 
  terms of his probation order.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] Chantelle was born on February 1, 1995. The appellant is her father. Her 
  mother, Floretta Thomas, died on January 13, 1996. Before her death, Ms. Thomas 
  left instructions that her brother, Dean Henry, should have custody of the child 
  and assume all parental responsibilities. Chantelle began living with Mr. Henry 
  on the Chippewa of the Thames First Nation Reserve in March 1996. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant commenced proceedings for custody of Chantelle in the spring 
  of 1996. On May 21, 1998, Morin J. of the Superior Court awarded custody to 
  Mr. Henry with generous rights of access to the appellant, which included two 
  separate two-week periods in the summer. A motion by the appellant to set aside 
  the custody order was dismissed on July 16, 1999. Also, a motion by the appellant 
  to have Chantelle declared a child in need of protection and placed in his custody 
  was dismissed on August 27, 1999. </p>
<p>
  [4] In the period from August 13, 1999 to August 27, 1999, the appellant exercised 
  one of his periods of access. On the day Chantelle was to be returned to Mr. 
  Henry, the appellant telephoned the professional exchange agency, which facilitated 
  his access, to advise he would not be returning the child to the agency and 
  that he would be returning her directly to Mr. Henry. </p>
<p>
  [5] Also on August 27, 1999, the appellant telephoned a policeman on the Chippewa 
  Reserve and asked if he was banned from the Reserve. The policeman told him 
  he was not aware of any ban. The policeman advised the appellant that he would 
  assist in the return of Chantelle to the Henry residence. On the same day, the 
  appellant faxed a letter to various people, including the reserve police and 
  the Strathroy O.P.P., in which a number of allegations were made against the 
  reserve police, Mr. Henry and others. He also stated in the fax that he had 
  been banned from the Reserve.</p>
<p>
  [6] Chantelle was not returned to Mr. Henry by the appellant. Instead, he took 
  her to Halifax, Nova Scotia and kept her there until he was apprehended by the 
  Halifax police on September 30, 1999. The following day, Chantelle was returned, 
  unharmed, to Mr. Henry. The appellant was returned to London, Ontario where 
  he faced the charge of breach of s. 282 (1)(a) of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [7] Although he had a legal aid certificate, the appellant acted for himself 
  during a 6-week trial. The Crown called four witnesses: Dean Henry, the operator 
  of the access exchange and two police officers. The appellant, in defence, called 
  five physicians, eight persons from either the Children's Aid Society or Child 
  and Family Services and two childcare workers. The appellant did not testify.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant raised nine grounds in his original inmate notice of appeal 
  dated August 18, 2000. The appellant filed a supplementary notice of appeal 
  dated March 6, 2001, in which he raised 53 grounds of appeal. Most of the original 
  grounds of appeal were incorporated in the supplementary notice of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [9] On July 20, 2002, the Court appointed Gregory Lafontaine as amicus curiae 
  to assist in the presentation of the appeal to the court.</p>
<p>
  THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant objected to proceeding with the argument of the appeal because 
  he said that he had recently been charged with a breach of probation and did 
  not want to incriminate himself. Counsel for the respondent undertook that the 
  Crown would not use anything the appellant said before us on the breach of probation 
  charge. The appellant raised a number of other issues concerning the state of 
  the record. He complained that he had not had an opportunity to prepare for 
  the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [11] We were satisfied that the appeal was ready for argument since the notice 
  of appeal had been filed more than 2 years ago and that both the Court and the 
  appellant would be greatly assisted by the appointment of Mr. Lafontaine as 
  amicus curiae. We therefore declined the appellant's request for an adjournment 
  of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant made an oral presentation to us in which he raised many matters 
  not relevant to the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [13] The submissions made by Mr. Lafontaine included: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit the jury 
  to consider the defence of colour of right;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit the jury 
  to consider the defence of imminent harm;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as 
  to elements of the offence in a manner consistent with the appellant having 
  been charged with &quot;detaining&quot; while the indictment particularized 
  the mode of the commission of the offence as &quot;taking&quot;; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) that the trial judge erred in imposing a term of probation 
  that required the appellant to seek leave of the court before commencing a civil 
  action.</p>
<p>
  (i) Did the trial judge err in refusing to permit the jury to consider the defence 
  of colour of right?</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Lafontaine submitted that s. 282 (2) of the Criminal Code implicitly 
  recognizes the defence of honest belief that no valid custody order was in place 
  in regard to a charge under s. 282 (1). Section 282 (2) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a count charges an offence under subsection (1) and the offence is not 
  proven only because the accused did not believe that there was a valid custody 
  order but the evidence does prove an offence under s. 283, the accused may be 
  convicted of an offence under s. 283.</p>
<p>
  [15] Mr. Lafontaine submitted that there was evidence that the appellant honestly 
  believed that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) he could not return Chantelle Henry on August 27 because 
  he had been banned from the reserve and could therefore not lawfully return 
  Chantelle to Dean Henry; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the order of Morin J. dated May 21, 1998 had been obtained 
  illegally and that the conduct (lawlessness) of various individuals, including 
  Dean Henry, in obtaining and carrying out the order had rendered it, in effect, 
  void in the mind of the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [16] Counsel for the respondent submitted that no colour of right defence is 
  available to a charge of parental child abduction under s. 282 (1)(a) of the 
  Code. He argued that, in the past, the single offence of child abduction required 
  the Crown to prove that the child was taken &quot;unlawfully,&quot; and an accused 
  had a statutory defence on the basis that he or she could claim in good faith 
  a right to custody of the child. These elements were removed by Parliament on 
  January 4, 1983. </p>
<p>
  [17] However, the respondent conceded that this court had previously held that 
  an objectively reasonable mistake of law might in unusual cases negate the mens 
  rea of the offence of parental abduction under s. 282 (1)(a) of the Code. See 
  R. v. Ilczyszyn (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (C.A.); leave granted: [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
  xiii; appeal quashed for delay; [1989] S.C.C.A. No. 16.</p>
<p>
  [18] Whether or not a colour of right defence is legally available to a defendant 
  charged under s. 282 (1)(a) of the Code, I agree with the respondent's submission 
  that it was not available in the circumstances of this case. There simply was 
  no air of reality to the submission that the appellant &quot;truly believed 
  on reasonable grounds&quot; that the custody order of May 21, 1998 was &quot;no 
  longer in existence&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [19] The respondent quite properly pointed out that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) there is no evidence that the appellant was told he was 
  banned from the reserve and no such order was made;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) even if such an order existed, the appellant could have 
  returned Chantelle through the facility of the professional exchange as had 
  been the established practice;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the appellant did not testify and therefore there was no 
  evidence that he had any question about the validityof the custody order; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the appellant had brought a motion to set aside the order 
  and therefore appreciated that it was a valid and subsisting order concerning 
  the custody of Chantelle.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Did the trial judge err in refusing to permit the jury to consider the 
  defence of imminent harm?</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Lafontaine submitted that there was an abundance of evidence that the 
  appellant firmly believed &quot;that Chantelle was constantly in harm while 
  in the custody of Dean Henry.&quot; He argued that the trial judge erred in 
  focusing on the lack of direct evidence from the appellant when there was evidence 
  to be found in the documentary record. He further submitted that while the reasonableness 
  of the appellant's belief was for the jury to consider in assessing its honesty, 
  an unreasonable but honest belief is a defence to a charge under s. 282 of the 
  Code. In support of this argument he cited: </p>
<p class="indent"> R. v. Osolin (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.); </p>
<p class="indent">R. v. Adams (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.)</p>
<p>
  [21] The defence of imminent harm is created by s. 285 of the Criminal Code 
  which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 280 to 283 if the 
  court is satisfied that the taking&#133;of any young person was necessary to 
  protect the young person from danger of imminent harm or if the person charged 
  with the offence was escaping from danger of imminent harm.</p>
<p>
  [22] Counsel for the respondent submitted in his factum that before an accused 
  can rely upon the defence of imminent harm under s. 285, there must be &quot;some 
  evidence showing that the accused honestly believed the child was in danger 
  of virtually immediate physical or psychological harm, and that the abduction 
  of the child by the accused was 'necessary', in an 'objective sense', based 
  upon the circumstances known to the appellant and the 'other remedial steps' 
  that were reasonably open to the accused.&quot; See R. v. Lines, [1986] N.W.T.J. 
  No. 98; R. v. Gamache (unreported, September 3, 1987, B.C. Co. Ct.); R. v. Adams, 
  supra; and R. v. Mendez (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (C.A.) at p. 310; leave 
  denied: [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 679.</p>
<p>
  [23] I agree with the respondent's further submission that there was no air 
  of reality to the defence of imminent harm. There was no evidence that Chantelle 
  was ever at risk physically, emotionally or psychologically. The five physicians 
  called to testify by the appellant each described Chantelle as happy and in 
  good health. The Children's Aid and Child and Family Service workers expressed 
  no concern about her welfare. The two childcare workers described Chantelle 
  as a happy, normally developing child.</p>
<p>
  [24] It is also significant that the appellant took Chantelle on August 18, 
  1999 to see Dr. Irwin Anton for a check-up. At that time, Chantelle was found 
  to have a common cold with no further complications and no medication was prescribed. 
  Accordingly, as counsel for the respondent pointed out, the appellant knew a 
  few days before the abduction that Chantelle was in good health. Further, on 
  the day of the abduction, August 27, 1999, the appellant was in communication 
  with a number of individuals and at no time did he suggest that he believed 
  Chantelle could be at risk of imminent harm. When the appellant arrived in Halifax, 
  he did not suggest to his friend, Ms. Pearson, or any members of his family, 
  that Chantelle was at risk of imminent harm and therefore that was the reason 
  for his bringing her to Halifax.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Did the trial judge err in instructing the jury as to the elements of 
  the offence in respect of detaining and taking?</p>
<p>
  [25] The indictment clearly states that the appellant was charged with &quot;taking&quot; 
  Chantelle contrary to s. 282 (1)(a) of the Code. He was not expressly charged 
  with &quot;detaining&quot; Chantelle, although it can be an element of the offence 
  under s. 282 (1)(a). However, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge referred 
  to both taking and detention and therefore the appellant submitted that he failed 
  to specifically address with clarity the mode of the offence with which the 
  appellant was charged. Mr. Lafontaine argued that the only evidence of &quot;taking&quot; 
  occurred on August 13, 1999 at the commencement of the access period and for 
  which there was little or no evidence of criminal intent. </p>
<p>
  [26] Counsel for the respondent conceded that it would have been preferable 
  for the trial judge to have charged the jury on the precise allegation of &quot;taking&quot; 
  as specified in the indictment. However, he submitted that there was never any 
  issue between the parties that the appellant did in fact &quot;take&quot; Chantelle 
  as alleged in the indictment and therefore any potential error in the charge 
  was of no consequence.</p>
<p>
  [27] While I agree with Mr. Lafontaine that the charge to the jury on the issue 
  of &quot;taking&quot; lacks clarity, I would not intervene. To the extent that 
  the trial judge fell into error in this aspect of the charge, I would invoke 
  s. 686 (1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code because there was no substantial wrong 
  or miscarriage of justice. This is a case in which the evidence against the 
  appellant was overwhelming and no valid purpose would be served by ordering 
  a new trial on the basis contended for by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  (iv) Did the trial judge err in imposing a term of probation that required the 
  appellant to seek leave of the court before commencing a civil action?</p>
<p>
  [28] The probation order contained three terms (10, 11 and 12) which prevented 
  the appellant from commencing legal action (without court approval) against 
  members of the Henry family, from seeking subpoenas relating to the Henry family 
  and from seeking access to records or information relating to the Henry family. 
  The trial judge explained his rationale for these provisions as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Terms 10, 11 and 12 impose limits on Mr. Finck's access to the Courts and to 
  records that relate to the Henry family. Given Mr. Finck's history and penchant 
  for harassment by litigation, I consider it appropriate that he should henceforth 
  be required to seek leave of the Court before initiating any legal process relating 
  to the Henry family. </p>
<p>
  [29] Section 732.1 (3)(h) of the Code permits a judge to impose &quot;&#133;reasonable 
  conditions&#133;for protecting society and for facilitating the offender's successful 
  reintegration into the community.&quot; In my view, the conditions imposed by 
  the trial judge in the circumstances before the court were well within his authority 
  under the aforesaid section. </p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [30] In the result, on the grounds argued before us, I would dismiss the appeal 
  from conviction. I would also dismiss the appeal from conviction in respect 
  of the other grounds contained in the supplementary notice of appeal. In regard 
  to the application for leave to appeal the sentence and, in particular, the 
  provisions in the probation order referred to above, I would grant leave and 
  dismiss the appeal as to sentence. </p>
