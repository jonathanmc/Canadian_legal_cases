<p>On appeal from the order of Justice J. David McCombs of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 3, 2002.</p> <P>
  WEILER J.A.:</p> <P>
  The Issue</p> <P>
  [1] Pursuant to a Rule 21.01 (1)(b) motion brought by the Crown, McCombs J. 
  struck out those portions of the appellants' amended statement of claim alleging 
  abuse of process, conspiracy to injure, and intentional infliction of harm on 
  the basis that they disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The issue on this 
  appeal is whether the motions judge erred in striking those causes of action.</p> <P>
  The History of the Action</p> <P>
  [2] The criminal proceedings giving rise to this action against the Crown are 
  reported in R. v. Folland (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.). In brief, 
  Folland was staying overnight at the home of a woman and her house-mate Shawn 
  Harris. The woman awakened in the night to find that she was being sexually 
  assaulted and she identified Folland to police as the person who assaulted her. 
  The police charged Folland with sexual assault. </p> <P>
  [3] Harris, who had had consensual sex with the woman on some prior occasions, 
  told one of the investigating officers that he was the person who had had sex 
  with the woman. A few days later, he declined to give the police a signed statement. 
  </p> <P>
  [4] A pair of men's underwear was found in the woman's bed. DNA testing prior 
  to trial excluded Folland as the donor of the semen found on the underwear. 
  No DNA samples were taken from Harris prior to trial. Although defence counsel 
  repeatedly pressed Crown counsel, in writing, to have the police conduct a fuller 
  investigation of Harris' role in the affair and suggested to Crown counsel that 
  he should call Harris as a witness at the trial so that the full story would 
  be before the jury, Crown counsel refused to do either. </p> <P>
  [5] Based on what Folland told him, Folland's trial counsel originally intended 
  to call Harris as a defence witness but attempts to serve him with a subpoena 
  were not successful. Folland's trial counsel was given an opportunity to apply 
  for a material witness warrant but declined because he had begun to doubt that 
  Harris would confess and was concerned that he would, instead, bolster the Crown's 
  case by denying that he had done anything to the woman. Folland was convicted 
  of sexual assault and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. After he had served 
  two and a half years of his sentence, Folland's friends were able to obtain 
  bodily samples from Harris and further DNA testing indicated that the semen 
  on the underwear found in the woman's bed belonged to Harris. Folland's trial 
  counsel stated that had he had the new DNA evidence, he would have elected to 
  pursue the application for a material witness warrant. </p> <P>
  [6] As a result of the fresh evidence, the Court of Appeal allowed Folland's 
  appeal and ordered a new trial. The Court noted that had the sentence portion 
  of the appeal proceeded, the Crown had already agreed that the sentence should 
  be reduced to time served and suggested the Crown consider whether it was in 
  the public interest to proceed with the new trial. Ultimately, the Crown elected 
  not to proceed with a new trial and requested that the charge be stayed.</p> <P>
  [7] The appellants then sued the Crown and the various police authorities alleging 
  a number of causes of action. The appellants alleged that Folland had been maliciously 
  prosecuted and that his ss. 7 and 11(d) rights under the Charter had been breached. 
  The Crown did not move to strike these claims as disclosing no cause of action 
  and the motions judge ordered that they would stand. The appellants also alleged 
  malicious and negligent investigation, wrongful conviction and wrongful incarceration. 
  These causes of action were abandoned at the hearing of the motion and were 
  struck. There is no appeal in respect of them. </p> <P>
  [8] In relation to the causes of action that are the subject of this appeal, 
  namely, abuse of process, conspiracy to injure and intentional infliction of 
  harm, the Crown's position was that the only common law tort available against 
  a Crown attorney for prosecutorial misconduct was malicious prosecution. </p> <P>
  [9] The motions judge agreed and held that the claims were barred by virtue 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions in Nelles v. Ontario (1989), 60 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 609 (S.C.C.) and Proulx v. Quebec ( Attorney General) (2001), 206 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). He stated: </p> 
<P class="indent"> On my reading of the authorities in particular the decisions 
  of the SCC in Proulx and Nelles, it is in my view plain and obvious that there 
  are no other causes of action available to the plaintiffs against the Crown 
  defendants. In the result, the other causes of action are ordered struck from 
  the statement of claim.</p> 
<P>
  General Principles Applicable to all Rule 21.01(b) Motions</p> <P>
  [10] As indicated by the motions judge, before a cause of action in a statement 
  of claim can be struck out it must be &quot;plain and obvious&quot; that no 
  cause of action is disclosed: Hunt v. Carey Canada inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. 
  Applying Hunt, supra, this court has held that the burden on a defendant to 
  strike a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action is very high, and 
  the court's power to do so should be exercised &quot;only in the clearest cases&quot;: 
  Temilini v. Ontario Provincial Police (Commissioner) (1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 664 
  (C.A.). For this reason the facts alleged in the statement of claim are accepted 
  as proven unless they are patently ridiculous or incapable of proof and the 
  statement of claim is read generously with allowance for inadequacies due to 
  drafting deficiencies: Nash v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.). The novelty 
  of a cause of action is of no concern: Johnson v. Adamson (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 
  236 (C.A.) [Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1982), 35 
  O.R. (2d) 64n].</p> <P>
  [11] Importantly, matters of law that have not been fully settled in the jurisprudence 
  should not be disposed of pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(b): Nash, supra, The analysis 
  in this case is focussed on the last requirement.</p> <P>
  Analysis </p> <P>
  [12] A Crown attorney has broad immunity against suits arising from the conduct 
  of prosecutions. Until the Nelles decision in 1989, a Crown attorney in Ontario 
  was considered to have absolute immunity respecting claims arising from his 
  or her conduct of a prosecution.</p> <P>
  [13] In Nelles, the Supreme Court of Canada held that in the interests of public 
  policy absolute immunity is not justified and the court carved out an exception 
  to the Crown's immunity in the case of malicious prosecution. The Court emphasized 
  that the exception to a Crown attorney's immunity was narrow, in order to accommodate 
  the competing interests of encouraging public trust and confidence in the impartiality 
  of prosecutors, and of avoiding a chilling effect on prosecutors' independence 
  and exercise of discretion. At p. 639, the Court identified the four elements 
  which must be present in order to establish the tort:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 1. The proceedings must have been initiated by the defendant;</p>
<P class="indent">2. The proceedings must have been terminated in favour of the 
  plaintiff; </p>
<P class="indent">3. There is an absence of reasonable and probable cause; and 
</p>
<P class="indent">4. There is malice, or a primary purpose other than that of 
  carrying the law into effect. </p>
<P>
  [14] In Oniel v. Toronto (Metropolitan) Police Force, [2001] O.J. No. 90 (C.A.), 
  leave to appeal to the Supreme Court dismissed at [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 121, this 
  Court held that continuing a prosecution in the absence of reasonable and probable 
  grounds is capable of giving rise to an inference of malice. Borins J.A. wrote 
  (at paras. 49-51):</p> 
<P class="indent"> Although the prosecutor may have reasonable and probable grounds 
  to commence a prosecution, if the prosecutor obtains information which suggests 
  that the person probably did not commit the offence,&#133; the prosecutor lacks 
  reasonable and probable grounds to continue the prosecution, and malice may 
  be inferred. &#133;</p>
<P class="indent">Continuing the prosecution in the absence of an honest belief 
  in the appellant's guilt would be incompatible with securing the ends of justice, 
  and malice could be inferred if the respondents continued the prosecution with 
  reckless indifference to the truth&#133; [emphasis added]. </p>
<P>
  [15] See also Wilson v. Toronto (Metropolitan) Police Service, [2001] O.J. No. 
  2434 (S.C.J.), at para. 27 where Dambrot J. held that although a police officer 
  in Ontario typically makes a decision to initiate a prosecution by swearing 
  an information, a prosecutor who carries on a prosecution maliciously may be 
  sued for malicious prosecution regardless of any involvement in the initiation 
  of proceedings.</p> <P>
  [16] The Supreme Court revisited Nelles in the Proulx decision and, although 
  the Court disagreed on the result in that particular case, it unanimously confirmed 
  that Nelles remains the law: Proulx supra, per majority at paras. 4, 9; per 
  dissenting judgment at para. 123</p> <P>
  [17] The majority of the Court in Proulx, at paras. 4, 8 and 9 began with the 
  following general comments about claims against Crown attorneys:</p> 
<P class="indent"> [4] Under our criminal justice system, prosecutors are vested 
  with extensive discretion and decision-making authority to carry out their functions. 
  Given the importance of this role to the administration of justice, courts should 
  be very slow indeed to second-guess a Prosecutor's judgment calls when assessing 
  Crown liability for prosecutorial misconduct. Nelles v. Ontario affirmed unequivocally 
  the public interest in setting the threshold for such liability very high, so 
  as to deter all but the most serious claims against the prosecuting authorities, 
  and to ensure that Crown liability is engaged in only the most exceptional circumstances. 
  Against these vital considerations is the principle that the Ministry of the 
  Attorney General and its Prosecutors are not above the law and must be held 
  accountable. Individuals caught up in the justice system must be protected from 
  abuses of power. In part, this accountability is achieved through the availability 
  of a civil action for malicious prosecution. </p>
<P class="indent">.&#133;.</p>
<P class="indent">[8] ... A failed prosecution does not without more - much more 
  - give rise to a viable claim for prosecutorial wrongdoing. </p>
<P class="indent">[9] As we have noted above, Nelles, set out four requirements 
  that must be established on a balance of probabilities by the claimant in an 
  action in damages based on prosecutorial misconduct in order to avoid the Crown's 
  relative immunity against such suits [emphasis added].</p>
<P>
  [18] As is seen in the excerpt quoted above, the Court in Proulx, when confirming 
  Nelles, did not identify or limit the four requirements of Nelles as being requirements 
  of &quot;malicious prosecution&quot; claims only. It identified those requirements 
  as the necessary elements of &quot;an action in damages based on prosecutorial 
  misconduct.&quot; The term prosecutorial misconduct is a broad term that could 
  encompass more than malicious prosecution. The only tort before the Court in 
  Proulx, however, was the tort of malicious prosecution. </p> <P>
  [19] The Crown's position before us is that the Proulx decision confirmed that 
  where prosecutorial misconduct is alleged the four requirements set out in Nelles 
  must always be proven. The Crown submits that the jurisprudence is settled and 
  there is no benefit to the appellants characterizing their claims under a variety 
  of labels because, if one of these four elements is not proven, all of the common 
  law torts will fail.</p> <P>
  [20] The appellants rely upon Milgaard v. Kujawa (1994), 118 D.L.R. (4th) 653 
  (Sask. C.A.) at 662-664 in which the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal suggested 
  that the categories of tort available against prosecutors were not closed and 
  that the torts of abuse of statutory power and conspiracy to abuse statutory 
  power might exist if actuated by malice or other improper motive. </p> <P>
  [21] In addition in R. v. Cook (1997), 146 D.L.R. (4th) 437 (S.C.C.) at 445-446, 
  L'Heureux Dub&eacute; J., on behalf of the Court, affirmed, albeit in a criminal 
  context, that the improper exercise of prosecutorial discretion can result in 
  a finding of abuse of process. She added, &quot;This misconduct can take many 
  forms, and will often engage the rights set out in the Charter of Rights and 
  Freedoms, although the exact manner in which this occurs will depend on the 
  particular circumstances in the case: R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, 103 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1, 130 D.L.R. (4th) 235.&quot; A plaintiff in an abuse of process 
  action does not need to show that the proceedings terminated in his or her favour: 
  Geo. Cluthe Manufacturing Co. v. ZTW Properties Inc. (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 370 
  at 379 (Div. Ct.).</p> <P>
  [22] It would appear, therefore, that the jurisprudence is not fully settled 
  as to whether the four elements for the tort of malicious prosecution must always 
  be proven in every civil action against a prosecutor. It is also not clear that, 
  if the four elements are established, a plaintiff is restricted to framing the 
  action as one of malicious prosecution rather than as one of conspiracy, abuse 
  of process or intentional infliction of harm. It may be that in some cases, 
  such as conspiracy, the rules relating to admissibility of evidence would be 
  of assistance to a plaintiff in establishing his or her case.</p> <P>
  [23] I also note that the purpose of a Rule 21 motion is to bring finality to 
  litigation that does not disclose a cause of action at an early stage of the 
  proceedings. Here, the actions of malicious prosecution and for breach of Charter 
  rights have not been struck and will be going on to trial in any event. </p> <P>
  Conclusion</p> <P>
  [24] It is inappropriate to strike the claims for abuse of process, conspiracy 
  to injure and intentional infliction of harm at this stage of the proceedings 
  because the jurisprudence is not settled that the four requirements of his action 
  for malicious prosecution must always be proven when a common law tort is alleged 
  against the Crown. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision 
  of the motions judge and dismiss the motion to strike the claims indicated.</p> <P>
  [25] I would reserve the costs of the appeal and of the motion to the judge 
  hearing the trial.</p>
