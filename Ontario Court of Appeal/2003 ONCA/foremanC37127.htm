<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John Brockenshire dated September 21, 
  2001.</p>
<p>ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this appeal is whether a clause in an employment contract stating 
  that the employee cannot be dismissed, should be enforced as a contract for 
  life.</p>

<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] John Kirby had a 50 per cent interest in P. H. Suhan Welding Ltd. (&quot;Suhan&quot;) 
  and 818329 Ontario Limited (&quot;818329&quot;), which owned, respectively, 
  the bingo hall in Stratford and in St. Thomas, Ontario. Mr. Kirby, a lawyer, 
  oversaw the operations of both the Stratford and St. Thomas bingo halls.</p>
<p>
  [3] Anne Marie Foreman was hired by Mr. Kirby in February 1989 to manage the 
  bingo hall in Stratford, Ontario. At the time, she and Mr. Kirby were romantically 
  involved. Ms. Foreman reported directly to Mr. Kirby and enjoyed a relatively 
  informal employment relationship with him. </p>
<p>
  [4] Ms. Foreman was a successful bingo hall manager and by April 1990, she was 
  working full-time as a manager and selling lottery tickets, dividing her time 
  between the St. Thomas and Stratford bingo halls. She did not have a written 
  employment contract.</p>
<p>
  [5] In the spring of 1990, Ms. Foreman learned that Frank DiMaria had agreed 
  to buy Mr. Kirby's shares in Suhan and 818329. Mr. DiMaria owned Cadith Entertainments 
  Ltd. (&quot;Cadith&quot;), which operated bingo halls in Ridgetown and Cobourg, 
  Ontario. Ms. Foreman anticipated that the share sale would result in a change 
  of management and that she would have to report to Mr. DiMaria rather than to 
  Mr. Kirby. Because she had heard that Mr. DiMaria had a reputation for replacing 
  existing employees with friends and family, Ms. Foreman asked Mr. Kirby to arrange 
  for an employment contract which would secure her position as manager. </p>
<p>
  [6] Mr. DiMaria agreed to provide Ms. Foreman with an employment contract. As 
  a result, Mr. Kirby prepared a contract on Ms. Foreman's behalf which included 
  the following paragraphs: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Anne Marie is an employee of 818329 and Suhan in the capacity 
  of hall manager. Her duties include the day-to-day management of 818329's hall 
  in St. Thomas and the supervision of Suhan's hall in Stratford. She is paid 
  a total of $640.00 per week, is entitled to the exclusive use of the apartment 
  located at the St. Thomas Hall, and is entitled to sell lottery tickets at the 
  St. Thomas hall for her own benefit. Her salary is reviewed annually on March 
  1st.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">5. 818329 and Suhan shall not dismiss Anne Marie.</p>
<p>
  [7] The lawyer for Cadith returned the contract to Mr. Kirby with a proposed 
  amendment inserting the words &quot;except for cause&quot; at the end of paragraph 
  5. This suggestion was, however, rejected by Mr. Kirby and the contract was 
  signed on June 25, 1990 with the original language of paragraph 5 intact. </p>
<p>
  [8] Nine months later, in March 1991, after being manager of the two bingo halls 
  and selling lottery tickets for 26 months, Ms. Foreman was fired by Mr. DiMaria. 
  She commenced an action against Suhan and 818329, as well as against DiMaria 
  and Cadith, who had signed the employment contract as guarantors. </p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge found that Ms. Foreman had been dismissed without cause 
  and was therefore entitled to damages. This finding is not under appeal. What 
  is at issue in this appeal is whether the 1990 contract is a contract for life 
  and whether the amount of $712,000 in damages awarded by the trial judge is 
  appropriate. </p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge found that paragraph 5 of the employment contract stating 
  that &quot;818329 and Suhan shall not dismiss Anne Marie&quot; provided for 
  a fixed term - life employment - that could only be terminated by Ms. Foreman. 
  The trial judge considered the applicability of s.2 of the Employers and Employees 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.E.12, which limits the term of employment contracts to nine 
  years. The trial judge concluded that Ms. Foreman and her employers waived the 
  limitation period as is permitted for managers under s. 11(2) of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [11] The measure of damages for the fixed term contract was, the trial judge 
  found, the money payable for the remainder of her life, minus any mitigation 
  on the part of Ms. Foreman. Since he found that Ms. Foreman would probably have 
  chosen to remain employed by her employers until the age of 65, and since she 
  was 32 when she was fired, the trial judge awarded damages in the amount of 
  $192,000, representing 33 years of lost wages plus anticipated profits from 
  the sale of lottery tickets. </p>
<p>
  [12] In addition, the trial judge found that Ms. Foreman was entitled to further 
  damages arising from her lost opportunity to profit from the sale of &quot;break 
  open&quot; lottery tickets sold by charities, and a different type of lottery 
  tickets from the ones she was already selling. Until February 1993, it was illegal 
  to sell this kind of lottery ticket in bingo halls. The new 1993 regulatory 
  scheme, initiated two years after Ms. Foreman was fired, permitted bingo hall 
  employees to sell the break open tickets if they had the appropriate licence 
  as well as the consent of an association of charities. </p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge determined that Ms. Foreman's past experience and business 
  acumen would likely have resulted in her being able to organize and facilitate 
  the sale of break open lottery tickets, and that she would have earned a further 
  profit from them. He estimated these profits to be $520,000, representing one-half 
  of the amount she would have earned from their sale. </p>
<p>
  [14] Both the $520,000 in damages for the break open tickets and the $192,000 
  award for lost wages and profits were based on figures prepared by expert accountants 
  and took mitigation into account. The total awarded was $712,000. This appeal 
  by the employers is from that amount.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [15] The preamble to the contract states that the consideration for the contract 
  was &quot;the sum of $1.00 and other good and valuable consideration&quot;. 
  The first argument by the employers was that there was no evidence that the 
  $1.00 was ever paid, that there was therefore no consideration for the contract, 
  and that in the absence of an enforceable contract, Ms. Foreman's employment 
  was for an indefinite term, entitling her only to reasonable notice. In view 
  of my conclusion about the nature of the employment clause, it is not necessary 
  to address this argument.</p>
<p>
  [16] The real issue in this appeal, it seems to me, is whether the employment 
  contract in this case operated to guarantee Ms. Foreman a fixed term for her 
  life, entitling her to damages representing 33 years of lost wages and profits, 
  or whether it provided for an employment relationship for an indefinite term, 
  entitling her to damages representing a period of reasonable notice. </p>
<p>
  [17] There is no doubt that fixed term employment contracts are legal. In Ontario, 
  such contracts are valid, but, as mentioned above, s. 2 of the Employers and 
  Employees Act, limits the enforceable term to nine years. This limitation period 
  can be waived in the case of any manager, officer or superintendent (s. 11(2)).</p>
<p>
  [18] This court recently considered the issue of fixed-term contracts in Ceccol 
  v. Ontario Gymnastic Federation (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 614, where MacPherson J.A. 
  observed at p. 624 that while fixed term contracts are legal and will be enforced 
  if their terms are clear, &quot;the courts require unequivocal and explicit 
  language to establish such a [fixed term] contract&#133;&quot; (citing Professor 
  Geoffrey England, Individual Employment Law (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2000) at p. 
  222). </p>
<p>
  [19] It is also possible to have a fixed term contract for the life of an employee. 
  Lifetime employment, while legal, and in some cases even desirable, nonetheless 
  requires even clearer articulation, given the profound financial responsibility 
  of such a guarantee. The Manitoba Court of Appeal affirmed the need for this 
  linguistic clarity in Wallace v. United Grain Growers (1996), 14 C.C.E.L. (2d) 
  41, rev'd in part on other grounds [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701 and in Pelletier v. Caisse 
  Populaire LaSalle Sudbury Lt&eacute;e. (1984), 5 C.C.E.L. 1 (Ontario H.C.J.); 
  aff'd on other grounds (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 784 (C.A.), where the contract stated 
  a fixed retirement age.</p>
<p>
  [20] In this appeal, however, there is no explicit language unequivocally stating 
  that the fixed term is for life or until retirement age. The evidence discloses 
  that what the parties intended was to protect Ms. Foreman from dismissal through 
  the change in management and not for the rest of her life. Ms. Foreman, on whose 
  behalf the contract was drafted, testified that the intention was protection 
  from arbitrary removal in favour of Mr. DiMaria's family and friends, not employment 
  for the rest of her life. The failure to include the words &quot;except for 
  cause&quot; does not detract from this conclusion. As Ms. Foreman stated at 
  trial: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I was concerned about my job being secure with [DiMaria's group] if they were 
  the purchasers of his interest. They have a history and a reputation of firing 
  and letting go employees for no apparent reason. Generally it would be to replace 
  them with family and friends. &#133;[I]t's the big guys move in and they come 
  in and they just take over the hall and you go out the door. They escort you 
  and you're gone.</p>
<p>
  [21] The contract was drawn up on behalf of Ms. Foreman by Mr. Kirby, who left 
  the term of the contract ambiguous. In the absence of the requisite clarity 
  for finding that this is a contract for a fixed life term, I would interpret 
  the ambiguity against Ms. Foreman's assertions but in accordance with her evidence, 
  and conclude that the employment contract provision insulates Ms. Foreman from 
  dismissal indefinitely, but not for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>
  [22] Because this is a contract for an indefinite term, Ms. Foreman is entitled 
  to reasonable notice. Given the importance of her job and the length of time 
  she performed it, I am of the opinion that she is entitled to twelve months' 
  notice.</p>
<p>
  [23] This means, among other things, that the period of reasonable notice would 
  have ended before the &quot;break open&quot; lottery tickets became legal in 
  bingo halls, and before Ms. Foreman would have been able to implement their 
  sale. Moreover, in light of the fact that they were not legal for sale in bingo 
  halls until two years after Ms. Foreman was wrongfully dismissed, they are so 
  remote that it is difficult to see how these damages could be included in the 
  damage award.</p>
<p>
  [24] At trial, the parties agreed upon figures prepared by two accountants for 
  the purpose of calculating Ms. Foreman's damages, which the trial judge used 
  in arriving at the amount of $192,000 for lost wages and lost profits on lottery 
  ticket sales. Using these same figures, the amount for twelve months' notice 
  according to the parties' own calculations, excluding lost profit for &quot;break 
  open&quot; lottery tickets, is $30,800. </p>
<p>
  [25] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial 
  judge, and order that Ms. Foreman be entitled to a period of damages representing 
  twelve months' notice. </p>
<p>
  [26] In view of the fact that there has been mixed success on this appeal, I 
  would not award costs.</p>
<p> RELEASED: &quot;SEP 04 2003&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;R.S. Abella J.A."<br>
  "I agree K. Weiler J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [27] I have read the reasons of my colleague Abella J.A. With respect, I am 
  unable to agree with her conclusions. </p>
<p>
  [28] The trial judge found that the agreement between Ms. Foreman and her employers 
  was in effect a contract for life. The issue as to whether the parties intended 
  a contract for life was clearly dependent upon the trial judge's assessment 
  of the parol evidence, the admissibility of which was not in issue. </p>
<p>
  [29] While I might well have come to a different conclusion than the trial judge, 
  I am not satisfied that he committed a palpable and over-riding error. See Housen 
  v. Rural Municipality of Shellbrook, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. </p>
<p>
  [30] There was evidence before the trial judge from which he could conclude 
  that the parties intended that the employment agreement was a contract for life. 
  Mr. DiMaria, who was, in effect, Ms. Foreman's employer and one of the signatories 
  to the contract testified in cross-examination: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q: But short of someone stealing you blind or destroying your 
  property, your agreement is you've got a job for life?</p>
<p class="indent">A: As long as you're doing your job, yes&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: You promised, you covenant [sic], you agreed to hire Anne 
  Marie for as long as she wanted?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes.</p>
<p>
  [31] Ms. Foreman testified that she had a lifetime employment contract as long 
  as she wanted to work. The trial judge concluded that she would work until age 
  65.</p>
<p>
  [32] I also accept the trial judge's finding that there was consideration for 
  the employment contract. </p>
<p>
  [33] I do, however, believe that the trial judge committed reversible error 
  in his assessment of damages. In my view, the evidence does not support a finding 
  that Ms. Foreman would be entitled to damages for the lost opportunity to profit 
  from the sale of &quot;break open lottery tickets&quot;. At the time the contract 
  was made, there was no contemplation of the parties that break open lottery 
  tickets would be sold in the bingo halls by Ms. Foreman. Indeed at that time, 
  it was not legally possible to sell such tickets. At the time the contract was 
  signed, Ms. Foreman was selling a different kind of lottery ticket in the bingo 
  halls. Ms. Foreman's damages are therefore limited to $192,000. </p>
<p>
  [34] In the result, I would allow the appeal in respect of damages and reduce 
  the damages award to $192,000. </p>
