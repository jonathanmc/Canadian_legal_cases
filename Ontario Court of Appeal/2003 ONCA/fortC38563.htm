<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. St. Fort, a lawyer working in Ottawa at the time, was charged with 
  Caren Maynard and Shuander Maynard with five counts of conspiracy to commit 
  fraud and three counts of fraud. Both Maynards failed to appear for their trial 
  and warrants are outstanding for their arrest. </p>
<p> [2] There was no real issue that the frauds on the banks as alleged were committed 
  by the co-accused. The issue was whether Mr. St. Fort was a party to the fraud. 
  The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable. The trial judge reviewed 
  Mr. St. Fort&#8217;s activities. He gave examples of the evidence of the appellant 
  in which he attempted to explain away facts and found the explanations to be 
  improbable.</p>
<p> [3] Having rejected the evidence of the appellant he then went on to consider 
  whether the Crown had proven its case. Because the appellant had been charged 
  with conspiracy to commit fraud, as well as fraud, he first considered whether 
  it was probable that the appellant was a member of the conspiracy. He held that 
  it was more than probable that the appellant was. He then considered whether 
  he needed to apply the Carter exception to the hearsay rule and he concluded 
  that he did not have to do so. He found that the appellant&#8217;s own acts 
  and declarations proved him guilty as a party to certain frauds. He was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that he had agreed to defraud the banks in the transactions 
  in which he acted as a solicitor. He therefore convicted the appellant on counts 
  6, 7 &amp; 8. He had a doubt, however, that Mr. St. Fort was a member of the 
  conspiracy. There was ample evidence to support the findings of the trial judge 
  and the verdict was not unreasonable. The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p> [4] With respect to sentence, the appellant submits that he ought to have 
  been given a conditional sentence. In our opinion the trial judge did not err 
  in principle in imposing a custodial sentence and the sentence is fit. </p>
<p> [5] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted the appeal as to 
  sentence is dismissed.</p>
