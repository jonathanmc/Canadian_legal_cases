<p>On appeal from an order of Justice Alexandra Hoy of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated October 28, 2002, reported at (2002), 27 C.P.C. (5th) 189.</p>

<p>
  CARTHY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants made a written offer to settle prior to trial. The trial 
  proceeded before Rouleau J., who reserved judgment. The parties had further 
  settlement discussions, which ended when the respondents accepted the earlier 
  written offer. Rouleau J. then delivered judgment in favour of the appellants 
  for an amount in excess of the accepted offer. Prior to that judgment, the respondents 
  moved successfully before Hoy J. under rule 49.09 for an order enforcing the 
  settlement. The appeal is against that order. The motions judge recounts the 
  facts in detail as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> [2] In a letter dated September 12, 2002, five days before 
  the scheduled trial date, counsel for the Plaintiffs wrote to counsel for the 
  Defendants offering &quot;to settle this matter for the all-inclusive sum of 
  $55,000.&quot; The letter provided that, &quot;If a reasonable overall settlement 
  cannot be achieved, then we will have no choice but to bring a motion at the 
  commencement of trial seeking an adjournment so that proper evidence can be 
  adduced at the trial with respect to damages; we would serve the motion material 
  by close of September 16, 2002.&quot; The offer was not accepted and the matter 
  was not settled before the scheduled commencement of trial on September 17, 
  2002. On September 17, 2002, the Plaintiffs brought a motion to adjourn the 
  trial, which was dismissed. The matter was placed on the standby list, and the 
  trial commenced on September 24 and concluded on Monday, September 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="indent">[3] On Sunday September 29, 2002, the parties conducted settlement 
  discussions via telephone. The Defendants made an oral offer for $40,000, all-inclusive, 
  and the Plaintiffs countered with an oral offer for $75,000, plus interest and 
  costs. This oral offer was not accepted.</p>
<p class="indent">[4] Within an hour and a half of the conclusion of the trial 
  of September 30, 2002, and before the presiding judge had issued his decision, 
  the Defendants faxed a letter to counsel for the Plaintiffs accepting the Plaintiff's 
  $55,000 all-inclusive offer of September 12. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants conceded that the offer was subject to Rule 49, and that 
  a written notice is required to withdraw an open-ended offer before it is accepted. 
  It was argued that, pursuant to rule 49.04(3), the offer was deemed to be withdrawn 
  when the time for acceptance expired, and that the time for acceptance was specified 
  to expire when the motion for adjournment of the trial was served.</p>
<p>
  [3] Hoy J. properly rejected that argument, applying a decision of the Divisional 
  Court in Miller v. Parkway Rental Ltd. (1997), 12 C.P.C. (4th) 303. In Miller, 
  the court dealt with a settlement offer that contained the following statement: 
  &quot;We have been advised that if this settlement proposal is not accepted, 
  then we are prepared to turn this matter over to defence.&quot; The Divisional 
  Court concluded that the statement did not constitute an expiry provision, holding, 
  at p. 305, that an effective expiry provision &quot;must be clearly expressed 
  as a time beyond which the offer can no longer be accepted and it must have 
  a specified or ascertainable date.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [4] In the present case, the settlement offer provided that if a reasonable 
  settlement could not be achieved, then a motion to adjourn the trial would be 
  brought, and the motion material would be served by close of September 16, 2002. 
  I agree with Hoy J. that this statement lacks the requisite clarity of an effective 
  expiry provision. It does not state that the offer expires upon service of the 
  motion material. Accordingly, this offer was open for acceptance on September 
  30. The settlement should be enforced unless a discretion is exercised in favour 
  of the appellants under rule 49.09.</p>
<p>
  [5] It is in respect of the discretion that I part company with Hoy J. and with 
  statements in Miller on the same subject.</p>
<p>
  [6] In Miller, A.G. Campbell J. stated at pp. 307-308: </p>
<p class="indent"> Assuming on the basis of Smith v. Robinson [(1992), 7 O.R. 
  (3d) 550 (Ont. Gen. Div.)] per Ferrier J. at p. 557 that the court &quot;in 
  given limited circumstances&quot; retains under Rule 40.09(a) a discretion to 
  refuse to grant judgment on an accepted offer, this is not one of those rare 
  cases.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant made a valid offer under Rule 49 that kept ticking 
  away until it was accepted by the plaintiff. The fact that both parties ignored 
  the ticking offer and tried to settle it on some other basis does not detract 
  from its legal force or the power of the plaintiff to accept it. It would have 
  been the easiest thing in the world for the defendant to specify in the letter 
  of May 22 1991 that it was not a Rule 49 offer. It is for the defendant unfortunate, 
  yet not unfair, to be visited with the ineluctable consequences of its Rule 
  49 offer.</p>
<p class="indent">To hold otherwise would interfere with the integrity of the 
  Rule 49 regime, blur the bright line between offers which comply with Rule 49 
  and offers which do not, and produce uncertainty by encouraging settlement offers 
  to be judged on the basis of collateral evidence rather than their clear terms.</p>
<p>
  [7] Hoy J. was clearly influenced away from her inclination favouring the appellants 
  in the exercise of her discretion as evidenced by her own words: </p>
<p class="indent"> [10] If this offer and acceptance were not in the context of 
  Rule 49, and absent the decision in Miller v. Parkway, my decision would have 
  been different. While the Defendants did not admit it, I suspect that they were 
  aware that the Plaintiffs thought that the September 12 offer was no longer 
  capable of acceptance when the Defendants accepted it.</p>
<p class="indent">[11] The Plaintiffs also asked that if I found that there was 
  a settlement agreement, I exercise my discretion and decline to grant judgment 
  in the terms of the accepted offer. In Bailey v. Plaxton, [2001] O.J. No. 1111 
  Mesbur J. outlined the limited circumstances where the Court has exercised its 
  discretion and refused to enforce settlement agreements. This case, which involves 
  an offer made and accepted within an 18-day period, albeit a costly 18-day period, 
  does not in my view fall within those limited circumstances. Exercising my discretion 
  in these circumstances would be tantamount to implying as a term of every settlement 
  offer that it expires on the commencement of trial or other change in circumstances. 
  Implying such a term would be contrary to both Rule 49.04(3) and Miller v. Parkway 
  Rental Ltd. Accordingly, judgment is to issue to the Plaintiffs for $55,000, 
  all-inclusive.</p>
<p>
  [8] In my view, this was an error in law in that it amounts to a refusal to 
  exercise a discretion by permitting the rules governing offers to settle to 
  narrow or foreclose a departure from enforcement. There is no question that 
  the integrity of the offer to settle process depends upon clarity and certainty 
  in the application of Rule 49. That is why the offer in this case was held not 
  to contain a specified time for acceptance. However, once Rule 49 has been held 
  to apply to an offer and acceptance, the same strictures cannot govern the exercise 
  of a discretion to enforce a settlement. Otherwise clarity and certainty would 
  demand that there be no ambit for discretion.</p>
<p>
  [9] It should also be noted that the exercise of discretion to enforce a settlement 
  under rule 49.09 is distinct from that under rule 49.10 in awarding costs under 
  one scale or another. Circumstances might justify refusal to enforce a settlement 
  at the instance of the defendant, while the same or other considerations might 
  justify a refusal to award the higher level of costs for a plaintiff's offer 
  that is lower than the judgment. Neither ambit of discretion is dictated by 
  the need for certainty and clarity in the content of the offer. The offer and 
  acceptance have been tested under that standard, and it remains to assess the 
  surrounding circumstances to decide upon the exercise of the particular discretion.</p>
<p>
  [10] Following the motion before Hoy J., the trial judge issued reasons granting 
  the appellants judgment in the amount of $84,675.50 together with pre and post-judgment 
  interest. The record before this court does not indicate that costs have been 
  adjudicated.</p>
<p>
  [11] In the exercise of discretion I would follow the course hinted at by Hoy 
  J. I conclude that the court should exercise its discretion under rule 49.09(b) 
  and direct that the proceedings should continue as if there had been no accepted 
  offer to settle. My reasoning is that, while the appellants' trial lawyer should 
  have been more careful, he clearly thought the written offer was off the table 
  when he demanded a substantially higher settlement; just as clearly, the respondents' 
  lawyer knew from the amount of the new offer that the appellants' lawyer had 
  made that error. Further, it was unrealistic to conclude that the all inclusive 
  written offer was meant to stand in the face of four days of accumulated trial 
  costs. Respondents' counsel took advantage of appellants' counsel's mistake 
  on the eve of a judicially considered assessment of entitlement. It does not 
  satisfy my sense of justice to enforce the settlement in those circumstances. 
  Equity favours the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [12] At the opening of trial, the appellants' motion for an adjournment was 
  dismissed with costs fixed at $2,500.00. Hoy J. absorbed that $2,500.00 into 
  the settlement that she enforced. Her order is set aside and this revives the 
  $2,500.00 cost order in favour of the respondents.</p>
<p>
  [13] There should be no costs of this appeal or of the motion before Hoy J. 
  The appellants through their counsel were at fault in failing to withdraw the 
  offer and should not be rewarded with a costs order. The costs of the action 
  are left to be dealt with by Rouleau J. </p>
<p>
  [14] The respondents succeeded on the motion by the appellants at the opening 
  of the appeal for leave to withdraw their concession that the September 12 offer 
  was subject to Rule 49. The respondents are entitled to costs of that motion 
  in the amount of $2,500.00.</p>
