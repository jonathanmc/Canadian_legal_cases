<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Lang, Day and Czutrin JJ.) 
  dated November 19, 2001, reported at 57 O.R. (3d) 716.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal concerns the interpretation of the death benefit provision 
  set out in s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule - Accidents 
  on or after November 1, 1996, O. Reg. 403/96, as amended (the &quot;1996 SABS&quot;), 
  which forms part of Ontario's no-fault automobile insurance accident benefits 
  system.</p>
<p>
  I. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] Ewelina Fraczek was tragically killed in a motor vehicle accident in 1998, 
  when she was 17 years old. At the time of the accident, her father, Jan Fraczek, 
  was insured by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (&quot;State Farm&quot;) 
  under a standard Ontario automobile liability policy of insurance. After Ewelina's 
  death, Jan Fraczek and Ewelina's mother, Stanislawa Fraczek, jointly applied 
  to State Farm for the payment of death benefits. State Farm paid a death benefit 
  of $10,000 to Ewelina's father, but denied her mother's benefit claim on the 
  basis that s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 SABS requires it to pay only a single 
  death benefit of $10,000. </p>
<p>
  [3] Thereafter, Jan and Stanislawa Fraczek and two of Ewelina's surviving siblings 
  sued the owners and operators of the motor vehicles involved in the fatal accident, 
  claiming damages for negligence. They also sued State Farm, seeking a declaration 
  that Stanislawa Fraczek was entitled to receive a death benefit from it in the 
  sum of $10,000.</p>
<p>
  [4] On July 17, 2000, Stinson J. of the Superior Court of Justice dismissed 
  the respondents' claim against State Farm on a motion brought by the insurer 
  under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. In his 
  view, where multiple death benefit payments are required by the 1996 SABS, that 
  legislative intention is clearly expressed by reference to each potential payee. 
  As s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 SABS contains no express reference to more than 
  one potential payee, the motions judge concluded that only a single death benefit 
  payment is required by that provision. </p>
<p>
  [5] On appeal, the Divisional Court disagreed, holding that s. 25(2)(5)(i) requires 
  an insurer to pay a $10,000 death benefit to each person eligible under the 
  1996 SABS for payment of the benefit. Accordingly, on November 19, 2001, the 
  Divisional Court allowed the respondents' appeal from the dismissal of their 
  claim against State Farm, set aside the order of the motions judge, and reinstated 
  the respondents' claim against the insurer. State Farm appeals that decision. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the motions judge. Accordingly, 
  I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p>
  II. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE 1996 SABS</p>
<p> [7] As relevant to this appeal, the 1996 SABS provides as follows<a href="#1">[1]</a>:<a name="r1"></a></p>
<p class="indent"> 2(6) For the purpose of this Regulation, a person is a dependant 
  of another person if the person is principally dependent for financial support 
  or care on the other person or the other person's spouse.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> 25 (1) The insurer shall pay a death benefit in respect of 
  an insured person if he or she dies as [a] result of an accident&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) The death benefit shall provide for the following payments:</p>
<p class="indent15"> 1. A payment to the insured person's spouse of,</p>
<p class="indent20">i. $25,000, or</p>
<p class="indent20"> ii. if the optional death and funeral benefit referred to in 
  section 27 has been purchased and is applicable to the insured person, the amount 
  fixed by the optional benefit.</p>
<p class="indent15"> 2. A payment to each of the insured person's dependants, and 
  to each person to whom the insured person had an obligation at the time of the 
  accident to provide support under a domestic contract or court order, of, </p>
<p class="indent20"> i. $10,000, or </p>
<p class="indent20"> ii. if the optional death and funeral benefit referred to in 
  section 27 has been purchased and is applicable to the insured person, the amount 
  fixed by the optional benefit.</p>
<p class="indent15"> 3. If no payment is required by paragraph 1, an additional 
  payment of $25,000 to the insured person's dependants and the persons, other 
  than a former spouse of the insured person, to whom the insured person had an 
  obligation at the time of the accident to provide support under a domestic contract 
  or court order, to be divided equally among the persons entitled.</p>
<p class="indent15"> 4. A payment of $10,000 to each former spouse of the insured 
  person to whom the insured person was obligated at the time of the accident 
  to provide support under a domestic contract or court order.</p>
<p class="indent15"> 5. A payment of $10,000 to,</p>
<p class="indent20"> i. a person in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant 
  at the time of the accident,</p>
<p class="indent20"> ii. the spouse of a person in respect of whom the insured person 
  was a dependant at the time of the accident, if the spouse was the insured person's 
  primary caregiver at the time of the accident and the person in respect of whom 
  the insured person was a dependant at the time of the accident dies before the 
  insured person or within 30 days after the insured person, or</p>
<p class="indent20"> iii. the dependants of a person in respect of whom the insured 
  person was a dependant at the time of the accident, if no payment is required 
  by subparagraph i or ii, to be divided equally among the persons entitled.</p>
<p> <span class="indent">&#133;</span></p>
<p class="indent20">(4) If at the time of the accident the insured person had more 
  than one spouse who is entitled to a payment under this section, the payment 
  shall be divided equally among them.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> (6) In this section,</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;spouse&quot; means a person who was a spouse at 
  the time of the accident.</p>
<p>
  III. THE ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [8] It is common ground that Ewelina was an &quot;insured person&quot; under 
  the State Farm policy at the time of her death, thereby triggering the coverage 
  for death benefits under the State Farm policy. Further, for the purpose of 
  this appeal, the parties agree that Jan and Stanislawa Fraczek are both persons 
  &quot;in respect of whom [Ewelina] was a dependant at the time of the accident&quot;, 
  within the meaning of s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 SABS. Accordingly, the sole 
  issue on this appeal is whether the Divisional Court erred by concluding that 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 SABS obliges an insurer to pay a $10,000 death benefit 
  to each person eligible under the 1996 SABS for payment of the benefit.</p>
<p>
  IV. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [9] The contemporary approach to the interpretation of legislation in civil 
  cases is aptly summarized in R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 
  3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at 131:</p>
<p class="indent"> There is only one rule in modern interpretation, namely, courts 
  are obliged to determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having 
  regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, 
  the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible 
  external aids. In other words, the courts must consider and take into account 
  all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning. After taking 
  these into account, the court must then adopt an interpretation that is appropriate. 
  An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified in terms of (a) its 
  plausibility, that is, its compliance with the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, 
  that is, its promotion of the legislative purpose; and c) its acceptability, 
  that is, the outcome is reasonable and just [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  That general interpretative rule forms the backdrop for analysis of s. 25(2)(5)(i) 
  of the 1996 SABS. </p>
<p>
  (1) The Purpose of Section 25(2)(5)(i) </p>
<p>
  [10] The death benefits regime under the 1996 SABS has two components. Section 
  25(1) imposes an obligation on insurers to pay a death benefit if an insured 
  person dies as a result of an accident within prescribed times after the accident. 
  In turn, s. 25(2) creates a benefit payment scheme, which establishes the classes 
  of persons eligible to receive a death benefit, and the amount of the benefit. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] Under s. 25(2), the s. 25(1) death benefit must provide for payments to 
  the following classes of persons:</p>
<p class="indent20"> (i) the insured person's spouse (s. 25(2)(1));</p>
<p class="indent20"> (ii) the insured person's dependants and other persons to 
  whom the insured person was financially obligated at the time of the accident 
  under a domestic contract or court order (ss. 25(2)(2) and 25(2)(3)); </p>
<p class="indent20"> (iii) the former spouses of the insured person in certain 
  circumstances (s. 25(2)(4)); and </p>
<p class="indent20"> (iv) persons in respect of whom the insured person was a 
  dependant at the time of the accident or, in certain circumstances, the spouse 
  or dependants of a person in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant 
  at the time of the accident (s. 25(2)(5)).</p>
<p>
  [12] Thus, the 1996 SABS provides for compensation through a detailed payment 
  scheme to four classes of persons who, by virtue of their relationship to an 
  insured person, suffer loss on the death of the insured person in a car accident. 
  The quantum of the compensation varies according to the nature of the relationship 
  between the insured person and the claimant.</p>
<p>
  [13] The respondents assert that the payment under s. 25(2)(5)(i) usually arises 
  on the death of a child, and that its purpose is to recognize the loss of a 
  child's life to the person in respect of whom the child was a dependant. They 
  also argue that each person in respect of whom the insured child was a dependant 
  suffers a distinct loss, which is intended to be separately recognized by payment 
  of a death benefit. </p>
<p> [14] The Divisional Court addressed the purpose of s. 25(2)(5)(i) in these 
  terms: &quot;[T]he purpose of the Regulation&#133;is to provide modest financial 
  recognition of a parent's loss of their dependant. In this case, their dependant 
  child."</p>
<p>[15] In the late 1980's, a comprehensive review of motor vehicle accident compensation 
  in Ontario was undertaken. The recommendations contained in the ensuing Report 
  of Inquiry into Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation in Ontario (Toronto: Queen's 
  Printer for Ontario, 1988) influenced reform of the no-fault accident benefits 
  insurance regime in place in Ontario prior to 1990. In the Report, Osborne J. 
  (as he then was) stated in connection with death benefits (at p. 580):</p>
<p class="indent"> The no fault part of the standard automobile insurance policy 
  should contain a death benefit. The death benefit should not be linked to the 
  deceased's income, but should rather provide some reasonable short-term financial 
  assistance to survivors, responsive to the simple recognition of the value of 
  life. The death benefit should be modest but not insignificant. An inordinately 
  low death benefit will trivialize the value of life; an inordinately high death 
  benefit on the other hand, even if unrelated to income, will provide compensation 
  for those who have little or no need for it (especially if life insurance is 
  not deducted). Moreover, consumers should not be forced to purchase protection 
  which is in the nature of life insurance beyond an amount which gives tangible 
  recognition to the value of life. For those who require the additional protection 
  generally provided by life insurance that protection should be purchased on 
  a voluntary basis through the life insurance markets, or as part of optional 
  coverage under the automobile policy.</p>
<p>
  [16] The purpose of the death benefit envisaged by s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 
  SABS, in my view, conforms to the observations of Osborne J. In recognition 
  of the value of life, it is intended to provide modest, but not insignificant, 
  short-term financial assistance to those who survive the loss of a dependant. 
  For that reason, the benefit is available to defined classes of persons including, 
  but not limited to, parents who suffer the loss of a dependent child through 
  the tragedy of a motor vehicle accident. That legislative purpose informs the 
  interpretation of s. 25(2)(5)(i). </p>
<p>
  (2) The Legislative History of Section 25(2)(5)(i)</p>
<p>
  [17] In Ontario, the death benefits regime concerning insured victims of fatal 
  car accidents varies according to the date of the accident. In this case, as 
  Ewelina died in 1998, the payment of benefits concerning her death is governed 
  by the 1996 SABS. Had the accident occurred prior to January 1, 1994, the Statutory 
  Accident Benefits Schedule - Accidents before January 1, 1994, O. Reg. 672, 
  as amended (the &quot;1990 SABS&quot;), would apply. Similarly, had the accident 
  occurred after December 31, 1993 and before November 1, 1996, the Statutory 
  Accident Benefits Schedule - Accidents after December 31, 1993 and before November 
  1, 1996, O. Reg. 776/93, as amended (the &quot;1994 SABS&quot;), would apply.</p>
<p>
  [18] As the Divisional Court properly recognized, the legislative history of 
  a challenged statutory provision can serve as a useful indicator of legislative 
  intent: Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513 at 528. In this 
  case, in my view, the legislative history of s. 25(2)(5)(i) does not clearly 
  establish its intended meaning. For that reason, a detailed review of the differences 
  in the terminology of the applicable death benefits regimes under the 1990, 
  1994 and 1996 SABS is unnecessary. However, as two of those differences were 
  relied upon by the Divisional Court in support of its conclusion concerning 
  the meaning of s. 25(2)(5)(i), and as they were also the subject of lengthy 
  submissions by the parties before this court, I briefly address them. </p>
<p> [19] The 1990 SABS provides for a death benefit payment to &quot;the person 
  upon whom the deceased was dependent&quot;, or that person's spouse in certain 
  circumstances. Two aspects of that provision are significant. First, the concept 
  of &quot;dependency&quot; under the 1990 SABS is restricted in scope: it recognizes 
  financial dependency only, and not dependency for care or non-financial living 
  requirements.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> In contrast, the 1994 and 
  1996 SABS contain a broader definition of &quot;dependant&quot;, which recognizes 
  principal dependency &quot;for financial support or care&quot;. Under that expanded 
  definition, an insured person potentially can be a dependant of all of his or 
  her principal financial supporter, principal caregiver, and the spouses of those 
  persons.</p>
<p>
  [20] In addition, the applicable provisions of the 1990 SABS provide for a benefit 
  payment to &quot;the&quot; person upon whom a deceased was principally financially 
  dependent or, if &quot;that&quot; person is dead, to the surviving spouse of 
  &quot;that&quot; person, that is, to the surviving spouse of the principal financial 
  supporter, provided that the surviving spouse was the deceased's primary caregiver 
  (see ss. 3(2) and 11(1)(d)(i) of the 1990 SABS). The death benefit provision 
  of the 1994 SABS contains similar language, notwithstanding the expanded concept 
  of &quot;dependency&quot; under that schedule (see ss. 4 and 51(5)(a) of the 
  1994 SABS). </p>
<p>
  [21] The ordinary and grammatical meaning of the language of the benefit provisions 
  under the 1990 and 1994 SABS, in my view, thus clearly contemplates the payment 
  of a single death benefit. Under the 1990 SABS, in the first instance, the benefit 
  is payable to the deceased's principal financial supporter. Under the 1994 SABS, 
  in the first instance, the benefit is payable to either the deceased's principal 
  financial supporter or principal caregiver. Under both schedules, where the 
  principal payee is deceased, his or her surviving spouse is eligible for receipt 
  of the benefit so long as he or she was the deceased's &quot;primary caregiver&quot;. 
  (See, in connection with the 1994 SABS, Harris v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 
  [1998] O.F.S.C.I.D. No. 55 and, in connection with the 1990 SABS, Jarvis v. 
  Allstate Insurance Co., [1996] O.I.C.D. No. 148.)</p>
<p>
  [22] In contrast, s. 25(2)(5)(i) of the 1996 SABS provides for a benefit payment 
  to &quot;a&quot; person &quot;in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant&quot; 
  at the time of the accident. The introductory words of s. 25(2)(5)(i) in the 
  French language version of the section read: &quot;soit &agrave; une personne&quot; 
  which, in the English language, means &quot;either to a person&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [23] The Divisional Court regarded the change from &quot;the person&quot; in 
  the 1994 (and 1990) SABS to &quot;a person&quot; in the 1996 SABS as significant. 
  It said: &quot;Presumably there was a purpose for that change. Further, the 
  subsection is, by application of the definition of dependant in s. 2(6), applicable 
  to more than one person.&quot; The Divisional Court concluded:</p>
<p class="indent"> Given the ambiguity of the provision, the interpretation most 
  consistent with the purpose of the legislation, the context of this section 
  in the regulatory scheme for death benefits, the recent recognition by the legislature 
  of caregivers in addition to financial providers, and the most efficacious interpretation, 
  we are of the view that ss. 25(2)(5)(i) requires the insurer to make payments 
  of $10,000.00 to each of the two persons who qualify under s. 2(6).</p>
<p>
  [24] In reliance on the Divisional Court's holding that s. 25(2)(5)(i) is ambiguous, 
  the respondents argue that s. 25(2)(5)(i) should be interpreted in accordance 
  with the reasonable expectations of the parties and the contra proferentem rule. 
  They assert that if s. 25(2)(5)(i), read fairly, is capable of being interpreted 
  as mandating either a single benefit payment or, alternatively, multiple death 
  benefit payments, the interpretation most favourable to the insured should prevail. 
  However, if the principles of interpretation relied upon by the respondents 
  can have any application to the interpretation of legislation, they nonetheless 
  apply only where there is genuine ambiguity as to the meaning of an impugned 
  provision: Hope v. Canadian General Insurance (2002), 158 O.A.C. 311 at 315 
  and Chilton v. Co-Operators General Insurance Co. (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 161 at 
  168-69 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [25] With respect, I do not agree that s. 25(2)(5)(i) is ambiguous on its face. 
  The rules of statutory interpretation presume that every word in a statute makes 
  sense, and has a specific role to play in advancing the legislative purpose 
  of the enactment: R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, supra 
  at 159-60. Accordingly, in this case, the Legislature's use of the phrase &quot;a 
  person&quot; in s. 25(2)(5)(i), rather than the phrase &quot;the person&quot;, 
  which appears in the companion provisions of the 1990 and 1994 SABS, must be 
  understood as purposive.</p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, the intent of the use of the phrase &quot;a person&quot; in 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i) is to recognize the expanded definition of &quot;dependant&quot; 
  originally introduced under the 1994 SABS and carried forward in s. 2(6) of 
  the 1996 SABS, whereby the persons who are potentially eligible for receipt 
  of the death benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(i) can be any of the insured's principal 
  financial supporter, principal caregiver or, in some circumstances, the spouses 
  of those persons. That inclusive approach to the class of potential benefit 
  payees seeks to avoid devaluing the importance in contemporary society of caregivers, 
  as opposed to financial supporters. The grammatical and ordinary meaning of 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i) thus holds open the possibility that payment of a benefit under 
  that section to more than one person can be required of the insurer. In that 
  sense, s. 25(2)(5)(i) is not ambiguous.</p>
<p>
  (3) The Legislative Context of Section 25(2)(5)(i)</p>
<p>
  [27] The 1996 SABS provides for the payment of various benefits and expenses 
  consequent upon the involvement in or injury of an insured in an automobile 
  accident. Section 25(2)(5)(i) is contained in Part VII of the 1996 SABS, which 
  concerns death and funeral benefits. It is important to recognize that s. 25(2)(5)(i) 
  is one part only, albeit a significant part, of the larger death benefits regime 
  established by s. 25. In that context, the language of the death benefits regime 
  under s. 25 and of the benefit payment scheme under s. 25(2), the risk underlying 
  the insurance coverage provided by s. 25(2)(5)(i), and the inter-relationship 
  of ss. 25(2)(5)(i), (ii) and (iii) are relevant to determining the intended 
  meaning of s. 25(2)(5)(i). I consider each of those factors in turn.</p>
<p> (a) The language of the death benefits regime:<br>
  equal division of a single benefit payment</p>
<p>
  [28] It is apparent, upon review of s. 25 as a whole, that where the Legislature 
  intended that a single death benefit be equally divided by the insurer among 
  multiple claimants, that intention is clearly expressed. Thus, s. 25(4) provides 
  that if, at the time of the accident, &quot;the insured person had more than 
  one spouse who is entitled to a payment&quot; under s. 25, the payment &quot;shall 
  be divided equally among them.&quot; Similarly, the equal division by the insurer 
  of one death benefit among the persons entitled to it is mandated by the express 
  language of ss. 25(2)(3) and 25(2)(5)(iii). The absence of such language in 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i) suggests that the Legislature did not intend that an insurer 
  divide a payment made under that section between or among multiple claimants. 
  It does not automatically follow, however, that s. 25(2)(5)(i) does not contemplate 
  a joint payment of a single $10,000 benefit where more than one claimant is 
  eligible to receive the benefit.</p>
<p> (b) The language of the benefit payment scheme:<br>
  multiple benefit payments</p>
<p>
  [29] In some instances, the language of s. 25(2) of the 1996 SABS clearly requires 
  multiple benefit payments. For example, s. 25(2)(2) provides for &quot;[a] payment 
  to each of the insured person's dependants&quot; and to &quot;each person&quot; 
  to whom the insured person was financially obligated by a domestic contract 
  or court order at the time of the accident. Similar language is contained in 
  s. 25(2)(4), which provides for &quot;[a] payment of $10,000&quot; to &quot;each 
  former spouse&quot; of the insured person, in certain circumstances. In contrast, 
  although s. 25(2)(5) also provides for &quot;[a] payment of $10,000&quot;, no 
  express reference is made in that section to more than one payee; nor is reference 
  made therein to &quot;each&quot; of several potential payees.</p>
<p>
  [30] The motions judge observed, &quot;[w]here multiple payments were contemplated 
  to be made, the regulation expressly refers to each potential payee&quot;. The 
  absence of express reference in s. 25(2)(5)(i) to payment of a benefit to each 
  of several payees is one indicator of legislative intention. In this case, it 
  favours the conclusion that s. 25(2)(5)(i) does not require payment of more 
  than a single $10,000 death benefit. That interpretation is strengthened by 
  the introductory language of s. 25(2)(5), which refers to &quot;a payment of 
  $10,000&quot;. </p>
<p>
  (c) Risk exposure under s. 25(2)(5)(i)</p>
<p>
  [31] Section 25(1) of the 1996 SABS, as a liability provision, imposes liability 
  on insurers for the payment of death benefits in accordance with the payment 
  scheme established by s. 25(2). Under s. 11(1)(d)(i) of the 1990 SABS and s. 
  51(5)(a) of the 1994 SABS, the liability of the insurer is confined to one payee. 
  Under the former provision, the payee is the principal financial supporter of 
  the insured. Under the latter provision, the payee is either the insured's principal 
  financial supporter or caregiver or, in some circumstances, the surviving spouse 
  of those persons. Can it reasonably be concluded that the Legislature intended 
  to double an insurer's risk exposure in 1996 by the mere change of the phrase 
  &quot;the person&quot; to the phrase &quot;a person&quot; in s. 25(2)(5)(i)?</p>
<p>
  [32] In Snaak (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance 
  Co. (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 230, this court considered the decisions of superior 
  court judges in Wilkieson-Valiente v. Wilkieson et al, [1996] I.L.R. I-3351 
  (Ont. Gen. Div.) and G.P. v. D.J., [2001] O.J. No. 313 (S.C.), in which a distinction 
  was drawn, when interpreting exclusion clauses in insurance policies, between 
  the phrases &quot;an insured&quot; and &quot;the insured&quot;. MacPherson J.A. 
  stated in connection with that form of reasoning (at paras. 31 and 37):</p>
<p class="indent"> I need not finally decide whether [the distinction drawn in 
  the Wilkieson case] is correct or incorrect. However, in my view, the distinction&#133;between 
  &quot;an&quot; and &quot;the&quot; is a fine one. </p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Judicial distinctions between the single words &quot;any&quot; 
  and &quot;the&quot;, and different results flowing from such distinctions, strike 
  me as overly refined and, potentially, unfair in a matter as important as insurance 
  coverage.</p>
<p>
  [33] While those observations applied to the interpretation of an exclusion 
  clause in an insurance policy, in respect of which ambiguity was resolved in 
  favour of the insured, I think that they are also apposite here. In particular, 
  it is significant that all of the 1990, 1994 and 1996 SABS remain in force, 
  although their application varies depending upon the date of the accident in 
  question and, in the future, the 1990 and 1994 SABS will cease to be operative 
  by the passage of time. The applicable death benefit provision in the 1990 and 
  1994 SABS requires payment of only a single death benefit. If the Legislature 
  intended to materially increase the risk exposure of insurers under the 1996 
  SABS concerning the same type of death benefit, payable for the same social 
  purpose, I think that it is reasonable to assume that a clearer signification 
  of such an intention would be evident. To conclude otherwise would result in 
  two fundamentally different risk exposures, for the same insurance cover, conditional 
  only on the date of the fatal accident. The value of life intended to be recognized 
  by the death benefit does not vary with the date of death.</p>
<p>
  (d) The inter-relationship of ss. 25(2)(5)(i), (ii) and (iii)</p>
<p>
  [34] Section 25(2)(5), read as a whole, provides for &quot;a payment of $10,000&quot; 
  to three classes of persons:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) under s. 25(2)(5)(i), to &quot;a person in respect of whom 
  the insured person was a dependant at the time of the accident&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) under s. 25(2)(5)(ii), to the spouse of &quot;a person in 
  respect of whom the insured person was a dependant at the time of the accident&quot; 
  if that person is deceased and the surviving spouse was the insured person's 
  primary caregiver at the time of the accident; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) under s. 25(2)(5)(iii), to the dependants of &quot;a person 
  in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant at the time of the accident&quot;, 
  if no payment is required by ss. 25(2)(5)(i) or (ii).</p>
<p>
  What meaning is to be attributed to each of those provisions?</p>
<p>
  (i) Section 25(2)(5)(iii)</p>
<p>
  [35] Section 25(2)(5)(iii) is concerned with the dependants of &quot;a person 
  in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant at the time of the accident&quot;. 
  It requires a payment of $10,000 to such dependants only &quot;if no payment 
  is required by subparagraph i or ii&quot;. Further, a payment to dependants 
  under that section must be &quot;divided equally among the persons entitled.&quot; 
  Section 25(2)(5)(iii) thus provides for receipt by dependants of the benefit 
  otherwise payable to other persons under ss. 25(2)(5)(i) or (ii). A single benefit 
  payment of $10,000 is contemplated, as is division of that benefit where more 
  than one dependant exists.</p>
<p>
  [36] In my view, the alternative nature of the payment mandated by s. 25(2)(5)(iii), 
  and the requirement thereunder for equal division of the benefit payment, confirms 
  that a cap of $10,000 applies to the payment to be made under that section. 
  That conclusion also informs the interpretation of ss. 25(2)(5)(i) and (ii). 
  It strongly suggests that a cap of $10,000 applies to s. 25(2)(5) as a whole.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Section 25(2)(5)(ii)</p>
<p>
  [37] Section 25(2)(5)(ii) concerns a single potential death benefit recipient: 
  &quot;the spouse of a person in respect of whom the insured person was a dependant 
  at the time of the accident&quot;. To be eligible for receipt of a benefit under 
  s. 25(2)(5)(ii), the spouse must have been the insured person's &quot;primary 
  caregiver at the time of the accident&quot;. In addition, the insured's principal 
  financial supporter must have died before, or within 30 days after, the insured 
  person. In turn, s. 25(2)(5)(i) provides for a death benefit payment to a person 
  in respect of whom the insured person was &quot;a dependant&quot; at the time 
  of the accident. Given the definition of &quot;dependant&quot; under s. 2(6) 
  of the 1996 SABS, an insured may be dependent on any of his or her principal 
  financial supporter or caregiver, or the spouses of those persons, or some combination 
  of them. </p>
<p>
  [38] Thus, a spouse of a deceased principal financial supporter or caregiver 
  of the insured person may be entitled to a benefit payment under s. 25(2)(5)(i). 
  If that section permits payment of a benefit to a spouse, in what circumstances 
  does s. 25(2)(5)(ii) apply? Further, if s. 25(2)(5)(i) permits multiple benefit 
  payments, that is, payment of a benefit to a spouse and to the principal financial 
  supporter or caregiver of the insured person, is s. 25(2)(5)(ii) redundant?</p>
<p>
  [39] The following example affords an illustration of the potential redundancy 
  of s. 25(2)(5)(ii): when: (a) the insured's principal caregiver and financial 
  supporter at the time of the accident are spouses and the parents of the insured; 
  and (b) the insured's father is the insured's principal financial supporter 
  and the insured's mother is the insured's principal caregiver, as the parties 
  agree applies in this case, then both parents are eligible for a $10,000 death 
  benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(i). The insured's mother is eligible because she was 
  the principal caregiver of the insured at the time of the accident and, as well, 
  because she is the spouse of the principal financial supporter of the insured. 
  In those circumstances, if the insured's father dies before, or within 30 days 
  after, the insured person, s. 25(2)(5)(ii) is redundant; the spouse of the insured's 
  principal financial supporter already qualifies for a $10,000 death benefit 
  under s. 25(2)(5)(i) because she was also the insured's principal caregiver 
  at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>
  [40] Such redundancy is avoided, in my view, if s. 25(2)(5)(i) is interpreted 
  as requiring payment of only a single $10,000 death benefit. Under that interpretation, 
  the insured's father, as the insured's principal financial supporter, qualifies 
  for a s. 25(2)(5)(i) benefit payment, as does the insured's mother and principal 
  caregiver. However, as only a single death benefit payment may be made under 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i), both parents cannot receive a benefit of $10,000 under that 
  section. Does it follow that the insurer is obliged to choose between the insured's 
  principal financial supporter and caregiver for the purpose of the benefit payment? 
  In my view, the Divisional Court rightly rejected that proposition. </p>
<p>
  [41] Rather, I conclude that a joint payment of $10,000 to the insured's principal 
  financial supporter and caregiver satisfies the insurer's payment obligation 
  under s. 25(2)(5)(i), meets the objective of the section and, importantly, gives 
  meaning to s. 25(2)(5)(ii). That approach has the following potential outcomes. 
  First, if the insured's principal financial supporter and caregiver are spouses 
  and the benefit payment is made jointly to them, and the principal financial 
  supporter dies before, or within 30 days after, the insured person, the surviving 
  spouse of that supporter is entitled under s. 25(2)(5)(ii) to receive the deceased 
  supporter's share of the $10,000 death benefit, so long as the surviving spouse 
  was the insured person's primary caregiver at the time of the accident. As the 
  principal caregiver of the insured, who is eligible to share in the benefit 
  payment under s. 25(2)(5)(i), is also the person who was the &quot;primary&quot; 
  caregiver of the insured at the time of the accident, he or she thus receives 
  part of the $10,000 death benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(i) and the remaining part 
  of the $10,000 death benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(ii), so long as the caregiver 
  was also the spouse of the insured person's principal financial supporter. In 
  the result, the insured's caregiver ultimately receives the entire $10,000 death 
  benefit.</p>
<p>
  [42] Alternatively, it is possible that the insured person's principal financial 
  supporter and caregiver at the time of the accident are not spouses. That scenario 
  results in the following outcome: the $10,000 death benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(i) 
  is payable in the first instance jointly to the principal financial supporter 
  and caregiver. If the principal financial supporter dies before, or within 30 
  days after, the insured person, his or her surviving spouse is not eligible 
  for receipt of any part of the death benefit because, under s. 25(2)(5)(ii), 
  he or she was not the &quot;primary&quot; caregiver of the insured person at 
  the time of the accident and, under s. 25(2)(5)(i), he or she was not the &quot;principal&quot; 
  caregiver of the insured person at the time of the accident. In the result, 
  the entire $10,000 death benefit is payable to the insured person's principal 
  caregiver under s. 25(2)(5)(i) and s. 25(2)(5)(ii) does not apply.</p>
<p>
  [43] As appears from the foregoing examples, under either scenario, the principal 
  caregiver of the insured person receives the entire $10,000 death benefit upon 
  the death of the insured person's principal financial supporter, either by application 
  of s. 25(2)(5)(i) or by the combined operation of s. 25(2)(5)(i) and (ii). That 
  outcome accords with the expanded concept of &quot;dependency&quot; which underlies 
  s. 25(2)(5)(i), by recognizing the benefit entitlement under that section of 
  both the principal financial supporter and caregiver. It also avoids the redundancy 
  of s. 25(2)(5)(ii). Further, it is consistent with the indication in s. 25(2)(5)(iii) 
  that a cap of $10,000 applies to the entirety of s. 25(2)(5). Finally, it advances 
  the purpose of the death benefit by ensuring that the benefit is paid in full 
  to the person or persons who principally supported the deceased insured during 
  his or her life.</p>
<p>
  [44] The respondents advance a different interpretation of ss. 25(2)(5)(i) and 
  (ii). They argue that multiple payments under s. 25(2)(5)(i) need not result 
  in the redundancy of s. 25(2)(5)(ii). They submit that when: (a) the insured's 
  principal caregiver and financial supporter at the time of the accident are 
  spouses; and (b) the principal financial supporter dies before, or within 30 
  days after, the insured person, then the principal caregiver of the insured 
  person qualifies under s. 25(2)(5)(i) for a $10,000 benefit payment and under 
  s. 25(2)(5)(ii) for an additional $10,000 benefit payment. </p>
<p>
  [45] The respondents' argument has been accepted by some insurance arbitrators 
  in Ontario (see, for example, Hisson v. Zurich Insurance Co., [2001] O.F.S.C.I.D. 
  No. 70). It is a possible interpretation of the application of ss. 25(2)(5)(i) 
  and 25(2)(5)(ii). However, I am not persuaded that it is the most reasonable 
  interpretation. It would result in the payment of multiple $10,000 death benefits, 
  by the combined operation of ss. 25(2)(5)(i) and (ii), in the absence of a clear 
  indication of a legislative intention to require same, and in the face of a 
  clear requirement for multiple benefit payments contained in other provisions 
  of the same benefit payment scheme of which ss. 25(2)(5)(i) and (ii) form a 
  part. In addition, it is inconsistent with the terms of s. 25(2)(5)(iii), which 
  suggest that a single death benefit of $10,000 is contemplated under both that 
  section and under s. 25(2)(5) as a whole. Finally, in my view, it is also inconsistent 
  with the recommendation of Osborne J., in his Report of Inquiry into Motor Vehicle 
  Accident Compensation in Ontario, supra, concerning death benefits. In considering 
  the reform of the death benefits regime in effect in Ontario prior to 1990, 
  under which &quot;dependency&quot; was related to financial dependency on the 
  &quot;head of the household&quot; or his or her spouse, Osborne J. said (at 
  p. 581):</p>
<p class="indent"> [I]n my view, the death benefit should be $25,000 for the death 
  of the head of the household or the death of the spouse of the head of the household. 
  An additional $10,000 should be paid for each dependant of the head of the household 
  or spouse. If a dependant child is killed, the death benefit would be $10,000 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  (4) Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [46] I conclude that an interpretation of s. 25(2)(5)(i) that requires payment 
  of a single death benefit is the most efficacious interpretation of that section, 
  consistent with its legislative context and purpose, and one which ensures a 
  meaningful application of the entire benefit payment scheme established by s. 
  25(2) of the 1996 SABS, including s. 25(2)(5)(ii). Consequently, only a single 
  $10,000 benefit payment is required under s. 25(2)(5)(i). That payment, in some 
  circumstances, should be paid jointly to the insured person's principal financial 
  supporter and caregiver. Implicit in that requirement is the expectation that 
  the joint recipients of the benefit payment will share the payment equally, 
  or in such other proportion as they may agree.</p>
<p>
  [47] In this case, State Farm paid the $10,000 death benefit under s. 25(2)(5)(i) 
  to Jan Fraczek, as Ewelina's principal financial supporter at the time of the 
  accident. In accordance with the observations of the motions judge and these 
  reasons, that payment should have been made jointly to Jan and Stanislawa Fraczek. 
  However, the declaratory relief sought by the respondents against State Farm 
  concerns payment in favour of Stanislawa Fraczek of a $10,000 death benefit. 
  That claim cannot proceed.</p>
<p>V. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [48] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would allow the appeal. As State 
  Farm does not seek its costs of this appeal, I would award no costs.</p>
