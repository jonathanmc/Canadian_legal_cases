<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Peter A. Cumming of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 20, 2002.<br>
  <br>
  SIMMONS J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] In the early 1990's, Mutual Trust Company failed to advance on a commitment 
  to provide individual unit purchase-money financing for a 300-unit residential 
  condominium built by Reemark Sterling I Limited. Mutual's financing was intended 
  to replace a construction loan from Bank of America Canada (&quot;the Bank&quot;). 
  In a prior action, the Bank sued Mutual successfully, and, on appeal, this court 
  specifically rejected Mutual's defence that it was Reemark's fault that Mutual 
  failed to advance. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] In this action, some of the original unit purchasers are suing Reemark 
  and Mutual's successor Clarica Trust Company, for losses arising from the failure 
  to complete their agreements of purchase and sale. Reemark and Clarica are cross-claiming 
  against each other. Each blames the other for the failure to advance.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The issues on this appeal relate to the proper application of the doctrines 
  of cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and abuse of process. The motion 
  judge found that Reemark is not barred from claiming against Clarica by cause 
  of action estoppel. However, he determined that Clarica is barred by issue estoppel 
  and abuse of process from disputing its liability to Reemark. Clarica appeals 
  against his decision.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>Background<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In the late 1980's, Reemark decided to build a 300 unit residential condominium. 
  In order to obtain construction financing, it was necessary that Reemark first 
  obtain a financing commitment from a lender willing to provide individual unit 
  financing once the project was completed. On November 12, 1987, Mutual provided 
  Reemark with a &quot;Take-out Commitment&quot; (the &quot;TOC&quot;) for that 
  purpose. Under the TOC, the proceeds of Mutual's unit mortgages were to be paid 
  to Reemark in a single advance of $36.5 million so that Reemark could pay off 
  its construction loan and transfer clear title to the unit purchasers. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] On the strength of the TOC, Reemark obtained a $33 million construction 
  loan from the Bank. On December 16, 1988, Reemark gave the Bank a general security 
  agreement and a general assignment of book debts as security for that loan. 
  In addition, Reemark, Mutual, and the Bank signed an &quot;Assignment of the 
  Take-out Commitment&quot; (the &quot;TOC Assignment&quot;) in favour of the 
  Bank.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] While the condominium project was under construction, real estate values 
  declined dramatically. When the project was completed, Mutual failed to pay 
  the monies owing under the TOC. Although the parties negotiated amendments to 
  the TOC in an Amended Take-out Commitment (the &quot;ATOC&quot;) signed December 
  18, 1991, Mutual's obligation to pay continued under the ATOC as well, and its 
  failure to perform left Reemark's construction loan from the Bank unpaid.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] On May 12, 1992, the Bank appointed a receiver-manager of the condominium 
  project. Subsequently, on June 2, 1992, the Bank sued Mutual claiming specific 
  performance of the TOC as assigned and amended, and, in the alternative, damages. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[9] When the receiver-manager attempted to sell the condominium project, Reemark 
  applied for an order preventing the sale. In minutes of settlement (the &quot;Minutes 
  of Settlement&quot;) signed by Reemark, the Bank, and the receiver-manager, 
  on March 3, 1993, the parties agreed as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>i) litigation between Reemark and the Bank would stop;<br>
</p>
<p>ii) Reemark would not attempt to prevent the sale of the condominium project;<br>
</p>
<p>iii) once the condominium was sold, the Bank would terminate the receiver-manager's 
  appointment;<br>
</p>
<p>iv) the Bank would be entitled to pursue its claim for any damages it suffered 
  in its action against Mutual; and<br>
</p>
<p>v) Reemark would be entitled to sue Mutual without interference by the receiver-manager 
  for any damages that Reemark may have suffered as a result of Mutual's actions 
  so long as its action was &quot;only for any damages in excess of the damages 
  suffered by the Bank&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] On May 20, 1993, the receiver-manager sold the condominium project and 
  applied the proceeds of sale to the Bank's outstanding construction loan. On 
  July 16, 1993, the Bank abandoned its claim for specific performance against 
  Mutual and amended the quantum of damages that it claimed. <br>
</p>
<p>[11] On June 23, 1995, several individual unit purchasers commenced this action 
  claiming damages for breach of their agreements of purchase and sale. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] On October 30, 1995, Mutual filed a defence to this action and cross-claimed 
  against Reemark for damages as well as for any sums that it was required to 
  pay to the plaintiffs. In particular, Mutual claimed that misconduct by Reemark 
  relieved it from any obligation to advance the unit financing. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] On November 17, 1995, Reemark filed a defence to this action, a defence 
  to Mutual's cross-claim, and a cross-claim against Mutual for lost profits on 
  the condominium project as well as for any sums that it was required to pay 
  to the plaintiffs.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] On April 14, 1998, the Bank obtained judgment in its action against Mutual. 
  Although Mutual pleaded that it was discharged from performance of the TOC and 
  the ATOC by Reemark's misconduct, the trial judge found that the Bank was a 
  lender for value without notice and that &quot;while [Mutual] may have been 
  able to rely on breaches of [a separate agreement] to fend off any Reemark claim&quot;, 
  it could not do so vis-&agrave;-vis the Bank. <br>
</p>
<p>[15] Mutual appealed, contending that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  the Bank was a lender for value without notice and in failing to hold that the 
  Bank was bound by the equities between Mutual and Reemark. On March 10, 2000, 
  this court affirmed the trial judgment as to liability and damages. Significantly, 
  this court rejected the submissions underlying the position that Mutual &quot;may 
  have had the right to refuse to perform at the instance of Reemark&quot;, and 
  concluded that it was unnecessary to determine whether the Bank was a lender 
  for value without notice or subject to the equities between Reemark and Mutual. 
  This court affirmed the trial judge's findings that it was Mutual that breached 
  the TOC and the ATOC<a href="#1">[1]</a>.<a name="r1"></a><br>
</p>
<p>[16] On October 25, 2001, Reemark amended its cross-claim against Clarica, 
  claiming that Clarica is bound by this court's decision in the Bank action rejecting 
  Mutual's claims that it was Reemark that breached the TOC and the ATOC. Clarica 
  responded with a pleading that Reemark's claim against Clarica is barred by 
  cause of action estoppel or abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] Both parties moved under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 
  1990, Reg. 194, for an order corresponding to their amended pleading. On February 
  6, 2002, the motion judge found that Clarica is bound by the decision of this 
  court that it was Mutual and not Reemark that breached the TOC and the ATOC 
  based on issue estoppel. He also held that it would constitute an abuse of process 
  to permit Clarica to re-litigate that issue. Although the motion judge found 
  that Reemark and the Bank are privies, he determined that they have separate 
  causes of action, and that cause of action estoppel does not bar Reemark's claim.<br>
</p>
<p>Grounds of Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Clarica raises two grounds of appeal:<br>
</p>
<p>i) the motion judge erred in failing to hold that Reemark's cross-claim against 
  Clarica is barred by cause of action estoppel or abuse of process; and <br>
</p>
<p>ii) in the alternative, the motion judge erred in declaring that Clarica is 
  liable to Reemark for breach of the TOC and the ATOC based on issue estoppel 
  or abuse of process.</p>
<p>Analysis<br>
</p>
<p>1. Did the motion judge err in failing to hold that Reemark's cross-claim against 
  Clarica is barred by cause of action estoppel or abuse of process?<br>
</p>
<p>[19] Clarica's submission that Reemark's cross-claim is barred by cause of 
  action estoppel can be expressed in two ways. <br>
</p>
<p>[20] Simply put, Clarica submits, based on the security documents and the Bank's 
  status as an assignee of Reemark, that Reemark and the Bank share a single cause 
  of action for damages arising from Clarica's alleged breaches of the TOC and 
  the ATOC, and that, because the Bank has now obtained a judgment for its damages, 
  cause of action estoppel precludes Reemark from suing Mutual a second time for 
  additional damages arising from the same cause. <br>
</p>
<p>[21] Expressed more technically, Clarica contends that that there are three 
  elements of cause of action estoppel, that only the third element is seriously 
  in issue in this case, and that six factors support the conclusion that the 
  third element has been met.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] The three elements that Clarica claims comprise cause of action estoppel 
  are as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>i) a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in a prior action; 
  <br>
</p>
<p>ii) the subject matter of the subsequent proceeding must be the same as the 
  subject matter of the prior proceeding (the &quot;identity of subject matter 
  requirement&quot;); and<br>
</p>
<p>iii) the parties in the subsequent litigation must have been parties to, or 
  in privity with, the parties to the prior proceeding (the &quot;mutuality requirement&quot;).<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The six factors Clarica relies on as supporting the conclusion that Reemark 
  should be considered a privy of the Bank relate to the Bank's status as an assignee 
  of Reemark, Clarica's assertion that Reemark and the Bank share a single cause 
  of action, and the extent of co-operation between Reemark and the Bank in the 
  Bank action.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] In the alternative, Clarica claims that Reemark and the Bank agreed deliberately 
  to split their cause of action as part of a common strategy to insulate Reemark 
  witnesses from cross-examination. It submits that it would be an abuse of process 
  to permit Reemark to advance its claim now, when Reemark chose not to join in 
  the Bank's proceeding in order to obtain a tactical advantage. <br>
</p>
<p>[25] Reemark responds that cause of action estoppel does not apply because 
  the Bank and Reemark have independent causes of action. <br>
</p>
<p>[26] I accept Reemark's submission that Reemark and the Bank have independent 
  causes of action. However, that in itself, does not negative Clarica's claim 
  that cause of action estoppel applies. Clarica relied on its submission that 
  Reemark and the Bank share a single cause of action to support its claim that 
  Reemark and the Bank are privies. However, Reemark, too, asserts that it is 
  a privy of the Bank. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether Reemark's 
  response negatives Clarica's claim of cause of action estoppel in some other 
  way. <br>
</p>
<p>[27] In my view, the conclusion that Reemark and the Bank have independent 
  causes of action relates more fundamentally to the second element of cause of 
  action estoppel, namely whether Reemark's claim is one that should have been 
  determined in the Bank action. <br>
</p>
<p>[28] I conclude that Reemark was not obliged to litigate its claim in the Bank 
  action, and that the second element of cause of action estoppel has not therefore, 
  been satisfied.<br>
</p>
<p>a) Do Reemark and the Bank share a single cause of action?<br>
</p>
<p>[29] Clarica contends that the Bank's cause of action against Clarica arises 
  from its status as Reemark's assignee, and that the Bank not only asserted Reemark's 
  cause of action, it claimed some of Reemark's remedies. <br>
</p>
<p>[30] I disagree. The provisions of the TOC Assignment determine this issue. 
  The highlighted portions of paragraph 1(d) set out below make it clear the TOC 
  Assignment was more than a simple assignment. Rather, it is a tripartite agreement 
  in which Reemark irrevocably directs Mutual to pay the entire proceeds of the 
  TOC to the Bank and in which Mutual agrees to do so. In my view, Mutual's independent 
  promise creates separate and distinct rights of action in favour of each of 
  Reemark and the Bank for payment of the entire proceeds of the TOC as well as 
  for damages for failing to perform. <br>
</p>
<p>[31] The relevant portions of the TOC Assignment are as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. (d) [Reemark] hereby irrevocably directs and authorizes 
  [Mutual] to advance all proceeds of the Takeout Financing to the Bank and [Mutual] 
  hereby agrees to advance all such proceeds to the Bank until receipt of written 
  notice from the Bank to the contrary; [emphasis added]<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(e) immediately upon receipt of written notice from 
  the Bank that it is entitled to enforce its remedies against [Reemark] pursuant 
  to the Loan Agreement, [Mutual] will, upon the terms of the Commitment, from 
  the date of such notice deal with the Bank or any receiver or receiver-manager 
  appointed by the Bank as if the Bank or any such receiver or receiver-manager 
  had been originally named in the Takeout Commitment in the place of [Reemark];<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(f) [Reemark] and [Mutual] agree that unless and until 
  notice under subparagraph (e) is given by the Bank, the Bank shall not be in 
  any way liable to [Mutual] under the Commitment or hereunder and the Borrower 
  [Reemark] shall be entitled and be obligated to continue to perform all of its 
  obligations on its part contained in the Takeout Commitment.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] It is common ground that, at least prior to the Bank's statement of claim, 
  the notice of default referred to in paragraphs 1 (e) and (f) was never given. 
  Although Reemark may have been disentitled from commencing an action when the 
  receiver-manager was appointed, Clarica does not dispute Reemark's claim that 
  it regained that right under the Minutes of Settlement. In my view, it is irrelevant 
  that the Bank may have been claiming a remedy it acquired through Reemark when 
  it sued Mutual for specific performance of the TOC under the TOC Assignment. 
  Once the condominium project was sold, the Bank deleted the claim for specific 
  performance and amended its claim for damages to correspond with the amount 
  outstanding on its construction loan to Reemark. Reemark and the Bank did not 
  split a single cause of action when they signed the Minutes of Settlement. Rather, 
  they restored the status quo.<br>
</p>
<p>a) Has the second element of cause of action estoppel been satisfied?<br>
</p>
<p>[33] The essence of Clarica's position is that Reemark's claim should have 
  decided in the Bank action. In my view, that submission relates fundamentally 
  to the second element of cause of action estoppel.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] For ease of reference, I will repeat Clarica's statement of the second 
  element of cause of action estoppel:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The subject matter of the subsequent proceeding must 
  be the same as the subject matter of the prior proceeding (the &quot;identity 
  of subject matter requirement&quot;)<br>
</p>
<p>[35] To support its summary of the elements of cause of action estoppel, Clarica 
  relies on a statement of the general rule of the &quot;constituent elements 
  of estoppel by res judicata&quot; in The Law of Evidence<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  in Canada at p. 1070. In a discussion about the second element of cause of action 
  estoppel at pp. 1078-1082, the authors note that &quot;it is necessary to bear 
  in mind that an adjudication on a particular set of facts does not raise an 
  estoppel with respect to every cause of action which is subsequently based on 
  the same facts, but only those claims which properly belonged to the first proceedings&quot;. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[36] The authors also cite Cromwell J.A.'s conclusion in Hoque v. Montreal 
  Trust Co.,<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> at p. 1079:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;while there are some very broad statements that 
  all matters that could have been raised are barred under the principle of cause 
  of action estoppel, none of the cases actually demonstrates this broad principle. 
  In each case, the issue was whether the party should have raised the point now 
  asserted in the second action. [emphasis in the original]<br>
</p>
<p>[37] Finally, the authors note that Cromwell J.A. went on in Hoque, at para. 
  64, to list a variety of factors that may be considered in determining whether 
  a matter should have been raised in earlier litigation. Those factors are set 
  out below. The factors that are applicable to this case are highlighted:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">That turns on a number of considerations, including 
  whether the new allegations are inconsistent with matters actually decided in 
  the earlier case, whether it relates to the same or a distinct cause of action, 
  whether there is an attempt to rely on new facts which could have been discovered 
  with reasonable diligence in the earlier case, whether the second action is 
  simply an attempt to impose a new legal conception on the same facts or whether 
  the present action constitutes an abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>[38] Having decided that Reemark's claim relates to a distinct cause of action, 
  the remaining applicable factor from the Hoque list is whether the present action 
  constitutes an abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>[39] As noted in paragraph 24, Clarica's alternative position to its submission 
  that Reemark's cross-claim is barred by cause of action estoppel is that the 
  cross-claim is an abuse of process. Clarica asserts that Reemark and the Bank 
  agreed deliberately to split their cause of action as part of a common litigation 
  strategy to insulate Reemark witnesses from cross-examination and that Reemark 
  should be precluded from benefiting from that strategy. <br>
</p>
<p>[40] I have rejected Clarica's claim that Reemark and the Bank split a single 
  cause of action. However, assuming, for the purposes of this appeal, that the 
  allegation of a common litigation strategy is true, I reject Clarica's submission 
  that Reemark's cross-claim is an abuse of process for three reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] First, the conclusion that the TOC Assignment created a free-standing 
  cause of action in favour of the Bank is a strong factor militating against 
  applying abuse of process. This case is not an attempt by the holders of a single 
  cause of action to collect different heads of damages or an effort to impose 
  a new legal concept on the same facts by using the label of a different cause 
  of action. Rather, it is a case where two plaintiffs are each entitled to an 
  independent cause of action.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] Although the Bank may have asserted a remedy that it acquired through 
  Reemark while the receivership was in place, it abandoned that claim after the 
  Minutes of Settlement were signed. Reemark, itself, never joined in the Bank's 
  proceeding. Assuming that Reemark co-operated with the Bank to the extent Clarica 
  claims, Clarica may well have been entitled to claim that Reemark was bound 
  by the result in the Bank proceeding had it gone the other way: see Bomac Construction 
  Ltd. v. Stevenson, [1986] 5 W.W.R. 21 (Sask. C.A.) at 28. However, where Reemark 
  and the Bank each hold a separate cause of action, in my view, it is not an 
  abuse of process to permit Reemark to separately advance its claim. <br>
</p>
<p>[43] Second, although, in the first action, the Bank adopted the position that 
  it was Mutual and not Reemark that breached the TOC and the ATOC, it also advanced 
  a defence that it was a lender for value without notice. Its position was not 
  therefore wholly identified with Reemark's, and it may not have been possible 
  for Reemark and the Bank to be co-plaintiffs.<br>
</p>
<p>[44] Third, Mutual had the same opportunity to seek joinder of the proceedings 
  as Reemark. This is not a case where Mutual was taken by surprise through a 
  second proceeding launched after the first action concluded. In fact, Mutual 
  filed its cross-claim raising the issue of who was the wrongdoer before Reemark 
  raised the issue in its pleading. Although I agree that Mutual was not obliged 
  to seek joinder, in my view, it must bear the consequences of choosing not to 
  do so. <br>
</p>
<p>[45] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>2. Did the motion judge err in declaring that Clarica is liable to Reemark 
  for breach of the TOC and the ATOC based on issue estoppel or abuse of process?<br>
</p>
<p>a) Issue Estoppel<br>
</p>
<p>[46] Dealing first with issue estoppel, Clarica submits that the motion judge 
  made three errors: 1) he failed to identify the fourth element of issue estoppel; 
  2) he failed to find that the fourth element of issue estoppel is not satisfied 
  in this case; and 3) he failed to exercise his discretion not to apply issue 
  estoppel.<br>
</p>
<p>[47] Clarica claims that the fourth element of issue estoppel is that the determination 
  relied on was fundamental to the decision in the prior proceeding. I accept 
  that that is a correct statement of one of the requirements of issue estoppel: 
  Angle v. M.N.R., [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248 at 254-256. However, it is unnecessary 
  that I determine whether it is a separate element, or whether it forms part 
  of the three elements identified by the motion judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] Stated as four elements, the requirements of issue estoppel are as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>i) the same question has been decided in a previous judicial proceeding;<br>
</p>
<p>ii) the judicial decision that is said to create the estoppel is final;<br>
</p>
<p>iii) the parties to the prior proceeding or their privies are the same parties 
  as the parties to the proceeding in which the estoppel is raised; and <br>
</p>
<p>iv) the determination of the issue giving rise to the estoppel was fundamental 
  to the decision arrived at in the prior proceeding. <br>
</p>
<p>[49] Clarica submits that the fourth element of issue estoppel is not satisfied 
  because it was this court, rather than the trial judge, that determined that 
  Mutual does not have a valid defence to Reemark's right to enforce the TOC. 
  It claims that, because the trial judge did not determine the issue, Reemark's 
  conduct escaped full scrutiny, and that the result could well be different if 
  the matter is litigated as between Clarica and Reemark.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] I reject Clarica's submission. Mutual raised this defence both at trial 
  and on appeal in the prior action. The determination made by this court was 
  a conclusion of law. It was fundamental to the decision on appeal and therefore 
  fundamental to the final decision in the Bank proceeding. Where the Court of 
  Appeal determines an issue, its determination is as final and binding as a determination 
  made at trial.<br>
</p>
<p>[51] Clarica's final submission relates as much to abuse of process as it does 
  to issue estoppel. I prefer to deal with it under that heading rather than determining 
  whether all of the elements of issue estoppel exist. The third element of issue 
  estoppel requires a finding concerning whether Reemark and the Bank are privies. 
  Both parties claim that Reemark and the Bank are privies, but they do so for 
  reasons that are fundamentally different. I have already rejected the basis 
  of Clarica's submission on the issue. Rather than risk extending the boundaries 
  of privity inappropriately because the issue has not been joined, I think it 
  preferable to dispose of this appeal based on abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>b) Abuse of Process<br>
</p>
<p>[52] Clarica submits that, in choosing not to join in the Bank action, Reemark 
  pursued a common litigation strategy with the Bank to insulate its witnesses 
  from cross-examination. It says that Reemark was a &quot;wait and see&quot; 
  plaintiff that chose to minimize its risk, and at the same time help the Bank 
  to fight the battle on another front. Clarica claims that a different result 
  may well ensue if it is permitted to re-litigate the issue in a forum where 
  Reemark must submit to discovery and expose its witnesses to cross-examination 
  at trial. It claims that the equities favour re-litigation and also demonstrate 
  that re-litigation would not amount to an abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>[53] I reject this submission. Knowing the tactical considerations, Mutual 
  chose to advance the defence in the Bank action, both at trial and before this 
  court, that it was Reemark, not Mutual, that breached the agreements. As already 
  noted, Mutual had the same opportunity as Reemark to request an order joining 
  these proceedings. It has advanced no explanation for failing to do so. When 
  the Bank failed to call any Reemark witnesses at the trial of the first action, 
  Mutual opted to ask that an adverse inference be drawn rather than call the 
  witnesses itself and, if necessary, request the right to cross-examine. In doing 
  so, Mutual made a tactical decision. It lost. That does not give it the right 
  to claim now that it suffered a procedural disadvantage. <br>
</p>
<p>[54] I find no merit in Clarica's submission that the possibility of a different 
  result somehow turns the equities in its favour. One of the reasons for restraining 
  duplicative litigation is to avoid inconsistent results. In my view, if satisfied 
  that Reemark was a &quot;wait and see&quot; plaintiff, the proper approach would 
  be to hold that it was an abuse of process for Reemark to re-litigate an issue 
  that was decided against it: see Bomac Const. Ltd. v. Stevenson. It appears 
  that Mutual was a &quot;wait and see&quot; defendant to the same extent, that 
  Reemark was a &quot;wait and see&quot; plaintiff, if not more so. <br>
</p>
<p>[55] Here, Mutual advanced a position at trial in a prior proceeding, knowing 
  that it was advancing the same position in this proceeding, and knowing the 
  procedural hurdles it faced in the first proceeding if it did not request an 
  order for joinder. It has not explained its failure to do so. I agree with the 
  motion judge's conclusion that it would constitute an abuse of process to permit 
  Clarica to re-litigate a position that it has already advanced, and lost.<br>
</p>
<p>Disposition<br>
</p>
<p>[56] I would dismiss this appeal and permit Reemark to file brief written submissions 
  concerning costs within seven days, and permit Clarica to respond within seven 
  days thereafter.</p>
