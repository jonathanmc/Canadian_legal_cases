<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of a brutal sexual assault and sentenced to 
  9 years imprisonment. There was evidence that the assault was planned. The attack 
  took place in the victim's home at a time when her two children were asleep. 
  The sexual assault was followed by unnecessary violence. The appellant inflicted 
  a cut to the victim's throat with a knife and he stabbed her in the chest.</p>
<p>[2] We admitted fresh evidence which disclosed that the appellant had little 
  remorse for the offence. The appellant who was nineteen years of age at the 
  time of the offence is an aboriginal Canadian. He argues that the trial judge 
  erred in failing to give due consideration to s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code. 
  We disagree. The trial judge specifically considered the section and noted that 
  in R. v. Gladue (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at para. 79, the Supreme 
  Court pointed out: </p>
<p class="indent">Generally the more violent and serious the offence, the more 
  likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals 
  and non-aboriginals would be close to each other or the same, even taking into 
  account the different concepts of sentencing.</p>
<p>[3] There is nothing in this record that would lead us to impose a sentence 
  for this serious offence that is less than what is a fit sentence for a non-aboriginal 
  offender. In our view, the sentence of 9 years (in addition to 11 months pre-trial 
  custody) was entirely fit. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>
