<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The trial judge made it clear that he expected that the appellant would 
  receive appropriate medical attention, including surgery to deal with the very 
  serious eyesight condition. The fresh evidence placed before the court shows 
  that the appellant has not received this treatment and his condition continues 
  to deteriorate. This is a completely unacceptable situation and has resulted 
  in the appellant serving sentence on extremely harsh conditions.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is reduced 
  to time served. We see no reason for adding any probation term given the appellant's 
  age and health.</p>
