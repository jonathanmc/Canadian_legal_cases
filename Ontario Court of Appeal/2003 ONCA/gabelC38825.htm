<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: March 12, 2003</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the motions judge erred in concluding that the appellant would 
  be entitled to seek originating corollary relief notwithstanding the existence 
  of a final divorce judgment which addressed the corollary relief issues. </p>
<p>[2] He did not address the three part test for setting aside the noting of 
  pleadings closed. We are satisfied that that test has been met in this case. 
  The respondent concedes that the motion was timely. The record is clear that 
  the appellant had a persistent intention to defend and that there is merit to 
  the appellant's claims for corollary relief. </p>
<p>[3] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of Karam J. and 
  the noting of pleadings closed, as well as paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the default 
  divorce judgment. Costs are payable to the appellant in the amount of $1,750 
  for the motion, and $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. for the appeal.</p>
