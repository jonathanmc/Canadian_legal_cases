<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] As presented by counsel at trial and the trial judge, this was a straightforward, 
  essentially single issue case. The only real issue was whether the appellant 
  intended to assault the complainant when he attempted to break into her home 
  through the balcony. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] It was agreed at trial that the complainant's evidence was unreliable and, 
  standing alone, should not result in a conviction. There was ample evidence, 
  however, apart from the complainant's evidence, from which the jury could infer 
  that the appellant intended to assault the complainant. This evidence included 
  a neighbour's observations of the complainant when she fled her home with the 
  appellant in apparent pursuit, and the evidence that the appellant had been 
  released from jail the day before having just completed a sentence for assaulting 
  the complainant. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] There was evidence that the appellant had assaulted the complainant on 
  prior occasions that had not resulted in criminal charges. This evidence was 
  left with the jury as evidence of motive or animus. The trial judge did not 
  tell the jury that the complainant's evidence in relation to those events should 
  be regarded as equally unreliable as was her evidence concerning the events 
  which led to the charges. It may have been better had the trial judge made that 
  specific comment, but we are satisfied that the jury would clearly have understood 
  that all of the complainant's evidence was regarded by everybody, including 
  the Crown, as unreliable if unconfirmed. We are satisfied that the alleged non-direction 
  did not result in any error in law or miscarriage of justice.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] There is no merit to the other grounds of appeal. There is no reason to 
  interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] The appeals are dismissed.</p>
