<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Maurice Cullity of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 12, 2002.</p>

<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] This case represents yet another debate about the application of the bright 
  line principle laid down in Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929 that 
  disputes which arise out of a collective agreement must be resolved by arbitration 
  and not by the courts.</p>
<p>
  [2] Cullity J. decided that this was such a dispute. For the reasons that follow 
  I agree with his conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellants are the plaintiffs in this lawsuit. They are Correctional 
  Officers who work at Kingston Penitentiary. As such, they are covered by a collective 
  agreement between their union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, and their 
  employer, the Government of Canada. </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondents, the defendants in the action, are the Attorney General 
  of Canada representing the Government of Canada and seven senior members of 
  its management team at Kingston Penitentiary.</p>
<p>
  [5] The statement of claim alleges that the defendants authorized and conducted 
  a secret operation to stop the flow of contraband into the penitentiary in which 
  they recruited inmates to coerce the appellants to comply with illegal requests 
  for contraband. The appellants allege that as part of this operation, the respondents 
  covertly supplied these inmates with funds, confidential information and contraband. 
  They say that this management conduct poisoned the atmosphere at the penitentiary 
  for the appellants and put their lives at risk. The appellants plead that these 
  actions constitute the intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach 
  of the duty of good faith, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of care 
  and breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and they claim damages for 
  the physical and emotional injuries they suffered. In addition the appellants 
  plead defamation alleging that public statements made by the respondents about 
  the operation defamed them.</p>
<p>
  [6] Pursuant to Rule 21.01(3)(a), the respondents moved to strike all the allegations 
  in the statement of claim save those relating to defamation. In granting the 
  order, the motions judge focussed primarily on the relevant provisions of the 
  legislation that governs the union and the employer, the Public Service Staff 
  Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 (PSSRA).</p>
<p>
  [7] Sections 91 and 92 of the PSSRA provide inter alia that an employee can 
  grieve both about the interpretation or application in respect of him or her 
  of a provision of the collective agreement and about the interpretation or application 
  of any other regulation or directive by the employer about terms and conditions 
  of employment, but can take only the former to arbitration. The relevant parts 
  of these sections read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 91. (1) Where any employee feels aggrieved</p>
<p class="indent">(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the 
  employee, of</p>
<p class="indent10">(i) a provision of a statute, or of a regulation, by-law, direction 
  or other instrument made or issued by the employer, dealing with terms and conditions 
  of employment, or</p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award 
  .&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">in respect of which no administrative procedure for redress 
  is provided in or under an Act of Parliament, the employee is entitled, subject 
  to subsection (2), to present the grievance at each of the levels, up to and 
  including the final level, in the grievance process provided for by this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An employee is not entitled to present any grievance relating 
  to the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of a provision 
  of a collective agreement or an arbitral award unless the employee has the approval 
  of and is represented by the bargaining agent for the bargaining unit to which 
  the collective agreement or arbitral award applies, or any grievance relating 
  to any action taken pursuant to an instruction, direction or regulation given 
  or made as described in section 113.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">92. (1) Where an employee has presented a grievance, up to and 
  including the final level in the grievance process, with respect to</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the interpretation or application in respect of the employee 
  of a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award .&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">and the grievance has not been dealt with to the satisfaction 
  of the employee, the employee may, subject to subsection (2), refer the grievance 
  to adjudication.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where a grievance that may be presented by an employee to 
  adjudication is a grievance described in paragraph (1)(a), the employee is not 
  entitled to refer the grievance to adjudication unless the bargaining agent 
  for the bargaining unit, to which the collective agreement or arbitral award 
  referred to in that paragraph applies, signifies in the prescribed manner its 
  approval of the reference of the grievance to adjudication and its willingness 
  to represent the employee in the adjudication proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [8] These provisions are in essence repeated in Article 20.01 and Article 20.23 
  of the collective agreement governing the parties here. They are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 20.01 In cases of alleged misinterpretation or misapplication 
  arising out of agreements concluded by the National Joint Council (NJC) of the 
  Public Service on items which may be included in a collective agreement and 
  which the parties to this Agreement have endorsed, the grievance procedure will 
  be in accordance with Section 7.0 of the NJC By-Laws.</p>
<p class="center">...</p>
<p class="indent">20.23 Where an employee has presented a grievance up to and 
  including the Final Level in the grievance procedure with respect to: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the interpretation or application in respect of him or 
  her of a provision of this Agreement or a related arbitral award,</p>
<p class="indent">or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) disciplinary action resulting in suspension or a financial 
  penalty,</p>
<p class="indent">or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) termination of employment or demotion pursuant to paragraph 
  11(2)(f) or (g) of the Financial Administration Act,</p>
<p class="indent">and the employee's grievance has not been dealt with to his 
  or her satisfaction, he or she may refer the grievance to adjudication in accordance 
  with the provisions of the Public Service Staff Relations Act and Regulations.</p>
<p>
  [9] The one other article of the collective agreement that is germane to this 
  dispute is Article 18: </p>
<p class="indent">
  18.01 The Employer shall make reasonable provisions for the occupational safety 
  and health of employees. The Employer will welcome suggestions on the subject 
  from the Alliance, and the parties undertake to consult with a view to adopting 
  and expeditiously carrying out reasonable procedures and techniques designed 
  or intended to prevent or reduce the risk of employment injury.</p>
<p>
  [10] The motions judge held that the central issue was one of statutory interpretation. 
  Could the complaints of the appellants have been made the subject of a grievance 
  within s. 92(1)(a) as one &quot;with respect to the interpretation or application 
  in respect of [these employees] of a provision of the collective agreement&quot;? 
  Keeping in mind Article 18, the motions judge concluded that (although the appellants 
  had not done so) a grievance presented by the appellants concerning their complaints 
  would have been one with respect to the application of the provisions of the 
  collective agreement within the meaning of s. 92(1)(a) of the PSSRA. He further 
  concluded that the arbitration process (called adjudication in the Act) authorized 
  by that section was sufficient to exclude the jurisdiction of the court to entertain 
  the appellants' claims based on the impugned paragraphs of the statement of 
  claim. He therefore struck all the paragraphs from the appellants' pleading 
  save those supporting the defamation claim. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [11] I would reach the same conclusion as the motions judge but by a slightly 
  different route. I would focus not on the interpretation of the arbitration 
  provision of the PSSRA, but rather on the essential character of the dispute, 
  to determine if it must be resolved by arbitration and not by the courts.</p>
<p>
  [12] Weber, supra, first set out in detail the principle of exclusive jurisdiction 
  - that certain disputes must be resolved by arbitration and the courts have 
  no power to entertain an action in respect of those disputes.</p>
<p>
  [13] The principle was designed to apply where there is a collective agreement 
  which is required by legislation to provide for the resolution of disputes by 
  arbitration. McLachlin J. spoke for the court on this issue. At p. 959 she made 
  clear that according exclusive jurisdiction to the arbitration process for certain 
  disputes gives &quot;full credit&quot; to several considerations: the legislation 
  requiring that there be an arbitration procedure to resolve disputes under the 
  collective agreement; the &quot;pattern of growing judicial deference&quot; 
  to the process of grievance and arbitration; and the desire not to allow concurrent 
  actions to duplicate and undermine that dispute resolution process. </p>
<p>
  [14] The Weber principle requires a determination of when a particular dispute 
  is within the exclusive jurisdiction of arbitration under the collective agreement 
  and therefore is beyond the reach of court action. Binnie J. articulated the 
  general test for this determination in Goudie v. Ottawa (City), 2003 S.C.C. 
  14 at paragraph 23: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subsequent cases have confirmed that if the dispute between the parties in its 
  &quot;essential character&quot; arises from the interpretation, application, 
  administration or violation of the collective agreement, it is to be determined 
  by an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the collective agreement, and 
  not by the courts.</p>
<p>
  [15] Weber and cases that have followed it have provided guidance on the considerations 
  for assessing &quot;the essential character&quot; of a particular dispute to 
  determine if the exclusive jurisdiction principle applies and therefore if it 
  must be resolved by arbitration.</p>
<p>
  [16] First, as McLachlin J. said in Weber at p. 955, one must look to the facts 
  giving rise to the dispute rather than the legal characterization of the wrong 
  said to be manifested by those facts. The facts must engage the rights and obligations 
  in the collective agreement in order to be arbitrated.</p>
<p>
  [17] The second consideration is the corollary of the first, namely (in the 
  language of McLachlin J. at p. 956 of Weber), the ambit of the collective agreement. 
  The language chosen by the parties must clearly create rights and obligations 
  that extend to these facts, either expressly or by implication.</p>
<p>
  [18] The third consideration is whether the arbitration process provided by 
  the collective agreement can furnish an effective remedy for the dispute. The 
  remedy need not be identical to that which the court would provide, but it must 
  be responsive to the wrong complained of. The arbitration process does not acquire 
  exclusive jurisdiction if the result is a real deprivation of any ultimate remedy. 
  McLachlin J. put this point as follows in Weber at pp. 958-959: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It might occur that a remedy is required which the arbitrator is not empowered 
  to grant. In such a case, the courts of inherent jurisdiction in each province 
  may take jurisdiction. This Court in St. Anne Nackawic confirmed that the New 
  Brunswick Act did not oust the residual inherent jurisdiction of the superior 
  courts to grant injunctions in labour matters (at p. 724). Similarly, the Court 
  of Appeal of British Columbia in Moore v. British Columbia (1988), 50 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 29, at p. 38, accepted that the court's residual jurisdiction to grant 
  a declaration was not ousted by the British Columbia labour legislation, although 
  it declined to exercise that jurisdiction on the ground that the powers of the 
  arbitrator were sufficient to remedy the wrong and that deference was owed to 
  the labour tribunal. What must be avoided, to use the language of Estey J. in 
  St. Anne Nackawic (at p. 723), is a &quot;real deprivation of ultimate remedy&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [19] This consideration arises particularly in the context of the PSSRA. In 
  Jadwani v. The Attorney General of Canada et al. (2001), 52 O.R. (3rd) 660 this 
  court applied the exclusive jurisdiction principle and precluded court action 
  in significant measure because, under the statute, the complaint could be remedied 
  at arbitration. On the other hand, in Guenette v. Canada (A.G.) (2002), 60 O.R. 
  (3d) 601 this court declined to apply the exclusive jurisdiction principle, 
  in part because under the PSSRA the complaint could be grieved, but could not 
  be taken to arbitration for final resolution as it arose outside the collective 
  agreement. This court relied on the absence of an ultimate remedy at arbitration 
  as an important factor in concluding that the principle of exclusive jurisdiction 
  precluding court action was inapplicable.</p>
<p>
  [20] The contrary view is that, at least under the PSSRA, the principle applies 
  even in the absence of an ultimate remedy at arbitration. With deference to 
  this view, most eloquently put by Evans J.A. in his concurrence in Vaughan v. 
  the Queen, [2003] F.C.J. No. 241 (C.A.), I would disagree with this approach. 
  To apply the principle of exclusive jurisdiction if the result is that there 
  is no ultimate remedy available either at arbitration or in court risks having 
  a right without an effective remedy. In my view the legislature should be presumed 
  to have effected such a result only if it has said so very clearly. Parliament 
  has not done so in the PSSRA.</p>
<p>
  [21] These considerations can in effect be consolidated by asking whether, considering 
  the facts of the dispute, the language of the collective agreement, and the 
  effectiveness of the remedy provided by the arbitration mechanism, this is the 
  kind of dispute that the parties intended to be finally resolved there. If so, 
  the principle of exclusive jurisdiction applies to exclude court action. Determining 
  the essential character of the dispute in this way is consistent with the reality 
  that the terms of the collective agreement both as to substance and as to dispute 
  resolution reflect the shared intention of the parties. It provides some assurance 
  that the disputes to be exclusively resolved by arbitration are ones that the 
  process was designed to deal with.</p>
<p>
  [22] It remains to determine, in light of these considerations, whether the 
  essential character of this dispute triggers the application of the exclusive 
  jurisdiction principle.</p>
<p>
  [23] The facts raise a complaint by individuals who are acknowledged to be covered 
  by the collective agreement. Their complaint is against their employer and its 
  executive team and concerns the way the workplace was run by management. The 
  facts centre on an alleged covert operation to stop contraband entering Kingston 
  Penitentiary which employed methods that the appellants say poisoned their work 
  environment and caused them physical and emotional harm. These allegations clearly 
  engage the employer's obligation in Article 18 of the collective agreement to 
  make reasonable provisions for the occupational safety and health of the employees.</p>
<p>
  [24] The same reasoning makes it equally clear that the ambit of Article 18 
  extends to the facts which the appellants say underpin this dispute. The employer's 
  obligation under the collective agreement to maintain a safe workplace is directly 
  implicated by the covert operation and its consequences for the appellants as 
  described in the statement of claim. </p>
<p>
  [25] If this dispute were arbitrated and a breach of the collective agreement 
  were established, the remedy at arbitration would undoubtedly include compensation 
  to injured employees who grieved. That would remedy the wrong in very much the 
  same way as would an award of damages in a court action. There would be no deprivation 
  of ultimate remedy.</p>
<p>
  [26] Finally, looked at holistically, it seems to me that this is precisely 
  the kind of dispute that the parties intended to be finally resolved by arbitration 
  when they agreed to Article 18. The facts involve a workplace dispute between 
  union members and management. The collective agreement sets out an obligation 
  that fits the problem with some precision. And arbitration can provide an effective 
  remedy. In these circumstances, the essential character of the dispute entails 
  that the principle of exclusive jurisdiction apply. The court thus has no power 
  to entertain an action based on this dispute.</p>
<p>
  [27] In summary, I agree with the result reached by the motions judge. I would 
  dismiss the appeal with costs on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $4,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements.</p>
