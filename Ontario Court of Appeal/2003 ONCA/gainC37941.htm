<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] This is a motion for directions concerning the cross-appeals by The Corporation 
  of the Township of Otonabee-South Monaghan (the &#147;Township&#148;) from the 
  judgments of Ferguson J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated February 20, 
  2002 and August 6, 2002.</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[2] This case originated in a dispute between two neighbours, the applicants 
  on this motion, Terence G. Gain and Donna L. Gain, and Ideal Milk Haulage Limited 
  (&#147;IMHL&#148;), concerning the use by IMHL of property purchased by it in 
  or about 1999, which was situated near the home of the applicants. IMHL used 
  its property for a milk transportation depot. This involved 18 to 20 trips by 
  diesel trucks, on a daily basis, in and out of the property, 7 days per week, 
  including three trips daily between approximately 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. The 
  applicants claimed that IMHL&#146;s use of its property interfered with their 
  enjoyment of their home, and regularly disturbed their sleep. Accordingly, they 
  brought an application for a declaration that IMHL was using its property for 
  purposes not permitted under the applicable municipal zoning by-law, an order 
  restraining such use by IMHL, and an order requiring IMHL to comply with the 
  zoning provisions of the by-law. The applicants sought no relief against the 
  Township. </p>
<p>[3] By judgment dated February 20, 2002, the applications judge: (1) granted 
  a declaration that IMHL, at the time of the application, was using its property 
  for uses which were not permitted by the applicable Township zoning by-law; 
  (2) ordered that IMHL forthwith cease using its property for other than residential, 
  business office, maintenance garage, or other uses as specifically permitted 
  by the Township by-law; (3) declined to order that IMHL comply with the zoning 
  provisions of the Township&#146;s zoning by-law; and (4) ordered that a shed 
  located on IMHL&#146;s property be used in the future only for one of the permitted 
  industrial uses specified by the Township&#146;s by-law and that, if the proposed 
  use of the shed was for a permitted industrial use, IMHL was not required to 
  comply with the zoning requirements of the by-law. The reasons and supplementary 
  reasons for judgment of the applications judge concerning those orders were 
  released on February 20, 2002 and May 20, 2002.</p>
<p>[4] In addition, by judgment dated August 6, 2002, the applications judge granted 
  the applicants their costs of the application, fixed in the amount of $91,107, 
  inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. He further ordered that, 
  of the costs awarded to the applicants, IMHL was required to pay the sum of 
  $61,107 to the applicants, and the Township was required to pay the sum of $30,000 
  to the applicants (the &#147;Costs Reasons&#148;).</p>
<p>[5] IMHL appealed part of the February 20, 2002 judgment of the applications 
  judge. The applicants cross-appealed that part of the applications judge&#146;s 
  decision set out in his reasons for judgment dated May 20, 2002. The Township 
  cross-appealed from the three decisions of the applications judge, including 
  from his judgment concerning costs. </p>
<p>[6] On September 20, 2002, IMHL abandoned its appeal and, within a matter of 
  days, paid the costs which it was ordered to pay under the Costs Reasons. </p>
<p>[7] When IMHL decided to sell its property, the applicants reached an agreement, 
  dated October 18, 2002, with the proposed purchasers of the property, whereby 
  it was agreed that IMHL&#146;s property could be used in the future for residential 
  purposes only (the &#147;Land Use Agreement&#148;). The applicants allege that 
  the Land Use Agreement was registered on title, and that it is binding on IMHL&#146;s 
  successors in interest, including any subsequent purchaser of the IMHL property.</p>
<p>[8] On November 15, 2002, Labrosse J.A. of this court granted the Township 
  an extension of time within which to cross-appeal from the judgments of the 
  applications judge. That extension was necessary because the Township had not 
  commenced its cross-appeals on a timely basis. Given that IMHL had abandoned 
  its appeal, Labrosse J.A. also ordered that the Township proceed as the primary 
  appellant. </p>
<p>[9] On November 29, 2002, IMHL sold its property to the persons with whom the 
  applicants entered into the Land Use Agreement. On December 16, 2002, the applicants 
  abandoned their cross-appeal as required by the terms of the Land Use Agreement. 
  Accordingly, at present, only the Township&#146;s cross-appeals are outstanding. 
  The Township wishes to proceed with those cross-appeals. </p>
<p>II. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS</p>
<p>[10] The applicants seek directions from this court concerning: </p>
<p class="indent">(1) whether the Land Use Agreement, and events associated with 
  it, render the cross-appeals moot; and</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the contents of the appeal and exhibit books to be used 
  on the cross-appeals, and the Township&#146;s obligation to serve a certificate 
  respecting evidence under rule 61.05(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The applicants also seek an extension of time within which to deliver their 
  factum, should the cross-appeals proceed.</p>
<p>III. PRELIMINARY ISSUE ON MOTION</p>
<p>
  [11] In response to the applicants&#146; motion, the Township filed an affidavit 
  by Ann-Marie Tindale, a law clerk in the offices of the solicitors for the Township, 
  sworn on January 23, 2003.</p>
<p>[12] At the outset of the argument of this motion, counsel for the applicants 
  objected to certain of the contents of Ms. Tindale&#146;s affidavit. In particular, 
  he argued that counsel for the Township, Michael Miller, should not be permitted 
  to argue this motion because the affidavit relied upon by his client in response 
  to the motion had been sworn by Mr. Miller&#146;s law clerk based on information 
  provided, and known, solely by Mr. Miller. For that reason, counsel for the 
  applicants initially argued that Ms. Tindale&#146;s affidavit should be wholly 
  disregarded on the motion. However, after further consideration, the applicants&#146; 
  counsel restricted his objection to the contents of paragraph 13 of Ms. Tindale&#146;s 
  affidavit. Counsel for the Township agreed, for the purpose of this motion, 
  that I should not have regard to that paragraph of Ms. Tindale&#146;s affidavit. 
  Accordingly, I have not taken paragraph 13 of Ms. Tindale&#146;s affidavit into 
  account in arriving at my decision. </p>
<p>IV. MOOTNESS ISSUE</p>
<p>[13] The applicants argue that the issues concerning the use of IMHL&#146;s 
  former property, as considered by the applications judge, are moot. They rely 
  on the Land Use Agreement, and on the alleged fact that the covenant in the 
  Land Use Agreement concerning the future use of the land was registered on title, 
  in order to run with the land and to be binding on any successors in title.</p>
<p>[14] The applicants submit that a single judge of this court has jurisdiction 
  to provide directions concerning the mootness issue. In the alternative, they 
  seek an order permitting them to file an affidavit on the Township&#146;s cross-appeals, 
  setting out the basis of their mootness argument. </p>
<p>[15] In my view, the applicants&#146; motion for directions on the mootness 
  issue must be dismissed.</p>
<p>[16] Under rule 61.16(2.2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to this 
  court for an order that finally determines an appeal, other than an order dismissing 
  the appeal on consent, must be heard and determined by a panel of three judges 
  of this court sitting together. If the directions sought by the applicants on 
  the mootness issue were to be provided, and if I were to conclude that all or 
  some of the issues raised by the Township in its cross-appeals are moot as a 
  result of events post-dating the judgments of the applications judge, I would, 
  in effect, be finally determining those issues. Accordingly, under rule 61.16(2.2), 
  determination of the mootness issue, and its consequences if the applicants&#146; 
  assertion of mootness is accepted, must be made by the panel hearing this appeal. 
</p>
<p>[17] For similar reasons, I deny the alternative relief sought by the applicants, 
  that is, an order permitting them to file an affidavit on the cross-appeals 
  setting out the basis of the alleged mootness argument. The evidence sought 
  to be introduced by the applicants to ground their mootness argument is evidence 
  concerning events which occurred after the date of the judgments of the applications 
  judge. Accordingly, it is fresh evidence which they may seek to place before 
  the panel hearing the cross-appeals according to the usual rules governing the 
  admission of fresh evidence on appeals to this court. It is for the panel hearing 
  the cross-appeals to determine whether the fresh evidence is properly admissible.</p>
<p>V. CONTENTS OF THE TOWNSHIP&#146;S APPEAL AND EXHIBIT BOOKS AND THE TOWNSHIP&#146;S 
  OBLIGATIONS UNDER RULE 61.05(1)</p>
<p>[18] The applicants allege that the Township failed to comply with rule 61.05(1) 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure by failing to serve a certificate respecting 
  evidence, despite request therefor by the applicants. They also allege that 
  materials relevant to the issues raised on the cross-appeals have been omitted 
  from the appeal and exhibit books filed by the Township. In that connection, 
  the applicants contend that the following omitted materials are relevant to 
  the cross-appeals: </p>
<p class="indent">(i) the applicants&#146; affidavits, sworn on March 3, 2002, 
  relating to the costs hearing before the applications judge (the &#147;Gain 
  Affidavits&#148;);</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the factum filed by the Township on the application, in 
  which the Township sought costs of the application;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the transcript of that part of the proceedings below, 
  when the applications judge ruled that the Township could participate in the 
  application, subject to any costs award that ultimately might be made;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the transcript of that part of the proceedings below pertaining 
  to discussion of Beer v. Hayes, [2001] O.J. No. 4062;</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the exhibits on the cross-examination of Mr. R. Beckstead;</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) a copy of a &#147;flyer&#148; circulated to residents of 
  the Township in July 1999, as referenced in the Costs Reasons; and </p>
<p class="indent">(vii) copies of all bills of costs, disbursements calculations, 
  and written submissions of the applicants on costs, as filed with the applications 
  judge.</p>
<p>I will address each of these matters in turn.</p>
<p>(i) the Township&#146;s certificate respecting evidence</p>
<p>
  [19] The Township does not object to filing a certificate respecting evidence. 
  However, in response to the assertion that it failed to comply with rule 61.05(1), 
  the Township points to the certificate respecting evidence filed by IMHL on 
  its appeal. In that certificate, dated March 15, 2002, counsel for IMHL certified 
  that all of the affidavit evidence, and all of the transcripts of cross-examinations, 
  filed with the Superior Court of Justice for use at the hearing of the application, 
  were required for the appeal. Based on that expansive certificate, the Township 
  claims that it understood that there was no dispute concerning the evidence 
  required pursuant to rule 61.05(1) for use on the cross-appeals. Accordingly, 
  it did not file its own certificate.</p>
<p>[20] The certificate respecting evidence served by IMHL was filed in IMHL&#146;s 
  appeal from part of the February 20, 2002 judgment of the applications judge. 
  It did not concern the decision of the applications judge set out in his May 
  20, 2002 supplementary reasons for judgment, or the costs decision of the applications 
  judge as set out in his Costs Reasons, neither of which was appealed by IMHL. 
  For that reason alone, the Township should file a certificate respecting evidence 
  in connection with its cross-appeals. In addition, given the procedural history 
  of this matter, and the fact that the Township is now the designated appellant, 
  it is advisable that the Township comply with rule 61.05(1). Accordingly, I 
  order that the Township serve and file with this court its certificate respecting 
  evidence in connection with its cross-appeals, as contemplated by rule 61.05(1), 
  within 10 days from the date of this order.</p>
<p>(ii) the Gain Affidavits </p>
<p>
  [21] Much of the argument on this motion concerned whether the Gain Affidavits 
  should form part of the materials filed with this court to be considered on 
  the Township&#146;s cross-appeals. </p>
<p>[22] The applicants argue that the exhibits to one or both of the Gain Affidavits 
  provide evidence concerning offers to settle, the Township&#146;s alleged change 
  of position at the hearings before the applications judge despite an agreement 
  or undertaking by the Township to remain neutral, and the dockets submitted 
  to the applications judge on behalf of Mr. Gain, a solicitor, and by counsel 
  for the applicants.</p>
<p>[23] The Township opposes the inclusion of the Gain Affidavits in its appeal 
  book on the basis that the applications judge did not consider them in arriving 
  at his decision concerning costs. The Township relies on the following passage 
  from the Costs Reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Applicants rely on their affidavits filed on the issue of costs. Those 
  affidavits describe a long history of activity concerning this dispute and are 
  relied on to support an award of solicitor and client costs on a ground of misbehaviour 
  by the Township and Ideal Milk. I am not going to consider that material. I 
  accept the submission of Mr. Miller that if the Applicants seek some compensation 
  based on that history they should have raised it in the Application. I am concerned 
  only with conduct relating to the conduct of this litigation.</p>
<p>[24] However, the applications judge later stated in his Costs Reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">For purposes of convenience, I shall analyse the costs of the Applicants with 
  reference to the summary at p. 9 of Tab A of the Applicants&#146; Record Re 
  Costs Submissions. </p>
<p>[25] Thereafter, in the next 11 paragraphs of his Costs Reasons, the applications 
  judge referred to the hourly rates charged by counsel for the applicants and 
  by Mr. Gain for his own time, and to the hours and the total costs, the counsel 
  fees, the disbursements, and the Goods and Services Tax claimed by the applicants. 
  Information relating to those issues, the applicants contend, is set out in 
  the Gain Affidavits or in the exhibits attached thereto. The applicants further 
  argue that in responding to the Township&#146;s cross-appeal from the costs 
  decision of the applications judge, they should be permitted to refer to the 
  contents of the Gain Affidavits concerning the Township&#146;s conduct.</p>
<p>[26] Counsel for the Township concedes that the quoted passages from the Costs 
  Reasons indicate that, in arriving at his decision concerning costs, the applications 
  judge considered the dockets submitted on behalf of the applicants. Although 
  counsel for the Township further concedes that those offers to settle which 
  form part of the Gain Affidavits should be included in the Township&#146;s appeal 
  book, he disputes the relevance of the remainder of the Gain Affidavits. </p>
<p>[27] In my view, it is possible to interpret the applications judge&#146;s 
  statement that he was &#147;not going to consider&#148; the Gain Affidavits 
  as meaning that he was not going to consider those parts of the Gain Affidavits 
  which address the alleged improper past behaviour of the Township. That does 
  not mean that the applications judge did not consider other parts of the Gain 
  Affidavits. As set out in the Costs Reasons, it appears that the applications 
  judge did consider those parts of the Gain Affidavits relating to the fees, 
  disbursements, and Goods and Services Tax claimed by the applicants. It is not 
  clear whether he also considered the offers to settle attached as exhibits to 
  Mr. Gain&#146;s affidavit of March 3, 2002. </p>
<p>[28] I have reviewed the Gain Affidavits and the applicants&#146; undated record 
  concerning costs submissions, as filed with the applications judge. Page 9 of 
  Tab &#147;A&#148; and Tabs &#147;B&#148; to &#147;D&#148;, inclusive, of that 
  record pertain to the applicants&#146; bills of costs, docketed time, and fees 
  and disbursements claimed. Those materials, in my view, are relevant to the 
  Township&#146;s cross-appeal from the costs decision of the applications judge.</p>
<p>[29] Part only of the Gain Affidavits, which were filed with the applications 
  judge as part of the applicants&#146; record on the costs hearing, appear to 
  concern the fees and disbursements claimed by the applicants. Other parts of 
  the Gain Affidavits concern the alleged conduct of the Township.</p>
<p>[30] On the record before me, it is not possible to identify with certainty 
  those parts of the Gain Affidavits that were considered by the applications 
  judge. In addition, in my view, the applicants are entitled to rely on those 
  parts of the Gain Affidavits which they claim properly bear on the costs disposition 
  of the applications judge.</p>
<p>[31] Accordingly, I conclude that it is necessary that page 9 of Tab &#147;A&#148; 
  and Tabs &#147;B&#148; to &#147;D&#148;, inclusive, of the applicants&#146; 
  record below concerning costs, and the Gain Affidavits sworn on March 3, 2002, 
  and the exhibits attached to those affidavits, be included by the Township in 
  a supplementary appeal book to be filed by it in accordance with these reasons. 
  The panel hearing the cross-appeals will determine if those materials are relevant 
  to the issues raised on the Township&#146;s cross-appeal from the costs decision 
  of the applications judge. </p>
<p>(iii) the factum filed by the Township on the application</p>
<p>
  [32] The applicants seek to have the factum filed by the Township on the application 
  included in the Township&#146;s appeal book filed on its cross-appeals, for 
  the purpose of establishing that the Township sought an award of costs in its 
  favour. Counsel for the Township acknowledged that fact during oral argument 
  of this motion. Given that acknowledgement, upon which the applicants may rely 
  during argument of the Township&#146;s cross-appeals, the inclusion in the Township&#146;s 
  appeal book of the Township&#146;s factum filed on the application is unnecessary. 
</p>
<p>(iv) the transcript of that part of the proceedings below, when the applications 
  judge ruled that the Township could participate in the application, subject 
  to any costs award that ultimately might be made </p>
<p>[33] As I understand the submissions of the applicants, this part of the transcript 
  is sought to be included in the Township&#146;s appeal book for the purpose 
  of establishing that the Township&#146;s participation in the proceedings before 
  the applications judge was conditional on the Township&#146;s exposure to potential 
  liability in costs. Counsel for the Township acknowledged that fact during oral 
  argument of this motion. Given that acknowledgement, upon which the applicants 
  may rely during argument of the Township&#146;s cross-appeals, the inclusion 
  in the Township&#146;s appeal book of the requested transcript extract is unnecessary.</p>
<p>(v) the transcript of that part of the proceedings below pertaining</p>
<p> to discussion of Beer v. Hayes, [2001] O.J. No. 4062.</p>
<p>[34] This transcript excerpt, pertaining to discussion of Beer v. Hayes, is 
  now available to counsel for the applicants. The Township does not object to 
  the inclusion of that transcript excerpt in its appeal book, providing that 
  counsel for the applicants furnishes the Township&#146;s counsel with a copy 
  of the excerpt. Accordingly, the applicants are directed to provide the relevant 
  transcript excerpt to counsel for the Township within 10 days from the date 
  of this order, and the Township is directed to include that excerpt in a supplementary 
  appeal book to be filed by it in accordance with these reasons.</p>
<p>(vi) the exhibits on the cross-examination of Mr. R. Beckstead</p>
<p>
  [35] The Township acknowledges that the exhibits on the cross-examination of 
  Mr. Beckstead should have been included in its original appeal book, as filed 
  with this court. Accordingly, the Township is directed to include a copy of 
  those exhibits in a supplementary appeal book to be filed by it in accordance 
  with these reasons.</p>
<p>(vii) the flyer circulated to residents of the Township in July 1999</p>
<p>
  [36] Neither counsel for the applicants nor counsel for the Township could assist 
  concerning whether the flyer in dispute was marked as an exhibit or otherwise 
  admitted by the applications judge as part of the materials properly before 
  him. However, the Township does not object to the inclusion of a copy of the 
  flyer in its appeal book. Accordingly, the Township is directed to include a 
  copy of the flyer in a supplementary appeal book to be filed by it in accordance 
  with these reasons. </p>
<p>(viii) the bills of costs, disbursements calculations, and written submissions 
  of the applicants on costs, as filed with the applications judge</p>
<p>[37] The applicants argue that all bills of costs, disbursements calculations, 
  and written submissions by them on costs, as filed with the applications judge, 
  are relevant to the Township&#146;s cross-appeal concerning the applications 
  judge&#146;s costs decision. I have already concluded that page 9 of Tab &#147;A&#148;, 
  and Tabs &#147;B&#148; to &#147;D&#148;, inclusive, of the applicants&#146; 
  record concerning costs submissions, as filed with the applications judge, are 
  to be included by the Township in its supplementary appeal book to be filed 
  in accordance with these reasons.</p>
<p>[38] The Township argues that the applicants&#146; previous costs submissions 
  are not relevant to the Township&#146;s cross-appeals. In the alternative, to 
  the extent that such costs submissions are relevant to the cross-appeals, the 
  Township submits that the applicants are free to repeat their submissions on 
  costs to the panel hearing the cross-appeals. I agree. Accordingly, save as 
  earlier directed in these reasons, the written costs submissions of the applicants, 
  as filed with the applications judge, need not be included in the Township&#146;s 
  appeal book filed on its cross-appeals. </p>
<p>[39] One further observation concerning the disputed materials in connection 
  with the Township&#146;s appeal and exhibit books is appropriate. In my view, 
  with minimal co-operation between counsel, many of those issues raised, and 
  argued in detail, on this motion could have been resolved without the necessity 
  for argument of this motion. </p>
<p>VI. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR DELIVERY OF THE APPLICANTS&#146; FACTUM</p>
<p>
  [40] In their notice of motion, the applicants sought an order extending the 
  time for delivery of their factum on the cross-appeals. However, that matter 
  was not addressed by counsel during oral argument of this motion. In addition, 
  the applicants&#146; motion materials do not specify the length of the extension 
  requested. Accordingly, within 7 days from the date of this order, the applicants 
  shall provide a letter to the Registrar, copied to counsel for the Township, 
  outlining the length of the extension requested. The Township&#146;s responding 
  position, if any, shall be provided by letter to the Registrar, copied to the 
  applicants&#146; counsel, within 7 days from the date of delivery to the Registrar 
  of the applicants&#146; letter. In the circumstances, I would not expect either 
  letter to exceed two pages in length. </p>
<p>VII. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [41] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the Township is directed to serve and 
  file, within 14 days from the date of this order, a supplementary appeal book
