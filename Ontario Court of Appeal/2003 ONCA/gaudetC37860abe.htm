<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded guilty to two serious driving offences and two property 
  offences, and not guilty to two other charges relating to a police chase. After 
  a trial, he was found guilty of assault. The appellant submitted that the trial 
  judge misdirected himself on the proper test for a finding of guilt on assault. 
  While his language could have been clearer, he made his reference to an &quot;objective&quot; 
  test in contradistinction to the specific intent offence of attempt murder of 
  which he had just acquitted the accused. </p>
<p>[2] Reading his reasons as a whole, we see no error in the application of the 
  appropriate test. Mens rea can properly be inferred from these facts to support 
  a conviction for assault on the basis of a threatening act, and the trial judge's 
  conclusion was available, especially considering that the appellant, in a speeding 
  car, drove his car directly towards the police officer.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant's counsel also submits that the imposition of consecutive 
  sentences resulting in a total sentence of six years was excessive. She asserts 
  the assault arose from the same facts as the dangerous driving offence and therefore 
  called for a concurrent sentence. We do not agree. This was a separate offence, 
  and was based on additional aggravating facts.</p>
<p>[4] The offences were serious, the appellant had 44 prior convictions, these 
  driving offences occurred while the appellant was under a driving suspension, 
  the chase occurred in a residential neighbourhood, and the victim was a police 
  officer acting in the line of duty. These are all aggravating factors. </p>
<p>[5] While the sentences imposed resulted in a disposition on the high end of 
  the range, nonetheless, given particularly the context of a police chase and 
  the lengthy criminal record of this 30-year-old appellant, the principles of 
  general and specific deterrence denunciation render this sentence fit.</p>
<p>[6] The appeal from conviction is accordingly dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed</p>
