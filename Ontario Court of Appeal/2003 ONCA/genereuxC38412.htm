<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally February 5, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The appellant's first argument is, in essence, that Mr. Carlstrom retain 
  beneficial ownership of his half interest in the property despite the conveyance 
  of legal title to his wife. This argument was not put with any clarity to the 
  application judge nor adjudicated by him. We would not give effect to it because 
  it is not appropriately dealt with for the first time on appeal to this court, 
  in the absence of the necessary findings of fact.</p>
<p>[2] As to the appellant's second argument, in our view, there was ample evidence 
  before the application judge to sustain his conclusion that the appellant did 
  not establish the intent necessary to obtain relief under s. 2 of the Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act.</p>
<p>[3] At the time of the conveyance, Mr. Carlstrom had an income, and prospects 
  of future income, sufficient to meet his current and anticipated liabilities. 
  Moreover Mr. Genereux knew about the transfer and was satisfied that it was 
  not done with intent to defraud. The application judge's conclusion is eminently 
  sustainable. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal must be dismissed. No order as to costs.</p>
