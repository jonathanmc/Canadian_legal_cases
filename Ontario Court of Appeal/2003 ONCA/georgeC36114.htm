<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice N. Dyson of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated February 28, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are all of the view that the trial judge failed to address the principal 
  issue in this case. The trial judge failed to consider the effect of the exclusion 
  clauses in the contract on Robson's bid, given the timing of the representation 
  made by the City. The trial judge found that the representation made by the 
  City's project engineer was to the effect that the sewer contract could be satisfied 
  by using a steel liner rather than a concrete liner, as called for in the contract 
  specifications. This representation was made before the contractor tendered 
  its bid. However, when it tendered its bid, it did so in response to the City's 
  requirement for a concrete liner. It was several weeks later before the contractor 
  raised the issue that it intended to proceed with a steel liner, which set off 
  a chain of events that led to the City terminating the contract. The legal effect 
  of that chronology, about which we come to no conclusion, was not addressed 
  by the trial judge in his reasons. Accordingly, with regret, we conclude that 
  there must be a new trial so that a judge may consider this issue and the other 
  issues in the context of all the evidence. </p>    <P>
  [2] The contractor cross-appealed on damages and requested that we increase 
  the award of $221,758.73 to $310,928.44 and requested $250,000 for punitive 
  and exemplary damages. We are unable to understand the basis upon which the 
  trial judge assessed damages at $221,758.73. This quantum was not sought by 
  the contractor nor was it suggested by the City. Since there must be a new trial, 
  it is unnecessary to say anything further about damages.</p>    <P>
  [3] Finally, we are of the view that the trial judge erred in making an order 
  for costs on a solicitor/client basis without requesting or hearing any submissions 
  on the issue.</p>    <P>
  [4] In the result, the judgment below is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>    <P>
  [5] In regard to costs, the City of Hamilton is entitled to its costs on a partial 
  indemnity basis. The total amount claimed by the City is $40,562.95 which is 
  calculated in accordance with the costs grid. The claim includes preparation 
  and counsel fees for two counsel - each with over 20 years experience. In our 
  view, the contractor ought not to be required to pay for two senior counsel. 
  Also, given the amount in issue and the degree of complexity of the case, the 
  amount sought by the appellant is excessive. This was a relatively straight-forward 
  contract claim. We therefore fix the City's costs at $18,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
