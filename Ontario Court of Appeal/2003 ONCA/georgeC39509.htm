<p>On appeal from the order of Justices Edward F. Then, Ronald G. Thomas and Helen 
  K. MacLeod of the Superior Court of Justice (Divisional Court) dated September 
  16, 2002. </p>
<p>
  LABROSSE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Ontario Public Service Employees Union (&quot;the Union&quot;), 
  appeals, with leave, the decision of the Divisional Court granting an application 
  for judicial review by the respondent &quot;George Brown College of Applied 
  Arts and Technology (&quot;the College&quot;) and quashing the award of a Workload 
  Resolution Arbitrator (&quot;the WRA&quot; or &quot;the arbitrator&quot;).</p>
<p>
  [2] The Union and the College are parties to a collective agreement involving 
  community college teachers across the province. Included in this agreement are 
  extensive provisions that create an expeditious process to resolve disputes 
  over individual teacher workload assignments. This process involves several 
  steps designed to resolve workload differences, with arbitration by a single 
  WRA as the final step. </p>
<p>
  [3] The issue before this court is whether the Union can directly refer individual 
  teacher workload disputes to the WRA. Although the collective agreement specifically 
  provides that teachers can refer workload disputes to the WRA, it is silent 
  about the Union's right to do so. The current case was commenced when the College 
  challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to hear Union-initiated workload 
  complaints. The arbitrator found against the College, but his decision was subsequently 
  quashed by the Divisional Court. The Union now appeals to this court. For the 
  reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Relevant Legislation and Articles of the Collective Agreement</p>
<p>
  [4] The relevant legislation and articles of the collective agreement are attached 
  to these reasons as Appendix &quot;A&quot;. For ease of reference, parts of 
  the collective agreement are reproduced below: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Article 32</p>
<p class="indent"> GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 32.10 The Union or Union Local shall have the right to file 
  a grievance based on a difference directly with the College arising out of the 
  Agreement concerning the interpretation, application, administration or alleged 
  contravention of the Agreement. Such grievance shall not include any matter 
  upon which an employee would be personally entitled to grieve and the regular 
  grievance procedure for personal or group grievance shall not be by-passed except 
  where the Union establishes that the employee has not grieved an unreasonable 
  standard that is patently in violation of this Agreement and that adversely 
  affects the rights employees. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Article 11</p>
<p class="indent"> WORKLOAD</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.01 A Each teacher shall have a workload that adheres to 
  the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 A 1 (b) The College may, where a change in circumstances 
  requires it, amend assignments provided to a teacher after the original assignment, 
  subject to the teacher's right to refer any matter to the College Workload Monitoring 
  Group (WMG) referred to in 11.02 B 1 and if necessary, the Workload Resolution 
  Arbitrator (WRA) referred to in 11.02 E 1 and appointed under 11.02 F 1.</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 A 6 (a) In the event of any difference arising from the 
  interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention of 11.01 
  or 11.02, a teacher shall discuss such difference as a complaint with the teacher's 
  immediate supervisor. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Failing settlement of such a complaint, a teacher may refer 
  the complaint, in writing, to the WMG within seven days of receipt of the immediate 
  supervisor's reply. The complaint shall then follow the procedures outlined 
  in 11.02 B through 11.02 F.</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 B 2 Each WMG will be composed of eight members, with 
  four to be appointed by the College and four appointed by the Union Local unless 
  the College and the Union Local otherwise agree. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 C 1 The functions of the WMG shall include: </p>
<p class="indent"><span class="indent"> (i) reviewing workload assignments in 
  general at the College and resolving apparent inequitable assignments;</span></p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) reviewing specific disputes pursuant to 11.02 A 4 and/or 
  11.02 A 6 (a) and where possible resolving such disputes;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) making recommendations to the College on the operation 
  of workload assignments at the College;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) reviewing individual workload assignments where requested 
  by the teacher or the Union Local and, where possible, resolving the disputes;</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) making recommendations to the College and Union Local committees 
  appointed under Article 7, Union College Committee, as to amendments or additions 
  to the provisions governing workload assignments at the College for local negotiation 
  in accordance with 11.02 G in order to address particular workload needs at 
  the College.</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 D 5 Such decision shall be binding on the College, the 
  Union Local and the teacher involved.</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 E 1 If following a review by the WMG of an individual 
  workload assignment which has been forwarded to the WMG, the matter is not resolved, 
  the teacher shall be so advised in writing. The matter may then be referred 
  by the teacher to a WRA provided under the agreement. Failing notification by 
  the WMG within three weeks of the referral of the workload assignment to the 
  WMG, the teacher may refer the matter to the WRA.</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 E 2 If the teacher does not refer an assignment to the 
  WRA within one week of the receipt by the teacher of notification by the WMG 
  that it has been unable to settle the matter, the matter will be considered 
  to have been settled.</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 F 5 A WRA shall determine appropriate procedure. The 
  WRA shall commence proceedings within two weeks of the referral of the matter 
  to the WRA. It is understood that the procedure shall be informal, that the 
  WRA shall discuss the matter with the teacher, the teacher's supervisor, and 
  whomever else the WRA considers appropriate. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 F 6 The award shall only have application to the teacher 
  affected by the matter and shall have no application beyond the end of a twelve-month 
  period from the date of the beginning of the workload assignment. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 11.02 F 8 The award of the WRA shall be final and binding on 
  the parties and the teacher, and shall have the same force and effect as a Board 
  of Arbitration under Article 32, Grievance Procedures.</p>
<p  class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p>
  [5] Briefly stated, the collective agreement sets out various dispute resolution 
  procedures to be used in the event of conflict. Article 32 of the agreement 
  prescribes a general grievance procedure that includes arbitration by a three-member 
  board. Although the parties agree that the general grievance procedure is not 
  available in the present case, Article 32.10 is significant because it describes 
  the procedure through which the Union may normally file grievances.</p>
<p>
  [6] The dispute resolution process available in this case is outlined in Article 
  11. Article 11.01 sets out workload limits, and Article 11.02 sets out a process 
  for assigning work and resolving individual workload complaints. According to 
  this Article, complaints about a teacher-specific workload are initially discussed 
  with that teacher's supervisor, and if there is no resolution, the complaints 
  are referred to a two-part process. The first part of the process involves a 
  consideration of the complaint by the Workload Monitoring Group (&quot;WMG&quot;). 
  The WMG is comprised of an equal number of Union and College appointees, and 
  a majority decision by the Group is binding on the College, the Union and the 
  teacher. If the matter is not resolved by the WMG, the complaint may then proceed 
  to the second part of the process, namely, arbitration by the WRA. In the case 
  before us, the Union, and not the teacher, referred the complaint to the WRA. 
  The issue in this case is whether the collective agreement permits this.</p>
<p>
  Workload Arbitrator's Award</p>
<p>
  [7] When asked to rule upon his jurisdiction to decide Union-initiated workload 
  complaints, the arbitrator concluded that notwithstanding the lack of express 
  language to the effect, the collective agreement implicitly allows the Union 
  to refer such complaints to the WRA. He summarized the basis of his decision 
  at p. 45 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Based on the analysis above, and especially because the result of no Union access 
  to arbitration is not compatible with the [Colleges Collective Bargaining] Act, 
  because the agreement makes it clear that these Union complaints can come before 
  the workload monitoring group, because the agreement also permits these Union 
  complaints to come before that group without providing any express language 
  as to how that is to happen, because the agreement implies that these disputes 
  are then resolved by workload resolution arbitration, and because the agreement 
  expresses a desire to have workload issues dealt with expeditiously, I conclude 
  that the parties intended that Union initiated workload complaints under Articles 
  11.01 and 11.02 should be dealt with through workload resolution arbitration. 
  Of the possible interpretations of the agreement, this is the interpretation 
  which fits best with the language of the collective agreement. I therefore find 
  that as workload resolution arbitrator I have jurisdiction over these Union 
  complaints.</p>
<p>
  The Divisional Court</p>
<p>
  [8] The Divisional Court quashed the WRA's award by holding that he had no jurisdiction 
  under the collective agreement to arbitrate workload disputes initiated by the 
  Union. According to the court, Article 11 contains very clear words limiting 
  access to an arbitrator solely to individual teachers. It is not correct to 
  assert that an unsuccessful complaint at the WMG stage means that there is no 
  remedy. Rather, the collective agreement merely provides that a remedy may be 
  pursued by the teacher and not the Union. Alternatively, the court held that 
  even if the Union can be said to have a right to arbitrate, the procedure governing 
  such arbitration is set out in s. 46(2) of the Colleges Collective Bargaining 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. C.15. Since s. 46(2) provides access to arbitration in front 
  of a tripartite board, it is not open for a single arbitrator to decide Union-initiated 
  workload complaints. As a result of these errors, the arbitrator's decision 
  amounted to a rewriting of the collective agreement. The WRA therefore exceeded 
  his jurisdiction and the award should be quashed.</p>
<p>
  Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [9] In light of the &quot;true&quot; privative clause found in s.84(1) of the 
  Act, both parties agree that the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness. 
  Little needs to be said on this issue, and it is sufficient to keep in mind 
  the words expressed by Cory J. in Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service 
  Alliance of Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941 at 963-64: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is said that it is difficult to know what &quot;patently unreasonable&quot; 
  means. What is patently unreasonable to one judge may be eminently reasonable 
  to another. Yet any test can only be defined by words, the building blocks of 
  all reasons. Obviously, the patently unreasonable test sets a high standard 
  of review. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary &quot;patently&quot;, an 
  adverb, is defined as &quot;[n]ot having the faculty of reason; irrational. 
  &#133; Not acting in accordance with reason or good sense&quot;. Thus, based 
  on the dictionary definition of the words &quot;patently unreasonable&quot;, 
  it is apparent that if the decision the Board reached, acting within its jurisdiction, 
  is not clearly irrational, that is to say evidently not in accordance with reason, 
  then it cannot be said that there was a loss of jurisdiction. This is clearly 
  a very strict test.</p>

  Teachers' Assn. (Toronto Elementary Unit) (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  Positions of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [10] On appeal, both parties also agreed that the Union is able to initiate 
  complaints before the WMG and that all of the workload issues raised by the 
  Union in this case were matters that could have been raised by individual teachers. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] The Union submits that the WRA's decision should stand because it interpreted 
  the collective agreement as a whole. It argues that the arbitrator's decision 
  is entitled to deference based on the standard of patent unreasonableness, is 
  consistent with the established labour relations principle that the Union and 
  not the individual is a party to the collective agreement, and is correct in 
  holding that all differences between the parties may be referred to arbitration. 
  According to the Union, the arbitrator's decision is also consistent with the 
  decision of this court in Re Ontario Hydro and Ontario Hydro Employees Union, 
  Local 1000 et al. (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 669 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [12] The College, on the other hand, adopts the reasoning of the Divisional 
  Court. It argues that the arbitrator's decision is patently unreasonable since 
  the collective agreement clearly specifies access to arbitration would be open 
  only to individual teachers and not the Union. In addition, the College argues 
  that Ontario Hydro can be distinguished from the case at bar.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  A. The Reasons of the WRA</p>
<p>
  [13] A review of the arbitrator's reasons for assuming jurisdiction reveals 
  that there is no rational basis for his decision. The arbitrator gave the following 
  five reasons for his conclusion: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The result of no Union access to arbitration is not compatible 
  with s. 46(1) of the Act; </p>
<p class="indent">2. The agreement makes it clear that the Union's complaints 
  can come before the WMG;</p>
<p class="indent">3. The agreement permits the Union complaints to come before 
  the WMG without providing any express language as to how that is to happen; 
</p>
<p class="indent">4. The agreement implies that these disputes are then resolved 
  by workload resolution arbitration; and </p>
<p class="indent">5. The agreement expresses a desire to have workload issues 
  dealt with expeditiously. </p>
<p>I will deal with each of these five issues in turn.</p>
<p>
  [14] First, the arbitrator states that denying the Union access to the WRA through 
  Article 11 is inconsistent with s.46 of the Act. The arbitrator has mischaracterized 
  the issue. The issue here, is not the Union's access to workload arbitration, 
  but its ability to initiate such complaints. Even if there is no provision for 
  the Union to initiate workload complaints, the WRA, under Article 11.02 F 5, 
  may consider the Union to be an appropriate participant if the teacher is willing 
  to initiate the complaint. To state, therefore, that the Union has no access 
  to arbitration is to ignore the larger picture of the complaints process provided 
  by the collective agreement. </p>
<p>
  [15] Indeed, the acts of defining and limiting the nature of the Union's access 
  to arbitration through Article 11 of the collective agreement is not inconsistent 
  with s. 46(1) of the Act. Nothing in s. 46(1) suggests that the arbitration 
  process mandated for collective agreements must be initiated solely by the Union 
  and no others. Instead, that section requires that an arbitration procedure 
  be included in the agreement, otherwise one will be deemed to exist by virtue 
  of s. 46(2). Under these provisions, parties can specify their own framework 
  for the process, and indeed the parties in this case have created a comprehensive 
  dispute resolution and arbitration mechanism to resolve workload disputes as 
  set out in Article 11.02. </p>
<p>
  [16] Second, the fact that, according to the arbitrator, the Union complaints 
  can come before the WMG does not assist in concluding that the Union complaints 
  can similarly come before the WRA. In fact, if the parties are right, and the 
  Union can indeed initiate workload complaints at the first step, it can be forcefully 
  argued that by expressly providing for the Union's involvement at the first 
  step and not at the second, the parties intended all along to preclude its involvement 
  at the WRA.</p>
<p>
  [17] Third, the absence of any express language as to how Union complaints come 
  before the WMG does not support the conclusion that the Union can refer complaints 
  to the WRA. The arbitrator's reasoning here begs the question of whether the 
  Union is, in fact, allowed to go directly to arbitration under the agreement. 
  Leaping from an observation that there is no provision for the Union to engage 
  either the WMG or the WRA to the conclusion that the Union is therefore entitled 
  to go to the WRA is not logically supportable. Just because there is a lack 
  of provisions for both processes does not mean that the parties intended for 
  the Union to directly refer workload complaints to the WRA.</p>
<p>
  [18] Fourth, the argument that the collective agreement implicitly allows workload 
  disputes to be resolved by workload resolution arbitration, again begs the central 
  question of the Union's entitlement to participate at the second stage of the 
  arbitration. Here, the arbitrator has reasoned by conclusion since he has stated, 
  without support, the issue under dispute as a reason for his decision. </p>
<p>
  [19] Finally, although it is true that the agreement intends to provide for 
  an expeditious determination of workload issues, it does not follow that the 
  Union is entitled to go to the WRA. In the agreement, specific time frames govern 
  each step of the appeal process. These time requirements seem to fulfil the 
  expediency purpose behind the dispute resolution mechanism. Whether an individual 
  teacher or the Union initiates such complaints is immaterial to the expediency 
  of the process. The addition of the Union as a party capable of initiating workload 
  complaints to the WRA does not change the time schedule set out in the agreement 
  and therefore has no bearing on the expeditious nature of the scheme. The fact 
  that an expedited procedure was intended by the parties therefore does not assist 
  in determining whether the Union should be allowed to initiate workload complaints 
  at the WRA.</p>
<p>
  [20] The reasons of the arbitrator therefore do not support his conclusion that 
  the Union can refer workload complaints to the WRA.</p>
<p>
  B. The Collective Agreement</p>
<p>
  [21] More importantly, the conclusion of the WRA is not supported by the relevant 
  articles of the collective agreement. </p>
<p>
  [22] First, the wording of Article 32.10 lends support to the argument that 
  the Union is specifically barred from going to the WRA for workload complaints. 
  Article 32.10 sets out a distinction between union grievances and individual 
  grievances. It explicitly contemplates personal grievances for individual employees, 
  and indeed provides that the Union cannot grieve matters that can be individually 
  grieved. While this article does not address the actual interpretation of Article 
  11, it clearly indicates that at the time of the negotiations for the collective 
  agreement, the parties had contemplated the possibility for complaints grieved 
  personally by individual employees without the involvement of the Union.</p>
<p>
  [23] Second, the words of Article 11.02 clearly specify that only individual 
  teachers are allowed to initiate workload grievances to the WRA. Although the 
  Article makes specific references to the teacher and the Union, it is the teacher 
  that is referred to most frequently in provisions relating to the complaints 
  process. Indeed, the words of the agreement suggest that it is the teacher alone 
  who is given the power to initiate complaints before the WRA: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) The College may &#133; amend assignments &#133; subject 
  to the teacher's right to refer any matter to the Workload Monitoring Group 
  (WMG) &#133; and if necessary, the WRA (11.02 A 1 (b));</p>
<p class="indent">b) If the teacher is not in agreement with the workload, the 
  teacher shall discuss such difference as a complaint with his or her supervisor 
  and failing settlement of such a complaint, the teacher may refer the complaint 
  to the WMG&quot; (11.02 A 6 (a)), composed of an equal number of College and 
  Union appointees (11.02 B 2);</p>
<p class="indent">c) The WMG is given a number of workload related functions including 
  &quot;reviewing individual workload assignments where requested by the teacher 
  or the Union Local and, where possible, resolving the disputes&quot;. (11.02 
  C 1);</p>
<p class="indent">d) A decision by a majority of the WMG shall be binding on the 
  College, the Union Local and the teacher involved (11.02 D 5);</p>
<p class="indent">e) If the complaint is not resolved, the teacher shall be so 
  advised in writing and the matter may then be referred by the teacher to the 
  WRA (11.02 E 1);</p>
<p class="indent">f) If the teacher does not refer an assignment to the WRA &#133; 
  the matter will be considered to have been settled.&quot; (11.02 E 2);</p>
<p class="indent">g) &#133; the WRA shall discuss the matter with the teacher, 
  the teacher's supervisor, and whomever else the WRA considers appropriate. (11.02 
  F 5);</p>
<p class="indent">h) The award shall only have application to the teacher affected 
  by the matter &#133; (11.02 F 6); and</p>
<p class="indent">i) The award of the WRA shall be final and binding on the parties 
  and the teacher, and shall have the same force and effect of a Board of Arbitration 
  under Article 32, Grievance Procedure (11.02 F 8). </p>
<p>
  As demonstrated above, the teacher initiates the process by complaining to his 
  or her supervisor. If the complaints cannot be resolved by the supervisor, the 
  teacher and the Union (as agreed by the parties) may then refer the complaint 
  to the WMG. However, when the decision is made to refer the complaints to the 
  second process, namely the WRA, the Articles are completely silent with respect 
  to the role of the Union. While Article 11.02 C 1, through its specific referral 
  to the Union Local, may allow the Union to initiate complaints without specifying 
  exactly how it is done at the WMG stage, the provisions describing the WRA process 
  do not name the Union as a player. Given the lack of specific reference to the 
  Union in the WRA provisions, it seems likely that the parties did not intend 
  to allow the Union to initiate complaints to the WRA. </p>
<p>
  [24] Third, several provisions in the agreement tend to demonstrate that only 
  the individual teacher is allowed to initiate complaints at the WRA. For example, 
  Article 11.02 E 2 states that if the teacher does not refer an assignment to 
  the WRA within a specified period of time, &quot;the matter will be considered 
  to have been settled&quot;. This article would be entirely redundant if the 
  matter could simply be referred to the WRA by the Union without regard to the 
  teacher. Similarly, if union initiated complaints at the WRA are permitted, 
  Article 11.02 F 6, which states that the award shall only have application to 
  the teacher affected by the complaint, would be an unnecessary departure from 
  Article 11.02 D 5 which makes the decision of the WMG binding on the teacher, 
  the College, and the Union. </p>
<p>
  [25] Fourth, the recognition of the Union's participation in the WMG process 
  at Article 11.02 C 1 not only amplifies the difference between the WMG's policy 
  function and the WRA's focus on the resolution of individual disputes, but also 
  bolsters the suggestion that the Union has no right to initiate complaints at 
  the WRA. According to the agreement, the WMG is responsible for reviewing workload 
  assignments in general, making recommendations to the College on the workload 
  assignments at the College, and making recommendations to the College and Union 
  as to amendments or additions to the provisions governing workload assignments. 
  Given these policy-related functions performed by the WMG, and the Union's ability 
  to represent large numbers of employees, it is logical to assume that the Union 
  would have an important role to play at this part of the process. </p>
<p>
  [26] Unlike the WMG, however, the WRA's main role is more specific in nature. 
  Instead of deciding policy issues, the WRA focuses on the resolution of individual 
  workload complaints between the teacher and the college. The purpose of the 
  WRA is to provide a quick, informal, non?technical and non-precedential process 
  for the resolution of individual disputes. It is therefore reasonable to expect 
  that the Union's involvement at the arbitration level would be decreased and 
  that only if the teacher (rather than the Union) is dissatisfied with the result 
  of the first stage can the second stage, WRA, be engaged. The difference in 
  function between the WMG and the WRA processes coupled with a lack of reference 
  to the Union under the arbitration provisions of Article 11.02 therefore dictates 
  that the parties did not intend the Union to initiate complaints to the WRA. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] Finally, given that the collective agreement is a very detailed agreement 
  covering comprehensive procedures that were negotiated over a long period of 
  time by large experienced negotiators, the repeated referral to &quot;teacher&quot; 
  when describing the WRA process cannot have been meant to include not only the 
  individual teacher, but also the Union. Had the parties intended to allow the 
  Union to initiate workload complaints at the WRA, they would have clearly said 
  so in the agreement. To allow the Union to refer complaints to the WRA would 
  therefore amount to a rewriting of the collective agreement. </p>
<p>
  C. Ontario Hydro Case</p>
<p>
  [28] The Union asserts that the provisions of the collective agreement are inconsistent 
  with the judgment of this Court in Re Ontario Hydro and Hydro Employees' Union 
  Local 1000, supra. In Ontario Hydro, the collective agreement contained a provision 
  which permitted a probationary employee to grieve, but precluded access to arbitration. 
  In that case, the court held that the board of arbitration had jurisdiction 
  to consider the matter. The Article barring resort to arbitration was held to 
  be ineffective due to the enactment of a section of the Labour Relations Act, 
  R.S.O. 1970, c. 232 which is similar in language to s. 46 of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [29] The present case does not involve a situation that is analogous to the 
  facts in Ontario Hydro. In Ontario Hydro, the probationary employee could initiate 
  a grievance but could not go to the arbitrator. In the present case, the employee 
  is entitled to proceed to arbitration because Article 11.02 specifically provides 
  a mechanism for the teacher employee to initiate workload complaints at the 
  WRA stage. </p>
<p>
  [30] Furthermore, this is not a case in which the Union is denied all access 
  to arbitration. In the agreement, the Union has recourse to arbitration under 
  Article 32.10 of the collective agreement, provided that union grievances &quot;shall 
  not include any matter upon which an employee would be personally entitled to 
  grieve.&quot; In addition to the right to have grievances adjudicated under 
  Article 32, the Union has the right to take grievances to arbitration under 
  s. 46 of the Act in the event that the provisions of the collective agreement 
  do not provide for &quot;final and binding settlement of all differences.&quot; 
  Although both procedures are limited, this is clearly not a case in which both 
  the individual and the Union are denied all opportunities to arbitrate. The 
  provision by the parties for a variety of different remedial mechanisms for 
  both the Union and the teacher is not the same as the complete denial of a remedy 
  as was the case in Ontario Hydro. </p>
<p>
  D. Other Caselaw </p>
<p>
  [31] The cases of Hamilton (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 
  617 (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 5 (C.A.) and Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of 
  London v. Service Employees Union, Local 210 (1997) 35 O.R. (3d) 91 (C.A.) are 
  helpful in showing when it is appropriate to infer terms into collective bargaining 
  agreements. </p>
<p>
  [32] In Hamilton, the grievor's position was eliminated and he was subsequently 
  assigned to another position at a lower salary. The grievor complained and the 
  arbitrator implied a term into the collective agreement whereby the grievor 
  was entitled to be red-circled, or paid the same salary as his previous position. 
  On appeal, this court held that inferring a term guaranteeing the wage of an 
  employee whose work had been contracted out was not necessary to the functioning 
  of the agreement's framework. Accordingly, the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction 
  when he effectively amended the provisions of the collective agreement.</p>
<p>
  [33] In Sisters of St. Joseph, the employer posted a job-vacancy previously 
  filled by registered nursing assistants with registered nurses. Despite a strong 
  management rights clause in the collective agreement, the arbitrator held that 
  the job should have been posted under the agreement covering nursing assistants 
  rather than with registered nurses. On appeal, this court held that the arbitrator 
  had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the employer's management decisions 
  to be &quot;cogent&quot; and &quot;convincing&quot;. Such a requirement was 
  not part of the collective agreement and the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction 
  by deciding the case on that basis. However, the court added that if it could 
  be said that the arbitrator was merely performing his function of interpreting 
  the agreement, then adding terms to an entirely clear provision in the agreement 
  was patently unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [34] The reasoning of this court in Hamilton and Sisters of St. Joseph, when 
  applied to the present case, demonstrates that allowing the Union to refer complaints 
  to the WRA would constitute an amendment to the agreement. First, it would contravene 
  Hamilton because the inference of such a term is not necessary to the functioning 
  of the arbitration process under Article 11.02. Since complaints may be referred 
  and settled by the teachers themselves, the involvement of the Union in the 
  referral stage is not necessary to the scheme. This is not a case where an inability 
  by the union to directly refer complaints leads to a breakdown of the dispute 
  resolution scheme set out in the agreement. Second, the agreement in this case 
  clearly provides that only teachers are allowed to refer complaints to the WRA. 
  To read in a term allowing the Union to initiate complaints would therefore 
  be contrary to the &quot;clear provision&quot; rule established in Sisters of 
  St. Joseph. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [35] As a result, the Divisional Court was correct in concluding that the WRA 
  had no jurisdiction to arbitrate workload disputes initiated by the Union. The 
  WRA was rewriting an entirely clear and specific provision of the collective 
  agreement. This rewriting by the WRA in order to confer jurisdiction on himself 
  was patently unreasonable. </p>
<p>[36] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $6,000.00, 
  as agreed by the parties.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"> APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p>
  Colleges Collective Bargaining Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 15</p>
<p>46. (1) Every agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement 
  by arbitration of all differences between an employer and the employee organization 
  arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention 
  of the agreement including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable. 
</p>
<p> (2) Unless an agreement otherwise provides for the final and binding settlement 
  of all differences between an employer and the employee organization arising 
  from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention 
  of the agreement, the agreement is deemed to include a provision to the following 
  effect: </p>
<p>Where a difference arises between an employer and the employee organization 
  relating to the interpretation, application or administration of this agreement, 
  or where an allegation is made that this agreement has been contravened, including 
  any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable, either the employer or 
  the employee organization may, after exhausting any grievance procedure established 
  by this agreement, notify the other in writing of its desire to submit the difference 
  or allegation to arbitration and the notice shall contain the name of its appointee 
  to an arbitration board. The recipient of the notice shall within five days 
  inform the other either that it accepts the other's appointee as a single arbitrator 
  or inform the other of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. Where 
  two appointees are so selected they shall, within five days of the appointment 
  of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be the chair. If the 
  recipient of the notice fails to appoint an arbitrator or if the two appointees 
  fail to agree upon a chair within the time limited, the appointment shall be 
  made by the Commission upon the request of either the employer or the employee 
  organization. The single arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the case may 
  be, shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall issue a 
  decision and the decision is final and binding upon the employer and the employee 
  organization and upon any employee affected by it. The decision of a majority 
  is the decision of the arbitration board, but, if there is no majority, the 
  decision of the chair governs. The arbitrator or arbitration board, as the case 
  may be, shall not by his, her or its decision add to, delete from, modify or 
  otherwise amend the provisions of this agreement. </p>
<p>32.10 The Union or Union Local shall have the right to file a grievance based 
  on a difference directly with the College arising out of the Agreement concerning 
  the interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention of 
  the Agreement. Such grievance shall not include any matter upon which an employee 
  would be personally entitled to grieve and the regular grievance procedure for 
  personal or group grievance shall not be by-passed except where the Union establishes 
  that the employee has not grieved an unreasonable standard that is patently 
  in violation of this Agreement and that adversely affects the rights employees. 
</p>
<p>11.01 A Each teacher shall have a workload that adheres to the provisions of 
  this Article.</p>
<p>11.02 A 1 (a) Prior to the establishment of a total workload for any teacher 
  the supervisor shall discuss the proposed workload with the teacher and complete 
  the SWF, attached as Appendix 1, to be provided by the College. The supervisor 
  shall give a copy to the teacher not later than six weeks prior to the beginning 
  of the period covered by the timetable excluding holidays and vacations. It 
  is recognized that if the SWF is subsequently revised by the College, it will 
  not be done without prior consultation with the teacher.</p>
<p>11.02 A 1 (b) The College may, where a change in circumstances requires it, 
  amend assignments provided to a teacher after the original assignment, subject 
  to the teacher's right to refer any matter to the College Workload Monitoring 
  Group (WMG) referred to in 11.02 B 1 and if necessary, the Workload Resolution 
  Arbitrator (WRA) referred to in 11.02 E 1 and appointed under 11.02 F 1.</p>
<p>11.02 A 6 (a) In the event of any difference arising from the interpretation, 
  application, administration or alleged contravention of 11.01 or 11.02, a teacher 
  shall discuss such difference as a complaint with the teacher's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>The discussion shall take place within 14 days after the circumstances giving 
  rise to the complaint have occurred or have come or ought reasonably to have 
  come to the attention of the teacher in order to give the immediate supervisor 
  an opportunity of adjusting the complaint. The discussion shall be between the 
  teacher and the immediate supervisor unless mutually agreed to have other persons 
  in attendance. The immediate supervisor's response to the complaint shall be 
  given within seven days after discussion with the teacher.</p>
<p>Failing settlement of such a complaint, a teacher may refer the complaint, 
  in writing, to the WMG within seven days of receipt of the immediate supervisor's 
  reply. The complaint shall then follow the procedures outlined in 11.02 B through 
  11.02 F.</p>
<p>11.02 B 2 Each WMG will be composed of eight members, with four to be appointed 
  by the College and four appointed by the Union Local unless the College and 
  the Union Local otherwise agree. The term of office of each member of the WMG 
  shall be two years, commencing on April 1 in each year with four members of 
  the WMG, two College appointees and two Union appointees, retiring on March 
  31 of each year. A quorum shall be comprised of four, six or eight members with 
  equal representation from the College and Union Local.</p>
<p>11.02 C 1 The functions of the WMG shall include: </p>
<p>
  (i) reviewing workload assignments in general at the College and resolving apparent 
  inequitable assignments;</p>
<p>
  (ii) reviewing specific disputes pursuant to 11.02 A 4 and/or 11.02 A 6 (a) 
  and where possible resolving such disputes;</p>
<p>
  (iii) making recommendations to the College on the operation of workload assignments 
  at the College;</p>
<p>
  (iv) reviewing individual workload assignments where requested by the teacher 
  or the Union Local and, where possible, resolving the disputes;</p>
<p>
  (v) making recommendations to the College and Union Local committees appointed 
  under Article 7, Union College Committee, as to amendments or additions to the 
  provisions governing workload assignments at the College for local negotiation 
  in accordance with 11.02 G in order to address particular workload needs at 
  the College.</p>
<p>11.02 D 5 Such decision shall be binding on the College, the Union Local and 
  the teacher involved.</p>
<p>11.02 E 1 If following a review by the WMG of an individual workload assignment 
  which has been forwarded to the WMG, the matter is not resolved, the teacher 
  shall be so advised in writing. The matter may then be referred by the teacher 
  to a WRA provided under the agreement. Failing notification by the WMG within 
  three weeks of the referral of the workload assignment to the WMG, the teacher 
  may refer the matter to the WRA.</p>
<p>11.02 E 2 If the teacher does not refer an assignment to the WRA within one 
  week of the receipt by the teacher of notification by the WMG that it has been 
  unable to settle the matter, the matter will be considered to have been settled.</p>
<p>11.02 F 5 A WRA shall determine appropriate procedure. The WRA shall commence 
  proceedings within two weeks of the referral of the matter to the WRA. It is 
  understood that the procedure shall be informal, that the WRA shall discuss 
  the matter with the teacher, the teacher's supervisor, and whomever else the 
  WRA considers appropriate.</p>
<p>11.02 F 6 A WRA shall, following the informal discussions referred to above, 
  issue a written award to the College and the Union Local and to the teacher, 
  resolving the matter. Such award shall be issued by the WRA within ten working 
  days of the informal discussion. The award shall only have application to the 
  teacher affected by the matter and shall have no application beyond the end 
  of a twelve-month period from the date of the beginning of the workload assignment.</p>
<p>11.02 F 8 The award of the WRA shall be final and binding on the parties and 
  the teacher, and shall have the same force and effect as a Board of Arbitration 
  under Article 32, Grievance Procedures.</p>
