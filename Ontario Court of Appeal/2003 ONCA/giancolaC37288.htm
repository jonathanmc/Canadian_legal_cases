<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in finding that the respondents 
  had cause to terminate the appellant. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in McKinley v. B.C. Tel., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 161 appears not to have been drawn 
  to the trial judge's attention. However, we are satisfied that, especially in 
  paras. 44 to 48 of her reasons for judgment, she carefully considered whether 
  the appellant's conduct - taking a lengthy vacation with no notice and without 
  arranging a replacement in the face of a clear warning not to do so - was incompatible 
  with his duties and gave rise to a breakdown in the employment relationship 
  sufficient to justify termination for cause. The trial judge carefully considered 
  the many factors in the appellant's favour, including his lengthy period of 
  service, the lack of formality adopted by the respondents with respect to vacations 
  and warnings, and the failure of the respondents to allege cause at the time 
  of termination, before concluding that the conduct was sufficiently serious 
  to constitute cause for termination. Her findings are entitled to deference 
  on appeal and we see no error that could justify interference.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant submits that the respondents condoned any misconduct on his 
  part. Reliance is placed on the termination letters of September 11, 1998 and 
  October 9, 1998, purporting to terminate him because of restructuring and offering 
  him a period of notice or payment in lieu of notice, and on the fact that, as 
  the trial judge found, the respondents did not actually terminate his employment 
  until October 9, 1998. We are unable to accept that submission for the following 
  reasons.</p>
<p>
  [3] It has frequently been held that that an employer who first states that 
  an employee is dismissed without cause will not necessarily be precluded from 
  later asserting cause, especially where the employer's initial position was 
  taken out of concern for the feelings of the employee: see e.g. Matheson v. 
  Matheson International Trucks, [1984] O.J. No. 306 (H.C.J.). The issue is whether 
  or not the employer's conduct amounts to condonation and, as stated in Tracey 
  v. Swansea Construction [1965] 1 O.R. 203 at 220, (H.C.J.), aff'd [1965] 2 O.R. 
  182n (C.A.): &quot;Intention is an essential element of condonation.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant was warned that if he took the vacation on such short notice 
  he should not return to work. Upon his return, he was told that there was no 
  longer a place for him with the respondents and he was given an unsigned letter 
  of termination. As the trial judge found, the respondents told the appellant 
  they no longer had a place for him, but they &quot;did not have the courage 
  to actually throw him out&quot; when he refused to listen. The reasons they 
  gave for the termination, the offer of severance pay and the delay in finally 
  carrying through with their stated intention to terminate the appellant, were 
  found by the trial judge to be acts of generosity and good faith. The respondents' 
  lack of resolve did not, in the face of their consistent assertion that they 
  wished to terminate the appellant, reflect an intention to condone his misconduct. 
  It certainly would have been preferable for the respondents to have clearly 
  stated that they had cause for termination and that the notice package they 
  were offering was without prejudice to their right to terminate for cause. However, 
  their failure to put their position in these clear terms does not, in our view, 
  support a finding of condonation in the circumstances of this case. </p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The parties may make brief written 
  submissions as to the costs of the appeal within ten days of the release of 
  this endorsement.</p>
