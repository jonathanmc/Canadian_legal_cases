<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant alleges two errors in principle.<br>
</p>
<P>(i) Disparity<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The difference between the appellant's sentence (38 months) and the co-accused's 
  sentence (23 months) is justified by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the appellant pled guilty to more charges;</li>
  <li>the appellant's record for break and enter is much worse than the co-accused's; 
    and</li>
  <li>the co-accused has an 8 year gap in his record. The appellant was released 
    three weeks before he committed these offences.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<P>(ii) The discount for the guilty plea<br>
</p>
<P>[3] The trial judge was entitled to take the timing of the guilty plea into 
  account in assessing its mitigation value. He did no more. <br>
</p>
<P>[4] The appellant also contends that the sentence is disproportionate to the 
  offence. We disagree. In the circumstances, the trial judge was required to 
  stress denunciation and deterrence. The sentence is not manifestly excessive. 
  Leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed. </p>
