<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In respect of the sexual assault that allegedly occurred on the morning 
  of September 9, 1999 after the respondent and the complainant had awoken, the 
  trial judge acquitted the respondent on the basis of the defence of honest but 
  mistaken belief in consent. In arriving at his conclusion, the trial judge took 
  into account the previous night's &quot;consensual&quot; sexual activity between 
  the parties and the complainant's failure to express her lack of consent more 
  forcefully, either by words or gestures. In sum, it would appear that the trial 
  judge was of the view that in the circumstances, the respondent was entitled 
  to take the complainant's &quot;equivocal&quot; conduct as affirmative evidence 
  of consent. </p>
<p>
  [2] Among other arguments, Mr. Lepofsky, for the Crown, submits that the analysis 
  undertaken by the trial judge was flawed by his failure to factor into it the 
  respondent's evidence that when the complainant awoke, she asked whether she 
  and the respondent had had &quot;sex last night&quot;, to which the respondent 
  replied: &quot;Yeah, a couple of times.&quot; Mr. Lepofsky argues that it was 
  incumbent on the trial judge to take that interchange into account in deciding 
  whether the respondent was entitled to take the complainant's &quot;equivocal&quot; 
  conduct as affirmative evidence of consent or whether instead, he was obliged 
  to take further steps in accordance with s. 273.2(b) of the Criminal Code to 
  ascertain whether she was in fact consenting. </p>
<p>
  [3] We agree with Mr. Lepofky's submission. The trial judge made no mention 
  of the important interchange in his reasons and we cannot be certain that he 
  took it into account in assessing whether, in the circumstances known to the 
  respondent, the respondent failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain that 
  the complainant was consenting. Accordingly, we are of the view that the acquittal 
  cannot stand. </p>
<p>
  [4] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the verdict of acquittal is set aside 
  and a new trial is ordered.</p>
