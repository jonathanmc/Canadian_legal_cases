<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice A. Gans of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated February 22, 2002, reported at (2002) 16 C.C.E.L. (3d) 97.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The principal issue in this wrongful dismissal appeal concerns the decision 
  of Gans J. to extend the notice period on the basis of the &quot;Wallace&quot; 
  factors (Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd. (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.)). 
  As a result of provincial legislation creating the new City of Toronto out of 
  the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, the City was required to do 
  a significant amount of restructuring. As a consequence, many managers who wished 
  to obtain employment with the new City were required to compete for a smaller 
  number of jobs. The respondent, who had been the Director of Roads and Sidewalk 
  Operations for the former City of North York, participated in a number of competitions. 
  He was unsuccessful in all of the competitions and his employment was terminated. 
  The City offered him a package that included 80 weeks' pay, benefits and an 
  allowance for job counselling in accordance with a programme that the City had 
  adopted for all management employees who were not successful in job competitions. 
  The respondent was dissatisfied with the manner in which one of the job competitions 
  was conducted. He applied to be reinstated and sued for wrongful dismissal.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge dismissed the application for reinstatement but allowed 
  the wrongful dismissal action. He awarded the respondent pay in lieu of notice 
  of 116 weeks, which included an unspecified amount for the Wallace factors.</p>
<p>
  [3] In my view the trial judge erred. On his findings of fact, the case for 
  increasing the period in lieu of notice for Wallace factors was not made out. 
  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with costs, if demanded. The appellant 
  cross-appealed against the trial judge's dismissal of the application for reinstatement. 
  I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs, if demanded.</p>
<p>
  THE BACKGROUND FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] There is little dispute about the background facts and they may be summarized 
  as follows. Following the amalgamation of the old City of Toronto and the adjoining 
  municipalities geographically comprising the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto 
  into the new City of Toronto, a process was put into place under which all managerial 
  positions in the new City would be filled by competition. As a result of the 
  amalgamation, some managers in the former municipalities would be terminated 
  from their employment. The City's human resource department prepared guidelines 
  for job competitions at the management level to ensure the fairness of the process. 
  In February 1998, prior to the competitions, City Council adopted a detailed 
  separation package for managers who would lose their employment as a result 
  of the competition process.</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent is a professional engineer. He began work with the former 
  City of North York in 1978 as a road maintenance engineer and since then had 
  received a number of promotions. When the new City was created he was the Director 
  of Roads and Sidewalk Operations in North York, managing a budget of $25 million 
  and a staff of 100 employees. After amalgamation he applied for five job competitions 
  and was granted an interview in three of them. The only competition in issue 
  in this case is the one for the five positions as Manager, Road Operations. 
  The respondent was one of 17 persons given interviews for these five positions.</p>
<p>
  [6] The interview panel consisted of four newly appointed Directors of Transportation 
  Services and a representative of the Human Resources department, Ruth McLellan. 
  While the four directors knew the respondent because they had worked with him 
  on a Transportation Working Group, only Roberto Stopnicki, the Director of District 
  3 (the former City of North York) was his direct superior. Moreover, Mr. Stopnicki 
  had only worked with the respondent for 3 months. The upper managers who were 
  most familiar with the respondent's work had retired before the competitions.</p>
<p>
  [7] At the competition interview, each of the candidates was asked the same 
  questions. The candidates were scored according to how they handled the questions. 
  There were two aspects to the questions: technical, upon which the respondent 
  did very well; and managerial, upon which the respondent did not fare as well. 
  The trial judge found that the interview process itself was fair.</p>
<p>
  [8] At the conclusion of the respondent's interview, he asked whether his performance 
  appraisals would be reviewed and his references contacted. The respondent testified 
  that Ms. McLellan told him that &quot;all of that would be done&quot;. In fact, 
  the respondent's performance appraisals were not considered and his referees 
  were not contacted.</p>
<p>
  [9] At the conclusion of the interviews, the directors expressed their views 
  about the prospective candidates. Mr. Stopnicki initially considered the respondent 
  to be the top candidate for the District 3 position. Had the respondent obtained 
  the job, Mr. Stopnicki would have been his supervisor. Over the weekend, after 
  speaking to one of his colleagues in another department, Mr. Stopnicki changed 
  his mind and opted for another candidate, Mr. Tenn, for the District 3 position. 
  As it happened, unbeknownst to Mr. Stopnicki, the person he spoke to was Mr. 
  Tenn's referee. Mr. Stopnicki testified that although he had worked with the 
  respondent for three months, he did not rely upon that experience in making 
  his choice.</p>
<p>
  [10] Another of the candidates who was initially considered for the District 
  1 (former City of Toronto) position was not available. That position was offered 
  to Rob Orpin even though his scores, especially on the technical questions, 
  were substantially below those of the respondent. The evidence was that the 
  respondent was not considered for the District 1 position, nor any other position.</p>
<p>
  [11] Ms. McLellan advised the respondent that he had not been successful in 
  the competition. She told him that he was passed over, primarily, because the 
  panel was of the view that his management style was not suited to the needs 
  of a merged city and that his responses to the &quot;management-type&quot; questions 
  were otherwise inappropriate. The respondent was very upset by the results of 
  the competition and met with Mr. Stopnicki, two other senior managers, Ms. McLellan, 
  and the Director of Human Resources. In December 1998, the respondent was advised 
  that his employment was terminated. He was offered a severance package in accordance 
  with the programme approved by City Council.</p>
<p>
  THE TRIAL JUDGE'S FACTUAL FINDINGS CONCERNING THE COMPETITION</p>
<p>
  [12] As I have said, the trial judge found that the interview process itself 
  was fair. He also made the following findings of fact concerning the process.</p>
<p>
  [13] As to the use of the scoring on the interviews:</p>
<p class="indent"> It does not appear to me that the results of the interview 
  alone constituted the entire rationale for the choice of the successful candidate. 
  If that were the case, the results indicate that persons other than Mr. Gismondi 
  should have been chosen not only in preference to him, but over some of the 
  other successful appointees, as well. Put otherwise, the highest interview mark 
  did not guarantee an appointment to the Manager's position. That having been 
  said, I hasten to add that there was nothing in the job posting itself which 
  mandated this result.</p>
<p>
  [14] Regarding whether the respondent was really in the running for any position 
  other than the District 3 position:</p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied on the evidence that Mr. Gismondi, notwithstanding 
  the fact that he applied for a Manager's position in each of the districts of 
  the merged City, was, realistically speaking, only in the running for a position 
  in the former City of North York. I am also satisfied that other than Roberto 
  Stopnicki, he had no one in his corner, as it were, and was in no way the preferred 
  candidate of any of the other directors. As I read the responses to the questions 
  posed and the evidence elicited, there is no doubt that his technical and technically-oriented 
  management skills were unquestioned and demonstrative of a proficient individual. 
  However, he did not overwhelm the members of the committee during the interview 
  or during his previous limited work-related encounters with them such that he 
  might be considered for a position outside his bailiwick. However, while he 
  may have found the process intimidating or daunting, this was the same process 
  to which all the candidates were subjected, a fact which does make the situation 
  inherently wrong or unfair.</p>
<p>
  [15] With respect to reasons for why the respondent was not selected for the 
  District 3 position:</p>
<p class="indent"> I also accept the evidence of the City's witnesses, perhaps 
  inelegantly put, that Mr. Gismondi was not the preferred candidate even for 
  the position in the former North York because, on balance, he did not appear 
  receptive to the dramatic changes, real or imagined, that they suggested were 
  imminent.</p>
<p>
  [16] However, the trial judge also found that Mr. Stopnicki opted for Mr. Tenn, 
  in part, because of the comments of his colleague who, as noted, happened to 
  be Mr. Tenn's referree. He also held that the respondent had an expectation 
  that his references and personnel file would be reviewed and that he was &quot;effectively, 
  but not purposely, treated in a manner different from other candidates&quot;. 
  That said, the trial judge also found that the difference in treatment did not 
  ultimately affect the result:</p>
<p class="indent"> What is ironic is that the conduct complained of was not egregious. 
  It was, simply put, sloppy. Had Mr. Stopnicki done what had been expected of 
  him, I dare say the result would probably not have been any different. The fact 
  of the matter was, although not stated in these terms, Mr. Stopnicki chose a 
  manager with whom he thought he could work and one who was better suited for 
  the new era. It would have been best if he and the H.R. personnel merely stated 
  this as the underlying rationale rather than attempting to justify the choice 
  in an otherwise transparent fashion. More harm was caused than was necessary 
  in an attempt to be diplomatic.</p>
<p>
  [17] The respondent obtained a new position in September 2000 but at a much 
  lower salary than what he had received from the City.</p>
<p>
  THE APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT</p>
<p>
  [18] At trial, the respondent argued that he was entitled to be instated into 
  one of the two positions of Manager, Road Operations that had gone to Mr. Tenn 
  and Mr. Orpin. This claim was based on the theory that he held an office that 
  went beyond the normal employer/employee relationship. The City was required 
  to accord him a special duty of fairness. He also submits that his employment 
  could only be terminated by a special resolution of City Council. The basis 
  for this argument is that when he was appointed to his position of Director 
  of Roads and Sidewalk Operations, the appointment was made by resolution of 
  North York City Council. As a result of the City of Toronto Act 1997, S.O. 1997, 
  c. 2 which created the new City of Toronto, he continued to hold that position.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge found that the respondent was a level 4 employee and could 
  be hired, fired and promoted by the City's Chief Administrative Officer, subject 
  to any regulations adopted by Council. In February 1998, Council adopted by 
  by-law governing the programme that led to the competitive process and the packages 
  for employees who were unsuccessful in the competition. The trial judge held 
  that it was not necessary for there to be a special resolution to terminate 
  the respondent's appointment. In any event, the by-law effectively rescinded 
  any resolution pertaining to the respondent's appointment by the former City 
  of North York. He also held that the respondent was not an office holder entitled 
  to a special duty of fairness.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [20] The appeal raises two issues: First, whether the trial judge erred in awarding 
  an amount for Wallace factors. Second, whether the trial judge erred in finding 
  that the respondent was entitled to more than the 80 weeks severance offered 
  by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [21] The cross-appeal raises the issues of whether the respondent held an office 
  and whether his employment could be terminated without a special resolution 
  of Council.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Wallace Factors</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge held that bad faith conduct on the part of the employer 
  justifying increased compensation under Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd. 
  is not limited to acts of the employer at the moment of dismissal and can include 
  &quot;the employer's conduct pre- and post-termination &#133; and the conduct 
  of the employer in its aftermath&quot;. The trial judge found that the City 
  &quot;lost control of the competition, in failing to apply the City's own fair, 
  open and equitable hiring criteria uniformly across the board&quot;. The trial 
  judge found that the conduct of the directors involved in the competition, including 
  Mr. Stopnicki, &quot;was not malevolent, and was probably well intentioned&quot; 
  but he and the other directors failed to follow the settled process. The process 
  &quot;went off the fairness-rails&quot; when the respondent was &quot;effectively, 
  but not purposefully&quot; treated differently from the other candidates. Finally, 
  more harm was caused than necessary &quot;in an attempt to be diplomatic&quot;. 
  The trial judge held that the respondent was entitled to receive 116 weeks pay 
  in lieu of notice, which award included an unspecified amount in respect of 
  the Wallace factors.</p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, these factors neither individually nor cumulatively justified 
  increased compensation under Wallace. I do not disagree with the trial judge's 
  view that Wallace damages are not limited to acts of the employer at the very 
  moment of dismissal and can in appropriate circumstances include &quot;the employer's 
  conduct pre- and post-termination &#133; and the conduct of the employer in 
  its aftermath&quot; but only, in my view, as a component of the manner of dismissal. 
  None of the conduct referred to by the trial judge reached the level of seriousness 
  justifying increased notice under Wallace. Further, the trial judge made no 
  findings that the manner in which the respondent was dealt with caused any injury 
  that was entitled to compensation in accordance with Wallace.</p>
<p>
  [24] In Wallace at para. 95, Iacobucci J. observed that involuntary loss of 
  one's job &quot;is always a traumatic event&quot; and that when employment is 
  terminated the employee is most vulnerable and in need of protection. Thus, 
  employers are held to an obligation of &quot;good faith and fair dealing in 
  the manner of dismissal.&quot; The courts will order compensation for breach 
  of this duty by adding to the length of the notice period. Further, he held 
  at para. 103 that while the law does not recognize injured feelings and emotional 
  upset as compensable losses arising from dismissal itself, where the bad faith 
  conduct or unfair dealing has caused injuries such as humiliation, embarrassment 
  and damage to one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem, these injuries &quot;might 
  all be worthy of compensation depending upon the circumstances of the case&quot;. 
  These injuries are entitled to compensation even if they have not actually affected 
  the employee's ability to obtain new employment. If the injuries did affect 
  the ability to find employment, as was the case in Wallace, the injuries may 
  be worthy of &quot;considerably more compensation&quot; (para. 104).</p>
<p>
  [25] In Wallace, Iacobucci J. did not purport to exhaustively define the nature 
  of the bad faith or unfair dealing that entitled the employee to additional 
  compensation. However, from the facts of Wallace and the examples relied upon 
  in that case, it is possible to formulate several general propositions. The 
  kind of conduct identified by Iacobucci J. included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> False allegation that termination was because of inability to perform the 
    job;</li>
  <li>False allegation that termination was for cause;</li>
  <li>Persisting in the allegation of cause up to the time of trial;</li>
  <li>Spreading word through the industry that the employee was terminated for 
    dishonest conduct or having done &quot;something reprehensible&quot;;</li>
  <li>Refusal to provide a letter of reference after termination;</li>
  <li>Although the employee's position was eliminated, he was led to believe he 
    would be transferred to a new job and only told of termination after selling 
    his home; </li>
  <li>Firing employee immediately upon return from disability leave (because suffering 
    from major depression);</li>
  <li>Laid-off employee learning, through a newspaper advertisement for his position, 
    that he had been terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [26] Iacobucci J. made it clear at para. 101 that these examples were not intended 
  to be an exhaustive list of types of bad faith or unfair dealing in the manner 
  of dismissal that would be worthy of compensation. However, he also indicated 
  that the examples were &quot;indicative of the type of conduct that ought to 
  merit compensation&quot; and that &quot;not all acts of bad faith or unfair 
  dealing will be equally injurious and thus, the amount by which the notice period 
  is extended will vary&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [27] The decisions from this and other courts since Wallace provide further 
  examples of the type of conduct by employers that justifies extending the notice 
  period. In Noseworthy v. Riverside Pontiac-Buick Ltd. (1998), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 
  629 (Ont. C.A.), the employer confronted the plaintiff with a false allegation 
  of forgery and threatened to lay criminal charges if he did not sign a letter 
  of resignation. The circumstances surrounding the termination caused the plaintiff 
  to suffer from traumatic stress disorder. </p>
<p>
  [28] In Marshall v. Watson Wyatt &amp; Co. (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 813 (C.A.), 
  the employer claimed in its statement of defence that it had just cause to dismiss 
  the plaintiff because of insubordination, inability to deal with subordinates, 
  failure to achieve expected performance, and generally unprofessional behaviour. 
  The employer maintained these allegations until shortly before the trial began. 
  It also failed to pay certain commissions that it acknowledged were owing to 
  the plaintiff, and delayed sending her the record of employment required for 
  unemployment insurance benefits. This conduct affected the plaintiff's ability 
  to market herself and deprived her of money needed to start her own business. 
  This court upheld a jury award of a three-month extension of the notice period. 
  As Laskin J.A. wrote for the court at para. 41, the employer &quot;practiced 
  the kind of 'hard ball' the Supreme Court of Canada warned against in Wallace&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [29] In Antonacci v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Company of Canada, Ltd. (2000), 
  181 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 5, this court set out the findings 
  of the trial judge. The trial judge found that a longer period of notice was 
  justified because of unfounded allegations made against the plaintiff of &quot;poor 
  performance, harassment, intimidation and threats [that] cast a shadow on him 
  that would make it virtually impossible for him to find another position.&quot; 
  The trial judge held that the plaintiff, a 33-year employee was entitled to 
  &quot;the maximum period of notice generally said to be available in wrongful 
  dismissal cases-namely, 24 months&quot;. That finding was not in issue in the 
  appeal, which concerned the deductibility of certain benefits.</p>
<p> [30] In Prinzo v. Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 
  474 (C.A.), the employer dismissed a 17&frac12;-year employee. The plaintiff 
  had been on disability leave and the employer made harassing telephone calls 
  to her inferring that she was malingering. The employer also wrote a letter 
  to the plaintiff falsely implying that her physician had said she was fit to 
  return to work. When the plaintiff did return to work she was told she would 
  be terminated and that the employer was concerned that her conduct not cause 
  harm to the residents of the geriatric centre. These events led to the plaintiff 
  suffering emotional upset, increased blood pressure, weight gain and return 
  of diabetes symptoms. The trial judge found that the plaintiff suffered a loss 
  of self-esteem and distress on a disabling basis for months after her dismissal. 
  Weiler J.A. speaking for the court upheld an award made by the trial judge for 
  mental suffering. However, she went on to hold that if the plaintiff was not 
  entitled to damages for the independent tort of intentional infliction of mental 
  suffering, she would have been entitled to a longer notice period based on the 
  Wallace factors. At para. 68, Weiler J.A. held that the manner of dismissal 
  "caused more than injured feelings and emotional upset; it was humiliating 
  and damaging to the self-esteem of a long-term employee".</p>
<p>
  [31] In Kroll v. 949486 Ontario Inc. (1997), 34 C.C.E.L. (2d) 78 (Gen. Div.) 
  at para. 26, Stach J. held that the plaintiff was entitled to an extended notice 
  period for &quot;bad faith&quot; dismissal. The employer gave the plaintiff 
  a letter of termination including an inadequate offer of severance pay, telling 
  him that if he did not accept the offer he would be terminated for cause and 
  would receive nothing. The offer included a restrictive covenant that would 
  have prevented him from working elsewhere. The employer knowingly terminated 
  the plaintiff just before his wedding.</p>
<p>
  [32] Returning to the question of bad faith or unfair dealing, it seems to me 
  that what is common in all of the examples provided in Wallace and the other 
  cases I have mentioned above is the presence of something akin to intent, malice, 
  or blatant disregard for the employee. It is conduct that could be characterized 
  as &quot;callous and insensitive treatment&quot; (Wallace at para. 88), or as 
  Laskin J.A. said in Marshall, &quot;playing hardball&quot; (Marshall at para. 
  41). The conduct found by the trial judge to exist in this case does not in 
  any sense resemble the examples provided in Wallace. The trial judge described 
  the directors, including the one he was most critical of, Mr. Stopnicki, as 
  &quot;not malevolent&quot; and &quot;probably well intentioned&quot;. He described 
  the manner in which the competition was conducted as &quot;sloppy&quot;. This 
  does not reach the kind of conduct worthy of compensation. </p>
<p>
  [33] I have particular difficulty with the trial judge's view that dealing with 
  the respondent &quot;diplomatically&quot; is a basis for compensation. If the 
  trial judge was thereby attempting to place the conduct into the category of 
  employees who were misled by the employer leading up to the dismissal, this 
  is simply not borne out by the evidence. Ms. McLellan and Mr. Stopnicki told 
  the respondent that he did not get the job because his management style was 
  not suited to the needs of the merged city. The trial judge found as a fact 
  that the respondent was not the preferred candidate because &quot;he did not 
  appear receptive to the dramatic changes, real or imagined&quot; that were imminent, 
  and that Mr. Stopnicki chose a candidate &quot;with whom he could work and one 
  who was better suited for the new era&quot;. I do not think there is a significant 
  difference between these findings of fact and what the respondent was told.</p>
<p>
  [34] If there are grounds for extending the notice period on the basis of Wallace, 
  it can therefore only be because Mr. Stopnicki inadvertently consulted with 
  a colleague who turned out to be Mr. Tenn's referee, and because the respondent's 
  expectations about checking references or the personnel file were not met. The 
  trial judge's findings that this conduct was neither malevolent nor egregious 
  but merely sloppy and, in any event, had no bearing on the outcome of the competition 
  are, in my view, fatal to the claim for increased notice. </p>
<p>
  [35] On appeal, the respondent argued that increased notice was justified because 
  the Directors also ignored their own scoring. Thus, even though the respondent 
  scored substantially higher than Mr. Orpin, he was rejected in favour of Mr. 
  Orpin for the District 1 position. However, the trial judge found that realistically, 
  the respondent was only in the running for the District 3 position. He also 
  found that there was nothing in the job posting itself that guaranteed that 
  the job would go to the candidate with the highest interview mark. Those findings, 
  in my view, weigh against the proposition that this could constitute a basis 
  for increased notice under Wallace.</p>
<p>
  [36] The respondent also relied upon certain internal memos generated by the 
  Human Resources department in the wake of his complaints about the competition. 
  In one of the memos, the Director of Human Resources summarizes his findings 
  by stating:</p>
<p class="indent"> In the end, I think we lost control of this competition. I'm 
  really disappointed in the way this was handled. In effect, the client made 
  decisions that it was not entitled to make, and we did not push back.</p>
<p>
  [37] The respondent points out that this memo was not disclosed prior to trial 
  and, to the contrary, the City insisted that the Human Resources Department 
  had reviewed the competition and they found that the competition was conducted 
  properly and fairly. The respondent did not call the author of the memo to testify. 
  The City made Ms. McLellan available for cross-examination. The trial judge 
  found that the respondent &quot;appropriately passed on this opportunity&quot;. 
  Although the Human Resources personnel were not called, it is possible to discern 
  their concerns. The problem was that Mr. Orpin was offered the job although 
  his scores were lower than the respondents. It seems that Human Resources felt 
  that they should have been involved if the decision was made to offer the job 
  to a candidate with a lower score.</p>
<p>
  [38] I have essentially already dealt with this aspect of the case. The trial 
  judge had the same material before him and he concluded that the conduct was 
  merely sloppy. He also noted that there was no guarantee that the candidate 
  with the higher score would be offered the job. The conduct is nothing like 
  that referred to in Wallace, as where the employer persisted in an unfounded 
  allegation that the employee was dismissed for cause, in particular because 
  of dishonesty. </p>
<p>
  [39] The trial judge found that no procedural safeguards formed part of the 
  respondent's contract. He also held that, &quot;Whatever format the City had 
  agreed to follow in its selection process could not reasonably be said to constitute 
  an element of the plaintiff's contract of employment, nor was there any consideration 
  for its inclusion in the contract&quot;. In the circumstances of this case, 
  the failure of the employer to strictly follow its own procedure neither entitled 
  the respondent to damages for a breach of contract nor to an extended notice 
  period, absent bad faith conduct as described in Wallace, even though the respondent 
  was dismissed as a result of the competition.</p>
<p>
  The Length of the Notice Period</p>
<p>
  [40] City Council approved a separation programme for managers who were not 
  retained after the competitive process. Under that programme, the respondent 
  was entitled to a severance payment equal to four weeks per year of employment 
  to a maximum of 96 weeks and other benefits. The respondent's employment was 
  terminated in December 1998. Since he had been employed for 20 years he was 
  offered 80 weeks severance pay. He was also offered a number of other benefits. 
  The trial judge was of the view that the range established by the City was inadequate. 
  He said this:</p>
<p class="indent"> I agree with the City's counsel that a court is not equipped 
  to micro manage a municipal restructuring. I am also inclined to the view that 
  a court should be loathe to second guess management when it has made a genuine 
  and bona fide attempt to craft and provide a reasonable termination package. 
  On the other hand, in the instant case, a &quot;one-suit fits all&quot; approach 
  to Mr. Gismondi's termination is not appropriate having regard to the off-cited 
  Bardal criteria. In my view, the upper end of the severance range should not 
  be capped at 96 weeks. I am of the opinion, under the circumstances of his employment 
  as defined above, that the range should more appropriately be set between 96 
  and 120 weeks for salary continuation or notice. This range would be equally 
  applicable to all the benefits to which Mr. Gismondi was otherwise entitled, 
  including employer pension contribution [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [41] The Bardal criteria referred to in the trial judge's reasons are, of course, 
  the criteria set out in the decision of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Bardal v. The Globe 
  and Mail Ltd. (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 and especially the passage at p. 145:</p>
<p class="indent"> There can be no catalogue laid down as to what is reasonable 
  notice in particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must 
  be decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the character 
  of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the age of the 
  servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, 
  training and qualifications of the servant.</p>
<p>
  [42] This passage has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Machtinger 
  v. HOJ Industries Ltd., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 986 and was referred to with approval 
  in Wallace at paras. 81 and 82 with the caveat that the Bardal criteria are 
  not exhaustive.</p>
<p>
  [43] Aside from stating that a &quot;one-size suit fits all&quot; approach was 
  not appropriate having regard to the Bardal criteria, the trial judge gave no 
  reasons for finding that the scheme established by the City was not appropriate 
  in general or for the respondent, except for the Wallace factors. Leaving aside 
  the Wallace factors, there is no particular criterion that suggests the range 
  set by the City Council was not proper. The only factor in this case requiring 
  special attention is that because of province-wide downsizing the respondent 
  would find it more difficult to find new employment in the municipal sector. 
  The trial judge did not mention this or any other factor for indicating why 
  the range set by the City was inconsistent with the Bardal criteria. </p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge's decision as to the length of notice is entitled to deference. 
  See Minott v. O'Shanter Development Company Ltd. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) 
  at 344. Further, as pointed out in that case, even where there is an error in 
  principle, the appellate court should substitute its own figure for that of 
  the trial judge &quot;sparingly if the trial judge's award is within an acceptable 
  range&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [45] The trial judge awarded 116 weeks notice. The selection of this notice 
  period is tainted by his error with respect to the Wallace factors. Further, 
  as I have said, the trial judge did not otherwise explain why the 80 weeks notice 
  offered by the City was inconsistent with the Bardal factors.</p>
<p>
  [46] One hundred and sixteen weeks exceeds by a considerable amount the 24 months 
  (104 weeks) salary in lieu of notice in Wallace that Iacobucci J. described 
  at para. 109 as &quot;at the high end of the scale&quot;. In Wallace, in addition 
  to the bad faith factors I have already referred to and which affected the plaintiff's 
  ability to find other employment, the court also took into account that the 
  plaintiff had been induced to leave his previous long-term secure employment 
  with an expectation that he would be employed by the defendant until retirement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [47] In my view, the trial judge's award is outside the acceptable range. I 
  agree with the trial judge that the courts cannot micro-manage a municipal restructuring. 
  The respondent did not show that the City's original offer was unreasonable. 
  Judgment should have been granted in accordance with the City's December 8, 
  1998 offer.</p>
<p>
  Right to reinstatement</p>
<p>
  [48] In his cross-appeal, the respondent submits that he held an office to which 
  a special duty of fairness attached aside from or in addition to the general 
  duty of fairness that arises at the time of termination. He submits that the 
  competition was not conducted fairly and he is entitled to be installed in one 
  or the other of the Manager, Road Operations positions. </p>
<p>
  [49] In a related submission, the respondent submits that he was never properly 
  terminated because there was no special Council resolution. He submits that 
  such a resolution was required because he was appointed by resolution to his 
  former position by the City of North York and under s. 2(7) of the City of Toronto 
  Act, 1997, every resolution of an old council is deemed to be a resolution of 
  the council of the new city. </p>
<p>
  [50] I can briefly deal with this second issue. In January 1998, City Council 
  adopted By-law No. 2-1998 setting out the duties and powers of the Chief Administrative 
  Officer including the power to &quot;appoint, promote, demote, suspend and dismiss, 
  subject to the provisions of any personnel regulations adopted by Council or 
  collective agreements applicable to employees of the City, all employees of 
  the City except the first level of senior management and statutory officials&quot;. 
  The respondent was not in the first level of senior management and is not a 
  statutory official. The offer made to the respondent was in accordance with 
  the separation programme adopted by Council in By-Law 40-1998. In my view, this 
  was sufficient authority to terminate the respondent's employment and no other 
  resolution of Council was required.</p>
<p>
  [51] With respect to the question of whether the respondent held an office to 
  which a special duty of fairness attached, I agree with the comprehensive reasons 
  of the trial judge and need only deal briefly with some of the submissions made 
  by the respondent in the cross-appeal. </p>
<p>
  [52] To summarize, the trial judge noted that the respondent fell in the ranks 
  of middle management and, absent any statutory or contractual requirements to 
  the contrary, municipal council had an unfettered discretion to dismiss any 
  of its employees. Like many municipal employees, the respondent held a position 
  of trust but this alone was not sufficient to make him an office holder. He 
  was not an officer within the meaning of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  M-45.</p>
<p>
  [53] The respondent relies upon the decision of this court in Hanis v. Teevan 
  (1998), 37 C.C.E.L. (2d) 1, which applied Knight v. Indian Head School Division 
  No. 19 (1990), 69 D.L.R. (4th) 490 (S.C.C.). In Knight at p. 502, the court 
  found that the relationship between employer and employee was not a &quot;pure 
  master and servant&quot; but had a &quot;strong 'statutory flavour', so as to 
  be categorized as an office&quot;. In Knight, the plaintiff held the office 
  of Director of Education, a position created by statute. By contrast, the respondent's 
  position did not have this strong statutory flavour. He was a middle manager 
  in a large municipality. He managed a large number of people and a large budget 
  but he was simply one of many employees and managers delivering municipal services 
  to the public. The municipal resolution appointing the respondent to his position 
  in the City of North York cannot be equated to a statutory position as considered 
  in Knight. </p>
<p>
  [54] The respondent's position is somewhat closer to the plaintiff's position 
  in Hanis. The plaintiff in that case was the Director of the Social Science 
  Computing Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario, and an Adjunct Professor 
  without tenure. He had built the laboratory from the ground up, played a leading 
  role in its development and management and applied for and received valuable 
  research grants. He was not governed by any detailed instructions from anyone 
  in a greater position of authority. In those circumstances, this court found 
  that the plaintiff was an office holder in the University, which is created 
  by statute and receives public funds. While, as I have said, the respondent 
  managed a large staff and budget, his employment does not otherwise have the 
  attributes of the plaintiff's employment in Hanis. I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [55] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and direct 
  that the City pay the respondent in accordance with its offer in December 8, 
  1998. I would dismiss the cross-appeal. The appellant should serve and file 
  its submissions on costs within 14 days of the release of these reasons. The 
  respondent will have 14 days to serve and file his response.</p>

  &quot;I agree Louise Charron J.A.&quot;</p>
