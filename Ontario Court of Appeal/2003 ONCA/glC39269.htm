<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Gladys I. Pardu of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated November 22, 2002. </p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted on charges of sexual touching and sexual assault 
  on his thirteen-year-old sister-in-law. The complainant described approximately 
  eighteen incidents over an eighteen-month period which included kissing, touching 
  of her breasts and vagina, both over and under her clothes, and inserting his 
  finger into her vagina. Anything more serious, she declined his advances and 
  he accepted her refusal. The sexual abuse became progressively more invasive.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was thirty years old during the relevant period. He was raised 
  in a dysfunctional home environment and was abused when he was young. He left 
  his family at a young age to become active in the workforce. He had an unsuccessful 
  marriage that produced two children, whom he continues to support. He is remarried 
  with three children, two of them from his wife's previous marriage. He and his 
  wife operate a waste disposal business and a towing company. Due to a physical 
  disability, his wife operates the businesses from their home and he performs 
  the manual labour on site. He has made contributions to his community.</p>
<p>
  [3] At the sentencing hearing, the Crown was seeking a period of imprisonment 
  of 9 to 12 months and the defence was seeking a conditional sentence of 12 to 
  18 months. The trial judge imposed a 10-month sentence of imprisonment to be 
  followed by probation for three years. The appellant appeals the sentence. He 
  has already served 49 days of his sentence.</p>
<p>
  [4] It is conceded that, by virtue of s. 45 of the Young Offenders Act, the 
  trial judge should not have considered or been made aware of the appellant's 
  youth record for sexual assault. Neither counsel nor the trial judge appeared 
  to be aware of s. 45 of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant's prior conviction for sexual assault as a young offender 
  clearly figured in the trial judge's reasons. In her reasons, she stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Most significantly, the accused was convicted at age 15 of 
  sexual assault of a ten year old girl and sentenced to six months probation.</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> In this case, I fear that serving the sentence in the community 
  would endanger the community. The accused's two convictions at age 15 and at 
  age 33 for sexual assaults of female children raise concerns that he has a long-standing 
  problem of sexual deviancy involving little girls. This puts the community at 
  risk.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge erred in relying on the appellant's young offender record 
  and, as a result of this record, in her assessment of the risk that the appellant 
  presented to the community. This was an error in principle and this court must 
  now address the appropriate sentence for the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [7] This court has repeatedly stressed both the serious nature of sexual abuse 
  against children and the importance of sentencing sexual offenders with the 
  principles of denunciation and deterrence in mind. See R. v. Palmer (1985), 
  7 O.A.C. 348 (C.A.) and R. v. D. (D.) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 at 797 (C.A.). 
  In R. v. D. R., an unreported decision, released February 24, 2003, this court 
  said at para. 8:</p>
<p class="indent"> This court has repeatedly indicated that a conditional sentence 
  should rarely be imposed in cases involving the sexual touching of children 
  by adults, particularly where, as here, the sexual violation is of a vulnerable 
  victim by a person in a position of trust. In addition, circumstances that involve 
  multiple sexual acts over an extended period of time and escalating in intrusiveness 
  generally warrant a severe sentence.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant was in a position of trust and the complainant was exceptionally 
  vulnerable. He used the complainant for his own sexual gratification, told her 
  that he loved her and threatened that disclosure would destroy his marriage 
  and hurt her sister. More importantly, the sexual offences were not isolated 
  incidents and they occurred over a lengthy period of time. They were progressively 
  more invasive and they had a marked impact on the complainant. According to 
  the pre-sentence report, the appellant has not accepted responsibility for his 
  actions. Subsequently, he abandoned his appeal against conviction. </p>
<p>
  [9] Although the imprisonment of the appellant may have adverse financial consequences 
  for the appellant and his family, the sentence of actual imprisonment was, and 
  continues to be, the most appropriate disposition in this case, having regard 
  to the principle of general deterrence and the need to express society's condemnation 
  of the appellant's conduct.</p>
<p>
  [10] In these circumstances, the sentence imposed was fit.</p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, while we would grant leave to appeal sentence, the appeal 
  is dismissed.</p>
