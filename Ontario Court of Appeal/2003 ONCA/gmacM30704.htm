<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The union moves under s. 193(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. B-3, for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal the order of Ground 
  J. dated April 29, 2003. The motion was originally brought before a panel of 
  this court to be argued together with the appeal. The panel determined that 
  this was a case where leave is required and must be obtained from a judge in 
  chambers. The parties advised that a date for the hearing of the appeal has 
  been obtained in the event that leave is granted.</p>
<p>
  [2] Because I have decided that this is an appropriate case for leave to be 
  granted so that there will be a full hearing of the issues by the panel, I will 
  only briefly set out the facts and reasons for granting leave.</p>
<p>
  [3] The context of this motion is the receivership of the T.C.T. Companies including 
  its unionized warehouse operation at Toronto, which employed seventy employees. 
  When the companies became insolvent, the largest secured creditor, GMAC Commercial 
  Credit Corporation - Canada, obtained the court appointment of an interim receiver, 
  KPMG, who later also became the trustee in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>
  [4] The interim receivership order, which was initially obtained ex parte, contained 
  a standard form clause protecting the receiver from the status of successor 
  employer under the collective agreement. It also contained another standard 
  form clause preventing anyone from bringing any action or proceeding against 
  the receiver without leave of the court. </p>
<p>
  [5] The receiver eventually sold the assets of the warehousing business to a 
  newly formed company owned by executives of T.C.T., which company moved the 
  operation from the unionized premises to another warehouse in Mississauga and 
  hired some of the former employees.</p>
<p>
  [6] Following the sale, the union brought an application before the Ontario 
  Labour Relations Board against KPMG and the purchasing company for a declaration 
  that the purchasing company is the successor employer to T.C.T. or KPMG and 
  thus bound by the collective agreement; a declaration that T.C.T. and the purchasing 
  company are a single employer for the purposes of labour relations; a declaration 
  of unfair labour practice and damages against T.C.T. and/or KPMG and the purchasing 
  company for eliminating the union; and for the certification of the union as 
  the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees of the purchasing company.</p>
<p>
  [7] The OLRB stayed the application against KPMG because the union had not obtained 
  leave of the court. The union then brought its motion before Ground J. for an 
  order deleting the provision of the receivership order that prevented the receiver 
  from becoming a successor employer, and for an order granting leave under the 
  receivership order or under s. 215 of the BIA to commence proceedings against 
  the receiver before the labour board.</p>
<p>
  [8] Ground J., in a thoroughly reasoned judgment, amended the receivership order 
  to provide that the receiver could not be deemed a successor employer as long 
  as it acted only as a realizer of the assets of the debtor and not as an employer 
  operating the business, following the decision of Farley J. in Re Royal Crest 
  Lifecare Group Inc., [2003] O.J. No. 756 (S.C.), and the decision of the Nova 
  Scotia Court of Appeal in Saan Stores Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Labour Relations 
  Board) (1999), 173 N.S.R. (2d) 222 (C.A.). He also made a finding that KPMG 
  had only acted as a realizer of assets in this receivership. Consequently, he 
  saw no basis for the court to grant leave to the union to proceed against the 
  receiver before the OLRB. He noted that his order would have no impact on the 
  union's proceeding at the labour board against the purchaser corporation.</p>
<p>
  [9] The test for granting leave to appeal under s. 193(e) of the BIA has been 
  described as containing the following criteria: leave should only be granted 
  if the judgment is contrary to law; amounts to an abuse of judicial power or 
  involves an obvious error, causing prejudice for which there is no remedy: McNab 
  v. B.S. &amp; B. Enterprises Ltd. (1951), 32 C.B.R. 53 (Que. K.B.), and from 
  Power Consolidated (China) Pulp Inc. v. British Columbia Resources Investment 
  Corp. (1988), 19 C.P.C. (3d) 396 (B.C. C.A.): whether the point of the appeal 
  is of significance to the practice; whether the point raised is of significance 
  to the action itself; whether the appeal is prima facie meritorious or frivolous; 
  and, whether the appeal will unduly prejudice the progress of the action. When 
  the order appealed from is discretionary, the issue must be of importance to 
  the administration of justice or to the rights of the parties: Zurich Indemnity 
  Co. of Canada v. Reemark Rideau Developments Ltd. (1992), 22 C.B.R. (3d) 291 
  (B.C. C.A.). Finally, the significance of the issue in bankruptcy law can determine 
  whether leave is granted: Re Nagy (1997), 1 C.B.R. (4th) 179 (Alta. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [10] The receiver opposes the motion on several grounds including the fact that 
  the union waited until after the business was sold to bring its proceeding, 
  after the receiver had acted on the understanding that it had the protection 
  of the receivership order in respect of any obligations to employees and under 
  the collective agreement. Linked with that objection is that this motion is 
  holding up the conclusion of the receivership and is causing the receiver to 
  incur significant cost. The receiver also submits that an order under s. 215 
  of the BIA is discretionary and therefore unlikely to be reversed on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [11] The union puts forth explanations for its delay in moving against the receivership 
  order and before the labour board. I conclude from my review of the reasons 
  of Ground J. that he did not base his decision on the union's delay. The union 
  says that it is (or may be) prejudiced in its proceedings against the purchasing 
  company if the receiver is not a party to the proceedings for the purpose of 
  continuity. </p>
<p>
  [12] Most importantly, the union points to developing jurisprudence across Canada 
  regarding the relationship between the role of the bankruptcy court and the 
  role of the labour board in determining the rights of employees of insolvent 
  companies, the status of a receiver or trustee as successor employer and its 
  obligations under a collective agreement: Re Big Sky Living Inc. (2002), 318 
  A.R. 165 (Q.B.); Saan Stores Ltd., supra; Re Royal Crest Lifecare Group, supra; 
  Syndicat national de l'amiante d'Asbestos inc. v. Jeffrey Mines Inc., [2003] 
  R.J.Q. 420 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [13] The question of leave is further complicated by the fact that the Royal 
  Crest case has been argued in this court and is under reserve. Although some 
  of the same issues are raised in that case, the facts are quite different.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [14] In my view, this is a case where leave ought to be granted. Ground J. not 
  only made a discretionary order, he also made the finding of no successor employer 
  and the amendment to the receivership order regarding the immunity of the receiver. 
  The legal issues identified in para. 12 are significant to commercial practice 
  regarding bankruptcy and receivership and ought to be considered and addressed 
  by this court. The issues are also of significance in the action. It is timely 
  that the issues be addressed by this court as part of the currently developing 
  jurisprudence.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appeal is scheduled to be heard on January 28, 2004. The costs of this 
  motion will follow the event of the appeal in an amount to be determined by 
  the panel based on the bills of costs that were filed at the hearing of this 
  motion. The costs incurred by the two respondents in preparing the responding 
  factums in response to the new factums filed on short notice by the union are 
  fixed at $1,200 each and are payable forthwith.</p>
