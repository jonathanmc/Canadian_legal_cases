<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground, of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, dated May 27, 2002.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] When will a trustee's statutory priority to the assets of the estate, for 
  payment of its fees, be set aside in favour of the estate solicitor's competing 
  claim for payment of legal fees? It is that question which this appeal must 
  address.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND </p>
<p>
  [2] Robert Irving Goldin, a former lawyer and business advisor, allegedly misdirected 
  $6.5 million that his family, friends and business associates advanced for investment 
  purposes. On October 12, 1999, Goldin made an assignment in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  [3] Initially, Ernst &amp; Young was appointed trustee of the Goldin estate. 
  The first creditors meeting was held on October 22, 1999, at which time the 
  appellant, Soberman Isenbaum Colomby Tessis Inc. (the &quot;Trustee&quot;) was 
  appointed to replace Ernst &amp; Young. At the same meeting, the respondent, 
  Bennett &amp; Company (&quot;Bennett&quot;), was appointed estate solicitor.</p>
<p>
  [4] Bennett was instructed to, among other things, collect $319,000 U.S.D. that 
  was being held in trust by Artor Holdings Inc. (the &quot;Artor funds&quot;). 
  Bennett immediately brought a motion, returnable on December 1, 1999, for an 
  order that the Artor funds be released to the estate.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Artor funds arose from a sale of property in Arizona over which Artor 
  held a mortgage receivable. Goldin had arranged for the mortgage through Goldwest 
  Holdings LLC, an Arizona company. Goldin and his wife, Nancy, were the registered 
  stakeholders in Goldwest. Artor sold the property and took $319, 000 U.S.D. 
  for itself. It held the balance of the proceeds of $319, 000 U.S.D. in trust 
  for Goldwest creditors. Artor would not release the money without a court order.</p>
<p>
  [6] At the outset, Bennett, the Trustee, and the inspectors all believed that 
  Goldin's estate was entitled to the entire $319, 000 U.S.D. But the Artor matter 
  quickly became complicated. Nancy Goldin requested an adjournment in order to 
  bring a competing claim and to file materials. For that reason and others, the 
  motion was adjourned to December 7, then to December 16 and again to December 
  23. On December 23, the motion was adjourned to February 2000 in order to allow 
  service on other competing claimants. On February 10, 2000, the matter was set 
  to be heard on February 24th. Nancy Goldin ultimately abandoned her claim.</p>
<p>
  [7] The other competing claimants were unsecured creditors of the Goldin estate. 
  All of the competing claimants were represented by the inspectors; they comprised 
  a substantial part of the unsecured claims against the estate. </p>
<p>
  [8] As a result of the competing claims, the Trustee reviewed the bankrupt's 
  records and determined that there was some merit to one of the claims, amounting 
  to $10, 000, and that the funds of some of the other claimants might have been 
  invested in Goldwest.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Trustee and the inspectors had notice of the competing claimants prior 
  to engaging Bennett.</p>
<p>
  [10] Shortly after being retained, Bennett wrote to the Trustee on the issue 
  of fees. In a letter dated November 22, 1999, Bennett wrote: </p>
<p class="indent"> As we have discussed previously, there is no money in the estate 
  at this time to fund any litigation or take any examination. As a result, we 
  are proceeding to obtain a declaration as soon as possible with respect to the 
  sale proceeds of the Arizona property being held by Artor Enterprises Inc&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I think it advisable to set out a list of matters to be reviewed 
  or investigated, and have an inspectors' meeting by telephone. Unless any one 
  or all of the inspectors are prepared to advance the moneys into the estate, 
  or unless the trustee is prepared to cover fees and disbursements, I would recommend 
  to the inspectors and creditors that section 38 proceedings be taken at this 
  time. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [11] On December 3, 1999, just after the Artor motion was first adjourned to 
  permit Nancy Goldin to file materials, Bennett again wrote to the Trustee regarding 
  fees, saying: </p>
<p class="indent"> We should discuss fees at this time. As you are aware, we have 
  both spent a considerable amount of time since the first meetings of the creditors. 
  There is not sufficient funds in the Estate to cover extensive examinations 
  and legal proceedings at this time. We were hopeful to have obtained an order 
  last Wednesday entitling you to the Arizona moneys. That matter has been adjourned 
  pending the filing of materials by Mr. Roher on behalf of Nancy Goldin.</p>
<p class="indent">Subject to Nancy Goldin contesting your motion, I think that 
  it may be desirable from our mutual point of view to request that any one or 
  all of the inspectors advance money to the trustee by way [sic] a loan to finance 
  more immediate concerns. I am not able to finance the costs of litigation without 
  knowing there [sic] that there are moneys in the Estate to cover the legal fees 
  and disbursements. We should come to some understanding about our respective 
  fees as soon as possible. </p>
<p>
  [12] The Trustee did not respond to the two letters.</p>
<p>
  [13] On January 31, 2000, the inspectors held another creditors meeting at which 
  they reported that they had conflicts of interest and were going to claim against 
  the Artor funds. </p>
<p>
  [14] On February 14, 2000, just as Bennett was about to argue the motion, the 
  Trustee terminated Bennett's retainer without cause. The Trustee then retained 
  the firm Thornton Grout Finnigan (&quot;TGF&quot;), as the estate solicitors, 
  to carry on with the motion. </p>
<p>
  [15] The motion did not proceed. Instead, the Trustee reached a tentative settlement 
  with the claimants. Under the terms of the settlement, the estate was to receive 
  a total of $50,000 U.S.D. plus half the accrued interest (for a total amount 
  of $79,195 CDN), of the $319,000 U.S.D initially sought.</p>
<p>
  [16] On March 8, 2000, the Trustee made a report to the creditors, which stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Receipt of [the settlement amount] ought to enable the Trustee 
  to complete the administration of the estate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The Trustee entered into this settlement, subject to the appropriate 
  approvals, to ensure that the Trustee has sufficient funding to complete the 
  administration of the Estate, to avoid the risk of losing the litigation and 
  to avoid the risk of being liable for costs awards if the motion was adjourned 
  to permit a trial and further costs awards if the issue was tried and the Trustee 
  was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>
  [17] The Trustee called a meeting of creditors to approve the settlement on 
  March 10, 2000. At the meeting, the Trustee reported that with the money from 
  the Artor settlement, there would be sufficient funds to &quot;complete the 
  administration of the estate&quot;. The total funds in the estate were $161,065, 
  including the $79,195 from the Artor funds. After disbursements of $8,355, there 
  was $152,710 available to pay trustee and legal fees, which was sufficient to 
  pay the fees of both the Trustee and Bennett at that time. The Trustee's fees, 
  as of January 27, 2000, were approximately $80,000. </p>
<p>
  [18] After the March 10th meeting, the Trustee incurred further expenses that, 
  if paid, would exhaust the estate and preclude payment of Bennett's fees.</p>
<p>
  [19] The final statement of receipts and disbursements showed the Trustee as 
  claiming fees of $183,746. Bennett's account was taxed at $53,494.43 on August 
  2, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [20] The Trustee made no complaints regarding Bennett's services. It signed 
  the certificate on Bennett's bill indicating that the services were duly authorized 
  and rendered and that the charges were fair and reasonable. However, the Trustee 
  took the position that it enjoyed a statutory priority to payment over Bennett, 
  and therefore approved payment of only $15,000 for Bennett's fees.</p>
<p>
  [21] Bennett brought a motion to compel payment of its bill of costs. That motion 
  was combined with the taxation of the Trustee's fees and heard by the Deputy 
  Registrar in Bankruptcy on September 7, 2001.</p>
<p>
  THE DECISIONS BELOW</p>
<p>
  [22] At the hearing before the Deputy Registrar, the Trustee suggested that 
  Bennett was terminated because the inspectors were not satisfied with the solicitors' 
  performance. The Deputy Registrar rejected this suggestion, noting that there 
  were no complaints from the inspectors until after Bennett's final bill was 
  rendered and, in any event, Bennett was prevented from achieving any measure 
  of success by the actions of the Trustee in terminating Bennett's retainer.</p>
<p> [23] The Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy found that the time spent by the Trustee 
  was reasonable and that the Trustee did not act improperly in settling the claim 
  to the Artor funds.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>She allowed the sum 
  of $176,283.14 for the Trustee's fees.</p>
<p> [24] The Deputy Registrar also found that all of the steps taken by Bennett 
  were authorized and that Bennett's work laid &quot;a significant foundation&quot; 
  for the recovery of the Artor funds. In an earlier decision, the Deputy Registrar 
  found that Bennett's fees were reasonable; there were no grounds for reducing 
  Bennett's bill; and, the Trustee's refusal to approve the bill in full was improper.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [25] The Trustee argued that it was entitled to priority of payment under s. 
  136 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. B-3 (&quot;BIA&quot;). 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] The Deputy Registrar rejected this argument. She concluded that Bennett's 
  taxed costs should be paid in full, after payment of the Trustee's disbursements 
  but in priority to payment of the Trustee's fees. </p>
<p>
  [27] The Trustee moved to set aside the Deputy Registrar's order. The bankruptcy 
  judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that Bennett was entitled to priority 
  on the ground of unjust enrichment. He reasoned as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In referring to the Rule in ex parte James, the Ontario Court 
  of Appeal in Re Treacy (1997) 302 O.R. (3rd) 717 stated &quot;Under [the rule 
  in ex parte James], where it would be unfair or dishonest for the trustee to 
  take full advantage of his legal rights, the court will order him not to do 
  so and to return money which it may have collected.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the principle to be extracted from these decisions 
  is that, in a situation where the estate of the bankrupt has been enriched through 
  the efforts of, or at the expense, of a claimant, and the trustee is invoking 
  a legal right to retain the amount by which the estate has been enriched, the 
  court will where it would be unfair or dishonest for the Trustee to take advantage 
  of its legal rights, order the Trustee to return the enrichment amount to the 
  claimant.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the principle is explicable [sic] to the case at 
  bar. The estate of Goldin has clearly been enriched through the efforts of Bennett 
  &amp; Company to the extent of $79,195 of which $53,494.43 is claimed by Bennett 
  &amp; Company as fees for its legal services toward collecting such amount. 
  The court should not permit the Trustee to retain the enrichment amount by asserting 
  its legal right to statutory priorities in the BIA. It is clearly, in the circumstances 
  of this case, unfair to Bennett &amp; Company for the Trustee to be permitted 
  to rely upon its statutory priority for the expenses and fees over legal costs 
  in order to retain proceeds realized substantially through the efforts of Bennett 
  &amp; Company in a legal proceeding in which such legal costs were incurred. 
  I therefore conclude the Registrar did not err in determining that the claim 
  of Bennett &amp; Company should be given priority over the claim of the Trustee 
  for its expenses and fees based upon the principle of unjust enrichment. </p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [28] On appeal, the Trustee argues that the bankruptcy judge erred in finding 
  that Bennett's claim had priority over the Trustee's claim on the equitable 
  grounds of unjust enrichment. The Trustee maintains that, by operation of s. 
  136 of the BIA, payment of its fees is to be given priority over payment of 
  legal costs. </p>
<p>
  [29] Section 136 reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  136(1) Subject to the rights of secured creditors, the proceeds realized from 
  the property of a bankrupt shall be applied in priority of payment as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the costs of administration, in the following order,</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the expenses and fees of the trustee, and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) legal costs;</p>
<p>[30] Bennett raises four issues by way of cross-appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">1. Did Bennett's account constitute a first charge under s.197 
  (6)(a) BIA so as to give it priority over the Trustee's claim under s.136 (1)(b)(ii) 
  BIA?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Was the Trustee personally liable for Bennett's account under 
  s.197 (3) BIA?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Was Bennett's account an &quot;expense&quot; of the trustee 
  under s.136 (1)(b)(ii) BIA, thereby ranking ahead of the Trustee's fees?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Was Bennett entitled to a charging order under the Solicitors 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  The Appeal</p>
<p>
  [31] The appellant argues that the principle of unjust enrichment, relied on 
  by the Deputy Registrar and the Judge in Bankruptcy, does not apply in the circumstances 
  of this case. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [32] The principle enunciated in Re Treacy, supra, and relied upon by the bankruptcy 
  judge applies where a) the estate is unjustly enriched and b) there is a contest 
  between a creditor of the estate and the estate itself. Neither condition exists 
  in the instant appeal. The Trustee and Bennett are both creditors of the estate; 
  the estate has been enriched by the efforts of both. The issue is not whether 
  the estate has been unjustly enriched - it has not. Rather, the question is 
  whether, in the circumstances of this case, the Trustee is entitled to exercise 
  its statutory priority to payment when to so do will prevent Bennett from recovering 
  his fees from the estate.</p>
<p>
  [33] That said, I agree with the bankruptcy judge that, on the facts of this 
  case, it would be contrary to the principles of equity to permit the Trustee 
  to exercise its statutory priority. However, in my view, it is not the equitable 
  doctrine of unjust enrichment that properly supports this conclusion; rather, 
  it is the doctrine of equitable fraud.</p>
<p>
  [34] Before setting out the law on equitable fraud, it is important to note 
  that there is nothing improper in a trustee exercising its statutory priority 
  to payment under s.136 (1)(b). The legislature clearly intended to protect the 
  interests of trustees by giving priority to payment of their fees over legal 
  costs. The bald fact that the Trustee would benefit from application of the 
  statutory scheme does not give rise to a claim in equity. Taking advantage of 
  legal rights created by statute, with nothing more, cannot be characterized 
  as unfair or equitable fraud. To do so would be, in effect, to characterize 
  competent legislation as unjust. That is impermissible. Zaidan Group Ltd. v. 
  London (City) (1990), 71 O.R. (2d) 65 (C.A.) at 69. A court cannot interfere 
  with a legislative scheme merely because it does not approve of the result produced 
  by the statute. Zeitel v. Ellscheid (1994), 113 D.L.R. (4th) 609 (S.C.C.) at 
  622. </p>
<p>
  [35] I turn now to consider when equitable principles may apply to alter the 
  statutory scheme of priorities. It is a well-established principle that equity 
  will not permit a statute to be used as an instrument of fraud. This principle 
  was articulated by Lord Westbury in McCormick v. Grogan (1869), L.R. 4 A.C.82, 
  at p. 97: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Court of Equity has, from a very early period, decided that even an Act 
  of Parliament shall not be used as an instrument of fraud; and if in the machinery 
  of perpetrating a fraud an Act of Parliament intervenes, the Court of Equity, 
  it is true, does not set aside the Act of Parliament, but it fastens on the 
  individual who gets title under that Act, and imposes upon him a personal obligation, 
  because he applies the Act as an instrument for accomplishing fraud.</p>
<p>
  [36] A much quoted statement of the scope of the doctrine of equitable fraud 
  comes from Kitchen v. Royal Air Forces Association And Others, [1958] 2 All 
  E.R. 241 (C.A.). In Kitchen, the English Court of Appeal considered whether 
  a limitation period arising under the Limitation Act should be postponed because 
  the defendant solicitor had concealed the cause of action. The court held that 
  there was no finding, and no justification for any finding, that the defendant 
  solicitor acted dishonestly to conceal the plaintiff's cause of action. However, 
  it concluded that it is not necessary to demonstrate any improper motive in 
  order to establish equitable fraud. The court stated, at p. 249, that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  no degree of moral turpitude is necessary to establish fraud within the section. 
  What is covered by equitable fraud is a matter which LORD HARDWICKE did not 
  attempt to define two hundred years ago, and I certainly shall not attempt to 
  do so now, but it is, I think, clear that the phrase covers conduct which, having 
  regard to some special relationship between the two parties concerned, is an 
  unconscionable thing for the one to do towards the other. </p>
<p>
  [37] This description of equitable fraud has been adopted in numerous Canadian 
  judgments. For example, in Guerin v. Canada, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 at p.390, the 
  Supreme Court of Canada relies upon this statement from Kitchen. Guerin also 
  addressed the question of the applicability of a limitation period where a cause 
  of action had been concealed. In Guerin, the Indian Affairs Branch concealed 
  the terms of a lease from a First Nations Band thereby preventing the band from 
  discovering a cause of action. There was no evidence of dishonesty or improper 
  motive on the part of the government. Nonetheless, the Court found that, considering 
  the fiduciary relationship between the Branch and the Band, the government's 
  conduct amounted to equitable fraud.</p>
<p>
  [38] There is a special relationship between the trustee of a bankrupt estate 
  and the estate solicitor. The trustee has all of the normal powers of retaining, 
  instructing and discharging a solicitor but, as the estate is responsible for 
  paying the fees, the trustee does not bear the normal obligation of a client 
  to pay the solicitor's fees incurred as a result of those instructions. Moreover, 
  the trustee has the best access to information about the estate's assets and 
  best ability to determine the estate's capacity to pay the solicitor's fees.</p>
<p>
  [39] On the facts of this case, at the time the Trustee retained Bennett and 
  instructed Bennett to pursue the Artor funds, it knew there were insufficient 
  funds in the estate to pay the fees that would be incurred as a result of those 
  instructions. </p>
<p>
  [40] The Trustee was twice notified in writing of Bennett's concerns over payment 
  of fees and Bennett's desire to address the issue as soon as possible. The Trustee 
  did not pursue any of the means of securing funds proposed by Bennett. Instead, 
  the Trustee terminated Bennett's retainer, thereby precluding Bennett from completing 
  the Artor matter or taking any other steps to secure payment of its fees.</p>
<p>
  [41] After discharging Bennett, the Trustee told the creditors that approval 
  of the proposed settlement would enable it to pay all administrative expenses. 
  In the face of that statement, it obtained the creditors approval of the settlement. 
  The Trustee then proceeded to incur further fees when it knew or ought to have 
  known that payment of its additional fees would preclude payment of Bennett's 
  legal fees because of the priorities established by s.136 (1)(b) of the BIA. 
  In effect, the Trustee chose to exhaust the estate's assets and preclude recovery 
  by Bennett with the practical consequence that it made itself the beneficiary 
  of Bennett's work.</p>
<p>
  [42] In this case, the Trustee claims entitlement to the fruits of Bennett's 
  labour by virtue of its priority under s.136 after: instructing Bennett to undertake 
  legal work for the estate; ignoring Bennett's concerns over payment of fees 
  and suggestions for addressing the problem of fees; terminating Bennett's retainer 
  without cause thereby preventing Bennett from potentially collecting assets 
  from which to recover its fees; taking a substantial benefit for the estate 
  that had been largely generated by Bennett's efforts; settling the Artor matter 
  on the basis that the costs of administration would be covered; and incurring 
  additional fees while possessed of the knowledge that the assets of the estate 
  would be exhausted in paying its own claim.</p>
<p>
  [43] The Trustee argues that Bennett voluntarily accepted the risk of non-payment 
  when it accepted the retainer. That may be, but it did not voluntarily accept 
  the risk of having its retainer terminated, without cause, at a point where 
  it had played a substantial and integral role in positioning the estate to recover 
  assets from which its fees could be paid. </p>
<p>
  [44] To permit the Trustee to rely on the provisions of s. 136 in such circumstances, 
  in my view, would be unconscionable as it would enable the Trustee to take unfair 
  advantage of its legal rights. In that sense, it would be to permit the Trustee 
  to use s. 136 as an instrument of equitable fraud.</p>
<p>
  The Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [45] Given the result of the appeal, there is no need to address the issues 
  raised on the cross-appeal. </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [46] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs 
  to the respondent fixed in the amount of $13,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
