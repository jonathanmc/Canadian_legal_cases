<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant contends that he brought himself within the one year limitation 
  period by advising the respondent Melfi of his claim within one year. We cannot 
  agree. The section says "unless suit is brought &#8230;" Notice 
  of a claim does not equal bringing a suit. Nor is this a case where the respondent's 
  conduct misled the appellant or otherwise estopped the respondent from relying 
  on the limitation period.</p>
<p> [2] In all other respects, we are satisfied that the summary motion judge 
  did not err in holding that there was no case for trial given the way the case 
  was pleaded and argued before him.</p>
<p> [3] The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of 
  $7,000.</p>
