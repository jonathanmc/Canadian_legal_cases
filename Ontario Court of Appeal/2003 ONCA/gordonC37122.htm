<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Judge B.M. Kelly on August 13, 2001 
  and the sentence imposed on September 25, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Since the appellant chose to represent himself at trial, there is no merit 
  to the argument that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. 
  Nor, in our view, is an accused who chooses to represent himself expected to 
  perform at the level of competent counsel. The ineffective assistance cases 
  have no application to a situation where an accused chooses to represent himself.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] We are satisfied that the appellant received a fair trial. This was a simple, 
  straightforward case. The appellant's defence was that he had not been properly 
  identified as the seller of the cocaine. While the appellant was not familiar 
  with criminal procedure, he was clearly an intelligent person who appreciated 
  his defence and advanced that defence through the witnesses tendered by the 
  Crown. He made the points he had to make in support of his position that the 
  Crown had not proved that he was the seller of the drugs. Unfortunately for 
  him, his arguments were not persuasive. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] There is no error in the trial judge's reasons which warrants reversal 
  of the convictions. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The sentence imposed was not unfit and we defer to the trial judge's determination 
  of the appropriate sentence. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] The appeals are dismissed.</p>
