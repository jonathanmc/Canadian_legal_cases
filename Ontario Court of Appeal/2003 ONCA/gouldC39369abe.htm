<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with counsel's submission that the place where the admitted assault 
  on the complainant occurred was the central factual issue.</p>
<p>[2] It was open to the trial judge on this evidence to find that there was 
  no blood between the appellant's room and the entrance to the complainant's 
  room. It was also open to the trial judge to infer from the absence of the blood 
  trail taken in combination with the other evidence, that the assault occurred 
  at the complainant's room.</p>
<p>[3] Even if the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning the extent 
  to which the appellant's brother co-operated with the police, that misapprehension 
  was not material to the result. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
