<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The offences were extremely serious and given the appellant's background 
  and history, the trial judge was on solid ground in concluding that a very substantial 
  penitentiary sentence was called for. We are, however, of the view that the 
  sentence imposed (effectively one of 20.5 years) was outside the range of sentences 
  imposed for like offenders in like circumstances. In our view, the appellant 
  deserved a sentence of sixteen years imprisonment less time served (2.5 years). 
  That, we believe, constitutes a fit and just sentence in the circumstances. 
  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence imposed at 
  trial (18 years) is varied to one of 13.5 years. </p>
