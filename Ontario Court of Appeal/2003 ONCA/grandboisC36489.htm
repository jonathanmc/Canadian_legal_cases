<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Erwin W. Stach of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting with a jury, on October 20, 1998.<br>
</p>
<p>MACPHERSON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>A. OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Denis Grandbois, was convicted of the second degree murder 
  of his wife, Beverly Grandbois. He admitted that he shot and killed his wife. 
  At the trial, the appellant raised the defence of not criminally responsible 
  pursuant to s. 16 of the Criminal Code. Although the appellant did not testify, 
  the defence called three psychiatrists whose testimony supported the s. 16 defence. 
  The Crown called no psychiatric evidence. The trial proceeded in an uneventful 
  and fair fashion. The trial judge's charge to the jury was in all respects, 
  including his treatment of the s. 16 defence, impeccable. The jury returned 
  a verdict of guilty of second degree murder. The appellant was sentenced to 
  life imprisonment with the standard parole ineligibility period of 10 years.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The only issue on the appeal is whether the jury's verdict was unreasonable. 
  The appellant contends that it was because it conflicted with the &quot;unambiguous, 
  unqualified and uncontradicted&quot; opinions of the three psychiatrists who 
  testified.<br>
</p>
<p>B. FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[3] On July 6, 1997, the appellant shot his wife in the family home in the 
  Township of Rugby. The two shots, in the neck and the chest, from close range 
  with a .410 shotgun, killed her.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The appellant has a long history of mental illness. He has been hospitalized 
  many times. At the trial, he was diagnosed unanimously by three psychiatric 
  experts as suffering from bipolar affective disorder with delusions, characterized 
  by mood swings which ranged between depression and hypomania (a mild form of 
  mania, marked by elation and hyperactivity). He was prescribed anti-psychotic 
  drugs, which he took sporadically, and had received electroshock therapy two 
  or three months before the shooting.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In the week leading up to July 6, 1997, the appellant's condition may have 
  taken a turn for the worse. His wife was sufficiently concerned that about a 
  week before the incident she left the couple's 10 year old twin daughters, Leona 
  and Marie, at her sister's home for two days because she said she wanted to 
  take her husband to the hospital.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> Moreover, 
  one of the appellant's treating psychiatrists, Dr. John Ledger, who saw the 
  appellant on June 24, testified that on that date his illness was &quot;as severe 
  as I'd seen him.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[6] However, there was also evidence that, in the weeks leading up to July 
  6, the appellant was pursuing disability benefits and may have exaggerated his 
  symptoms. He saw Dr. Crosby Watler, his other treating psychiatrist, on June 
  12. Dr. Watler refused to sign the disability forms because &quot;he was doing 
  very well&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] In addition, about a week later, during a visit to his wife's family in 
  Fort Frances, the appellant went for a drive with his wife's sister, Cindy Nick. 
  Ms. Nick testified that when she remarked that Denis would receive a disability 
  benefit, his response was to lean over and smile and say: &quot;I've already 
  got the disability . . . I know how to fool [the psychologists]. I tell them 
  what they want to hear. I told them that my marriage was falling apart and that 
  I didn't recognize [my] children.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>[8] In the early afternoon of July 6, 1997, the appellant and one of his daughters 
  drove to a friend's home and collected a bag of clothing and ammunition. He 
  returned home around 45 minutes later. At around 2:30 - 2:45, Beverly was on 
  the telephone with one of her sisters. She spoke initially with Ms. Nick, and 
  then with another sister, Donna Marwick. The appellant told the twins to go 
  for a walk for half an hour so he could speak to their mother. When the twins 
  returned, he told them to take a longer walk. The telephone call involving Beverly 
  continued. Ms. Marwick testified that Beverly told her that she and the children 
  were going to move to Fort Frances &quot;with or without him&quot;. Shortly 
  after, she heard Beverly scream, Denis say in a very calm voice &quot;Get over 
  here&quot;, and more screams from Beverly, which eventually &quot;started to 
  fade off&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] While the twins were on the second walk, they also heard a scream, followed 
  by a gunshot. They ran home. Their father came out of the house carrying a gun. 
  He was spattered with blood. He put down the gun and told the twins &quot;me 
  and mom got into a fight&quot; and &quot;I slapped your mom&quot; and she was 
  sleeping so they should go for a walk together.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Immediately following the shooting, the appellant called the police and 
  said &quot;there's been a murder&quot; and &quot;I just shot my wife&quot;. 
  An hour later, when the police had not arrived, he called 911 again and spoke 
  to the police for 22 minutes. He stated again that there had been a murder at 
  his home and gave this description of the incident to Detective Constable Adam 
  Alderson:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: You're in the house, okay, and what's happening 
  there, Denis?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Well, we had an argument, and, uh, I shot 
  my wife.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Well ... you did what?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: I shot my wife.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: You shot your wife &#133; okay &#133; okay. 
  Where are you now?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: In the house.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: You're in the house? And where's your wife?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Uh &#133; she's in the hallway.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: &#133; Okay, so &#133; so what happened to 
  day with your &#133; with your &#133; uh &#133; with your wife, there? With 
  Beverly?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Oh, it was just an argument.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Okay &#133; and &#133; is &#133; is she still 
  alive?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Nope.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: No? How long ago did this happen?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Oh, I don't know, half an hour or an hour 
  ago, I don't know.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Okay.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: I got to get back to my twins.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Have you been drinking, Denis?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Nope.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Okay, are you &#133; are you guys split up? 
  Or . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Nope.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Okay, but were you splitting up, or &#133; 
  what was happening?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Ya.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: Okay, you and Beverly are still together, 
  is that right?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Not really, no.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alderson: No? And now, can you explain to me, what do 
  you mean by that, Denis?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Grandbois: Well, we've been arguing for quite a while.</p>
  
<p> [11] At the trial, the Crown called as witnesses several members of Denis' 
  and Beverley's families. The Crown called no psychiatric evidence. The defence 
  called Dr. Ledger and Dr. Watler, the appellant's treating psychiatrists, and 
  Dr. Fred Shane, a third psychiatrist who assessed the appellant in jail about 
  a month after the shooting. The appellant did not testify. The essence of the 
  psychiatrists' testimony was that the appellant suffered from a mental disorder 
  that rendered him incapable of knowing that the shooting of his wife was wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>C. ISSUE<br>
</p>
<p>[12] The sole issue on the appeal is whether the jury verdict of guilty of 
  second degree murder was unreasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>D. ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>[13] Section 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code authorizes an appellate court 
  to set aside a jury verdict if &quot;it is unreasonable or cannot be supported 
  by the evidence&quot;. The test for judicial interference with a jury verdict 
  is a strict one; such interference is justified only if the verdict is one that 
  a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could not reasonably have rendered: 
  see R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at 186; R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 
  381 at 405-06; and R. v. G. (A.), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439 at 444-45.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The nature of the inquiry in which an appellate court must engage has 
  been well?described by Arbour J.A. in Biniaris, at pp. 405-06:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[The Yebes] formulation of the test imports both an 
  objective assessment and, to some extent, a subjective one. It requires the 
  appeal court to determine what verdict a reasonable jury, properly instructed, 
  could judicially have arrived at, and, in doing so, to review, analyze and, 
  within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence. This latter 
  process is usually understood as referring to a subjective exercise, requiring 
  the appeal court to examine the weight of the evidence, rather than its bare 
  sufficiency. The test is therefore mixed, and it is more helpful to articulate 
  what the application of that test entails, than to characterize it as either 
  an objective or a subjective test.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] At the heart of the trial in the present case was the appellant's invocation 
  of s. 16(1) of the Criminal Code, which provides:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">16.(1) No person is criminally responsible for an act 
  committed or an omission made while suffering from a mental disorder that rendered 
  the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission 
  or of knowing that it was wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>By virtue of ss. 16(2) and (3) of the Code, it fell to the appellant to establish 
  on a balance of probabilities that he came within s. 16(1) when he shot his 
  wife.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] There are three components in s. 16(1); however, at the appellant's trial 
  one of them was not really in play. Both Dr. Watler and Dr. Shane expressed 
  the opinion that the appellant knew that what he was doing was violent and would 
  result in the death of his wife - in other words, he appreciated the nature 
  and quality of the act he committed. Dr. Ledger, who did not interview the appellant 
  after the shooting, expressed the opinion that the appellant would not appreciate 
  what he was doing if he was acting under a delusion or a command hallucination 
  at the time (i.e. voice ordering him to kill his wife).<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The crux of the trial was the other two components of s. 16(1) - was the 
  appellant suffering from a mental disorder when he shot his wife and, if he 
  was, did he know that the shooting was wrong?<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The appellant's position is that there was &quot;unambiguous, unqualified 
  and uncontradicted&quot; psychiatric evidence that the appellant was suffering 
  from a mental disorder when he shot his wife and that this mental disorder rendered 
  him incapable of knowing that this was wrong. The appellant relies heavily on 
  R. v. Molodowic, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420 and R. v. Weldon, [1995] O.J. No. 3462 
  (C.A.), two cases in which appellate courts substituted verdicts of not criminally 
  responsible (&quot;NCR&quot;) after juries had rendered guilty verdicts at murder 
  trials.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] In Molodowic, the accused drove eight miles to his grandfather's house 
  in the middle of the night, parked, loaded a semi-automatic carbine and shot 
  his grandfather twice in the chest. He then drove home, went to a friend's house 
  and said he had just shot his grandfather and the police should be called.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] The accused was found guilty of second degree murder by a jury. The conviction 
  was upheld, in a 2-1 decision, by the Manitoba Court of Appeal. The Supreme 
  Court of Canada allowed the appeal, concluding that, on all the evidence, the 
  verdict was not a reasonable one. In my view, this decision is particularly 
  instructive in the present appeal. Arbour J., speaking for a unanimous court, 
  set out the general principles relating to expert testimony in the context of 
  an NCR defence based on the accused's capability to know that what he did was 
  morally wrong, at pp. 425-28:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[U]nder the terms of s. 16 of the Criminal Code, the 
  appellant was entitled to be found not criminally responsible for the killing 
  if he could prove, on a balance of probabilities, that, by reason of his mental 
  disorder, he was incapable of knowing that his act was morally wrong . . . . 
  <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In R. v. Ratti, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 68, at p. 80, this Court 
  held that an act or omission is &quot;wrong&quot;, within the meaning of s. 
  16, where that act or omission &quot;in the particular circumstances would have 
  been morally condemned by reasonable members of society&quot; (emphasis in original). 
  In deciding whether or not an accused appreciated that his actions were morally 
  wrong, a jury is not &quot;bound by the expert psychiatric testimony and ... 
  its probative value [is] to be assessed in the same manner as any other testimony&quot; 
  (Ratti, supra, at p. 81). Further, in weighing expert evidence a jury is entitled 
  to examine the factual foundations of the opinion and is entitled to accord 
  less weight to that opinion where it is not based on facts proved at trial and/or 
  where it is based upon factual assumptions with which they disagree. See R. 
  v. Lavalee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at pp. 896-97, and Ratti, supra, at p. 81.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The jury may therefore reject the opinion of experts, 
  even when the experts called are unanimous and uncontradicted by other experts. 
  . . However, there has to be a rational foundation, in the evidence, for the 
  jury to reasonably reject the opinion of the experts.<br>
</p>
<p class="center">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">A proper understanding and weighing of expert opinion 
  often plays a central role in the determination of whether or not an accused 
  should be found not guilty by reason of mental disorder. The absence of a Crown 
  rebuttal expert to contradict an accused's psychiatric evidence is not in itself 
  sufficient to conclude that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable if that conclusion 
  remained reasonably open to the jury on the totality of the evidence. However, 
  it may be unreasonable for a jury to disregard the expert evidence put before 
  it, particularly where all the experts called were in agreement with each other, 
  when their evidence was &quot;uncontradicted and not seriously challenged&quot; 
  (R. v. Kelly (1971), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 186 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 186), and when there 
  was nothing in the &quot;conduct of the commission of the crime which would 
  raise any serious question as to the validity of the psychiatrics' conclusion&quot; 
  (Kelly, supra, at p. 186).<br>
</p>
<p>[21] After setting out these general principles, Arbour J. adopted the reasoning 
  of the dissenting judge from the Manitoba Court of Appeal, finding that not 
  only was there uncontradicted psychiatric evidence, but the psychiatrists' opinions 
  were entirely consistent with the facts of the case. The accused's conduct before 
  and after the shooting, and his conduct on the night of the killing revealed 
  a &quot;very disturbed mind&quot; (at p. 430). The psychiatric evidence was 
  based on formal psychological testing, records from the appellant's hospital 
  stay, interviews with the appellant's family and his statements to the police. 
  He had full blown paranoid schizophrenia, a psychotic delusional disorder of 
  a &quot;persecutory type&quot; (at p. 432). The Crown's theory was that while 
  the accused was psychotic before and after the killing, and incapable of knowing 
  his actions were wrong, he was experiencing a moment of lucidity at the time 
  of the killing. Arbour J.A. concluded that the evidence could not reasonably 
  support this theory (at p. 436).<br>
</p>
<p>[22] In Weldon, this court substituted a finding of NCR for a jury's verdict 
  of first degree murder. The accused was a paranoid schizophrenic experiencing 
  serious psychotic symptoms. He stabbed his common law wife several times in 
  front of her daughter. The daughter testified about his strange behaviour leading 
  up to the incident, and his bizarre conduct during and after it. He did not 
  appear angry or surprised, but rather confused. He stabbed himself without experiencing 
  any visible pain, and lay down, pulling the deceased on top of him.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] At the trial, two psychiatrists testified that the accused was NCR. This 
  court dealt with this evidence, at paras. 24-26:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There was, therefore, before the jury the evidence of 
  two highly qualified psychiatrists that the provisions of s. 16 of the Criminal 
  Code were applicable to this case.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">While the Crown counsel challenged the evidence of both 
  psychiatrists in cross?examination and in argument, no testimony was called 
  to contradict or challenge the validity of their opinions. Mr. Weldon was examined 
  by Dr. Hrab at the request of the Crown. He was assessed and treated pursuant 
  to a court order in a public facility in circumstances where the Crown had full 
  access to all of the evidence developed at Penetang. The reason why no contradictory 
  evidence was called by the Crown was that no one who assessed or treated this 
  man could say anything other than that s. 16 applied in this case. This is made 
  clear in an answer given by Dr. McDonald when asked by Crown counsel in cross-examination 
  about the views of others at Penetang. He said:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">. . . by the time of the final report, to the best of my recollection, 
  I am not aware of anyone who did not see the case in the fashion that I did 
  at that point.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The history, the circumstances and the expert evidence 
  overwhelmingly proved that s. 16 was applicable in this case. It is our opinion 
  that when the jury declined to so find it acted unreasonably and contrary to 
  the evidence. The appeal must be allowed. The only verdict which the evidence 
  in this case can reasonably support is that the appellant is not criminally 
  responsible.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] The Crown's response to the appellant's reliance on Molodowic and Weldon 
  is that they provide the proper framework for analysis in an appeal where the 
  appellant seeks to overturn a jury's rejection of a s. 16 defence and concomitant 
  guilty verdict on the basis that these were unreasonable. However, the Crown 
  submits, correctly, that Molodowic explicitly recognizes that a jury need not 
  accept psychiatric evidence tendered by the accused, even if it is not contradicted 
  by Crown expert evidence. The Crown also points out that there are many cases 
  in which appellate courts have upheld jury verdicts of guilty in precisely this 
  circumstance: see, for example, R. v. Mailloux (1985), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 171 (Ont. 
  C.A.), aff'd. [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029; R. v. Scardino (1991), 6 C.R. (4th) 146 
  (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Lapointe, [1994] O.J. No. 1328 (C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[25] In the end, the resolution of this appeal requires an application of the 
  general approach described in Biniaris for assessing whether a jury verdict 
  was unreasonable, combined with a careful consideration of the factors set out 
  in Molodowic relating to cases with s. 16 defences. Against the backdrop of 
  this analytical framework, I have reviewed the entire trial record in this case 
  and have reached the conclusion that the jury verdict in the present case was 
  not unreasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] I begin by noting again that there is no challenge to the trial judge's 
  charge to the jury. Indeed, trial counsel (who is also appeal counsel) paid 
  the trial judge the high compliment of saying that his objections to the trial 
  judge's charge were &quot;the shortest I've been in connection with objections 
  to a charge since, I think, 1965, maybe&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] I also observe that since the jury verdict was simply 'guilty', an appellate 
  court cannot know with certainty where the accused's s. 16 defence foundered 
  in the eyes of the jury. For reasons discussed above, it seems highly likely 
  that the jury would have concluded that the accused appreciated the nature and 
  quality of his acts. However, we cannot know whether the jury found that the 
  accused had not established that he was suffering from a mental disorder at 
  the time of the shooting or, alternatively, that he was suffering from a mental 
  disorder but nevertheless knew that shooting his wife was wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] In my view, it was open to the jury to reject the s. 16 defence on either 
  basis. Specifically, it was open to the jury to reject the opinion offered by 
  the psychiatrists called by the defence and to rely on other evidence about 
  the events surrounding the shooting in support of the verdict.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] With respect to the psychiatric evidence, I observe that the appellant 
  did not testify. Accordingly, the only evidence about 'the voices' telling him 
  that his wife was planning to kill him came from the psychiatrists respecting 
  what the appellant had told them.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] Dr. Watler admitted that his opinion was premised on the truthfulness 
  of what the appellant told him and his history. He also saw the appellant less 
  than a month before the incident and concluded that &quot;he was doing very 
  well.&quot; Dr. Watler admitted that he had not listened to the 911 tapes or 
  reviewed the transcripts of the appellant's conversations with the police or 
  the statements of his daughters. After reviewing both 911 transcripts, Dr. Watler 
  agreed that there was nothing in the content of what the appellant said in these 
  conversations to suggest that he was psychotic. Dr. Watler further agreed that 
  it was possible for the appellant to exaggerate his symptoms or recount symptoms 
  such as ideations that his wife wanted to kill him if that was to his advantage.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] Dr. Ledger also admitted that his opinion was based primarily on what 
  the appellant told him. Moreover, although he regarded the appellant's condition 
  as &quot;severe as I'd seen him&quot; 13 days before the shooting, he did not 
  &quot;consider him at that time to be suicidal or homicidal.&quot; Finally, 
  Dr. Ledger's opinion was only that if the appellant was acting under a command 
  hallucination, he would not know that shooting his wife was wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Dr. Shane was not a treating psychiatrist. He saw the appellant on only 
  one occasion for about three or four hours. He did no testing of the appellant. 
  He admitted that his opinion about the appellant's mental state was based solely 
  on what the appellant told him and his history. He offered the opinion that 
  the appellant did not know that shooting his wife was wrong. Yet, when asked 
  to explain why the appellant called the police immediately after killing his 
  wife if he did not appreciate that his conduct was wrong, Dr. Shane replied:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, he recognized there was a death, that he had 
  done something wrong and that's not unusual for people who kill to pick up the 
  phone. I mean I've seen it so many times in my experience. People, they call 
  police. They recognize they've done something bad. This is a matter for the 
  authorities and they call the police, something terrible has happened. It's 
  something they feel is the right thing to do.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] I mention these components of the evidence of the psychiatrists called 
  by the defence not to challenge their integrity or professionalism, but rather 
  as preface to my conclusion that the appellant's description of their evidence 
  as &quot;unambiguous, unqualified and uncontradicted&quot; is not supported 
  by a careful review of their testimony. The above examples establish that the 
  psychiatrists' testimony was both ambiguous and qualified, especially by their 
  acceptance of the appellant's statements as the principal foundation for their 
  opinions.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] It is true that the psychiatric evidence called by the defence was not 
  contradicted by other psychiatric testimony. However, that does not mean that 
  the jury could not identify contradictions emanating from other sources. In 
  that vein, the jury could attach significance to the testimony of Cindy Nick 
  that the appellant told her that he knew how to play the system and fool the 
  psychologists. Moreover, the jury could note that the defence's command hallucination 
  scenario was not reflected at all in what the appellant told the police or his 
  daughters immediately after the shooting. The appellant's entire description 
  of the event was anchored in a fight between him and his wife.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Finally, the jury could have attached weight to the events surrounding 
  the shooting. Put simply, there was an absence of the type of bizarre behaviour 
  seen in cases like Weldon. The appellant knew that his wife and daughters were 
  moving to Fort Frances &quot;with or without him&quot;, he drove to a neighbour's 
  house to pick up ammunition, he sent his daughters for a walk twice, he was 
  heard to order his wife in a calm voice to &quot;get over here&quot; just before 
  he shot her, and his conversations with police and his daughters shortly after 
  the shooting seemed relatively lucid.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] In the end, I am drawn to a statement by Lacourci&egrave;re J.A. in Mailloux, 
  supra, at p. 177:<br>
  Dealing first with our power to substitute a verdict under s. 613(1)(d), there 
  certainly was ample evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict 
  of not guilty by reason of insanity. However, we are satisfied that the evidence 
  was also capable of reasonably supporting the jury's conclusion, according to 
  the view which they took of it, that the defence of insanity had not been proved 
  by the accused on the balance of probabilities.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] My conclusion is similar. There was certainly evidence to support an NCR 
  finding in this case. However, there was also strong evidence pointing the other 
  way. The jury was entitled to reject the factual underpinnings of the defence 
  experts' opinions and to look at all the other evidence in the trial and conclude 
  that the accused had not met his burden to establish the s. 16 defence on a 
  balance of probabilities. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the jury verdict 
  in this case was unreasonable.<br>
