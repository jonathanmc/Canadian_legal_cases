<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant was convicted after trial by judge and jury of possession 
  of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. He raises several grounds of appeal 
  against conviction.</p>    <P>
  The verdict</p>    <P>
  [2] The appellant submits that the trial judge had no choice but to declare 
  a mistrial when juror number 8, upon being polled, indicated that he still had 
  a doubt about the guilt of the appellant. In this regard, the appellant relies 
  on R. v. Pan (2001), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at paragraph 120. We do not 
  agree. In our view, it was open to the trial judge in the exercise of her discretion 
  to inquire into the matter, give further directions, allow further deliberations 
  and accept a substituted or second verdict for the first one returned (see R. 
  v. Head (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at pp. 484-85). The procedure adopted 
  by the trial judge in providing a brief but proper exhortation and then allowing 
  the jury to retire for the night was appropriate and we have not been persuaded, 
  in the circumstances, that a miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>    <P>
  The adverse inference issue</p>    <P>
  [3] In our view, this was not a case in which the defence was entitled to an 
  &quot;adverse inference&quot; instruction by reason of the Crown's failure to 
  call D.C. Grekos. At most, the jury was entitled to take D.C. Grekos' absence 
  into account in deciding whether, at the end of the day, they entertained a 
  reasonable doubt on the evidence before them. As the trial judge noted, there 
  was nothing in the record to explain why D.C. Grekos was not called, and nothing 
  to suggest that if he had been called, he would not have supported the position 
  of the Crown. The trial judge also gave a proper instruction, in accordance 
  with R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, in which she made it clear that a reasonable 
  doubt could arise from an absence of evidence.</p>    <P>
  D.G. Grekos' notes</p>    <P>
  [4] Assuming, without deciding, that the notes were admissible, the appellant 
  suffered no prejudice because in his closing address, defence counsel told the 
  jury (without objection from the Crown) essentially what was in the notes. </p>    <P>
  Failure to outline the evidence in support of the defence position</p>    <P>
  [5] The trial judge alerted the jury to the defence position, albeit in short 
  compass. As well, she reviewed the evidence of the various witnesses, including 
  the appellant's evidence and the evidence given by the other two defence witnesses. 
  In the circumstances of this short and uncomplicated trial, the charge was adequate.</p>    <P>
  The Corbett issue</p>    <P>
  [6] We see no error in law in the manner in which the trial judge instructed 
  the jury on the Corbett issue. [See R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670.]</p>    <P>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>    
<P> Signed: &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;<br>
