<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This action involves the Letter Carriers Dental Plan (the "Plan"), 
  administered by Great-West Life Assurance Company ("Great-West Life") 
  pursuant to the Services and Financial Agreement (the "SAFA"), for 
  Canada Post Corporation ("Canada Post") and the Canadian Union of 
  Postal Workers ("CUPW"). The Plan was funded on an on-going basis 
  through matching monthly contributions from Canada Post and the employees. Under 
  the SAFA, Canada Post and CUPW were equally liable to Great-West Life for any 
  deficit. </p>
<p>
  [2] When the Plan was replaced by a new dental plan (the Corporate Dental Plan, 
  effective October 1, 1992), a deficit of approximately $1 million existed. Canada 
  Post admitted responsibility for 50% of the deficit and paid the amount. This 
  appeal is with respect to the balance of the deficit for which CUPW was held 
  liable by the trial judge. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant CUPW raises two issues: </p>
<p>
  (1) that the trial judge erred in failing to find that Canada Post failed to 
  remit the proper amount of monthly premiums and that, as between Canada Post 
  and CUPW, any liability of CUPW for the deficit should be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>
  (2) that the trial judge erred in finding that the SAFA had not been terminated 
  and that it contemplated the payment of "run-off" claims for dental 
  services provided before October 1, 1992 but submitted within ninety days thereafter. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The appeal is entirely factual. We see no overriding and palpable error 
  on the part of the trial judge on either issue. </p>
<p>
  [5] While the trial judge could have been more explicit in his reasons with 
  respect to the first issue, we are not persuaded that he erred in rejecting 
  CUPW's contention that Canada Post should bear sole responsibility for 
  that portion of the deficit arising from the shortfall between the monthly contributions 
  and the cost of the Plan. The evidence clearly established that there were many 
  reasons for the deficit, including (1) CUPW's refusal to contribute the 
  surplus from an earlier plan; (2) CUPW's refusal to agree to a recommended 
  premium increase in the face of a rising deficit; (3) an improvement in benefits 
  in 1991; and (4) the imposition of a new Quebec tax on premiums. CUPW knew of 
  the deficit but was not concerned about it and, in fact, encouraged its members 
  to utilize the more generous benefits schedule in September 1992. </p>
<p>
  [6] Although there was evidence indicating that a portion of the deficit may 
  have arisen through Canada Post's failure to remit monthly premiums, it 
  was open to the trial judge to conclude that Canada Post had not collected the 
  employees' share of those premiums and therefore that CUPW should share 
  responsibility for that portion of the deficit.</p>
<p>
  [7] With respect to the second issue, the trial judge made two essential findings: 
  (i) the SAFA was never legally terminated; and (ii) that the SAFA, read together 
  with the Plan, contemplated the payment of claims for services provided before 
  October 1, 1992 for a ninety day "run-off period". In our view, 
  those findings are well supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [8] There was no notice of termination as required by Art. VII of the SAFA to 
  bring that agreement to an end. The August 20, 1992 letter from Canada Post, 
  relied upon by CUPW as the notice of termination, makes no reference to Art. 
  VII. It deals with the transfer or folding in of the Letter Carriers to the 
  Corporate Plan, says nothing about terminating the Plan, and explicitly refers 
  to the ninety-day run-off period under the Plan. </p>
<p>
  [9] The Plan has a ninety-day period for submission of claims and SAFA incorporates 
  the terms of the Plan by reference in the preamble and by necessary implication. 
  The trial judge correctly interpreted the SAFA as incorporating a ninety-day 
  period for submission of claims and equating the "run-off period" 
  with the period of ninety days. CUPW raised no objection to the ninety-day submission 
  advice given to all letter carriers by Canada Post in September 1992. Moreover, 
  CUPW never raised the issue of the deficit until 1993, after all letter carriers 
  had been reimbursed for claims submitted after October 1, 1992 for work done 
  before that date.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appeal is dismissed with costs to Canada Post in the agreed amount 
  of $20,000, all inclusive.</p>
