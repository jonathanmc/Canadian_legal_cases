<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Terrence L. J. Patterson of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 29, 2003.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The leading case dealing with the enforcement of foreign judgments is Morguard 
  Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077 (&quot;Morguard&quot;). 
  The overarching theme of the decision is that in a mobile global society it 
  is both necessary and desirable that governments and courts respect the orders 
  made by courts in foreign jurisdictions with comparable legal systems.</p>
<p>
  [2] Morguard addressed the enforcement of a court order across Canadian provincial 
  boundaries. However, its rationale has been extended to the enforcement of orders 
  made by courts in foreign countries, including the United States: see, for example, 
  United States of America v. Ivey (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.); Beals v. Saldanha 
  (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.); and Occidental Chemical Corp. v. Sovereign 
  General Insurance Co. (2002), 157 O.A.C. 180.</p>
<p>
  [3] The general proposition that foreign judgments should be enforced by Canadian 
  courts admits of some important exceptions. The leading Ontario case dealing 
  with these exceptions is probably Four Embarcadero Center Venture v. Kalen (1988), 
  65 O.R. (2d) 551 (H.C.J.), in which Henry J. enumerated five such exceptions, 
  including, at 571, the rule that a foreign judgment would not be enforced if 
  its enforcement would be contrary to public policy in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [4] This appeal involves an attempt by a successful party in an action in the 
  state of Michigan to enforce its judgment in Ontario against an Ontario resident. 
  The Ontario resident resists the enforcement on the basis of the public policy 
  exception to the general rule of enforceability. Specifically, he submits that 
  enforcement of the judgment of the Michigan court should be rejected because 
  the judgment is predicated on an agreement that charges a criminal rate of interest 
  contrary to s. 347 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant, John Yates, is a Canadian resident who lives near Windsor, 
  Ontario. He entered into a business partnership with two Michigan residents, 
  Andrew Soley and Leonard Norwood, for the purpose of building a golf course 
  in Michigan. The three partners incorporated a company known as Golf Club of 
  Michigan (&quot;Golf Club&quot;). The golf course was completed, and opened 
  for business, in 2001.</p>
<p>
  [6] Shortly after opening the course, Golf Club required additional financing 
  for the purchase of a GPS tracking system for its golf carts. The corporation 
  executed a Lease Agreement with Equipment Leasing Specialists, Inc. (&quot;ELS&quot;) 
  to obtain the necessary financing. Yates, Soley and Norwood signed personal 
  guarantees to secure the loan.</p>
<p>
  [7] The GPS equipment was purchased for $207,915.75 (U.S.) by ELS from a Florida 
  company known as ParView. The Lease Agreement provided for 51 monthly payments 
  of $5565. Golf Club made five payments and then defaulted in November 2001.</p>
<p>
  [8] In February 2002, the respondent Great America Leasing Corporation (&quot;GALC&quot;), 
  which had become an assignee of the Lease Agreement, commenced an action in 
  Michigan against Golf Club, Soley, Norwood and Yates.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant, through Michigan counsel, filed a Notice of Appearance, an 
  Appearance and an &quot;Answer and Affirmative Defenses&quot; document in the 
  Michigan action. One of his 'affirmative defenses' was: &quot;Interest and other 
  fees claimed by Plaintiff are usurious.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [10] GALC brought a Motion for Summary Judgment, supported by a 10-page brief 
  of fact and law, with relevant documentation attached. Yates filed no responding 
  material.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Honourable George E. Woods of the United States District Court for 
  the Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) granted summary judgment 
  against all of the defendants. He released a six page judgment in which he addressed 
  the arguments made by Norwood, who had filed a response to GALC's motion. With 
  respect to the other three defendants, Judge Woods held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As to Defendants Golf Club of Michigan, Andrew G. Soley and John Yates, the 
  Court observes that Rule 56(e) provides in relevant part that when the adverse 
  party fails to respond, &quot;summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered 
  against the adverse party.&quot; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Here, Plaintiff has satisfied 
  the Court that summary judgment is appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [12] The formal order of the Michigan court gave judgment against the four defendants 
  for &quot;$354,192.95, which includes $267,476.29 on the accelerated lease amount, 
  including costs and accrued late charges, as well as attorney fees in the amount 
  of 33.33% of the balance, or $86,716.66.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [13] Yates did not appeal the Michigan judgment and the time for commencing 
  an appeal has expired.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Ontario proceedings</p>
<p>
  [14] GALC brought an action in Ontario seeking to enforce the Michigan judgment 
  against Yates and moved for summary judgment. Yates brought a cross-motion seeking 
  (1) leave to amend his Statement of Defence and (2) a stay of GALC's action.</p>
<p>
  [15] Patterson J. dismissed Yates' cross-motion and granted judgment in favour 
  of GALC. The motions judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case at hand, there was default, a demand was made of the amount owing, 
  an action was started in Michigan, a defence and appearance was filed by Mr. 
  Yates. A summary judgment application was subsequently made to which Mr. Yates 
  did not attend, though properly notified. The summary judgment was granted with 
  full reasons being provided by the Michigan court and are before me. </p>
<p>
  [16] The motions judge then addressed Yates' main substantive argument, namely, 
  that &quot;the legal fees, when included with the interest being claimed after 
  default, results in a Criminal Code offence in Canada, being in total over 60 
  per cent.&quot; He rejected this argument on the basis that the provision relating 
  to legal fees was a term of the lease which Yates had signed and that contingency 
  fees were legal in Ontario following the decision of this court in McIntyre 
  Estate v. Ontario (Attorney General) (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 257. Accordingly, 
  he concluded: &quot;I do not believe there are public policy grounds, why this 
  foreign judgment should not be the basis of a summary judgment in Ontario.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant appeals the judgment of the motions judge.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [18] The issue on appeal is whether the motions judge erred by granting summary 
  judgment to enforce the Michigan judgment in Ontario against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant contends that the enforcement of the judgment of the Michigan 
  court would be contrary to public policy in Ontario because the Lease Agreement 
  in effect establishes a criminal rate of interest.</p>
<p>
  [20] It is important to place the appellant's defence in its proper context. 
  As expressed by Feldman J.A. in Society of Lloyd's v. Meinzer (2001), 55 O.R. 
  (3d) 688 at 719 (C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  To determine whether enforcement of the particular judgment would be contrary 
  to the public policy of Ontario, the court must consider the historical and 
  factual context of the proceedings which led to the granting of the judgment, 
  and where there are competing public policy imperatives, whether overall, registration 
  would be contrary to public policy.</p>
<p>
  [21] In my view, the historical and factual context which led to the granting 
  of the judgment in the present proceedings is grounded almost entirely in the 
  state of Michigan in terms of both the underlying commercial activity and the 
  litigation that resulted from that activity. </p>
<p>
  [22] The underlying commercial activity was the construction of a golf course 
  and the operation of a golf club in Michigan. To pursue this activity, a company 
  was incorporated in Michigan. The three principals of the company were two Michigan 
  residents and an Ontario resident.</p>
<p>
  [23] The specific commercial action which ultimately gave rise to the litigation 
  was the execution of a Lease Agreement for a GPS tracking system for the company's 
  golf carts. The Lease Agreement contained a provision that it was to be &quot;governed 
  and interpreted by the laws of the State of Michigan&quot;. The appellant provided 
  a personal guarantee in support of the Lease Agreement. He gave a Detroit address 
  on this document. The guarantee also contained a provision relating to judicial 
  forum and applicable law: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Law and Judicial Forum that apply: This agreement is governed by Michigan Law. 
  The Guarantor agrees that any legal action or proceeding against it with respect 
  to any of its obligations under this Guaranty may be brought in any court of 
  the State of Michigan or of the United States of America for the Eastern or 
  Western District of Michigan, as the Lessor in its sole discretion may elect. 
  By the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor submits to and 
  accepts, with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself and in respect 
  of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of those courts. 
  The Guarantor waives any claim that the State of Michigan is not a convenient 
  forum or the proper venue for any suit, action or proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [24] Turning to the litigation, the respondent commenced its action in the Michigan 
  courts, as it was entitled to do by the Lease Agreement and the guarantee. The 
  appellant retained a Detroit attorney who filed a Notice of Appearance and an 
  Appearance on his behalf. A week later, the attorney filed an &quot;Answer and 
  Affirmative Defenses&quot; document. Importantly, one of the 'affirmative defenses' 
  relied on by the appellant was the following: &quot;Interest and other fees 
  claimed by Plaintiff are usurious.&quot; This defence also serves as the foundation 
  for the public policy exception advanced by the appellant in the Ontario enforcement 
  proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [25] There is no suggestion of any procedural irregularity in, or natural justice 
  concern relating to, the Michigan court proceedings. The appellant was represented 
  by counsel throughout the proceedings, received proper notice of each step, 
  and actually participated at some stages. However, in the end he chose to let 
  the case proceed by way of summary judgment against him. He also chose not to 
  pursue an appeal to which he was entitled.</p>
<p>
  [26] There is not a single factor relating to either the commercial activity 
  in Michigan or the Michigan litigation that suggests any impropriety in what 
  happened to the appellant in that jurisdiction. The appellant signed the Lease 
  Agreement and the guarantee. He knew how much the respondent was seeking in 
  its Michigan action. He was represented by a Michigan attorney who raised the 
  issue of usurious interest and fees in his pleadings. However, the appellant 
  chose not to develop this submission before the Michigan court for reasons that 
  are not apparent.</p>
<p>
  [27] In Beals v. Saldanha, Doherty J.A., at 653, articulated the need to guard 
  against this situation: &quot;defendants who choose not to participate in the 
  foreign proceedings, unlike those who do participate, will be able to relitigate 
  the merits of the foreign proceedings in the action to enforce the foreign judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [28] That is the situation in this case. The court proceedings in Michigan were 
  open and fair. The trial judge wrote a full set of reasons dealing with the 
  submissions (from Norwood) before him. Accordingly, having regard to the principle 
  of comity, his judgment is entitled to respect in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [29] In terms of the substance of the Michigan judgment, I am not satisfied 
  that the appellant has met the evidentiary burden on him to present evidence 
  capable of supporting his defence based on s. 347 of the Criminal Code or the 
  Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. V.2. Apart from bald 
  statements and speculative assertions, the evidence falls short of showing that 
  the Lease Agreement in issue even comes within the ambit of s. 347 of the Code, 
  let alone offends it. Likewise, apart from speculation, it does not show that 
  the Lease Agreement offends against the provisions of the Unconscionable Transactions 
  Relief Act or that it is otherwise so patently unfair or unconscionable that 
  enforcement of the judgment would conflict with the essential moral values of 
  Canadian society: See Boardwalk Regency Corp. v. Maalouf (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 
  737 at 742 (C.A.), per Carthy J.A.</p>
<p>
  [30] In the end, having regard to the historical and factual context of the 
  proceedings and the substance of the Michigan judgment, I am not persuaded that 
  there is a genuine issue that would call into question the enforcement of the 
  judgment on public policy grounds.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [31] I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $9000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
<p>&quot;J. C. MacPherson J.A."<br>
  "I agree M. J. Moldaver J.A.&quot;</p>

<p>
  BORINS J.A. (Concurring): </p>
<p>
  [32] I have read the reasons of my colleague, MacPherson J.A., and while I agree 
  that this appeal must be dismissed, I differ substantially from him in how I 
  reach that outcome. While I am in substantial agreement with paragraphs 29 and 
  30, I have reservations respecting my colleague's analysis and conclusion in 
  paragraphs 20 to 28. As I read the decision of this court in Society of Lloyd's 
  v. Meinzer (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 688 at 712-720, it appears that the law is unsettled 
  in respect to the circumstances in which the court will decline to enforce a 
  foreign judgment on the basis of a public policy exemption. As I am able to 
  decide this appeal by the application of a different analysis, I prefer not 
  to express an opinion on the public policy exemption.</p>
<p>
  [33] This is an appeal from a summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20 of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure enforcing a Michigan judgment. Applying the well-settled 
  Rule 20 analysis outlined by this court in such cases as Hi-Tech Group Inc. 
  v. Sears Canada Inc. (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), I am satisfied on the record 
  in this case that the respondent has established that there is no genuine issue 
  for trial. On this ground alone, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [34] In reaching my conclusion I have assumed that a foreign judgment that is 
  contrary to the public policy of the domestic forum may not be recognized or 
  enforced by that forum. I have also assumed that a foreign judgment predicated 
  on an agreement that charges a criminal rate of interest within the meaning 
  of s. 347 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 may be encompassed by the 
  public policy exemption. Further, I have assumed that it is at least arguable 
  that s. 347(1) may apply to the agreement on which the Michigan judgment is 
  predicated. For the purpose of this appeal, therefore, the issue is whether 
  the appellant provided evidence that the Equipment Lease Agreement on which 
  the Michigan judgment is predicated provides for the advancement of credit to 
  Golf Club, and if so, whether the cost of the credit advanced results in an 
  effective annual rate of interest that exceeds sixty per cent.</p>
<p>
  [35] In para. 30 of Hi-Tech, Morden J.A. referred with approval to the Rule 
  20 analysis to be undertaken by the court on a motion for summary judgment described 
  by this court in Lang v. Kligerman, [1998] O.J. 3708 (C.A.) in para. 9: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The authorities are clear that the onus is on the moving party to establish 
  that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence. 
  There is no onus on the responding party. However, where the evidence presented 
  by the moving party prima facie establishes that there is no genuine issue for 
  trial, and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, 
  to preclude the granting of summary judgment the responding party assumes the 
  evidentiary burden of presenting evidence which is capable of supporting the 
  position advanced by the responding party in its pleading. On the basis of this 
  evidence, when considered with all the evidence before the motion judge, it 
  will then be for the motion judge to determine whether the evidentiary record 
  raises a genuine issue for trial.</p>
<p>
  [36] In this case, there is no doubt that before the motion judge the respondent 
  prima facie established that there is no genuine issue for trial in respect 
  to the enforcement of the Michigan judgment in Ontario, and that as a matter 
  of law it was entitled to summary judgment. Before the motion judge and in this 
  court, the appellant contended that the respondent was precluded from enforcing 
  the Michigan judgment in Ontario on the ground that the Equipment Lease Agreement 
  on which it was predicated engaged s. 347 of the Criminal Code. The appellant 
  alternatively contended that the agreement resulted in an unconscionable transaction 
  contrary to the Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. U.2. 
  Consequently, an evidentiary burden rested on the appellant to present evidence 
  capable of supporting his defence based on either s. 347 of the Criminal Code 
  or the Act.</p>
<p>
  [37] In determining whether the appellant has presented evidence that is capable 
  of supporting his s. 347 defence, it is necessary to recognize that s. 347 creates 
  two separate offences. Section 347(1)(a) makes it illegal to enter into an agreement 
  or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate, while s. 347(1)(b) makes 
  it illegal to receive a payment or partial payment of interest at a criminal 
  rate: Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co., [1998] 3 S.C.R. 112.</p>
<p>
  [38] Where s. 347(1)(a) is engaged, it should be narrowly construed. Whether 
  an agreement or arrangement for credit violates s. 347(1)(a) is determined as 
  of the time the transaction is entered into. If the agreement or arrangement 
  permits the payment of interest at a criminal rate but does not require it, 
  there is no violation of s. 347(1)(a), although s. 347(1)(b) might be engaged. 
  When s. 347(1)(b) is engaged, it should be broadly construed. Whether an interest 
  payment violates s. 347(1)(b) is determined as of the time the payment is received. 
  For the purposes of s. 347(1)(b), the effective payment is calculated over the 
  period during which credit is actually outstanding: Degelder Construction Co. 
  v. Dancorp Developments Ltd., [1998] 3 S.C.R. 90.</p>
<p>
  [39] In submitting that the Michigan judgment is predicated on a lease agreement 
  that violates s. 347, the appellant does not say whether the agreement violates 
  s. 347(1)(a) or whether the respondent has received interest at a criminal rate 
  contrary to s. 347(1)(b). As there is no evidence that the respondent received 
  any payment of interest, necessarily the appellant's position must be that the 
  agreement violates s. 347(1)(a). It follows that to raise a genuine issue for 
  trial in respect to this defence, the appellant must satisfy the evidentiary 
  burden of presenting evidence that is capable of supporting the defence that 
  the agreement violates s. 347(1)(a), or his alternative defence that the agreement 
  constitutes an unconscionable transaction.</p>
<p>
  [40] &quot;Interest&quot; is broadly defined in s. 347(2) and, as discussed 
  in Garland, that definition includes not only common law interest, being a price 
  for money which accrues day by day, but also fixed payments, such as fees, commissions 
  and penalties, which may be incurred by a borrower for the advancing of credit 
  by the lender. As pointed out in Degelder Construction at para. 29: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subsection (1)(a) is violated if a credit agreement expressly imposes an annual 
  rate of interest above 60 percent, or if the agreement requires payment of interest 
  charges over a period which necessarily gives rise to an annual rate exceeding 
  the legal limit. See, e.g. R. v. Duzan (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3e) 552 (Sask. C.A.). 
  However, if there is merely a possibility that the rate of interest could become 
  illegal under the agreement, subs. (1)(a) is not violated [emphasis in the original].</p>
<p>
  [41] In submitting that the Equipment Lease Agreement is an agreement to receive 
  interest at a criminal rate in violation of s. 347(1)(a), the appellant has 
  focused primarily on clause 12 of the agreement that provides, in the case of 
  default, for payment by the lessee of accelerated rent and, if legal proceedings 
  are taken, payment of &quot;a reasonable attorney's fee not to be less than 
  an amount equal to 33.3 % of said balance of rentals payable&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [42] In my view, an examination of the record in this case discloses that the 
  appellant has failed to meet his Rule 20 evidentiary burden of presenting evidence 
  capable of supporting his defences that the agreement violates s. 347(1)(a), 
  or that it constitutes an unconscionable transaction. While it is true that 
  in paragraphs 13 and 14 of his factum the appellant has calculated an effective 
  rate of interest exceeding sixty per cent per annum, he failed to present any 
  supporting evidence. As support for his interest calculations, the appellant 
  relied on similar calculations contained in his responding affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [43] Section 347(4) of the Criminal Code provides a convenient manner of proof 
  of an effective annual rate of interest on any credit advanced under an agreement 
  for the purpose of a prosecution under s. 347(1) by the production of a certificate 
  of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries stating that he has calculated 
  the rate under the agreement and setting out the calculations and the information 
  on which they are based. Although s. 347(4) applies to prosecutions under s. 
  347(1), there is no reason why the appellant could not have relied on a similar 
  certificate verified by an affidavit of the actuary to meet his evidentiary 
  burden of presenting evidence that is capable of supporting his defence that 
  the agreement would have been unenforceable in Ontario on public policy grounds 
  because it violates s. 347.</p>
<p>
  [44] For the foregoing reasons, I would not interfere with the summary judgment 
  awarded by the motion judge. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs 
  as proposed by MacPherson J.A.</p>
