<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In acquitting the appellant on all of the false pretence counts, the trial 
  judge did so on the basis of an understanding that had grown up between the 
  complainant and the appellant that the cheques were not to be deposited immediately 
  because of a present lack of funds but that funds would become available in 
  a reasonable period of time. While that reasoning was certainly appropriate 
  in relation to the cheques dated February 4 and 5 (three in number), it appears 
  to have escaped the trial judge's attention that it did not apply in respect 
  of the two cheques dated February 9th given his finding, supported by the evidence, 
  that the appellant stopped payment on those cheques before the goods were delivered 
  and had no intention of paying for them. Had the trial judge considered the 
  matter that way, he no doubt could have convicted the appellant of the false 
  pretence charges in counts 5 and 6. His failure to do so enured to the appellant's 
  benefit. It does not render the conviction on count 1 for fraud inconsistent; 
  nor, in our view, is the verdict unreasonable. </p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. The appeal from sentence 
  is dismissed as abandoned</p>
