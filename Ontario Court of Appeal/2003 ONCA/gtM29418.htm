<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The primary complaint of the unsecured noteholders is not that the parent 
  company has been excluded from the reorganization plan, but that having been 
  excluded, the plan is unfair and inequitable to the extent that it requires 
  the parent company to transfer certain of its assets to the subsidiaries for 
  the purpose of facilitating the plan, and it deprives the noteholders of rights 
  and remedies they might have had against others, including the subsidiary operating 
  companies, their officers, directors, employees and auditors, and the monitor. 
</p>
<p>[2] Without minimizing the importance of the broader issue raised, that is, 
  a loss of rights without representation, we are not persuaded in the circumstances 
  that leave should be granted. In particular, we believe that the complaint about 
  the asset transfer is illusory since the assets of the parent company would 
  be lost to the secured creditors in any event. As for the loss of rights to 
  sue, beyond the rights preserved by the plan, any further rights are, in our 
  view, unsubstantiated and at best speculative.</p>
<p>[3] When these factors are considered, along with the failure of the applicant 
  to appeal Justice Himel's order of November 20, 2002, its failure to pursue 
  its concerns with the diligence called for in the circumstances, its failure 
  to propose an alternative plan, and the prospect that further delay may result 
  in a loss of the subscription agreement and the many benefits flowing from it, 
  we do not believe that this is an appropriate case to grant leave to appeal.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed with costs 
  fixed on a partial indemnity basis as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) The GT Group of Companies should have their costs in the 
  amount of $10,000.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The Monitor shall have its costs in the amount of $5,000.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The remaining respondents shall have costs of $7,500 to 
  be shared pari passu or as they may agree amongst themselves. </p>
<p class="indent">In all cases, the cost awards are inclusive of applicable G.S.T. 
  and disbursements.</p>
