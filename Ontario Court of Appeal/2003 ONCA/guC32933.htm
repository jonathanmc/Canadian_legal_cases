<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Arthur M. Gans of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 16, 1999, January 18, 2001 and July 18, 2001, reported 
  at [1999] O.J. No. 3333, [2001] O.J. No. 113, and [2001] O.J. No. 2962.<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:<br>
</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION<br>
</p>
<p>[1] From its modest beginning as a suit provoked by a stolen computer, this 
  action developed into a long and complicated trial in which, ultimately, the 
  parties sought millions of dollars from each other. After a 47 day trial which 
  unfolded in three separate stages over 27 months, and which the trial judge 
  described in the first sentence of his judgment as having &quot;more twists 
  and turns than the Amalfi coastline&quot;, the practical result was that only 
  $50,000 moved from one side to the other. This tiny mouse of a result flowing 
  from the mountain of litigation has provoked a flurry of appeals and a cross-appeal 
  which, together, raise issues of contract law, commercial law and damages.<br>
</p>
<p>B. FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>(1) The parties and the events<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Chujun Gu (&quot;Gu&quot;) is the inventor of a number of CFC-free refrigerants 
  which he developed in the People's Republic of China for worldwide distribution. 
  Gu holds patents for CFC-free refrigerants under the laws of Canada and the 
  United States and pursuant to an international patent convention. Gu's business 
  interests in China were conducted through the China Sun Group, a Chinese corporation, 
  owned and managed by Gu.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] David Lam (&quot;Lam&quot;) is a Canadian chartered accountant who developed 
  a successful business importing Asian and South American seafood products into 
  North America. In his commercial ventures with Gu, Lam used two of the companies 
  he controlled, Tai Foong Investments Ltd. and Tai Foong International Ltd.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] By 1992, the Gu refrigerant products were achieving commercial success 
  in Asia and were attracting international attention from parties interested 
  in the opportunity to distribute them. The stimulus for the emerging market 
  was an international accord made in 1987 known as the &quot;Montreal Protocol&quot;, 
  which required all participating nations to eliminate the production, and later 
  the use, of CFC refrigerants. December 31, 1995 was a critical date under the 
  Montreal Protocol; after that date, CFC-free refrigerants were to be used in 
  automobile, residential and industrial/commercial applications.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In the autumn of 1992, Lam and one of his project managers, Robert Fu (&quot;Fu&quot;), 
  went to Beijing for meetings with Gu and one of his project managers, Xiaohui 
  Hu. On October 17, 1992, after approximately one week of negotiations, the parties 
  (the &quot;Gu Group&quot; and the &quot;Lam Group&quot;) entered into a joint 
  venture agreement (the &quot;JVA&quot;). The main terms of the JVA were:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Gu and Lam agreed to establish a joint venture in 
  Canada to market the Gu refrigerants in Canada, Mexico and the United States;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Gu was to receive 60% and the Lam Group 40% of the 
  shares of a Canadian corporation, Gu Cooling Systems Limited (&quot;GCSL&quot;), 
  which was to be the joint venture vehicle;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Gu's capital contribution, which was valued at $6,000,000 
  U.S., was the right to use the Gu refrigerants (not a proprietary interest in 
  them);<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the Lam Group was to make a capital contribution 
  of $4,000,000 U.S., of which $3,000,000 U.S. was to be in cash and the balance 
  in &quot;kind&quot; (e.g. premises and equipment);<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the Gu Group was to provide the gases, the technology, 
  all &quot;upgrades&quot; to the refrigerants as they became available, technological 
  support, training, and a &quot;guarantee&quot; that the technology complied 
  with the Montreal Protocol; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Lam was to supply marketing and promotional expertise.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The enterprise contemplated by the JVA failed almost from its inception. 
  Gu was critical of Lam's failure to advance capital towards the enterprise, 
  especially the $3,000,000 U.S. that the JVA required Lam to contribute by December 
  15, 1992. Lam, ultimately, accused Gu of misrepresenting the success and marketability 
  of the refrigerants.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The relationship between the two groups drifted, somewhat aimlessly, through 
  the first half of 1993. In July 1993, Gu came to Canada. There is a dispute, 
  central to both the trial and the appeal, about what happened during Gu's visit. 
  The trial judge found that Gu terminated the JVA at that time. The dispute on 
  appeal concerns the consequences of that termination.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  In any event, regardless of the legal situation with respect to the JVA in July 
  1993, it is clear that the two groups did not end their relationship at that 
  juncture.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] During the summer of 1993, Gu and Lam entered into negotiations with Michael 
  Elder (&quot;Elder&quot;) of Powerx Group Inc. (&quot;Powerx&quot;), an active 
  investor in the refrigeration industry. The result of those negotiations was 
  a new tripartite agreement among Gu, Lam and Powerx in November 1993.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The key document establishing the new arrangement was the Founders Shareholders 
  Agreement (&quot;FSA&quot;), which provided that the parties would market Gu 
  refrigerants and technologies in Canada through an Ontario company called Greencool 
  Corporation (&quot;Greencool&quot;) which was incorporated on November 10, 1993. 
  Gu was to acquire 60% of the shares for a capital contribution of $6,000,000 
  U.S. made by executing a Distribution and License Agreement to confer on Greencool 
  the Canadian distribution rights for Gu refrigerants and technologies. The Lam 
  Group and Powerx were to contribute $1,000,000 U.S. each in exchange for 20% 
  each of the shares in Greencool. Lam and Elder were required to make their capital 
  contributions by specified dates by posting separate letters of credit.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The FSA relationship was, if anything, even less successful than the earlier 
  JVA relationship. By the spring of 1994, Gu was trying to disengage from his 
  relationship with Lam and Elder. Lam resisted. A crucial event - at which point 
  the trial judge found that &quot;all hell broke loose&quot; - was Gu's firing 
  of Fu, Lam's project manager, in April 1994.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] In early May 1994, the Lam Group seized some of the Gu Group's property, 
  including Gu's personal laptop computer. Several weeks later, the Gu Group commenced 
  an action against the Lam Group for, among other claims, conversion and return 
  of property, and for injunctive relief to restrain the Lam Group from using 
  and marketing confidential information and technology associated with Gu refrigerants.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] The Lam Group responded with two separate lawsuits against the Gu Group. 
  In an action, the Lam Group alleged breach of the JVA, misrepresentation, conversion 
  of property, breach of fiduciary duty, and deceit. In an application, the Lam 
  Group sought oppression remedies against the Gu Group.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] On July 21, 1994, Borins J. ordered the return of personal property to 
  the Gu Group. He also ordered, on an interim basis, that the business of marketing 
  and selling Gu refrigerants in North America be conducted by the Gu Group. Finally, 
  Borins J. ordered the Gu Group to pay $506,000 into court as security for its 
  undertaking as to damages, and for its occupancy of the Greencool premises.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The Gu Group did not post the required security. On September 23, 1994, 
  Borins J. essentially reversed his previous order. He ordered, on an interim 
  basis, that the Lam Group conduct the business of marketing and selling Gu refrigerants 
  in North America. The Lam Group provided the usual undertaking as to damages 
  as a condition of obtaining that relief.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] Sixteen months later, in January 1996, the Gu Group moved to set aside 
  Borins J.'s order of September 1994. On June 4, 1996, Lissaman J. varied Borins 
  J.'s order to permit the Gu Group to conduct, on an interim basis, the business 
  of marketing and selling Gu refrigerants, provided that the Gu Group pay $1,000,000 
  into court. This time the Gu Group made the required payment.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] In a series of other orders from 1996 to 1999, made by various judges, 
  the three lawsuits were consolidated, certain issues relating to alleged contempt 
  were reserved to the trial judge, and it was ordered that the trial of liability 
  issues proceed first, to be followed by a trial relating to contempt, remedies 
  and damages.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The trial commenced before Gans J. on March 29, 1999. It proceeded in 
  three stages. The first stage lasted from March 29 to June 30, 1999 and occupied 
  40 days. The second stage unfolded for five consecutive days from December 11-15, 
  2000. The third stage took place on June 21 and 22, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>(2) The trial judgments<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The trial judge wrote three comprehensive sets of reasons for judgment 
  dated September 16, 1999, January 18, 2001 and July 18, 2001. He considered 
  all of the material issues. His disposition of many of those issues is not contested 
  on the two appeals and the cross-appeal; accordingly, the summary which follows 
  serves only as a brief description of the trial judge's conclusions on the issues 
  which are contested in this appeal proceeding.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] First, the trial judge held that Gu terminated the JVA in July 1993 by 
  accepting the Lam Group's repudiation of it. However, he also held that Gu elected 
  to waive any action on the JVA. Accordingly, the Gu Group could not recover 
  damages for the Lam Group's breach of the JVA. The Gu Group appeals that holding.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Second, the trial judge dismissed the Gu Group's claim for damages arising 
  from the undertaking as to damages provided by the Lam Group when it sought 
  and obtained the interlocutory injunction referred to in paragraph 14 above. 
  He reached that conclusion because he found that Gu disobeyed Borins J.'s order 
  permitting the Lam Group, exclusively, to conduct the business of marketing 
  and selling Gu refrigerants in North America. On this issue the trial judge 
  concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, even though vindicated after trial, Gu's 
  actions in flouting the injunction and actively promoting his business in the 
  U.S. constitute special circumstances sufficient to disentitle him to an inquiry 
  into damages.<br>
  The Gu Group appeals that holding.</p>
<p>[21] Third, in the course of holding that the Lam Group repudiated the JVA, 
  the trial judge held that any pre-contractual representations, if made, of the 
  Gu Group concerning the development stage and marketability of Gu refrigerants 
  were &quot;of no moment&quot;. The Lam Group cross-appeals that component of 
  the judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Fourth, as a corollary to his finding that the JVA was at an end in July 
  1993, the trial judge held that any claim by the Lam Group under that agreement 
  must fail. Specifically, there was not room for the Lam Group's claim under 
  the oppression remedy sections of the Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. B. 16, s. 248. In the alternative, the trial judge held that &quot;the OBCA 
  oppression remedy sections cannot be invoked to enforce contractual remedies 
  when the corporation through which an action is sought to be maintained was 
  created to carry out a commercial transaction....&quot; The Lam Group cross-appeals 
  that component of the judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] Fifth, the trial judge awarded the Gu Group punitive damages of $50,000 
  for the Lam Group's conversion of Gu's personal laptop computer. The Lam Group 
  appeals that holding.<br>
</p>
<p>(3) Observation<br>
</p>
<p>[24] There are other facts, relating to the parties, the events and the litigation, 
  that are relevant to the disposition of the two appeals and the cross-appeal. 
  However, it is convenient to deal with these additional facts in the context 
  of the grounds of appeal and cross-appeal to which they relate.<br>
</p>
<p>C. ISSUES<br>
</p>
<p>[25] The issues raised by the Gu Group's appeal are:<br>
</p>
<p>(1) Did the trial judge err in holding that the Gu Group was not entitled to 
  damages for breach of the Joint Venture Agreement?<br>
</p>
<p>(2) Did the trial judge err in dismissing the Gu Group's claim for damages 
  arising from the undertaking as to damages provided by the Lam Group when it 
  sought and obtained an interim injunction?<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The issues raised by the Lam Group's cross-appeal are:<br>
</p>
<p>(3) Did the trial judge err by failing to give any legal effect to the pre-contractual 
  representations of the Gu Group?<br>
</p>
<p>(4) Did the trial judge err in finding that the Lam Group had no remedy for 
  the oppression flowing from the Gu Group's appropriation of the business of 
  Gu Cooling Systems Ltd.?<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The issue raised by the Lam Group's appeal is:<br>
</p>
<p>(5) Did the trial judge err by awarding punitive damages against the Lam Group 
  for conversion of Gu's laptop computer?<br>
</p>
<p>D. ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>Gu Group's Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>(1) Gu Group's entitlement to damages for Lam Group's breach of the JVA<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The trial judge held that the Lam Group breached the JVA by &quot;not 
  providing its full capital contribution as specified.&quot; In addition, the 
  trial judge held that Gu had not &quot;affirmed&quot; (condoned) the Lam Group's 
  breach of the JVA; on the contrary, the Lam Group's &quot;repudiation of the 
  Agreement was in fact accepted by Gu and the contract was treated at an end.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[29] At the trial, the Gu Group sought damages for the Lam Group's breach of 
  the JVA. Although the trial judge recognized that the Gu Group had a prima facie 
  entitlement to damages at the date of the Lam Group's breach, he held that in 
  the circumstances of the case the Gu Group had lost its entitlement to damages. 
  He reached that conclusion on the basis of the doctrine of waiver and, perhaps, 
  the principle of abandonment.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] The Gu Group appeals the trial judge's decision on that issue on four 
  bases: (1) the trial judge erred by permitting the Lam Group to first advance 
  the defences of abandonment and waiver at the conclusion of the trial when those 
  defences had not been asserted in its pleadings; (2) he failed to distinguish 
  rescission from repudiation; (3) he erred in applying the doctrine of waiver; 
  and (4) he erred in applying the principle of abandonment.<br>
</p>
<p>(a) Pleadings<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The Gu Group contends that the trial judge ought not to have permitted 
  the Lam Group to argue abandonment and waiver in its closing argument. The Gu 
  Group submits that these were surprise affirmative defences which had not been 
  pleaded by the Lam Group: see rule 25.07(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 
  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 and Strong v. Paquet Estate (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 70 (C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[32] The trial judge dealt carefully with this issue during the trial. As he 
  noted in his reasons, the Gu Group itself raised the issues of abandonment and 
  waiver in its reply and defence to counterclaim in relation to the Lam Group's 
  obligations under the JVA. The Gu Group, therefore, was alert to the possible 
  assertion of those defences by the Lam Group, at least in connection with the 
  latter's breach of the JVA.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Moreover, the reality is that the 'surprise' defences advanced by the 
  Lam Group in its closing argument were a direct response to a major 'surprise' 
  sprung by the Gu Group during the trial. In its pleadings, and in the testimony 
  of all of its witnesses except one, the Gu Group took the position that the 
  JVA was terminated in February or March 1994. The exception to that position 
  was a stunning one - Gu himself testified, alone on the Gu Group side of the 
  case, that he had come to Canada and terminated the JVA in July 1993.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] This change in the Gu Group's position meant that much of the evidence 
  at the trial about events in the July 1993 - March 1994 period had to be viewed 
  through the prism of post-termination, not pre-termination, conduct. In light 
  of the Gu Group's new assertion about the termination date of the JVA, the trial 
  judge permitted the Lam Group to change its position as well and assert, for 
  the first time, that it accepted Gu's testimony on the issue of termination 
  date. This position then served as a foundation for the Lam Group's new argument 
  that the Gu Group's post-termination conduct established that it had waived 
  and/or abandoned its prima facie right to seek damages for the Lam Group's breach 
  of the JVA.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Viewed from one perspective, there is an element of &quot;two wrongs do 
  not make a right&quot; in what transpired late in the trial. Arguably, Gu should 
  not have been permitted to testify contrary to his pleadings: see Kalkinis (Litigation 
  Guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.); 
  and the Lam Group should not have been permitted to argue defences it had not 
  pleaded: see Strong v. Paquet Estate, supra.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] However, in the end,we cannot say that we think the trial judge erred 
  in permitting the Lam Group to advance the defences in its closing argument. 
  There was a simple explanation for the absence of the defences in the pleadings 
  - they were a late unpleaded response to a late unpleaded position advanced 
  in the evidence and in argument by the Gu Group. Moreover, we cannot disagree 
  with the trial judge's conclusion that the Gu Group was not prejudiced by the 
  Lam Group's arguments. Nor do we quarrel with the trial judge's decision, on 
  the last day of a 40 day trial, not to permit the parties to call further evidence 
  on the basis that &quot;there is nothing that can be asked of the witnesses 
  who testified that would or could alter the events as they have been described 
  to me.&quot; In our view, the trial judge was in the best position to make that 
  assessment.<br>
</p>
<p>(b) Confusion of concepts?<br>
</p>
<p>[37] The Gu Group contends that the trial judge did not distinguish Gu's termination 
  of the JVA on the basis of Lam's repudiation from rescission. The effect of 
  termination, asserts the Gu Group, is that an accepted repudiation &quot;terminates&quot; 
  the contract to the extent that future obligations are extinguished but &quot;[a]ccrued 
  obligations under the contract continue to exist, at least in the form of a 
  secondary obligation to pay damages&quot;: see 1394918 Ontario Ltd. v. 1310210 
  Ontario Inc. et al. (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 607 at 614 (C.A.); see also Guarantee 
  Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423. In contrast, 
  rescission voids the contract ab initio and returns the parties to their original 
  positions.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] We agree with the Gu Group's statement of the law in this domain. However, 
  we do not agree with its proposition that the trial judge misapprehended the 
  law. Although the trial judge used the word &quot;rescind&quot; when he stated 
  the issue, he was simply quoting the word the Gu Group used in its supplementary 
  factum. Moreover, it is clear from a full reading of his reasons that the trial 
  judge did not apply the doctrine of rescission. Indeed, if he had applied that 
  doctrine, he would not have needed to embark upon an analysis of waiver and 
  abandonment because the JVA would simply have been &quot;voided ab initio by 
  some vitiating element&quot;: see Keneric Tractor Sales Ltd. v. Langille, [1987] 
  2 S.C.R. 440 at 455. But that is not what the trial judge found. He recognized 
  that further analysis was required to determine whether the Gu Group had remedies, 
  including damages, against the Lam Group after accepting the repudiation and 
  terminating the contract.<br>
</p>
<p>(c) Waiver<br>
</p>
<p>[39] In our view, this is the central component of the Gu Group's appeal. The 
  Gu Group contends that the trial judge erred in holding that although the Gu 
  Group lawfully terminated the JVA following the Lam Group's repudiation of it, 
  it nevertheless waived its right to seek damages for the breach because of its 
  desire to enter into a new agreement with the Lam Group and Powerx.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] A leading case dealing with waiver in a contract law setting is Saskatchewan 
  River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490. This 
  case involved a life insurance policy that was terminated after the insured 
  failed to make a timely payment. The insured did not collect its mail regularly 
  and did not receive the requests for payment until it was too late. The waiver 
  issue arose because the insurance company did not initially terminate the policy 
  when it was entitled to do so, but rather extended a grace period to allow the 
  insured to pay. The insured argued that the insurance company had waived its 
  right to timely payment and was required to give notice before terminating the 
  contract for lack of payment. The Supreme Court of Canada held that, although 
  the insurance company had initially waived its right to timely payment, it was 
  still entitled to return to its contractual right to terminate for lack of payment 
  because the insured had not relied on the extended grace period. Indeed, the 
  insured only found out about the extended grace period after the contract had 
  been terminated.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] Writing for a unanimous court, Major J. said, at p. 500:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Waiver occurs where one party to a contract or to proceedings 
  takes steps which amount to foregoing reliance on some known right or defect 
  in the performance of the other party&#133;.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Waiver will be found only where the evidence demonstrates 
  that the party waiving had (1) a full knowledge of rights; and (2) an unequivocal 
  and conscious intention to abandon them. The creation of such a stringent test 
  is justified since no consideration moves from the party in whose favour a waiver 
  operates. An overly broad interpretation of waiver would undermine the requirement 
  of contractual consideration. <br>
</p>
<p>See also: Northern Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Reierson, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 
  390 at 398, and Griffiths v. Zambosco (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 397 at 407 (C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[42] The decision in Saskatchewan River Bungalows confirms that an unequivocal 
  and conscious intention to abandon rights may be manifest from the conduct of 
  the party possessing such rights. Accordingly, the primary question here is 
  whether the Gu Group, by its conduct, evinced &quot;an unequivocal and conscious 
  intention to abandon&quot; rights known to it.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] On this issue, the trial judge examined both Gu's testimony and the objective 
  evidence available. In paragraph 53 of his reasons dated September 16, 1999, 
  the trial judge set out several passages from Gu's testimony which clearly indicate 
  Gu's firm position that the JVA was finished and that he strongly desired to 
  enter into a new agreement. On three separate occasions in his evidence, Gu 
  claimed that the purpose of the new agreement was to &quot;replace&quot; the 
  JVA. Then, in paragraph 54, the trial judge turned to other evidence:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, this testimony is in &quot;harmony&quot; 
  with other more objective evidence, including but not limited to:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. The detailed negotiations of the Founders Shareholder 
  and Distribution and License Agreements;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. The proposal by Gu to Elder of a Mexican Franchise;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. The purchase by Tai Foong of $400,000 plus of the 
  Gu Refrigerants from China Sun;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. The incorporation of Greencool Corporation;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">6.[sic] The execution of the Founders Shareholder and 
  Distribution and License Agreements;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">7. The conclusion of a settlement agreement with an 
  earlier Gu licensee (the Dendera Agreement);<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">8. The posting of a million dollar L.C. by Lam in January 
  1994;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">9. The provision by Gu of his cash contribution of $260,000 
  and the demand of Lam for an equal amount;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">10. The wording of the Founders Shareholder Agreement 
  in respect to its application and the respective capital contributions of Gu 
  on the one hand and Lam and Elder on the other.<br>
</p>
<p>[44] Based on Gu's testimony and the cited contextual evidence, the trial judge 
  concluded that &quot;the bits of evidence just described underscore Gu's desire 
  to end the [JVA] once and for all in July, 1993 and conclude a new arrangement 
  on a new footing&quot;. We note that, although the Gu Group was represented 
  by counsel when the FSA was prepared, no agreement was proposed, or entered 
  into, to preserve any of the Gu Group's rights concerning the JVA, nor was the 
  FSA expressed to be without prejudice to those rights. While the Gu Group was 
  not required to expressly preserve its rights in order to defeat a subsequent 
  waiver claim, those facts are indicative of the Gu Group's intention concerning 
  its right to seek damages for breach of the JVA. In addition, as the trial judge 
  observed, although the Gu Group commenced litigation against the Lam Group in 
  June 1994, it did not amend its pleadings, or otherwise indicate any intention, 
  to include a claim for compensatory damages for the Lam Group's breach of the 
  JVA until approximately 1998, something that the trial judge thought &quot;speaks 
  volumes&quot;. In our view, that fact also supports the conclusion that the 
  Gu Group intended, when entering into the FSA, to abandon its rights under the 
  JVA.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] Further, unlike Saskatchewan River Bungalows, in this case the trial judge 
  found evidence that Lam relied on Gu's waiver; he observed that &quot;Lam would 
  have been bereft of any sense in paying for the Gu Refrigerants in September 
  [$400,000] and certain other accounts in November if at the same time he was 
  under threat of suit.&quot; He also observed that the Lam Group provided its 
  $1,000,000 letter of credit, as required by the FSA. In combination, therefore, 
  the Lam Group invested more than $1,400,000 under the new FSA. It is difficult 
  to conceive that it would have done so had there been any live prospect then 
  of it being exposed to an unresolved damages claim under the JVA.<br>
</p>
<p>[46] The Gu Group further asserts that its conduct was consistent with its 
  legal duty to attempt to mitigate its damages, including through the exploration 
  of the possibility of entering into an alternative agreement with the party 
  in breach: see Nashville Contractors Ltd. v. Middleton, [1984] O.J. No. 99 (C.A.), 
  and Payzu, Limited v. Saunders, [1918] 2 K.B. 581. <br>
</p>
<p>[47] We do not say that this submission is devoid of merit; at the time of 
  the Lam Group's breach, the Gu Group was certainly entitled to look to the Lam 
  Group in mitigation, without waiving its right to damages. However, that is 
  not the way the trial judge viewed the matter.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] In this case, in our view, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that 
  Gu's testimony and the surrounding contextual evidence concerning the conduct 
  of the Gu Group established that the Gu Group in fact had waived its right to 
  sue the Lam Group for damages in relation to the Lam Group's repudiation of 
  the JVA.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> After July 1993, both parties 
  moved on, entered into negotiations, and took steps, including major financial 
  steps, to reconstruct their relationship. It was open to the trial judge on 
  the evidence to conclude that the Gu Group terminated the JVA in July 1993 (as 
  Gu asserted), and that its post-termination conduct amounted to a waiver of 
  its right to sue the Lam Group in connection with the breach of the JVA.<br>
</p>
<p>(d) Abandonment<br>
</p>
<p>[49] The Gu Group contends that the trial judge held that the JVA was abandoned 
  and that he erred in so holding. For two reasons, we are not inclined to consider 
  this issue.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] First, our reading of the trial judge's reasons leaves us in doubt that 
  he reached a decision on this issue. It is true that he expressly permitted 
  the Lam Group to argue the defence of abandonment in its closing argument. As 
  well, when he summarized the Lam Group's legal argument in his reasons, he referred 
  specifically to the abandonment component of the argument. However, the trial 
  judge then explicitly framed &quot;the neat issue&quot; as &quot;whether there 
  is evidence to support the notion that Gu also elected to waive action on the 
  contract . . . .&quot; He moved directly to a consideration of the evidence 
  and reached his conclusion, all without mentioning abandonment again. Accordingly, 
  we are not convinced that it is necessary to embark upon a consideration of 
  the law relating to abandonment in a contract setting.<br>
</p>
<p>[51] Second, and in any event, our disposition of the waiver issue, which is 
  the central argument advanced by the Gu Group, renders superfluous the need 
  to address the abandonment issue. Even if we held that the trial judge addressed 
  the abandonment issue, and erred in his resolution of it, nothing would turn 
  on such a conclusion. The loss on waiver is determinative of the Gu Group's 
  appeal on the compensatory damages issue.<br>
</p>
<p>(2) Damages related to the Lam Group's undertaking<br>
</p>
<p>[52] The facts relating to this part of the appeal are sketched briefly in 
  paras. 13, 14 and 20 above. We shall now set forth more details. On September 
  23, 1994 Borins J. made a somewhat lengthy order which contained fourteen operative 
  paragraphs. Paragraphs 3, 4, and 11 in that order provided:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">33. This Court orders that save as specifically allowed 
  for in this Order, or upon further Order of this Honourable Court, Chujun Gu, 
  China Sun Group, Greencool Canada Inc. and any parties acting on their behalf 
  shall be excluded and enjoined from the day to day control, direction, operation, 
  management and business of GCS Ltd. and the commercial exploitation in the U.S.A., 
  Canada and Mexico of Gu Refrigerants and Technologies, including without limiting 
  the foregoing, all banking and financial matters and signing authority. Further, 
  no resolution(s) of the shareholders and/or directors of GCS Ltd. shall have 
  the effect of altering or varying this order, and shall have no legal force 
  and effect. Without limiting the definition of Gu Refrigerants and Technology 
  as found in the material filed with this Honourable Court, it shall include 
  compositions sold as G2015, G2018, G2018(a), G2018(b), G2032, GF2010 and G2018.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. This Court orders that until further Order of this 
  Honourable Court, all business activities in Canada, the United States of America 
  and Mexico to commercially exploit Gu Refrigerants and Technologies as defined 
  in the materials before this Honourable Court shall be conducted exclusively 
  through GCS Ltd. Without limiting the general wide meaning of commercial exploitation, 
  it shall include the sale, marketing, distribution and manufacture of Gu Refrigerants 
  and Gu Technologies.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">11. This Court orders that until further order of this 
  Honourable Court GCS Ltd, David Lam, Tai Foong Investments Ltd. and Tai Foong 
  International Ltd. undertake to abide by any order concerning damages that this 
  Court may make, as required by Rule 40.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<br>
</p>
<p>[53] It can be seen that under paragraphs 3 and 4 of that order the Lam Group 
  was given the right to exploit commercially Gu refrigerants and technologies 
  in Canada, the United States, and Mexico through Gu Gooling Systems Ltd. and 
  that the Gu Group was enjoined from engaging in &quot;the day to day control, 
  direction, operation, management and business of [Gu Cooling Systems Ltd.] and 
  the commercial exploitation in the U.S.A., Canada and Mexico of Gu Refrigerants 
  and Technologies&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[54] By order of Lissaman J. dated June 4, 1996 Borins J.'s order was &quot;superseded&quot; 
  and the commercial exploitation of Gu refrigerants and technologies was ordered 
  to &quot;be conducted through Greencool Canada Inc.&quot; The Gu Group was ordered 
  to provide security in the amount of $1,000,000 for its undertaking as to damages 
  &quot;provided for by Rule 40.03.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[55] During the second segment of the trial, the trial judge heard the Gu Group's 
  application &quot;for an inquiry to determine damages payable on the basis of 
  the undertaking provided by the Lam Group pursuant to the Order of the Honourable 
  Mr. Justice Borins dated September 23, 1994&quot; (para. 2 of the judgment dated 
  January 18, 2001). He dismissed the application and the Gu Group appeals from 
  that dismissal.<br>
</p>
<p>[56] Broadly speaking, the Gu Group submits that, although the trial judge 
  stated the correct test to determine whether the Lam Group should be relieved 
  from paying damages pursuant to its undertaking, he erred in the application 
  of the test. Specifically, the Gu Group submits that the trial judge gave weight 
  only to one consideration, namely, that the Gu Group had contravened the injunction.<br>
</p>
<p>[57] In what follows we shall set forth the legal test and then consider the 
  trial judge's reasons in the light of the test and the Gu Group's submissions. 
  The test is set forth in Vieweger Construction Co. Ltd. v. Rush &amp; Tompkins 
  Construction Ltd. (1964), 48 D.L.R. (2d) 509 (S.C.C.) at 518 per Spence J. speaking 
  for the court:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It would appear that the proper test was laid down by the Court of Appeal in 
  Griffith v. Blake (1884), 27 Ch. D. 474. There, the Court of Appeal was concerned 
  with a dictum of the late Master of the Rolls in Smith v. Day (1882), 21 Ch. 
  D. 421, to the effect that the undertaking as to damages only applies where 
  the plaintiff has acted improperly in obtaining the injunction, and all the 
  members of the Court expressed dissent with that view. Baggallay, L. J. said, 
  at p. 476:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">If the defendants turn out to be right, it appears to me that they can, under 
  the undertaking, obtain compensation for all injury sustained by them from the 
  granting of the injunction.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">And Cotton, L.J., said at p. 477:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">But I am of opinion that his dictum is not well founded, and that the rule 
  is, that whenever the undertaking is given, and the plaintiff ultimately fails 
  on the merits, an inquiry as to damages will be granted unless there are special 
  circumstances to the contrary. (The italics are my own.)<br>
</p>
<p>[58] The test was elaborated upon by the judgment of this court in Nelson Burns 
  &amp; Co. et al v. Gratham Industries Ltd. (1987), 23 C.P.C. (2d) 279 at 288 
  where Zuber J.A. said for the court:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Since the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Vieweger an important 
  change has taken place in the law with respect to interlocutory injunctions. 
  As a result of a decision of the House of Lords in American Cyanamid Co. v. 
  Ethicon Ltd., [1975] A.C. 396, [1975] 1 All E.R. 504, the balance of convenience 
  test has largely displaced an earlier view that an applicant could obtain an 
  interlocutory injunction only if he could show a strong prima facie case. Whatever 
  the differences may be between the two standards, it is now plain that in Ontario 
  interlocutory injunctions are now easier to obtain than was the case prior to 
  the American Cyanamid case.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Because of this change and because of the number of such injunctions that are 
  sought, it is appropriate to emphasize the serious nature of the undertaking 
  to pay damages which is a condition of the issuance of the interlocutory injunction. 
  In the ordinary course the unsuccessful plaintiff must understand that he is 
  obliged to pay damages in accordance with his undertaking without quibble, and 
  Courts generally will be unsympathetic towards [t]hose who seek to resile from 
  such an obligation.<br>
</p>
<p>[59] The trial judge, in his reasons under the heading &quot;Acts of Circumvention&quot;, 
  found that the Gu Group breached the injunction by carrying on business in the 
  United States. Gu was prepared to admit that he breached the injunction by &quot;assisting&quot; 
  others in the sale of Gu gases and technologies in the United States and by 
  performing other consulting services. This was presented on behalf of Gu as 
  being akin to an honest mistake of law or fact based on Gu's lack of understanding 
  of the injunction order.<br>
</p>
<p>[60] The trial judge then observed that there were facts upon which he could 
  conclude that Gu was not merely performing a consultative function but was the 
  principal in two United States companies, Greencool Washington Inc. and Greencool 
  Technology Inc. This was not disputed. The trial judge said:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am more than satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Gu was the driving 
  force of the U.S. operation in the period after the Borins order to the date 
  of the Lissaman order in June 1996 and was not merely acting in a consultative 
  capacity. The evidence in this respect is overwhelming and beyond mere coincidence. 
  &#133;<br>
  No matter how one might torture the language of the Borins order, the consultative 
  assistance that Messrs. Gu and Hu admitted giving clearly resulted in the commercial 
  exploitation of Gu refrigerants and technology - a prohibited act in and of 
  itself.<br>
</p>
<p>[61] In his analysis, the trial judge found that:</p>
<p class="indent">Gu's actions in flouting the injunction and actively promoting his business 
  in the U.S. constitute special circumstances sufficient to disentitle him to 
  an inquiry into damages. In addition, his explanation given in evidence, while 
  perhaps motivated by the threat of the then pending contempt proceedings, was 
  not only ill conceived but had the effect of exacerbating matters. I hasten 
  to observe that I have arrived at this conclusion even though I was urged by 
  Mr. Bates to have regard to the behaviour of the Lam Group both in the manner 
  in which the injunction was obtained and its conduct thereafter.<br>
</p>
<p>[62] The trial judge then dealt extensively with the conduct of the Lam Group. 
  This included his consideration of the Gu Group's submission that the Lam Group 
  &quot;had no business taking over the control of the joint venture company&quot;, 
  and that the Lam Group &quot;not only did not possess the requisite knowledge 
  and skill to manufacture and market the Gu gases or their equivalent, but also 
  had no intention to pursue the business itself.&quot; Lam's intention was to 
  extort repayment of the money he had allegedly invested in a joint venture.<br>
</p>
<p>[63] The trial judge did not doubt that the evidence gave voice &quot;to the 
  above assertions&quot; but, in any event, he observed:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. Lam was unwavering in his assertion that the joint 
  venture agreement [the JVA] was in effect right through to the conclusion of 
  trial. Indeed, when Gu testified, he acknowledged that Lam always maintained 
  the existence of the Agreement even though I found it had come to an end in 
  the summer of 1993. Accordingly, Lam's pleadings were perfectly consonant with 
  this position.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. The fact that Lam would rather have been paid out 
  than operate the joint venture company to the exclusion of Gu does not taint 
  his actions. There is nothing reprehensible or repugnant about this conduct.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Lam Group's activities and efforts subsequent 
  to the date of the injunction, although far from stellar, are more an indication 
  of Lam's approach to business than they are of malfeasance. Lam is, from my 
  observations, a tight fisted businessman who sought to spread the risk of an 
  inherently risky venture.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. I am not sure his actions in obtaining the injunction 
  were as purposeful and high handed as was argued. I am more inclined to conclude 
  that he backed into the injunction based upon the fact that Gu was unable to 
  come up with the mandated security.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">5. In the final analysis, I am not persuaded that Lam's 
  conduct amounted to an abuse of process, even if it were undertaken solely for 
  the purpose of being paid money to which Lam thought he was entitled. As will 
  be discussed in more detail below, such a motivation does not amount to a collateral 
  purpose. In any event, even if such actions were undertaken for a collateral 
  purpose, they do not amount to an abuse of process at law.<br>
</p>
<p>[64] The trial judge then referred to Gu's submission that he did not have 
  to &quot;go so far as to find Lam's actions amounted to an abuse of process 
  to warrant a balancing of conduct&quot;, and that the trial judge &quot;only 
  had to conclude that Lam's actions amounted to misconduct to warrant censure.&quot; 
  He found that Lam's activities after the injunction were &quot; 'questionable', 
  again, not because they admit of misconduct, but because they were illogical.&quot; 
  He then said:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, and more to the point, I do not think Lam's actions in obtaining 
  injunctive relief, albeit as a last resort, warrant comment or criticism of 
  this court. Such is particularly the case where the actions taken can be said 
  to logically flow from the claims originally made. That, regrettably, is the 
  nature of the litigation beast.<br>
</p>
<p>[65] The trial judge concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, even if such actions amounted to misconduct, they do not amount to 
  an abuse of process and do not warrant a balancing exercise. If such an exercise 
  were warranted, I am not persuaded that Lam's actions tip the scales sufficiently 
  to negate Gu's own conduct and thus permit an inquiry into the undertaking as 
  to damages. Accordingly, this aspect of the Gu Group's claim must fail.<br>
</p>
<p>[66] We do not think that the trial judge erred in the manner submitted by 
  the Gu Group. At the end of the day, he concluded that if a &quot;balancing 
  exercise&quot; were warranted he would give greater weight to Gu's own conduct.<br>
</p>
<p>[67] We shall examine his reasons further in light of the applicable principles. 
  There can be no doubt that Gu's violation of the injunction was a highly relevant 
  factor. His complaint was that the Lam Group's interlocutory injunction prevented 
  him from exploiting a business that was rightfully his. However, the facts as 
  found and, it is important to observe, not challenged on this appeal, showed 
  that by reason of his deliberate violations the injunction did not have this 
  effect. In seeking the inquiry as to damages, he did not come to court with 
  &quot;clean hands&quot;: see City of Toronto v. Polai, [1970] 1 O.R. 483 (C.A.) 
  at 493-94.<br>
</p>
<p>[68] Gu, in making light of his conduct, appears to be submitting that a violation 
  of an injunction should not count for much and that the enjoined party should 
  still be entitled to pursue his claim for damages - setting off, it would seem, 
  what he gained by his violation against the damages he incurred. This approach 
  trivializes an injunction.<br>
</p>
<p>[69] In upholding the trial judge's conclusion we do not intend to lay down 
  the proposition that in any case where an enjoined party has breached the injunction 
  he or she, for this reason alone, will not be entitled to an inquiry as to damages. 
  All potentially relevant factors, including the nature of the breach, should 
  be taken into account in determining the equities of the case before a decision 
  is made. <br>
</p>
<p>[70] Further, applying what was said by this court in Nelson Burns, supra, 
  we emphasize that the undoubted discretion that a judge has to relieve a party 
  from its undertaking is a narrow one. We have no doubt that there is a strong 
  presumption in favour of an inquiry into the enjoined party's damages.<br>
</p>
<p>[71] In this case the violation of the injunction was not inadvertent or of 
  a minor nature. Such a violation, depending on the other features of the case, 
  might not ultimately count against an enjoined party. The violations in this 
  case, however, were deliberate and flagrant and we cannot say that the trial 
  judge erred in giving them the weight that he did and in not giving the weight 
  that the Gu Group submitted should be given to the Lam Group's conduct. See 
  R. v. Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.) at 719 respecting appellate review 
  relating to &quot;error[s] in principle&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[72] With respect to the Lam Group's conduct, although the trial judge's reasons 
  are not as clear as they might be, we are satisfied that he took its conduct 
  into account even if it could not be characterized as &quot;an abuse of process&quot;. 
  We accept that it would be too rigid an approach to consider the enjoining party's 
  conduct as a factor against directing an inquiry into damages only if it amounted 
  to an abuse of process. <br>
</p>
<p>[73] In summary, we are satisfied that in determining whether an inquiry was 
  warranted, the trial judge considered all of the relevant factors and, in the 
  exercise of his judgment, gave predominant weight to the Gu Group's contraventions 
  of the injunction. We are not persuaded that he erred in arriving at this conclusion<br>
</p>
<p>Lam Group's Cross-appeal<br>
</p>
<p>(3) Pre-contractual representations of the Gu Group<br>
</p>
<p>[74] The Lam Group contends that the trial judge erred by failing to give any 
  effect to the pre-contractual representations of the Gu Group concerning the 
  success and marketability of its refrigerants.<br>
</p>
<p>[75] The trial judge's conclusion on that issue was that &quot;any pre-contractual 
  representations, if made, are of no moment&quot;. He offered three reasons for 
  his conclusion:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the time that these issues represented at trial, I am of the 
  view that any pre-contractual representations, if made, are of no moment. In 
  the first place, my assessment of the evidence leads me to conclude that the 
  Lam Group knew a lot more about the developmental stage and marketability of 
  the Gu Refrigerants before going to China than they would have the court believe. 
  Fu's own notes suggest that he had (or could have) contacted relevant governmental 
  authorities. I find he was (or, at worst, should have been) aware in the weeks 
  before leaving for China that governmental approval of some form was necessary 
  before the gases could be marketed commercially in Canada, at least. Furthermore, 
  both he and Lam knew that they were embarking upon a risky venture with no proven 
  track record. They were nevertheless prepared to run this risk.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, even if the Gu Group had overstated its success, or the apparent marketability 
  of the Gu Refrigerants, the Lam Group knew about any alleged misrepresentations 
  early on in the relationship after their return to Canada. There was ample opportunity 
  and occasion for Lam to ascertain the true state of the Gu Refrigerants from 
  a myriad of sources. Once learned, they chose not to avoid the relationship 
  and back out of the deal or even complain about the fact that they had, presumably, 
  been misled. Indeed, this pattern of behaviour continued until the date the 
  battle lines between the parties were drawn, well into 1994, when the first 
  articulated complaints about misrepresentations first began to surface.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, Lam, as a sophisticated businessperson, 
  saw an opportunity which was virtually limitless in terms of potential. He was 
  very much interested in securing whatever right or &quot;option&quot; he could 
  for the North American market. He was not above making his own set of promises 
  to Gu, which he undoubtedly thought he would be able to modify on his return 
  to Canada and to which he hoped he might not be bound in future.<br>
</p>
<p>[76] The Lam Group contends that the trial judge erred in this passage by finding 
  that the Lam Group was not entitled to rely on the alleged misrepresentations 
  because of its own lack of diligence in rescinding, or otherwise complaining 
  about, the agreement it had entered into because of them.<br>
</p>
<p>[77] We do not agree with this submission. A fair reading of the entire passage, 
  in which the trial judge deals with several factors, is that the trial judge 
  found that Lam did not rely on Gu's representations about the marketability 
  and success of the refrigerants. While he expresses some uncertainty about what 
  the parties knew versus what they could or should have known, this is explained 
  by the crucial fact that the trial judge did not believe most of Lam's, or his 
  project manager Fu's, testimony (&quot;I reject the evidence of Mr. Lam in its 
  entirety and would observe that it was not assisted by the evidence of Mr. Fu&quot;).<br>
</p>
<p>[78] Although the Lam Group also raises several other arguments in support 
  of its position concerning the alleged misrepresentations of the Gu Group, in 
  our view there is a simple bottom line on this issue. The trial judge found 
  that Lam knew more than he admitted and would have entered into the JVA even 
  if he knew that Gu was overstating the marketability and success of his products. 
  Accordingly, the trial judge was entitled to hold that any misrepresentations, 
  if made, were insignificant and did not vitiate Lam's repudiation of the JVA 
  by failing to make the required payments of capital.<br>
</p>
<p>(4) Oppression remedy<br>
</p>
<p>[79] The Lam Group contends that the trial judge erred by holding that oppression 
  remedies were not available to it.<br>
</p>
<p>[80] We disagree. The Lam Group's breach of the JVA and the trial judge's decision 
  that it was terminated in July 1993 defeat any oppression claim. In attempting 
  to use the oppression remedy in this circumstance, the Lam Group is essentially 
  asking the court either to uphold its rights under the JVA (which it repudiated) 
  or, at the very least, to restrict the Gu Group to marketing its technology 
  through the new GCSL with Lam as a partner, no matter how seriously the Lam 
  Group had breached the agreement that brought the parties together. Either proposition, 
  on the facts here, is untenable. <br>
</p>
<p>Lam Group's Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>(5) Punitive damages<br>
</p>
<p>[81] The trial judge awarded the Gu Group $50,000 punitive damages in addition 
  to $25,000 which the parties agreed the Lam Group would pay as a result of Lam's 
  conversion of Gu's laptop computer. He found that Gu's computer was one of his 
  most important business tools, it was held with absolutely no justification, 
  Lam attempted to delay its return through a ruse designed to extort concessions 
  from Gu, Lam denied the gravity of this conduct throughout the trial, and Lam 
  tried to access Gu's files and damaged his hard drive in the process. Lam contends 
  that there is no evidence to support the last finding.<br>
</p>
<p>[82] The leading case on punitive damages is Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co. 
  (2002), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (S.C.C.). In that case, the court indicated that 
  the general objectives of punitive damages are punishment, deterrence of the 
  wrongdoer and others, and denunciation, and went on to state that &quot;punitive 
  damages should be resorted to only in exceptional cases and with restraint&quot; 
  (p. 288). Binnie J. also said, at p. 288:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[A]ll jurisdictions seek to promote rationality. In 
  directing itself to the punitive damages, the court should relate the facts 
  of the particular case to the underlying purposes of punitive damages and ask 
  itself how, in particular, an award would further one or other of the objectives 
  of the law, and what is the lowest award that would serve the purpose, i.e., 
  because any higher award would be irrational [emphasis in original].<br>
</p>
<p>[83] The Lam Group contends that the trial judge's award of $50,000 in punitive 
  damages violates the rationality principle and is disproportionate when set 
  against its conduct in this case.<br>
</p>
<p>[84] We disagree. Although the trial judge did not have the benefit of the 
  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Whiten, a fair reading of his comprehensive 
  reasons on the issue of punitive damages establishes that his reasoning was 
  consistent with the analytical framework set out by Binnie J. The behaviour 
  of the Lam Group concerning Gu's personal computer was seriously blameworthy 
  - the Lam Group stole the computer, damaged it, retained it for several weeks, 
  attempted to use it to extract concessions from Gu and, at trial, minimized 
  all of this misconduct. This constellation of conduct went well beyond the tort 
  of conversion. In our view, both the decision to award punitive damages and 
  the choice of quantum of $50,000 were rational and proportionate within the 
  parameters of the principles set out in Whiten.<br>

<p>E. DISPOSITION<br>

  Lam relating to a potential multi-million dollar action for damages by Gu against 
  Lam.</p>
