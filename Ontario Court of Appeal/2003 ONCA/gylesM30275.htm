<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On September 10, 2003, I made an order releasing the applicant pending 
  appeal. I attached a term to the release order directing that he not perform 
  any duties or functions of councillor for the balance of his term. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown asked that I also include a condition prohibiting the applicant 
  from running in the upcoming municipal election. I reserved my decision on that 
  request. I am not prepared to add the additional condition sought by the Crown. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] There is no statutory bar to a person in the applicant's circumstances from 
  standing for election to municipal office. The only legislative prohibition 
  is found in s. 91(1) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, S.O. 1996, c. 32. 
  The Act prohibits individuals from standing for election when they have been 
  convicted of either a corrupt practice as set out in ss. 89-90 of the Act or 
  of an offence under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, s. C-46 in connection with 
  a municipal election. The offences of which the applicant now stands convicted 
  fall under neither head and as such do not attract the s. 91(1) prohibition.</p>
<p>
  [4] The policy underlying the legislative scheme would seem to be that it is 
  up to the electorate to decide whether it wishes someone with a criminal record, 
  other than a record referred to in the Municipal Elections Act, to represent 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [5] I accept Mr. Gold's submission that there is little risk that the applicant, 
  if elected, would commit an offence similar to those of which he now stands 
  convicted while on bail pending appeal. Given that, I am not persuaded that 
  I should interfere with the normal electoral process through the imposition 
  of a condition in the bail order.</p>
<p>
  [6] In making this ruling, I distinguish an order prohibiting the applicant 
  from running for election from the order I made precluding the applicant from 
  carrying out his duties as a municipal councillor during his present term of 
  office. When the applicant was elected to his present term, the electorate was 
  not aware of the convictions that give rise to this appeal. That being the case, 
  it is, in my view, in the public interest that the applicant be prohibited from 
  carrying out his duties as councillor during the balance of the present term.</p>
<p>
  [7] For the above reasons, I deny the Crown's request to add the additional 
  condition to the applicant's release order.</p>
