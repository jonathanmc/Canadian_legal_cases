<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p align="left">[1] On the state of the record that was before the motions
  judge, it could not be said that there was no genuine issue for trial with
  respect to the question of Linamar's liability to the appellant for intentional
  interference with economic relations. There was evidence, including the evidence
  of actions taken by officers of Linamar and of documents sent by and to Linamar,
  such that it cannot be said, with the certainty that a motion for summary judgment
  requires, that dismissal of the appellant's claim against Linamar is inevitable. </p>
[2] The appeal is allowed, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order of the motions judge
are set aside and, in their place, an order will go dismissing Linamar's motion
for summary judgment. An order will go for the assessment of the appellant's
costs of the motion before the motions judge. Costs of the appeal will be fixed
in the amount of $10,000, including disbursements and G.S.T. This amount is less
than the amount to which counsel were prepared to agree, but is consistent with
the range of costs this court generally awards on appeals of this nature.
