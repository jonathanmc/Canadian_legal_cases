<p>On appeal from a judgment of the Divisional Court (Heather F. Smith, A.C.J.S.C., 
  Robert A. Blair R.S.J., and Harry LaForme J.) dated July 12, 2002, reported 
  at 60 O.R. (3d) 321.</p>
<p><strong>BY THE COURT:<br>
  </strong></p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[1] The definition of marriage in Canada, for all of the nation&#146;s 136 
  years, has been based on the classic formulation of Lord Penzance in <em>Hyde 
  v. Hyde and Woodmansee </em>(1866), L.R. 1 P.&amp;D. 130 at 133: &#147;I conceive 
  that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined 
  as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of 
  all others.&#148; The central question in this appeal is whether the exclusion 
  of same-sex couples from this common law definition of marriage breaches ss. 
  2(a) or 15(1) of the <em>Canadian <em>Charter</em> of Rights and Freedoms</em> 
  (&#147;the <em>Charter</em>&#148;) in a manner that is not justified in a free 
  and democratic society under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p>[2] This appeal raises significant constitutional issues that require serious 
  legal analysis. That said, this case is ultimately about the recognition and 
  protection of human dignity and equality in the context of the social structures 
  available to conjugal couples in Canada.</p>
<p>[3] In<em> Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</em>, [1999] 
  1 S.C.R. 497 at 530, Iacobucci J., writing for a unanimous court, described 
  the importance of human dignity:</p>
<p class="indent">Human dignity means that an individual or group feels self-respect and self-worth. 
  It is concerned with physical and psychological integrity and empowerment. Human 
  dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal traits or circumstances 
  which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, or merits. It is enhanced 
  by laws which are sensitive to the needs, capacities, and merits of different 
  individuals, taking into account the context underlying their differences. Human 
  dignity is harmed when individuals and groups are marginalized, ignored, or 
  devalued, and is enhanced when laws recognize the full place of all individuals 
  and groups within Canadian society. </p>
<p>[4] The Ontario <em>Human Rights Code, </em>R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, also recognizes 
  the importance of protecting the dignity of all persons. The preamble affirms 
  that &#147;the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all 
  members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace 
  in the world&#148;. It states:</p>
<p class="indent">[I]t is public policy in Ontario to recognize the dignity and worth of every 
  person and to provide for equal rights and opportunities without discrimination 
  that is contrary to law, and having as its aim the creation of a climate of 
  understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person so 
  that each person feels a part of the community and able to contribute fully 
  to the development and well-being of the community and the Province;</p>
<p>[5] Marriage is, without dispute, one of the most significant forms of personal 
  relationships. For centuries, marriage has been a basic element of social organization 
  in societies around the world. Through the institution of marriage, individuals 
  can publicly express their love and commitment to each other. Through this institution, 
  society publicly recognizes expressions of love and commitment between individuals, 
  granting them respect and legitimacy as a couple. This public recognition and 
  sanction of marital relationships reflect society&#146;s approbation of the 
  personal hopes, desires and aspirations that underlie loving, committed conjugal 
  relationships. This can only enhance an individual&#146;s sense of self-worth 
  and dignity.</p>
<p>[6] The ability to marry, and to thereby participate in this fundamental societal 
  institution, is something that most Canadians take for granted. Same-sex couples 
  do not; they are denied access to this institution simply on the basis of their 
  sexual orientation. </p>
<p>[7] Sexual orientation is an analogous ground that comes under the umbrella 
  of protection in s. 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em>: see <em>Egan v. Canada,</em> 
  [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513, and <em><em>M. v. H.</em></em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3. As explained 
  by Cory J. in <em>M. v. H.</em> at 52-53:</p>
<p class="indent">In<em> Egan</em>...this Court unanimously affirmed that sexual 
  orientation is an analogous ground to those enumerated in s. 15(1). Sexual orientation 
  is &#147;a deeply personal characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable 
  only at unacceptable personal costs&#148; (para. 5). In addition, a majority 
  of this Court explicitly recognized that gays, lesbians and bisexuals, &#147;whether 
  as individuals or couples, form an identifiable minority who have suffered and 
  continue to suffer serious social, political and economic disadvantage&#148; 
  (para. 175, <em>per</em> Cory J.; see also para. 89, <em>per</em> L&#146;Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J.).</p>
<p>[8] Historically, same-sex equality litigation has focused on achieving equality 
  in some of the most basic elements of civic life, such as bereavement leave, 
  health care benefits, pensions benefits, spousal support, name changes and adoption. 
  The question at the heart of this appeal is whether excluding same-sex couples 
  from another of the most basic elements of civic life - marriage - infringes 
  human dignity and violates the Canadian Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>B. FACTS<br>
  </strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(1) The parties and the events</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[9] Seven<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> gay and lesbian couples (&#147;the Couples&#148;) 
  want to celebrate their love and commitment to each other by getting married 
  in civil ceremonies. In this respect, they share the same goal as countless 
  other Canadian couples. Their reasons for wanting to engage in a formal civil 
  ceremony of marriage are the same as the reasons of heterosexual couples. By 
  way of illustration, we cite the affidavits of three of the persons who seek 
  to be married:</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Aloysius Edmund Pittman</em></p>
<p class="indent">I ask only to be allowed the right to be joined together by 
  marriage the same as my parents and my heterosexual friends.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Julie Erbland</em></p>
<p class="indent">I understand marriage as a defining moment for people choosing 
  to make a life commitment to each other. I want the family that Dawn and I have 
  created to be understood by all of the people in our lives and by society. If 
  we had the freedom to marry, society would grow to understand our commitment 
  and love for each other. We are interested in raising children. We want community 
  recognition and support. I doubt that society will support us and our children, 
  if our own government does not afford us the right to marry.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Carolyn Rowe</em></p>
<p class="indent">We would like the public recognition of our union as a &#147;valid&#148; 
  relationship and would like to be known officially as more than just roommates. 
  Married spouse is a title that one chooses to enter into while common-law spouse 
  is something that a couple happens into if they live together long enough. We 
  want our families, relatives, friends, and larger society to know and understand 
  our relationship for what it is, a loving committed relationship between two 
  people. A traditional marriage would allow us the opportunity to enter into 
  such a commitment. The marriage ceremony itself provides a time for family and 
  friends to gather around a couple in order to recognise the love and commitment 
  they have for each other.</p>
<p>[10] The Couples applied for civil marriage licences from the Clerk of the 
  City of Toronto. The Clerk did not deny the licences but, instead, indicated 
  that she would apply to the court for directions, and hold the licences in abeyance 
  in the interim. The Couples commenced their own application. By order dated 
  August 22, 2000, Lang J. transferred the Couples&#146; application to the Divisional 
  Court. The Clerk&#146;s application was stayed on consent.</p>
<p>[11] In roughly the same time frame, the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto 
  (&#147;MCCT&#148;), a Christian church that solemnizes marriages for its heterosexual 
  congregants, decided to conduct marriages for its homosexual members. Previously, 
  MCCT had felt constrained from performing marriages for same-sex couples because 
  it understood that the municipal authorities in Toronto would not issue a marriage 
  licence to same-sex couples. However, MCCT learned that the ancient Christian 
  tradition of publishing the banns of marriage was a lawful alternative under 
  the laws of Ontario to a marriage licence issued by municipal authorities: see 
  <em>Marriage Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.3, s. 5(1).</p>
<p>[12] Two couples, Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell and Elaine and Anne Vautour, 
  decided to be married in a religious ceremony at MCCT. In an affidavit, Elaine 
  and Anne Vautour explained their decision:</p>
<p class="indent">We love one another and are happy to be married. We highly value the love and 
  commitment to our relationship that marriage implies. Our parents were married 
  for over 40 and 50 years respectively, and we value the tradition of marriage 
  as seriously as did our parents.</p>
<p>[13] The pastor at MCCT, Rev. Brent Hawkes, published the banns of marriage 
  for the two couples during services on December 10, 17 and 24, 2000. On January 
  14, 2001, Rev. Hawkes presided at the weddings at MCCT. He registered the marriages 
  in the Church Register and issued marriage certificates to the couples.</p>
<p>[14] In compliance with the laws of Ontario, MCCT submitted the requisite documentation 
  for the two marriages to the Office of the Registrar General: see <em>Vital 
  Statistics Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. V.4, s. 19(1) and the Regulations under 
  the <em>Marriage Act</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 738, s. 2(3). The Registrar refused 
  to accept the documents for registration, citing an alleged federal prohibition 
  against same-sex marriages. As a result, MCCT launched its application to the 
  Divisional Court.</p>
<p>[15] By order dated January 25, 2001, Lang J. consolidated the Couples&#146; 
  and MCCT&#146;s applications.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(2) The litigation</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[16] The Couples&#146; application and MCCT&#146;s application were heard by 
  a panel of the Divisional Court consisting of Smith A.C.J.S.C., Blair R.S.J. 
  And LaForme J. In reasons released on July 12, 2002, the court unanimously held 
  that the common law definition of marriage as the &#147;lawful and voluntary 
  union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others&#148; infringed 
  the Couples&#146; equality rights under s. 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> 
  in a manner that was not justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. The court 
  also held that the remaining <em><em>Charter</em></em> rights claimed by the 
  applicants were either not applicable or not infringed. In particular, the court 
  did not accept MCCT&#146;s arguments anchored in s. 2(a), freedom of religion.</p>
<p>[17] The panel&#146;s ruling on remedy was not unanimous. Smith A.C.J.S.C. 
  was of the view that Parliament should legislate the appropriate remedy and 
  that it should be given two years to do so, failing which the parties could 
  return to the court to seek an appropriate remedy. LaForme J. favoured immediate 
  amendment, by the court, of the common law definition of marriage by substituting 
  the words &#147;two persons&#148; for &#147;one man and one woman&#148;. Blair 
  R.S.J. adopted a middle position; he would have allowed Parliament two years 
  to amend the common law rule, failing which the reformulation remedy proposed 
  by LaForme J. would be automatically triggered. It is Blair R.S.J.&#146;s position 
  that is reflected in the formal judgment of the court.</p>
<p>[18] The appellant Attorney General of Canada (&#147;AGC&#148;) appeals from 
  the judgment of the Divisional Court on the equality issue.</p>
<p>[19] The Couples cross-appeal on the question of remedy alone. They seek a 
  declaration of unconstitutionality and a reformulation of the definition of 
  marriage, both to take place immediately, and related personal remedies in the 
  nature of <em>mandamus</em>.</p>
<p>[20] MCCT also cross-appeals on the question of remedy. In addition, it cross-appeals 
  from the Divisional Court&#146;s dismissal of its claim that the current definition 
  of marriage infringes its ss. 2(a) and 15(1) rights as a religious institution.</p>
<p>[21] Because of the public importance of the issues, several parties were given 
  permission to intervene in the appeal.</p>
<p>[22] The Association for Marriage and the Family in Ontario and the Interfaith 
  Coalition on Marriage and Family support the position of the AGC.</p>
<p>[23] The Canadian Human Rights Commission, Egale Canada Inc. and the Canadian 
  Coalition of Liberal Rabbis for Same-Sex Marriage support the position of the 
  Couples and MCCT.</p>
<p>[24] The Attorney General of Ontario and the Clerk of the City of Toronto take 
  no position with respect to the issues raised by the appeal and the cross-appeal. 
  Both state that they will abide by any order made by this court.</p>
<p><strong>C. ISSUES</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[25] We frame the issues as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) What is the common law definition of marriage? Does it prohibit 
  same-sex marriages?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Is a constitutional amendment required to change the common 
  law definition of marriage, or can a reformulation be accomplished by Parliament 
  or the courts?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Does the common law definition of marriage infringe MCCT&#146;s 
  rights under ss. 2(a) and 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Does the common law definition of marriage infringe the 
  Couples&#146; equality rights under s. 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em>?</p>
<p class="indent">(5) If the answer to question 3 or 4 is &#145;Yes&#146;, is 
  the infringement saved by s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>?</p>
<p class="indent">(6) If the common law definition of marriage is unconstitutional, 
  what is the appropriate remedy and should it be suspended for any period of 
  time?</p>
<p><strong>D. ANALYSIS</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[26] Before turning to the issues raised by the appeal, we make four preliminary 
  observations.</p>
<p>[27] First, the definition of marriage is found at common law. The only statutory 
  reference to a definition of marriage is found in s. 1.1 of the <em>Modernization 
  of Benefits and Obligations Act</em>, S.C. 2000, c. 12, which provides:</p>
<p class="indent">For greater certainty, the amendments made by this Act do not affect the meaning 
  of the word &#147;marriage&#148;, that is, the lawful union of one man and one 
  woman to the exclusion of all others.</p>
<p>[28] The<em> Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act</em> is the federal 
  government&#146;s response to the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s decision in 
  <em><em>M. v. H.</em></em> The Act extends federal benefits and obligations to all unmarried 
  couples that have cohabited in a conjugal relationship for at least one year, 
  regardless of sexual orientation. As recognized by the parties, s. 1.1 does 
  not purport to be a federal statutory definition of marriage. Rather, s. 1.1 
  simply affirms that the Act does not change the common law definition of marriage.</p>
<p>[29] Second, it is clear and all parties accept that, the common law is subject 
  to <em><em>Charter</em></em> scrutiny where government action or inaction is 
  based on a common law rule: see <em>B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney 
  General)</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214; <em>R. v. Swain</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933; 
  <em>R. v. Salituro</em>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654; and <em>Hill v. Church of Scientology</em>, 
  [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130. Accordingly, there is no dispute that the AGC was the 
  proper respondent in the applications brought by the Couples and MCCT, and that 
  the common law definition of marriage is subject to <em>Charter</em> scrutiny.</p>
<p>[30] Third, the issues raised in this appeal are questions of law. Accordingly, 
  the standard of review applicable to the decision of the Divisional Court is 
  that of correctness: <em>Housen v. Nikolaisen</em>, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 8. 
  As explained by Iacobucci and Major JJ. at para. 9: &#147;[T]he primary role 
  of appellate courts is to delineate and refine legal rules and ensure their 
  universal application. In order to fulfill [these] functions, appellate courts 
  require a broad scope of review with respect to matters of law.&#148;</p>
<p>[31] Fourth, this court is not the first court to deal with the issues relating 
  to the constitutionality of the definition of same-sex marriage. In addition 
  to the judgments prepared by the three judges of the Divisional Court, courts 
  in two other provinces have addressed the same issues we must face.</p>
<p>[32] In <em>Hendricks v. Quebec (Attorney General)</em>, [2002] J.Q. No. 3816 
  (S.C.), Lemelin J. declared invalid the prohibition against same-sex marriages 
  in Quebec caused by the intersection of two federal statutes and the <em>Civil 
  Code of Quebec</em> on the basis that it contravened s. 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> 
  and could not be saved under s. 1. She stayed the declaration of invalidity 
  for two years.</p>
<p>[33] In <em>EGALE Canada Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, [2003] B.C.J. 
  No. 994, released on May 1, 2003, the British Columbia Court of Appeal declared 
  the common law definition of marriage unconstitutional, substituted the words 
  &#147;two persons&#148; for &#147;one man and one woman&#148; and suspended 
  the declaration of unconstitutionality until July 12, 2004, the expiration of 
  the two-year suspension ordered by the Divisional Court in this case.</p>
<p>[34] We want to record our admiration for the high quality of the reasons prepared 
  by all of the judges in these cases. As will become clear, we agree with a great 
  deal of their reasoning and conclusions on the equality issue. Our reasons can 
  be shortened, given the clarity and eloquence of our judicial colleagues.</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>(1) The common law rule regarding marriage</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[35] The preliminary argument on this appeal advanced by the Couples is that 
  there is no common law bar to same-sex marriages. The intervenor Egale Canada 
  Inc. (&#147;Egale&#148;) supported this argument and expanded on the Couples&#146; 
  submissions.</p>
<p>[36] As previously mentioned, the classic formulation of marriage is found 
  in the English decision of <em>Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee</em>, &#147;the voluntary 
  union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.&#148; 
  Egale argues that <em>Hyde and Corbett v. Corbett</em>, [1970] 2 All E.R. 33 
  (P.D.A.), the other English case cited as authority for the common law restriction 
  against same-sex marriage, have a weak jurisprudential foundation and ought 
  not to be followed. Egale points out that <em>Hyde</em> dealt with the validity 
  of a potentially polygamous marriage, and argues that the comments in <em>Hyde</em> 
  about marriage being between opposite-sex persons are <em>obiter</em>. With 
  respect to <em>Corbett</em>, Egale argues that it is based on outdated, narrow 
  notions of sexual relationships between women and men. The Couples adopt Egale&#146;s 
  submissions, and further argue that <em><em>M. v. H.</em></em> overruled, by implication, 
  any common law restriction against same-sex marriages. </p>
<p>[37] In our view, the Divisional Court was correct in concluding that there 
  is a common law rule that excludes same-sex marriages. This court in <em>Iantsis 
  v. Papatheodorou</em>, [1971] 1 O.R. 245 at 248, adopted the Hyde formulation 
  of marriage as the union between a man and a woman. This understanding of the 
  common law definition of marriage is reflected in s. 1.1 of the <em>Modernization 
  of Benefits and Obligations Act</em>, which refers to the definition of marriage 
  as &#147;the lawful union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.&#148; 
  Further, there is no merit to the submission that <em>M. v. H.</em> overruled, by implication, 
  the common law definition of marriage. In <em>M. v. H.</em>, Iacobucci J. stated, at 
  p. 83:</p>
<p class="indent">This appeal does not challenge traditional conceptions of marriage, 
  as s. 29 of the [<em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3] expressly applies 
  to <span class="underline">unmarried</span> opposite-sex couples. <em>That being 
  said, I do not wish to be understood as making any comment on marriage or indeed 
  on related issues</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(2) Constitutional amendment</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[38] The <em>Constitution Act</em>,<em> 1867 </em>divides legislative powers 
  relating to marriage between the federal and provincial governments. The federal 
  government has exclusive jurisdiction over &#147;Marriage and Divorce&#148;: 
  s. 91(26). The provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the solemnization 
  of marriage: s. 92(12). </p>
<p>[39] The intervenor, The Association for Marriage and the Family in Ontario 
  (&#147;the Association&#148;), takes the position that the word &#147;marriage&#148;, 
  as used in the <em><em>Constitution Act, 1867</em></em>, is a constitutionally entrenched 
  term that refers to the legal definition of marriage that existed at Confederation. 
  The Association argues that the legal definition of marriage at Confederation 
  was the &#147;union of one man and one woman&#148;. As a constitutionally entrenched 
  term, this definition of marriage can be amended only through the formal constitutional 
  amendment procedures. As a consequence, neither the courts nor Parliament have 
  jurisdiction to reformulate the meaning of marriage. </p>
<p>[40] In the Divisional Court, LaForme J. rejected this argument. His analysis 
  was adopted by Smith A.C.J.S.C. and Blair R.S.J., as well as by the British 
  Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>EGALE Canada Inc</em>. None of the parties or 
  other intervenors supports the Association on this issue.</p>
<p>[41] In our view, the Association&#146;s constitutional amendment argument 
  is without merit for two reasons. First, whether same-sex couples can marry 
  is a matter of capacity. There can be no issue, nor was the contrary argued 
  before us, that Parliament has authority to make laws regarding the capacity 
  to marry. Such authority is found in s. 91(26) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. 
</p>
<p>[42] Second, to freeze the definition of marriage to whatever meaning it had 
  in 1867 is contrary to this country&#146;s jurisprudence of progressive constitutional 
  interpretation. This jurisprudence is rooted in Lord Sankey&#146;s words in 
  <em>Edwards v. A.G. Canada</em>, [1930] A.C. 124 at 136 (P.C.): &#147;The British 
  North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion 
  within its natural limits.&#148; Dickson J. reiterated the correctness of this 
  approach to constitutional interpretation in <em>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</em>, 
  [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145 at 155:</p>
<p class="indent">The task of expounding a constitution is crucially different 
  from that of construing a statute. A statute defines present rights and obligations. 
  It is easily enacted and as easily repealed. A constitution, by contrast, is 
  drafted with an eye to the future. Its function is to provide a continuing framework 
  for the legitimate exercise of governmental power and, when joined by a <em>Bill</em> 
  or a <em>Charter of Rights</em>, for the unremitting protection of individual 
  rights and liberties. Once enacted, its provisions cannot easily be repealed 
  or amended. It must, therefore, be capable of growth and development over time 
  to meet new social, political and historical realities often unimagined by its 
  framers. The judiciary is the guardian of the constitution and must, in interpreting 
  its provisions, bear these considerations in mind.</p>
<p>[43] In <em>Constitutional Law of Canada</em>, looseleaf (Scarborough: Carswell, 
  1997) at 15-43 to 15-44, Professor Peter W. Hogg explained that Canada has changed 
  a great deal since Confederation, and &#147;[t]he doctrine of progressive interpretation 
  is one of the means by which the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> has been able 
  to adapt to the changes in Canadian society.&#148;</p>
<p>[44] Under the doctrine of progressive interpretation, activities have been 
  included under ss. 91 and 92 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> that had 
  not previously been included. For example, s. 91(15) of the <em>Constitution 
  Act, 1867</em> gives the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over &#147;Banking, 
  Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money&#148;. In <em>A.G. Alberta 
  v. A.G. Canada</em>, [1947] A.C. 503 (P.C.), the province argued that certain 
  credit activities did not fall within the scope of s. 91(15) because &#147;banking&#148; 
  at the time of Confederation did not include these activities. The Privy Council, 
  in rejecting this argument, held that the term &#147;banking&#148; in s. 91(15) 
  is not confined to the extent and kind of business actually carried on by banks 
  in Canada in 1867.</p>
<p>[45] Similarly, in regard to the federal government&#146;s authority over &#147;The 
  Criminal Law&#148; under s. 91(27), the Privy Council in <em>P.A.T.A. v. A.G. 
  Canada</em>, [1931] A.C. 310, considered the constitutionality of federal legislative 
  provisions intended to protect against restraint of trade. Notwithstanding that 
  the impugned provisions criminalized activity that was not the subject of criminal 
  legislation in 1867, the Privy Council concluded that the legislation was<em> 
  intra vires</em> the federal government under its criminal law power. Lord Atkin, 
  writing the unanimous judgment, said at p. 324:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Criminal law&#148; means &#147;the criminal law in its widest sense&#148;....It 
  certainly is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any 
  Province in 1867. The power must extend to legislation to make new crimes.</p>
<p>[46] In our view, &#147;marriage&#148; does not have a constitutionally fixed 
  meaning. Rather, like the term &#147;banking&#148; in s. 91(15) and the phrase 
  &#147;criminal law&#148; in s. 91(27), the term &#147;marriage&#148; as used 
  in s. 91(26) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> has the constitutional flexibility 
  necessary to meet changing realities of Canadian society without the need for 
  recourse to constitutional amendment procedures. </p>
<p>[47] The Association also argues that the <em><em>Charter</em></em> cannot 
  be used to alter provisions of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and, accordingly, 
  cannot be the basis for amending the definition of marriage in s. 91(26). The 
  Association points to <em>Reference Re Bill 30, an Act to Amend the Education 
  Act (Ont.)</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R 1148 at 1197-98, where Wilson J. said: &#147;It 
  was never intended, in my opinion, that the <em>Charter</em> could be used to 
  invalidate other provisions of the Constitution&#148;. The Association also 
  relies on <em>New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the 
  House of Assembly)</em>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319 at 373, where McLachlin J. stated: 
  &#147;It is a basic rule...that one part of the Constitution cannot be abrogated 
  or diminished by another part of the Constitution&#148;. </p>
<p>[48] We do not agree with the Association&#146;s argument on this point. <em>Reference 
  Re Bill 30</em> dealt with the constitutional recognition accorded to minority 
  religious groups in regard to education. This express constitutional recognition 
  finds its root in the religious compromises achieved at Confederation. We are 
  of the view that, whatever compromises were negotiated to achieve the legislative 
  distribution of power relating to marriage, such compromises were not related 
  to constitutionally entrenching differential treatment between opposite-sex 
  and same-sex couples.</p>
<p>[49] The <em>Nova Scotia Speaker </em>case dealt with the decision of the legislature 
  of Nova Scotia to prohibit the televising of its proceedings. The Supreme Court 
  of Canada recognized that parliamentary privilege is necessary to ensure the 
  orderly operation of the legislature, and that this privilege includes the power 
  to exclude strangers from legislative chambers. A majority of the court held 
  that parliamentary privilege is part of the constitution of Canada, and therefore 
  not subject to <em><em>Charter</em></em> review. In our view, the exercise of 
  a constitutionally recognized parliamentary privilege to exclude strangers from 
  the legislature is not analogous to a law excluding persons from marriage. </p>
<p>[50] Accordingly, we do not accept the Association&#146;s submissions on this 
  issue.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(3) Cross-appeal by MCCT: religious rights under sections 
  2(a) and 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em><br>
  </strong> </p>
<p>[51] In its cross-appeal, MCCT takes the position that the common law definition 
  of marriage breaches its freedom of religion under s. 2(a) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> and 
  its right to be free from religious discrimination under s. 15(1). MCCT argues 
  that the common law definition of marriage is rooted in Christian values, as 
  propounded by the Anglican Church of England, which has never recognized same-sex 
  marriages. MCCT contends that this definition, therefore, has the unconstitutional 
  purpose of enforcing a particular religious view of marriage and excluding other 
  religious views of marriage. MCCT also contends that the common law definition 
  of marriage, which provides legal recognition and legitimacy to marriage ceremonies 
  that accord with one religious view of marriage, has the effect of diminishing 
  the status of other religious marriages. </p>
<p>[52] MCCT framed its argument this way in its factum:</p>
<p class="indent">There is no obligation on the law to recognize religious marriage as a legal 
  institution. However, once it decides to do so (as it has done), it cannot withhold 
  recognition to any religious marriage except in a constitutionally lawful manner.</p>
<p>[53] In our view, this case does not engage religious rights and freedoms. 
  Marriage is a legal institution, as well as a religious and a social institution. 
  This case is solely about the legal institution of marriage. It is not about 
  the religious validity or invalidity of various forms of marriage. We do not 
  view this case as, in any way, dealing or interfering with the religious institution 
  of marriage. </p>
<p>[54] Even if we were to see this case as engaging freedom of religion, it is 
  our view that MCCT has failed to establish a breach of s. 2(a) of the <em>Charter</em>. 
  In <em>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 at 336, Dickson 
  J. described freedom of religion in these terms:</p>
<p class="indent">The essence of the concept of freedom of religion is the right to entertain 
  such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs 
  openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest 
  religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination. </p>
<p>[55] Dickson J. then identified, at p. 337, the dual nature of the protection 
  encompassed by s. 2(a) as the absence of coercion and constraint, and the right 
  to manifest religious beliefs and practices. </p>
<p>[56] MCCT frames its submissions regarding s. 2(a) in terms of state coercion 
  and constraint. We disagree with MCCT&#146;s argument that, because the same-sex 
  religious marriage ceremonies it performs are not recognized for civil purposes, 
  it is constrained from performing these religious ceremonies or coerced into 
  performing opposite-sex marriage ceremonies only.</p>
<p>[57] In <em>Big M Drug Mart</em>, the impugned legislation prohibited all persons 
  from working on Sunday, a day when they would otherwise have been able to work. 
  Thus, the law required all persons to observe the Christian Sabbath. In sharp 
  contrast to the situation in <em>Big M Drug Mart</em>, the common law definition 
  of marriage does not oblige MCCT to abstain from doing anything. Nor does it 
  prevent the manifestation of any religious beliefs or practices. There is nothing 
  in the common law definition of marriage that obliges MCCT, directly or indirectly, 
  to stop performing marriage ceremonies that conform with its own religious teachings, 
  including same-sex marriages. Similarly, there is nothing in the common law 
  definition of marriage that obliges MCCT to perform only heterosexual marriages.</p>
<p>[58] MCCT also argues that the common law&#146;s failure to recognize the legal 
  validity of the same-sex marriages it performs constitutes a breach of its right 
  to be free from religious discrimination under s. 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em>. We consider 
  the impact of s. 15(1) on the common law definition of marriage in greater detail 
  in the next part of these reasons. For now, it appears clear to us that any 
  potential discrimination arising out of the differential treatment of same-sex 
  marriages performed by MCCT is based on sexual orientation. This differential 
  treatment is not based on the religious beliefs held by the same-sex couples 
  or by the institution performing the religious ceremony. For this reason, we 
  conclude that MCCT has failed to establish religious discrimination under s. 
  15(1).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(4) Section 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em><br>
  </strong></p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(a) Approach to section 15(1)<br>
  </strong> </p>
<p>[59] Section 15(1) of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> provides that &#147;[e]very individual is 
  equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and 
  equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without 
  discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, 
  age or mental or physical disability.&#148;</p>
<p>[60] In <em>Law</em>, Iacobucci J., writing for a unanimous court, described 
  the purpose of s. 15(1) in the following terms, at p. 529:</p>
<p class="indent">It may be said that the purpose of s. 15(1) is to prevent the violation of 
  essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, 
  stereotyping, or political or social prejudice, and to promote a society in 
  which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members 
  of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect 
  and consideration.</p>
<p>[61] Iacobucci J. emphasized that a s. 15(1) violation will be found to exist 
  only where the impugned law conflicts with the purpose of s. 15(1). The determination 
  of whether such a conflict exists must be approached in a purposive and contextual 
  manner: <em>Law</em> at 525. To that end, Iacobucci J. articulated a three-stage 
  inquiry, at pp. 548-49:</p>
<p class="indent">(A) Does the impugned law (a) draw a formal distinction between 
  the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics, 
  or (b) fail to take into account the claimant's already disadvantaged position 
  within Canadian society resulting in substantively differential treatment between 
  the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics?</p>
<p class="indent">(B) Is the claimant subject to differential treatment based 
  on one or more enumerated and analogous grounds?</p>
<p class="indent">and</p>
<p class="indent">(C) Does the differential treatment discriminate, by imposing 
  a burden upon or withholding a benefit from the claimant in a manner which reflects 
  the stereotypical application of presumed group or personal characteristics, 
  or which otherwise has the effect of perpetuating or promoting the view that 
  the individual is less capable or worthy of recognition or value as a human 
  being or as a member of Canadian society, equally deserving of concern, respect, 
  and consideration?</p>
<p>The claimant has the burden of establishing each of these factors on a balance 
  of probabilities.</p>
<p class="indent10"> <strong>(b) The existence of differential treatment</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[62] The first stage of the s. 15(1) inquiry requires the court to determine 
  whether the impugned law: (a) draws a formal distinction between the claimant 
  and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics; or (b) fails 
  to take into account the claimant's already disadvantaged position within Canadian 
  society resulting in substantively differential treatment between the claimant 
  and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics.</p>
<p>[63] This stage of the inquiry recognizes that the equality guarantee in s. 
  15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> is a comparative concept. As explained by Iacobucci 
  J. in <em>Law</em> at 531:</p>
<p class="indent">The object of a s. 15(1) analysis is not to determine equality in the abstract; 
  it is to determine whether the impugned legislation creates differential treatment 
  between the claimant and others on the basis of enumerated or analogous grounds, 
  which results in discrimination. </p>
<p>[64] Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the relevant comparator group 
  in order to determine whether the claimants are the subject of differential 
  treatment. Generally speaking, the claimants choose the group with whom they 
  wish to be compared for the purpose of the discrimination inquiry: <em>Law</em> 
  at 532.</p>
<p>[65] In this case, the Couples submit that the common law definition of marriage 
  draws a formal distinction between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples 
  on the basis of their sexual orientation. Opposite-sex couples have the legal 
  capacity to marry; same-sex couples do not.</p>
<p>[66] The AGC submits that marriage, as an institution, does not produce a distinction 
  between opposite-sex and same-sex couples. The word &#147;marriage&#148; is 
  a descriptor of a unique opposite-sex bond that is common across different times, 
  cultures and religions as a virtually universal norm. Marriage is not a common 
  law concept; rather, it is a historical and worldwide institution that pre-dates 
  our legal framework. The Canadian common law captured the definition of marriage 
  by attaching benefits and obligations to the marriage relationship. Accordingly, 
  it is not the definition of marriage itself that is the source of the differential 
  treatment. Rather, the individual pieces of legislation that provide the authority 
  for the distribution of government benefits and obligations are the source of 
  the differential treatment. Moreover, since the enactment of the <em>Modernization 
  of Benefits and Obligations Act</em>, same-sex couples receive substantive equal 
  benefit and protection of the federal law.</p>
<p>[67] In our view, the AGC&#146;s argument must be rejected for several reasons. 
</p>
<p>[68] First, the only issue to be decided at this stage of the s. 15(1) analysis 
  is whether a distinction is made. The fact that the common law adopted, rather 
  than invented, the opposite-sex feature of marriage is irrelevant. In <em>Vriend 
  v. Alberta</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493 at 543-44, Cory J. stated:</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he respondents&#146; contention that the distinction is not 
  created by law, but rather exists independently of [Alberta&#146;s <em>Individual&#146;s 
  Rights Protection Act</em>, R.S.A. 1980, c. I-2] in society, cannot be accepted&#133;.It 
  is not necessary to find that the legislation <span class="underline">creates</span> 
  the discrimination existing in society in order to determine that it creates 
  a potentially discriminatory distinction.</p>
<p>[69] Second, Canadian governments chose to give legal recognition to marriage. 
  Parliament and the provincial legislatures have built a myriad of rights and 
  obligations around the institution of marriage. The provincial legislatures 
  provide licensing and registration regimes so that the marriages of opposite-sex 
  couples can be formally recognized by law. Same-sex couples are denied access 
  to those licensing and registration regimes. That denial constitutes a formal 
  distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex couples. The words of La Forest 
  J. in <em>Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 
  624 at 678 are instructive:</p>
<p class="indent">This Court has repeatedly held that once the state does provide a benefit, 
  it is obliged to do so in a non-discriminatory manner&#133;.In many circumstances, 
  this will require governments to take positive action, for example by extending 
  the scope of a benefit to a previously excluded class of persons [citations 
  omitted].</p>
<p>[70] Third, whether a formal distinction is part of the definition itself or 
  derives from some other source does not change the fact that a distinction has 
  been made. If marriage were defined as &#147;a union between one man and one 
  woman of the Protestant faith&#148;, surely the definition would be drawing 
  a formal distinction between Protestants and all other persons. Persons of other 
  religions and persons with no religious affiliation would be excluded. Similarly, 
  if marriage were defined as &#147;a union between two white persons&#148;, there 
  would be a distinction between white persons and all other racial groups. In 
  this respect, an analogy can be made to the anti-miscegenation laws that were 
  declared unconstitutional in <em>Loving v. Virginia</em>, 388 U.S. 1 (1967) 
  because they distinguished on racial grounds.</p>
<p>[71] Fourth, an argument that marriage is heterosexual because it &#147;just 
  is&#148; amounts to circular reasoning. It sidesteps the entire s. 15(1) analysis. 
  It is the opposite-sex component of marriage that is under scrutiny. The proper 
  approach is to examine the impact of the opposite-sex requirement on same-sex 
  couples to determine whether defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution 
  is discriminatory: see <em>Miron v. Trudel</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418 at 488-93 
  per McLachlin J. </p>
<p>[72] Accordingly, in our view, there is no doubt that the common law definition 
  of marriage creates a formal distinction between opposite-sex couples and same-sex 
  couples on the basis of their sexual orientation. The first stage of the s. 
  15(1) inquiry has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent10"> <strong>(c) Differential treatment on an enumerated or analogous 
  ground</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[73] The second stage of the s. 15(1) inquiry asks whether the differential 
  treatment identified under stage one of the inquiry is based on an enumerated 
  or analogous ground. </p>
<p>[74] In <em>Egan</em> at 528, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized sexual 
  orientation as an analogous ground, observing that sexual orientation is a &#147;deeply 
  personal characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable 
  personal costs&#148;.</p>
<p>[75] In this case, the AGC properly conceded that, if this court determined 
  that marriage imposes differential treatment, then sexual orientation, as an 
  analogous ground, is the basis for such differential treatment.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p>[76] Accordingly, stage two of the s. 15(1) inquiry has been met.</p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(d) The existence of discrimination</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[77] The third stage of the s. 15(1) inquiry requires the court to determine 
  whether the differential treatment imposes a burden upon, or withholds a benefit 
  from, the claimants in a manner that reflects the stereotypical application 
  of presumed group or personal characteristics, or that otherwise has the effect 
  of perpetuating or promoting the view that the individual is less capable or 
  worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society, 
  equally deserving of concern, respect, and consideration.</p>
<p>[78] This stage of the inquiry in the s. 15(1) analysis is concerned with substantive 
  equality, not formal equality: <em>Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General)</em>, 
  2002 SCC 84 at para. 22. The emphasis is on human dignity. In Law at 530, Iacobucci 
  J. elaborated on the meaning and importance of respecting human dignity, particularly 
  within the framework of equality rights:</p>
<p class="indent">Human dignity means that an individual or group feels self-respect 
  and self-worth. It is concerned with physical and psychological integrity and 
  empowerment. Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal 
  traits or circumstances which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, 
  or merits. It is enhanced by laws which are sensitive to the needs, capacities, 
  and merits of different individuals, taking into account the context underlying 
  their differences. Human dignity is harmed when individuals and groups are marginalized, 
  ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced when laws recognize the full place of 
  all individuals and groups within Canadian society. Human dignity within the 
  meaning of the equality guarantee does not relate to the status or position 
  of an individual in society <em>per se</em>, but rather concerns the manner 
  in which a person legitimately feels when confronted with a particular law. 
  Does the law treat him or her unfairly, taking into account all of the circumstances 
  regarding the individuals affected and excluded by the law?</p>
<p>[79] The assessment of whether a law has the effect of demeaning a claimant&#146;s 
  dignity should be undertaken from a subjective-objective perspective. The relevant 
  point of view is not solely that of a &#147;reasonable person&#148;, but that 
  of a &#147;reasonable person, dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances, 
  possessed of similar attributes to, and under similar circumstances as, the 
  group of which the rights claimant is a member&#148;: <em>Egan</em> at 553; 
  <em>Law</em> at 533-34. This requires a court to consider the individual&#146;s 
  or group&#146;s traits, history, and circumstances in order to evaluate whether 
  a reasonable person, in circumstances similar to the claimant, would find that 
  the impugned law differentiates in a manner that demeans his or her dignity:<em> 
  Law </em>at 533.</p>
<p>[80] The court is required to examine both the purpose and effects of the law 
  in question. It is clear that a law that has a discriminatory purpose cannot 
  survive s. 15(1) scrutiny. However, a discriminatory purpose is not a requirement 
  for a successful s. 15(1) challenge; it is enough for the claimant to demonstrate 
  a discriminatory effect. As stated in <em>Law</em> at 535:</p>
<p class="indent">[A]ny demonstration by a claimant that a legislative provision 
  or other state action has<em> the effect </em>of perpetuating or promoting the 
  view that the individual is less capable, or less worthy of recognition or value 
  as a human being or as a member of Canadian society&#133;will suffice to establish 
  an infringement of s. 15(1). [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[81] In Law at 550-52, Iacobucci J. identified four contextual factors that 
  a claimant may reference in order to demonstrate that the impugned law demeans 
  his or her dignity in purpose or effect. The list of factors is not closed and 
  not all of the factors will be relevant in every case. The four factors identified 
  by Iacobucci J. are examined below.</p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(i) Pre-existing disadvantage, stereotyping or vulnerability 
  of the claimants</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[82] The first contextual factor to be examined is the existence of a pre-existing 
  disadvantage, stereotyping, prejudice or vulnerability experienced by the individual 
  or group at issue. While this contextual factor is not determinative, it is 
  &#147;probably the most compelling factor favouring a conclusion that differential 
  treatment imposed by legislation is truly discriminatory&#148;: <em>Law</em> 
  at 534. As explained by Iacobucci J., at pp. 534-35:</p>
<p class="indent">These factors are relevant because, to the extent that the claimant is already 
  subject to unfair circumstances or treatment in society by virtue of personal 
  characteristics or circumstances, persons like him or her have often not been 
  given equal concern, respect, and consideration. It is logical to conclude that, 
  in most cases, further differential treatment will contribute to the perpetuation 
  or promotion of their unfair social characterization, and will have a more severe 
  impact upon them, since they are already vulnerable.</p>
<p>[83] The disadvantages and vulnerability experienced by gay men, lesbians and 
  same-sex couples were described by Cory J. in Egan at 600-602:</p>
<p class="indent">The historic disadvantage suffered by homosexual persons has been widely recognized 
  and documented. Public harassment and verbal abuse of homosexual individuals 
  is not uncommon. Homosexual women and men have been the victims of crimes of 
  violence directed at them specifically because of their sexual orientation&#133;.They 
  have been discriminated against in their employment and their access to services. 
  They have been excluded from some aspects of public life solely because of their 
  sexual orientation&#133;.The stigmatization of homosexual persons and the hatred 
  which some members of the public have expressed towards them has forced many 
  homosexuals to conceal their orientation. This imposes its own associated costs 
  in the work place, the community and in private life.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Homosexual couples as well as homosexual individuals have suffered greatly 
  as a result of discrimination. Sexual orientation is more than simply a &quot;status&quot; 
  that an individual possesses. It is something that is demonstrated in an individual's 
  conduct by the choice of a partner&#133;.[S]tudies serve to confirm overwhelmingly 
  that homosexuals, whether as individuals or couples, form an identifiable minority 
  who have suffered and continue to suffer serious social, political and economic 
  disadvantage.</p>
<p>See also Vriend at 543; M v. H. at 52-55.</p>
<p>[84] The AGC acknowledges that gay men and lesbians have been recognized as 
  a disadvantaged group in Canada. It emphasizes, however, that historical disadvantage 
  is not presumed to embody discrimination. It points to the Supreme Court of 
  Canada&#146;s recent decision in <em>Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh</em>, 
  2002 SCC 83, where, despite the fact that cohabiting common law couples have 
  been recognized as a historically disadvantaged group, the court found that 
  the impugned law was not discriminatory. </p>
<p>[85] We agree that the existence of historical disadvantage is not presumptive 
  of discrimination. In <em>Law</em> at 536, Iacobucci J. stated:</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, I also do not wish to suggest that the claimant's 
  association with a group which has historically been more disadvantaged will 
  be conclusive of a violation under s. 15(1), where differential treatment has 
  been established. This <span class="underline">may</span> be the result, but 
  whether or not it is the result will depend upon the circumstances of the case 
  and, in particular, upon whether or not the distinction truly affects the dignity 
  of the claimant. There is no principle or evidentiary presumption that differential 
  treatment for historically disadvantaged persons is discriminatory. </p>
<p>[86] However, as previously stated, Iacobucci J. also made it clear that historical 
  disadvantage is a strong indicator of discrimination: see <em>Law</em> at 534-35. 
  Therefore, the historical disadvantage suffered by same-sex couples favours 
  a finding of discrimination in this case. </p>
<p>[87] Furthermore, we note that in <em>Walsh</em> the court determined that 
  the impugned legislation was not discriminatory because the distinction the 
  legislation created between married couples and common law couples respected 
  the liberty interest of individuals to make fundamental choices regarding their 
  lives. Bastarache J. stated, at para. 63:</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, it is important to note that the discriminatory aspect of the legislative 
  distinction must be determined in light of <em><em>Charter</em></em> values. One of those essential 
  values is liberty, basically defined as the absence of coercion and the ability 
  to make fundamental choices with regard to one's life&#133;.Limitations imposed 
  by this Court that serve to restrict this freedom of choice among persons in 
  conjugal relationships would be contrary to our notions of liberty.</p>
<p>In this case, the common law requirement that persons who marry be of the opposite 
  sex denies persons in same-sex relationships a fundamental choice &#150; whether 
  or not to marry their partner. </p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(ii) Correspondence between the grounds and the claimant&#146;s 
  actual needs, capacities or circumstances<br>
  </strong> </p>
<p>[88] The second contextual factor is the correspondence, or lack thereof, between 
  the grounds on which the claim is based and the actual needs, capacities or 
  circumstances of the claimant or others with similar traits: Law at 537, 551. 
  As illustrated in<em> Eaton v. Brant County Board of Education</em>, [1997] 
  1 S.C.R. 241, legislation that accommodates the actual needs, capacities and 
  circumstances of the claimants is less likely to demean dignity. </p>
<p>[89] The AGC submits that marriage relates to the capacities, needs and circumstances 
  of opposite-sex couples. The concept of marriage - across time, societies and 
  legal cultures - is that of an institution to facilitate, shelter and nurture 
  the unique union of a man and woman who, together, have the possibility to bear 
  children from their relationship and shelter them within it. </p>
<p>[90] We cannot accept the AGC&#146;s argument for several reasons.</p>
<p>[91] First, it is important to remember that the purpose and effects of the 
  impugned law must at all times be viewed from the perspective of the claimant. 
  The question to be asked is whether the law takes into account the actual needs, 
  capacities and circumstances of same-sex couples, not whether the law takes 
  into account the needs, capacities and circumstances of opposite-sex couples. 
  In <em>Law</em> at 538, Iacobucci J. cautioned that &#147;[t]he fact that the 
  impugned legislation may achieve a valid social purpose for one group of individuals 
  cannot function to deny an equality claim where the effects of the legislation 
  upon another person or group conflict with the purpose of the s. 15(1) guarantee.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[92] Second, the AGC&#146;s argument on this point is more appropriately considered 
  in the context of a s. 1 justification analysis. We find the comments of Bastarache 
  J. in <em>Lavoie v. Canada</em>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 769 at 809-10 to be apposite:</p>
<p class="indent">In measuring the appellants&#146; subjective experience of discrimination 
  against an objective standard, it is crucial not to elide the distinction between 
  the claimant's onus to establish a <em>prima facie</em> s. 15(1) violation and 
  the state's onus to justify such a violation under s. 1. Section 15(1) requires 
  the claimant to show that her human dignity and/or freedom is adversely affected. 
  The concepts of dignity and freedom are not amorphous and, in my view, do not 
  invite the kind of balancing of individual against state interest that is required 
  under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. On the contrary, the subjective inquiry 
  into human dignity requires the claimant to provide a rational foundation for 
  her experience of discrimination in the sense that a reasonable person similarly 
  situated would share that experience. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, the government's burden under s. 1 is to <span class="underline">justify</span> 
  a breach of human dignity, not to explain it or deny its existence. This justification 
  may be established by the practical, moral, economic, or social underpinnings 
  of the legislation in question, or by the need to protect other rights and values 
  embodied in the <em><em>Charter</em></em>. It may further be established based 
  on the requirements of proportionality, that is, whether the interest pursued 
  by the legislation outweighs its impact on human dignity and freedom. However, 
  the exigencies of public policy do not undermine the prima facie legitimacy 
  of an equality claim. <em>A law is not &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; simply 
  because it pursues a pressing objective or impairs equality rights as little 
  as possible. Much less is it &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; because it reflects 
  an international consensus as to the appropriate limits on equality rights. 
  While these are highly relevant considerations at the s. 1 stage, the suggestion 
  that governments should be encouraged if not required to counter the claimant's 
  s. 15(1) argument with public policy arguments is highly misplaced. Section 
  15(1) requires us to define the scope of the individual right to equality, not 
  to balance that right against societal values and interests or other Charter 
  rights</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[93] Third, a law that prohibits same-sex couples from marrying does not accord 
  with the needs, capacities and circumstances of same-sex couples. While it is 
  true that, due to biological realities, only opposite-sex couples can &#147;naturally&#148; 
  procreate, same-sex couples can choose to have children by other means, such 
  as adoption, surrogacy and donor insemination. An increasing percentage of children 
  are being conceived and raised by same-sex couples: <em>M. v. H.</em> at 75. </p>
<p>[94] Importantly, no one, including the AGC, is suggesting that procreation 
  and childrearing are the only purposes of marriage, or the only reasons why 
  couples choose to marry. Intimacy, companionship, societal recognition, economic 
  benefits, the blending of two families, to name a few, are other reasons that 
  couples choose to marry. As recognized in <em>M. v. H.</em> at 50, same-sex couples are 
  capable of forming &#147;long, lasting, loving and intimate relationships.&#148; 
  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry perpetuates the contrary view, namely, 
  that same-sex couples are not capable of forming loving and lasting relationships, 
  and thus same-sex relationships are not worthy of the same respect and recognition 
  as opposite-sex relationships.</p>
<p>[95] Accordingly, in our view, the common law requirement that marriage be 
  between persons of the opposite sex does not accord with the needs, capacities 
  and circumstances of same-sex couples. This factor weighs in favour of a finding 
  of discrimination.</p>
<strong><p class="indent10">(iii) Ameliorative purpose or effects on more disadvantaged 
  individuals or groups in society<br>
</p>
</strong>
<p>[96] The third contextual factor to be considered is whether the impugned law 
  has an ameliorative purpose or effect upon a more disadvantaged person or group 
  in society. The question to be asked is whether the group that has been excluded 
  from the scope of the ameliorative law is in a more advantaged position than 
  the person coming within the scope of the law. In <em>Law</em> at 539, Iacobucci 
  J. emphasized that &#147;[u]nderinclusive ameliorative legislation that excludes 
  from its scope the members of a historically disadvantaged group will rarely 
  escape the charge of discrimination&#148;. </p>
<p>[97] The AGC cites La Forest J. in <em>Egan</em> at 539 for the proposition 
  that, since opposite-sex couples raise the vast majority of children, supporting 
  opposite-sex relationships &#147;does not exacerbate an historic disadvantage; 
  rather it ameliorates an historic economic disadvantage&#148;.</p>
<p>[98] We do not accept the AGC&#146;s submission. The critical question to be 
  asked in relation to this contextual factor is whether opposite-sex couples 
  are in a more disadvantaged position than same-sex couples. As previously stated, 
  same-sex couples are a group who have experienced historical discrimination 
  and disadvantages. There is no question that opposite-sex couples are the more 
  advantaged group. </p>
<p>[99] In our view, any economic disadvantage that may arise from raising children 
  is only one of many factors to be considered in the context of marriage. Persons 
  do not marry solely for the purpose of raising children. Furthermore, since 
  same-sex couples also raise children, it cannot be assumed that they do not 
  share that economic disadvantage. Accordingly, if alleviating economic disadvantages 
  for opposite-sex couples due to childrearing were to be considered an ameliorative 
  purpose for the opposite-sex requirement in marriage, we would find the law 
  to be underinclusive. The principle from <em>Law</em> that &#147;[u]nderinclusive 
  ameliorative legislation that excludes from its scope the members of a historically 
  disadvantaged group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination&#148; would 
  be applicable.</p>
<strong><p class="indent10">(iv) Nature of the interest affected<br>
</p>
</strong>
<p>[100] The fourth contextual factor to be examined is the nature of the interest 
  affected by the impugned law. The more severe and localized the effect of the 
  law on the affected group, the greater the likelihood that the law is discriminatory: 
  <em>Egan</em> at 556; <em>Law</em> at 540.</p>
<p>[101] In Law at 540, the court adopted L&#146;Heureux-Dub&eacute; J.&#146;s 
  description of this factor in <em>Egan</em>, where she emphasized that s. 15(1) 
  of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> protects more than &#147;economic rights&#148;. 
  She stated, at p.556:</p>
<p class="indent">Although a search for economic prejudice may be a convenient 
  means to begin a s. 15 inquiry, a conscientious inquiry must not stop here. 
  The discriminatory calibre of a particular distinction cannot be fully appreciated 
  without also evaluating the constitutional and societal significance of the 
  interest(s) adversely affected. <em>Other important considerations involve determining 
  whether the distinction somehow restricts access to a fundamental social institution</em>, 
  or affects a basic aspect of full membership in Canadian society (e.g. voting, 
  mobility). Finally, <em>does the distinction constitute a complete non-recognition 
  of a particular group?</em> It stands to reason that a group's interests will 
  be more adversely affected in cases involving complete exclusion or non-recognition 
  than in cases where the legislative distinction <span class="underline">does</span> 
  recognize or accommodate the group, but does so in a manner that is simply more 
  restrictive than some would like. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[102] The AGC submits that the existence of the <em>Modernization of Benefits 
  and Obligations Act</em> precludes a finding of discrimination. With this Act, 
  Parliament amended 68 federal statutes in order to give same-sex couples the 
  same benefits and obligations as opposite-sex couples. The AGC also points to 
  recent amendments to provincial legislation that similarly extended benefits 
  to same-sex couples. As a result, same-sex couples are afforded equal treatment 
  under the law.</p>
<p>[103] In our view, the AGC&#146;s submission must be rejected. </p>
<p>[104] First, we do not agree that same-sex couples are afforded equal treatment 
  under the law with respect to benefits and obligations. In many instances, benefits 
  and obligations do not attach until the same-sex couple has been cohabiting 
  for a specified period of time. Conversely, married couples have instant access 
  to all benefits and obligations.</p>
<p>[105] Additionally, not all benefits and obligations have been extended to 
  cohabiting couples. For example, in <em>Walsh</em> the Supreme Court of Canada 
  upheld Nova Scotia&#146;s legislation that provides only married persons with 
  equalization of net family property upon breakdown of the relationship. Ontario&#146;s 
  <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, similarly excludes cohabiting 
  opposite-sex and same-sex couples from equalization of net family property. 
  Opposite-sex couples are able to gain access to this legislation as they can 
  choose to marry. Same-sex couples are denied access because they are prohibited 
  from marrying. </p>
<p>[106] Second, the AGC&#146;s submission takes too narrow a view of the s. 15(1) 
  equality guarantee. As the passage cited from <em>Egan</em> indicates, s. 15(1) 
  guarantees more than equal access to economic benefits. One must also consider 
  whether persons and groups have been excluded from fundamental societal institutions. 
  A similar view was expressed by Cory J. in <em>M. v. H.</em> at 53:</p>
<p class="indent">The respondent H. has argued that the differential treatment 
  imposed by s. 29 of the [<em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3] does 
  not deny the respondent M. the equal benefit of the law since same-sex spouses 
  are not being denied an economic benefit, but simply the opportunity to gain 
  access to a court-enforced process. Such an analysis takes too narrow a view 
  of &quot;benefit&quot; under the law. It is a view this Court should not adopt. 
  The type of benefit salient to the s. 15(1) analysis cannot encompass only the 
  conferral of an economic benefit. It must also include access to a process that 
  could confer an economic or other benefit. . . . </p>
<p>[107] In this case, same-sex couples are excluded from a fundamental societal 
  institution &#150; marriage. The societal significance of marriage, and the 
  corresponding benefits that are available only to married persons, cannot be 
  overlooked. Indeed, all parties are in agreement that marriage is an important 
  and fundamental institution in Canadian society. It is for that reason that 
  the claimants wish to have access to the institution. Exclusion perpetuates 
  the view that same-sex relationships are less worthy of recognition than opposite-sex 
  relationships. In doing so, it offends the dignity of persons in same-sex relationships.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(v) Conclusion</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[108] Based on the foregoing analysis, it is our view that the dignity of persons 
  in same-sex relationships is violated by the exclusion of same-sex couples from 
  the institution of marriage. Accordingly, we conclude that the common-law definition 
  of marriage as &#147;the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to 
  the exclusion of all others&#148; violates s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. The next 
  step is to determine whether this violation can be justified under s. 1 of the 
  <em><em>Charter</em></em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(5) Reasonable limits under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em><br>
  </strong></p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(a) The necessity of a s. 1 analysis<br>
  </strong> </p>
<p>[109] Section 1 of the <em><em>Charter</em></em> provides:</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> guarantees 
  the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits 
  prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic 
  society.</p>
<p>[110] In this case, the parties agree that the common law requirement that 
  marriage be between two persons of the opposite sex is &#147;prescribed by law&#148;: 
  see <em>Swain</em> at 979. However, the Couples submit that a s. 1 analysis 
  is not required because this case concerns a challenge to a common law or &#147;judge-made&#148; 
  rule rather than a legislative provision. Relying on <em>Swain</em> at 978, 
  the Couples submit that the court may proceed to cure the <em><em>Charter</em></em> 
  infringement by fashioning a new rule that complies with constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>[111] While it may not be strictly necessary to consider the application of 
  s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>, we find the words of Lamer C.J.C. in Swain at 979-80 to 
  be compelling:</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Oakes</em> test provides a familiar structure through 
  which the objectives of the common law rule can be kept in focus and alternative 
  means of attaining these objectives can be considered. Furthermore, the constitutional 
  questions were stated with s. 1 in mind. While this is not, in and of itself, 
  determinative, the Court has had the benefit of considered argument under s. 
  1 both from the immediate parties and from a number of interveners. In my view, 
  it would be both appropriate and helpful for the Court to take advantage of 
  these submissions in considering the objective of the existing rule and in considering 
  whether an alternative common law rule could be fashioned&#133;.</p>
<p>[112] Further, since marriage is the foundation for a myriad of government 
  benefits, and since Parliament &#147;confirmed&#148; the opposite-sex definition 
  of marriage in s. 1.1 of the <em>Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act</em>, 
  we consider a s. 1 justification analysis to be appropriate. We also note that, 
  during oral argument, counsel for the Couples conceded that it would be suitable 
  for this court to conduct the s. 1 inquiry.</p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(b) Approach to section 1</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[113] In <em>R. v. Oakes</em>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103 at 138-39, Dickson C.J.C. 
  formulated the test for determining whether a law is a reasonable limit on a 
  <em><em>Charter</em></em> right or freedom in a free and democratic society. 
  The party seeking to uphold the impugned law has the burden of proving on a 
  balance of probabilities that:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The objective of the law is pressing and substantial; and 
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The means chosen to achieve the objective are reasonable 
  and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. This requires:</p>
<p class="indent15">(A) The rights violation to be rationally connected to the 
  objective of the law; </p>
<p class="indent15">(B) The impugned law to minimally impair the <em>Charter</em> guarantee; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent15">(C) Proportionality between the effect of the law and its 
  objective so that the attainment of the objective is not outweighed by the abridgement 
  of the right.</p>
<p>See<em> Eldridge</em> at 684; <em>Vriend</em> at 554.</p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(c) Pressing and substantial objective</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[114] The first stage of the <em>Oakes</em> test involves a two-step process: 
  (i) the objective(s) of the impugned law must be determined; and (ii) the objective(s) 
  of the impugned law must be evaluated to see if they are capable of justifying 
  limitations on <em>Charter</em> rights: <em>Sauv&eacute; v. Canada (Chief Electoral 
  Officer)</em>, 2002 SCC 68 at para. 20.</p>
<p>[115] When a law has been found to violate the <em>Charter</em> due to underinclusion, 
  both the objective of the law as a whole and the objective of the exclusion 
  must be considered: <em>Vriend</em> at 554-55; <em>M. v. H.</em> at 62.</p>
<p>[116] The AGC submits that marriage, as a core foundational unit, benefits 
  society at large in that it has proven itself to be one of the most durable 
  institutions for the organization of society. Marriage has always been understood 
  as a special kind of monogamous opposite-sex union, with spiritual, social, 
  economic and contractual dimensions, for the purposes of uniting the opposite 
  sexes, encouraging the birth and raising of children of the marriage, and companionship.</p>
<p>[117] No one is disputing that marriage is a fundamental societal institution. 
  Similarly, it is accepted that, with limited exceptions, marriage has been understood 
  to be a monogamous opposite-sex union. What needs to be determined, however, 
  is whether there is a valid objective to maintaining marriage as an exclusively 
  heterosexual institution. Stating that marriage is heterosexual because it always 
  has been heterosexual is merely an explanation for the opposite-sex requirement 
  of marriage; it is not an objective that is capable of justifying the infringement 
  of a <em>Charter</em> guarantee.</p>
<p>[118] We now turn to the more specific purposes of marriage advanced by the 
  AGC: (i) uniting the opposite sexes; (ii) encouraging the birth and raising 
  of children of the marriage; and (iii) companionship.</p>
<p>[119] The first purpose, which results in favouring one form of relationship 
  over another, suggests that uniting two persons of the same sex is of lesser 
  importance. The words of Dickson C.J.C. in Oakes at 136 are instructive in this 
  regard:</p>
<p class="indent">The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and 
  democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the 
  inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, 
  accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, 
  and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation 
  of individuals and groups in society. The underlying values and principles of 
  a free and democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed 
  by the <em>Charter</em> and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or 
  freedom must be shown, despite its effect, to be reasonable and demonstrably 
  justified.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a purpose that demeans the dignity of same-sex couples is contrary 
  to the values of a free and democratic society and cannot be considered to be 
  pressing and substantial. A law cannot be justified on the very basis upon which 
  it is being attacked: <em>Big M Drug Mart </em>at 352. </p>
<p>[120] The second purpose of marriage, as advanced by the AGC, is encouraging 
  the birth and raising of children. Clearly, encouraging procreation and childrearing 
  is a laudable goal that is properly regarded as pressing and substantial. However, 
  the AGC must demonstrate that the objective of maintaining marriage as an exclusively 
  heterosexual institution is pressing and substantial: see <em>Vriend</em> at 
  554-57.</p>
<p>[121] We fail to see how the encouragement of procreation and childrearing 
  is a pressing and substantial objective of maintaining marriage as an exclusively 
  heterosexual institution. Heterosexual married couples will not stop having 
  or raising children because same-sex couples are permitted to marry. Moreover, 
  an increasing percentage of children are being born to and raised by same-sex 
  couples. </p>
<p>[122] The AGC submits that the union of two persons of the opposite sex is 
  the only union that can &#147;naturally&#148; procreate. In terms of that biological 
  reality, same-sex couples are different from opposite-sex couples. In our view, 
  however, &#147;natural&#148; procreation is not a sufficiently pressing and 
  substantial objective to justify infringing the equality rights of same-sex 
  couples. As previously stated, same-sex couples can have children by other means, 
  such as adoption, surrogacy and donor insemination. A law that aims to encourage 
  only &#147;natural&#148; procreation ignores the fact that same-sex couples 
  are capable of having children. </p>
<p>[123] Similarly, a law that restricts marriage to opposite-sex couples, on 
  the basis that a fundamental purpose of marriage is the raising of children, 
  suggests that same-sex couples are not equally capable of childrearing. The 
  AGC has put forward no evidence to support such a proposition. Neither is the 
  AGC advocating such a view; rather, it takes the position that social science 
  research is not capable of establishing the proposition one way or another. 
  In the absence of cogent evidence, it is our view that the objective is based 
  on a stereotypical assumption that is not acceptable in a free and democratic 
  society that prides itself on promoting equality and respect for all persons. 
</p>
<p>[124] The third purpose of marriage advanced by the AGC is companionship. We 
  consider companionship to be a laudable goal of marriage. However, encouraging 
  companionship cannot be considered a pressing and substantial objective of the 
  <em>omission</em> of the impugned law. Encouraging companionship between only 
  persons of the opposite sex perpetuates the view that persons in same-sex relationships 
  are not equally capable of providing companionship and forming lasting and loving 
  relationships. </p>
<p>[125] Accordingly, it is our view that the AGC has not demonstrated any pressing 
  and substantial objective for excluding same-sex couples from the institution 
  of marriage. For that reason, we conclude that the violation of the Couples&#146; 
  rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> cannot be saved under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p class="indent10"><strong>(d) Proportionality analysis</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[126] Our conclusion under the first stage of the <em>Oakes</em> test makes 
  it unnecessary to consider the second stage of the test. However, as has become 
  the norm, we will go on to briefly consider the remainder of the test. </p>
<p class="indent15"><strong>(i) Rational Connection</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[127] Under the rational connection component of the proportionality analysis, 
  the party seeking to uphold the impugned law must demonstrate that the rights 
  violation is rationally connected to the objective, in the sense that the exclusion 
  of same-sex couples from marriage is required to encourage procreation, childrearing 
  and companionship. </p>
<p>[128] The AGC submits that the rational connection for the opposite-sex nature 
  of marriage is &#147;self-evident&#148;, considering its universality and its 
  effectiveness in bringing the two sexes together, in sheltering children, and 
  in providing a stable institution for society. </p>
<p>[129] The difficulty with the AGC&#146;s submission is its focus. It is not 
  disputed that marriage has been a stabilizing and effective societal institution. 
  The Couples are not seeking to abolish the institution of marriage; they are 
  seeking access to it. Thus, the task of the AGC is not to show how marriage 
  has benefited society as a whole, which we agree is self-evident, but to demonstrate 
  that maintaining marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution is rationally 
  connected to the objectives of marriage, which in our view is <em>not</em> self-evident.</p>
<p>[130] First, the AGC has not shown that the opposite-sex requirement in marriage 
  is rationally connected to the encouragement of procreation and childrearing. 
  The law is both overinclusive and underinclusive. The ability to &#147;naturally&#148; 
  procreate and the willingness to raise children are not prerequisites of marriage 
  for opposite-sex couples. Indeed, many opposite-sex couples that marry are unable 
  to have children or choose not to do so. Simultaneously, the law is underinclusive 
  because it excludes same-sex couples that have and raise children.</p>
<p>[131] Second, the AGC has not demonstrated that companionship is rationally 
  connected to the exclusion of same-sex couples. Gay men and lesbians are as 
  capable of providing companionship to their same-sex partners as persons in 
  opposite-sex relationships.</p>
<p>[132] Accordingly, if we were of the view that the objectives advanced by the 
  AGC were pressing and substantial, we would conclude that the objectives are 
  not rationally connected to the opposite-sex requirement in the common law definition 
  of marriage. </p>
<p class="indent15"><strong>(ii) Minimal Impairment</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[133] With respect to minimal impairment, the AGC submits that there is no 
  other way to achieve Parliament&#146;s objectives than to maintain marriage 
  as an opposite-sex institution. Changing the definition of marriage to incorporate 
  same-sex couples would profoundly change the very essence of a fundamental societal 
  institution. The AGC points to no-fault divorce as an example of how changing 
  one of the essential features of marriage, its permanence, had the unintended 
  result of destabilizing the institution with unexpectedly high divorce rates. 
  This, it is said, has had a destabilizing effect on the family, with adverse 
  effects on men, women and children. Tampering with another of the core features, 
  its opposite-sex nature, may also have unexpected and unintended results. Therefore, 
  a cautious approach is warranted. </p>
<p>[134] We reject the AGC&#146;s submission as speculative. The justification 
  of a <em>Charter</em> infringement requires cogent evidence. In our view, same-sex couples 
  and their children should be able to benefit from the same stabilizing institution 
  as their opposite-sex counterparts.</p>
<p>[135] The AGC further submits that the means chosen by Parliament to achieve 
  its objectives impair the rights of same-sex couples as minimally as possible. 
  Although same-sex relationships are not granted legal recognition, gay men and 
  lesbians have the right to choose their partners and to celebrate their relationships 
  through commitment ceremonies. Additionally, same-sex couples have achieved 
  virtually all of the federal benefits that flow from marriage with the passing 
  of the <em>Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act</em>. </p>
<p>[136] We do not accept these submissions. As explained in our s. 15(1) analysis, 
  it is our view that same-sex couples have not achieved equal access to government 
  benefits. There are significant waiting periods involved before cohabiting couples 
  can access these benefits. Some benefits and obligations are available only 
  to married couples. Importantly, the benefits of marriage cannot be viewed in 
  purely economic terms. The societal significance surrounding the institution 
  of marriage cannot be overemphasized: see <em>M. v. H.</em> at 57.</p>
<p>[137] Allowing same-sex couples to choose their partners and to celebrate their 
  unions is not an adequate substitute for legal recognition. This is not a case 
  of the government balancing the interests of competing groups. Allowing same-sex 
  couples to marry does not result in a corresponding deprivation to opposite-sex 
  couples. </p>
<p>[138] Nor is this a case of balancing the rights of same-sex couples against 
  the rights of religious groups who oppose same-sex marriage. Freedom of religion 
  under s. 2(a) of the <em>Charter</em> ensures that religious groups have the option of 
  refusing to solemnize same-sex marriages. The equality guarantee, however, ensures 
  that the beliefs and practices of various religious groups are not imposed on 
  persons who do not share those views.</p>
<p>[139] In our view, the opposite-sex requirement in the definition of marriage 
  does not minimally impair the rights of the claimants. Same-sex couples have 
  been completely excluded from a fundamental societal institution. Complete exclusion 
  cannot constitute minimal impairment.</p>
<p class="indent15"><strong>(iii) Proportionality between the effect of the law and its objective 
  </strong><br>
</p>
<p>[140] The final branch of the proportionality test requires an examination 
  of whether the deleterious effects caused by excluding same-sex couples from 
  marriage are so severe that they outweigh its purposes.</p>
<p>[141] Since we have already concluded that the objectives are not rationally 
  connected to the opposite-sex requirement of marriage, and the means chosen 
  to achieve the objectives do not impair the Couples&#146; rights as minimally 
  as possible, it is axiomatic that the deleterious effects of the exclusion of 
  same-sex couples from marriage outweigh its objectives.</p>
<p class="indent15"><strong>(e) Conclusion</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[142] Accordingly, we conclude that the violation of the Couples&#146; equality 
  rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> is not justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. 
  The AGC has not demonstrated that the objectives of excluding same-sex couples 
  from marriage are pressing and substantial. The AGC has also failed to show 
  that the means chosen to achieve its objectives are reasonable and justified 
  in a free and democratic society. </p>
<p class="indent"><strong>(6) Remedy</strong><br>
</p>
<p>[143] Having found that the common law definition of marriage violates the 
  Couples&#146; equality rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> in a manner that 
  is not justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>, we turn to consider the appropriate 
  remedy. </p>
<p>[144] The Couples and MCCT seek an immediate declaration that the common law 
  definition of marriage is invalid, and an order reformulating the definition 
  to refer to the union of &#147;two persons&#148; to the exclusion of all others. 
  Additionally, the Couples seek an order directing the Clerk of the City of Toronto 
  to issue a marriage licence to each of them, and an order directing the Registrar 
  General of the Province of Ontario to register same-sex marriages. MCCT also 
  seeks an order that the Registrar General register the marriages of Kevin Bourassa 
  and Joe Varnell and of Elaine and Anne Vautour. The AGC takes the position, 
  in the event that we dismiss its appeal, that the appropriate remedy is to declare 
  the common law definition of marriage unconstitutional, but to suspend the declaration 
  of invalidity for two years. </p>
<p>[145] <em>Schachter v. Canada</em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, remains the seminal 
  authority regarding constitutional remedies. Lamer C.J.C. identified the court&#146;s 
  obligation to fashion a remedy for a constitutional breach and the scope of 
  such remedies, at p. 695:</p>
<p class="indent">Section 52 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> mandates the 
  striking down of any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, 
  but only &#147;to the extent of the inconsistency&#148;. Depending upon the 
  circumstances, a court may simply strike down, it may strike down and temporarily 
  suspend the declaration of invalidity, or it may resort to the techniques of 
  reading down or reading in.</p>
<p>[146] Lamer C.J.C. set out three steps to be followed in determining the appropriate 
  remedy for a <em>Charter</em> breach. First, the court is to define the extent of the 
  impugned law&#146;s inconsistency with the <em>Charter</em>. Second, it should select 
  the remedy that best corrects the inconsistency. Third, the court should assess 
  whether the remedy ought to be temporarily suspended. </p>
<p>[147] Turning to the first step, we hold that the common law definition of 
  marriage is inconsistent with the <em>Charter</em> to the extent that it excludes same-sex 
  couples. </p>
<p>[148] With respect to the second step, in our view the remedy that best corrects 
  the inconsistency is to declare invalid the existing definition of marriage 
  to the extent that it refers to &#147;one man and one woman&#148;, and to reformulate 
  the definition of marriage as &#147;the voluntary union for life of two persons 
  to the exclusion of all others&#148;. This remedy achieves the equality required 
  by s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> but ensures that the legal status of marriage is 
  not left in a state of uncertainty. </p>
<p>[149] We reject the AGC&#146;s submission that the only remedy we should order 
  is a declaration of invalidity, and that this remedy should be suspended to 
  permit Parliament to respond. A declaration of invalidity alone fails to meet 
  the court&#146;s obligation to reformulate a common law rule that breaches a 
  <em>Charter</em> right. Lamer C.J.C. highlighted this obligation in <em>Swain</em> 
  at 978:</p>
<p class="indent">[B]ecause this appeal involves a <em>Charter</em> challenge to a common 
  law, judge-made rule, the <em>Charter</em> analysis involves somewhat different considerations 
  than would apply to a challenge to a legislative provision. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Given that the common law rule was fashioned by judges and not 
  by Parliament or a legislature, judicial deference to elected bodies is not 
  an issue. If it is possible to reformulate a common law rule so that it will 
  not conflict with the principles of fundamental justice, such a reformulation 
  should be undertaken. </p>
<p>No argument was presented to us that the reformulated common law definition 
  of marriage would conflict with the principles of fundamental justice. Nor is 
  there any issue that the reformulated definition would violate the <em>Charter</em>. 
</p>
<p>[150] In addition to failing to fulfil the court&#146;s obligation, a declaration 
  of invalidity, by itself, would not achieve the goals of s. 15(1). It would 
  result in an absence of any legal definition of marriage. This would deny to 
  all persons the benefits of the legal institution of marriage, thereby putting 
  all persons in an equally disadvantaged position, rather than in an equally 
  advantaged position. Moreover, a declaration of invalidity alone leaves same-sex 
  couples open to blame for the blanket denial of the benefits of the legal institution 
  of marriage, a result that does nothing to advance the goal of s. 15(1) of promoting 
  concern, respect and consideration for all persons. </p>
<p>[151] We are also of the view that the argument made by the AGC and several 
  of the intervenors that we should defer to Parliament once we issue a declaration 
  of invalidity is not apposite in these circumstances. <em>Schachter</em> provides 
  that the role of the legislature and legislative objectives is to be considered 
  at the second step of the remedy analysis when a court is deciding whether severance 
  or reading in is an appropriate remedy to cure a legislative provision that 
  breaches the <em>Charter</em>. These considerations do not arise where the genesis 
  of the <em>Charter</em> breach is found in the common law and there is no legislation 
  to be altered. Any lacunae created by a declaration of invalidity of a common 
  law rule are common law lacunae that should be remedied by the courts, unless 
  to do so would conflict with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p>[152] The third step remains to be considered, that is, whether to temporarily 
  suspend the declaration of invalidity. As previously noted, the AGC argues for 
  a suspension in order to permit Parliament an opportunity to respond to the 
  legal gap that such a declaration would create. Again, <em>Schachter</em> provides 
  guidance on the resolution of this issue. Lamer C.J.C. emphasized, at p. 716, 
  that &#147;[a] delayed declaration allows a state of affairs which has been 
  found to violate standards embodied in the <em>Charter</em> to persist for a 
  time despite the violation.&#148; He stated, at pp. 715-16 and 719, that temporarily 
  suspending a declaration of invalidity is warranted only in limited circumstances, 
  such as where striking down the law poses a potential danger to the public, 
  threatens the rule of law, or would have the effect of denying deserving persons 
  of benefits under the impugned law. Further, Lamer C.J.C. pointed out, at p. 
  717, that respect for the role of the legislature is not a consideration at 
  the third step of the analysis:</p>
<p class="indent">The question whether to delay the application of a declaration 
  of nullity should therefore turn not on considerations of the role of the court 
  and the legislature, but rather on considerations listed earlier relating to 
  the effect of an immediate declaration on the public [<em>i.e.</em> potential 
  public danger, threat to the rule of law, or denial of benefit to deserving 
  persons].</p>
<p>[153] There is no evidence before this court that a declaration of invalidity 
  without a period of suspension will pose any harm to the public, threaten the 
  rule of law, or deny anyone the benefit of legal recognition of their marriage. 
  We observe that there was no evidence before us that the reformulated definition 
  of marriage will require the volume of legislative reform that followed the 
  release of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s decision in <em>M. v. H.</em> In our view, 
  an immediate declaration will simply ensure that opposite-sex couples and same-sex 
  couples immediately receive equal treatment in law in accordance with s. 15(1) 
  of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
<p>[154] Accordingly, we would allow the cross-appeal by the Couples on remedy. 
  We would reformulate the common law definition of marriage as &#147;the voluntary 
  union for life of two persons to the exclusion of all others&#148;. We decline 
  to order a suspension of the declaration of invalidity or of the reformulated 
  common law definition of marriage. We would also make orders, in the nature 
  of <em>mandamus</em>, requiring the Clerk of the City of Toronto to issue marriage 
  licences to the Couples, and requiring the Registrar General of the Province 
  of Ontario to accept for registration the marriage certificates of Kevin Bourassa 
  and Joe Varnell and of Elaine and Anne Vautour.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a></p>
<p><strong>E. DISPOSITION<br>
  </strong> </p>
<p>[155] In summary, we have concluded the following:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) the existing common law definition of marriage is &#147;the 
  voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others&#148;;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the courts have jurisdiction to alter the common law definition 
  of marriage; resort to constitutional amendment procedures is not required;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the existing common law definition of marriage does not 
  infringe MCCT&#146;s freedom of religion rights under s. 2(a) of the <em>Charter</em> 
  or its equality rights on the basis of religion under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>;</p>
<p class="indent">(4) the existing common law definition of marriage violates 
  the Couples&#146; equality rights on the basis of sexual orientation under s. 
  15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>; and</p>
<p class="indent">(5) the violation of the Couples&#146; equality rights under 
  s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> cannot be justified in a free and democratic society 
  under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p>[156] To remedy the infringement of these constitutional rights, we:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) declare the existing common law definition of marriage to 
  be invalid to the extent that it refers to &#147;one man and one woman&#148;;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) reformulate the common law definition of marriage as &#147;the 
  voluntary union for life of two persons to the exclusion of all others&#148;;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) order the declaration of invalidity in (1) and the reformulated 
  definition in (2) to have immediate effect; </p>
<p class="indent">(4) order the Clerk of the City of Toronto to issue marriage 
  licenses to the Couples; and</p>
<p class="indent">(5) order the Registrar General of the Province of Ontario to 
  accept for registration the marriage certificates of Kevin Bourassa and Joe 
  Varnell and of Elaine and Anne Vautour.</p>
<p>[157] In the result, the AGC&#146;s appeals are dismissed. MCCT&#146;s cross-appeal 
  relating to s. 2(a) of the <em>Charter</em> and s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> on the basis 
  of religion is dismissed. The Couples&#146; cross-appeal and MCCT&#146;s cross-appeal 
  on remedy are allowed.</p>
<p>[158] If the AGC, the Couples and MCCT are unable to agree on costs, they may 
  speak to the matter by filing brief written submissions within two weeks of 
  the release of these reasons. There will be no costs awarded to or against the 
  Clerk of the City of Toronto, the Attorney General of Ontario, or any of the 
  intervenors.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Eight gay and lesbian couples originally 
  challenged the decision of the Clerk of the City of Toronto not to grant them 
  marriage licences. One of the couples separated after the decision of the Divisional 
  Court but before the hearing of this appeal. The persons involved indicated 
  that they did not wish to continue to participate in the proceedings. </p>
<P><a name="2" id="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> The Couples also submit that the common 
  law definition of marriage violates s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> on the 
  basis of sex. In our view, sexual orientation is the most applicable ground 
  of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. Accordingly, we find 
  it unnecessary to decide whether there is a <em>Charter</em> violation on the 
  basis of sex.</p>
<P><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> We recognize that an order requiring 
  the Registrar General of the Province of Ontario to accept for registration 
  the marriage certificates of Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell and of Elaine and 
  Anne Vautour does not flow from our rejection of MCCT&#146;s legal arguments. 
  However, given our conclusion on the equality issue, and bearing in mind the 
  consolidation of the two applications, we are of the view that a remedy for 
  the two couples involved in the MCCT application is also appropriate.</p>
