<p>McMURTRY C.J.O.:</p>  <p>[1] This is a motion brought on behalf of Rabbi Irwin Zeplowitz and the Canadian 
  Coalition of Liberal Rabbis for Same-Sex Marriage (the &quot;Coalition&quot;) 
  for leave to intervene in these appeals as a friend of the court. The appellant, 
  the Attorney General of Canada, opposes the application while the respondents 
  and other intervenors either support the applicant or take no position on the 
  application. This matter was originally before me on February 20th, 2003 but 
  was adjourned to permit cross-examination of Rabbi Zeplowitz. As a result of 
  certain objections raised today the transcript of the cross-examination was 
  withdrawn by counsel for the Attorney General of Canada. For other reasons, 
  a supplementary motion record filed by the Attorney General was also withdrawn. 
  </p>  <p>
  [2] Some of my observations with respect to this application, will of necessity, 
  be similar to those made in the application of the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
  to be an amicus curiae in this appeal. </p>  <p>
  [3] At their core, the issues in these appeals were succinctly summarised by 
  Blair R.S.J. in his reasons of the Divisional Court when he posed the following 
  question: </p>  
<p class="indent"> &quot;Are same-sex couples entitled under Canadian 
  Law to marry?&quot;</p>  
<p>
  [4] This question is one of significant public interest and importance. The 
  decision of this court must take into consideration and weigh a continuum of 
  the secular and religious values within our community. The reasons of Dubin 
  C.J.O. in Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Canada 
  Limited (1990), 74 OR 2nd 164 (C.A.) set out the test to be applied on motions 
  such as this as follows, at page 167:</p>  
<p class="indent"> Although much has been written as to the proper matters 
  to be considered in determining whether an application for intervention should 
  be granted, in the end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are the 
  nature of the case, issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being 
  able to make a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing 
  injustice to the immediate parties.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Chief Justice Dubin in that case, the court is more receptive 
  to the participation of intervenors in cases of constitutional or societal importance 
  so as to have the benefit of various perspectives of the historical and sociological 
  context, as well as, policy and other considerations that bear on the validity 
  of legislation. As the issues in this case are of great public and social concern, 
  a number of other intervenors were permitted to participate in the court below 
  and in this court. The existing intervenors were permitted to participate, at 
  least in part, so as to bring to bear their expertise and varying perspectives 
  to the important issues to be decided.</p>  <p>
  [5] The proposed intervenor is an association of self described liberal rabbis 
  who, for many years, have been actively involved in the theological discussion 
  of same-sex unions and who have dealt with the practical reality of the difficulties 
  encountered by gay and lesbian congregants in participating in Jewish religious 
  life. The actual Coalition, however, was formed only recently in order to participate 
  in legal proceedings considering same-sex marriages. Given the long term involvement 
  of its individual members in the discussion of the issues at the core of this 
  appeal, I do not believe in these circumstances that the fact that the Coalition 
  is recently formed and unincorporated should be a bar to its application.</p>  <p>
  [6] The record for these appeals is substantial and contains significant amounts 
  of evidence in relation to the nature of &quot;marriage&quot; in our society 
  and the impact that an expansion of the definition of marriage to include same-sex 
  couples would have on our society, from both religious and secular perspectives. 
  The proposed intervenor is not asking to add to the existing record or to enhance 
  the evidentiary basis for its argument. Nevertheless I am satisfied that, in 
  relation to the existing record, the proposed intervenor has a unique perspective 
  from which to address the issues on this appeal which will enable it to &quot;make 
  a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing injustice 
  to the immediate parties.&quot; </p>  <p>
  [7] Counsel for the Attorney General takes the position that, as an unincorporated 
  entity, the Coalition does not have the capacity to participate as an intervenor. 
  The proposed intervenor responds that, if necessary, I could appoint Rabbi Zeplowitz 
  as an intervenor in his own right or as nominee on behalf of the Coalition. 
  Given my conclusion that the Coalition could make a useful contribution to the 
  argument of this appeal, it is my view, that this objection is one more of form 
  than of substance. As stated by Dubin C.J.O. in Layland v. Ontario (Ministry 
  of Consumer and Commercial Relations) (1994) 47 ACWS (3d) 68): </p>  
<p class="indent"> I do not give the word &quot;person&quot; in Rule 13 
  the same importance as if the rights of the applicant were being determined. 
  By analogy, I could have made a representation order but I do not think it necessary 
  to do so in this case.</p>
<p>Two of the existing intervenors are unincorporated associations of interested 
  &quot;corporate persons&quot;. In all of the circumstances I do not think it 
  is either necessary or appropriate to make a representation order here.</p>  
<p> [8] Counsel for the Attorney General has also argued that to permit intervention 
  at this late stage would prejudice or cause an injustice to the parties. Nevertheless, 
  I believe the comments of Morden, J.A., in Louie v. Lastman (2001), 208 DLR 
  (4th) 380, at paragraph 13, are appropriate to this application when he stated, 
  &quot;the intervention will expand the number of submissions to which the responding 
  party will be obliged to reply but this, which is for the potential benefit 
  of the court, is not an injustice&quot;. The concerns of the Attorney General 
  of Canada can be largely alleviated by the conditions that I impose. Accordingly 
  I grant leave to the Coalition of Canadian Liberal Rabbis for Same-Sex Marriages, 
  to intervene as a friend of the court on the following conditions:</p>  
<p class="indent"> 1. That it takes the record as it is and will not be 
  permitted to introduce further material;<br>
  2. That it will not seek costs on the appeal but that costs may be awarded against 
  it;<br>
  3. That it deliver its factum, which will not duplicate the argument of other 
  parties, and is not to exceed 15 pages, on or before March 13th, 2003, and<br>
  4. That the time allocated for its oral submissions be 15 minutes. </p>
<p>
  [9] There will be no costs of this motion. </p>  
<p> &quot;R. Roy McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;</p>
