<p class="boldcenter">Synopsis of <em>Halpern et al v. Attorney General of Canada 
  et al</em></p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>From April 22 to 25, 2003, a panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, composed 
  of Chief Justice McMurtry and Justices MacPherson and Gillese, heard a constitutional 
  challenge to the definition of marriage. The definition of marriage, which is 
  found only in the common law, requires that marriage be between &#147;one man 
  and one woman&#148;. This opposite-sex requirement was challenged by eight same-sex 
  couples (&#147;the Couples&#148;) as offending their right to equality as guaranteed 
  by s. 15(1) of the <em>Canadian <em>Charter</em> of Rights and Freedoms</em> (&#147;the 
  <em>Charter</em>&#148;) on the basis of sexual orientation. The opposite-sex requirement 
  was also challenged by the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto (&#147;MCCT&#148;) 
  as violating its right to freedom of religion under s. 2(a) of the <em>Charter</em> and 
  its equality rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> on the basis of religion.</p>
<p>On July 12, 2002, the Divisional Court (Associate Chief Justice Smith, Regional 
  Senior Justice Blair and Justice LaForme) unanimously held that the opposite-sex 
  requirement of marriage infringed the Couples&#146; equality rights under s. 
  15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> and was not saved as a justifiable limit in a free and 
  democratic society under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Divisional Court was also 
  unanimous in ruling that the rights of MCCT as a religious institution were 
  not violated. The Court was divided on the issue of remedy. The formal judgment 
  of the Court declared the common law definition to be inoperative. The declaration 
  was suspended for two years to enable Parliament to fashion an appropriate remedy. 
  If Parliament failed to act within two years, then the common law definition 
  of marriage would be automatically reformulated by substituting the words &#147;two 
  persons&#148; for &#147;one man and one woman&#148;. </p>
<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal upholds the decision of the Divisional 
  Court that the common law definition of marriage offends the Couples&#146; equality 
  rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> in a manner that cannot be justified in 
  a free and democratic society. The Court further agrees that MCCT&#146;s rights 
  as a religious institution are not violated. On remedy, the Court declares the 
  current definition of marriage to be invalid, reformulates the definition of 
  marriage to be &#147;the voluntary union for life of two persons to the exclusion 
  of all others&#148;, and orders the declaration of invalidity and the reformulated 
  definition to have immediate effect.</p>
<p><strong>Violation of Equality Rights under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>:</strong></p>
<p>The Court holds that the dignity of persons in same-sex relationships is violated 
  by the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of marriage. </p>
<p>The opposite-sex requirement in the definition of marriage creates a formal 
  distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex couples on the basis of sexual 
  orientation, an analogous ground of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. 
</p>
<p>A law that prohibits same-sex couples from marrying does not accord with the 
  needs, capacities and circumstances of same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are 
  capable of forming long, lasting, loving and intimate relationships. Denying 
  same-sex couples the right to marry perpetuates the contrary view, namely, that 
  same-sex couples are not capable of forming loving and lasting relationships, 
  and thus same-sex relationships are not worthy of the same respect and recognition 
  as opposite-sex relationships. Moreover, same-sex couples can choose to have 
  children through adoption, surrogacy and donor insemination. Importantly, procreation 
  and child-rearing are not the only purposes of marriage, or the only reason 
  why couples choose to marry. </p>
<p>The Court does not accept that, given recent amendments to federal law extending 
  benefits to same-sex couples, same-sex couples are afforded equal treatment 
  under the law. In many instances, statutory rights and obligations do not attach 
  until the same-sex couple has been cohabiting for a specified period of time. 
  Married couples, on the other hand, have instant access to all attendant rights 
  and obligations. Additionally, not all marital rights and obligations have been 
  extended to cohabiting couples. Further, s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees 
  more than equal access to economic benefits; it requires a consideration of 
  whether persons and groups have been excluded from fundamental societal institutions. 
  Exclusion from marriage &#150; a fundamental societal institution &#150; perpetuates 
  the view that same-sex relationships are less worthy of recognition than opposite-sex 
  relationships. In doing so, it offends the dignity of persons in same-sex relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Violation of s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> is not justified under s. 1 of 
  the <em>Charter</em>:</strong><br>
</p>
<p>The Court holds that the Attorney General of Canada has failed to demonstrate 
  that the violation of the equality rights of the Couples is justified in a free 
  and democratic society under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p>First, the Attorney General of Canada did not demonstrate any pressing and 
  substantial objective for maintaining marriage as an exclusively heterosexual 
  institution. A law whose purpose is uniting the two opposite sexes has the result 
  of favouring one form of relationship over another, and suggests that uniting 
  two persons of the same sex is of lesser importance. The encouragement of procreation 
  and child-rearing does not require the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage. 
  Heterosexual couples will not stop having or raising children because same-sex 
  couples are permitted to marry. An increasing percentage of children are born 
  to and raised by same-sex couples. Although a union of two persons of the opposite 
  sex is the only union that can &#147;naturally&#148; procreate, it is not a 
  sufficiently pressing and substantial objective to justify infringing the equality 
  rights of same-sex couples. </p>
<p>Second, the Attorney General of Canada did not demonstrate that the means chosen 
  to achieve its objectives are reasonable and justified in a free and democratic 
  society. The opposite-sex requirement in marriage is not rationally connected 
  to the encouragement of procreation and child-rearing. The law is overinclusive 
  because the ability to naturally procreate and the willingness to raise children 
  are not prerequisites of marriage for opposite-sex couples. The law is underinclusive 
  because it excludes same-sex couples that have and raise children. Companionship 
  also is not rationally connected to the exclusion of same-sex couples. Gay men 
  and lesbians are as capable of providing companionship to their partners as 
  persons in opposite-sex relationships. Additionally, the opposite-sex requirement 
  in the definition of marriage does not minimally impair the rights of the Couples. 
  Same-sex couples have been completely excluded from a fundamental societal institution. 
  Complete exclusion cannot constitute minimal impairment.</p>
<p><strong>Remedy:</strong></p>
<p>The common law definition of marriage is inconsistent with the <em>Charter</em> to the 
  extent that it excludes same-sex couples. The remedy that best corrects the 
  inconsistency is to declare invalid the existing definition of marriage to the 
  extent that it refers to &#147;one man and one woman&#148; and to reformulate 
  the definition of marriage as &#147;the voluntary union for life of two persons 
  to the exclusion of all others&#148;. This remedy achieves the equality required 
  by s. 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em> but ensures that the legal state of marriage is not 
  left in a state of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Court does not accept that the only remedy that should be ordered is a 
  declaration of invalidity and that the declaration should be suspended to permit 
  Parliament to respond. A declaration of invalidity alone fails to meet the Court&#146;s 
  obligation to reformulate a common law rule that breaches a <em>Charter</em> right. A 
  temporary suspension allows a state of affairs that has been found to violate 
  standards embodied in the <em>Charter</em> to persist for a time despite the violation. 
  A temporary suspension is warranted only in limited circumstances, such as where 
  striking down the law poses a potential danger to the public, threatens the 
  rule of law, or would have the effect of denying benefits under the law to deserving 
  persons. There is no evidence that these limited circumstances exist here. </p>
