<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice David S. Crane of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 20, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 3817.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] Hamilton Kilty Hockey Club Inc., a registered charity and a non-share capital 
  corporation incorporated under the Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38, commenced 
  class proceedings against the respondents in August 2001. It claimed, amongst 
  other relief, restitution for amounts remitted by it and other members of the 
  proposed class in payment of a fee imposed by the Crown as part of a provincial 
  scheme for the sale by charities of instant win lottery tickets. The appellant 
  also claimed pre- and post-judgment interest on the amounts remitted.</p>    <P>
  [2] On September 20, 2002, Crane J. of the Superior Court of Justice granted 
  the respondents' summary judgment motion and struck out the appellant's claims 
  for restitution and pre- and post-judgment interest. The appellant appeals that 
  decision.</p>    <P>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <P>
  I. BACKGROUND</p>    <P>
  [4] Instant win lottery tickets are &quot;break open&quot; lottery tickets variously 
  known as pull tabs, Nevada tickets, or &quot;BOTs&quot;. They are made of laminated 
  cardboard with windows. When opened, the windows reveal symbols, the correct 
  combination of which entitles the holder to a cash prize. The appellant holds 
  a licence issued by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario to sell BOTs 
  through a commissioned sales person at a kiosk at a retail store in the City 
  of Hamilton.</p>    <P>
  [5] In general terms, the BOTS lottery scheme in Ontario permits licensed charities 
  to sell BOTS to the public. A licensee is required to comply with all of the 
  terms and conditions of its licence, and must use the gross proceeds realized 
  from the sale of BOTS for charitable or religious purposes, less the cost of 
  the prizes awarded and the reasonable and necessary expenses of the management 
  and conduct of the lottery as specified in the terms and conditions of the licence. 
  BOTS, once obtained by licensees from gaming equipment and services suppliers, 
  are sold directly by the licensees to members of the public for prices which 
  are regulated by the Crown. Particulars of the regulatory framework which governs 
  the BOTs lottery scheme are as follows.</p>    <P>
  (1) Regulatory Framework</p>    <P>
  [6] The sale of BOTs in Ontario by charities is regulated through the Registrar 
  of Alcohol and Gaming (the &quot;Registrar&quot;) under the combined authority 
  of s. 207(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as amended, Order 
  in Council Number 2688/93, as amended (the &quot;OIC&quot;), and the terms and 
  conditions of licences issued to charities pursuant to the OIC.</p>    <P>
  [7] Section 207(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, which pertains to permitted lotteries 
  in Canada, provides that it is lawful &quot;for a charitable or religious organization, 
  pursuant to a licence issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province&#133;to 
  conduct and manage a lottery scheme&quot; if the proceeds from that scheme are 
  &quot;used for a charitable or religious object or purpose&quot;. Under s. 207(2) 
  of the Criminal Code, licences may contain terms and conditions &quot;relating 
  to the conduct, management and operation of or participation in the lottery 
  scheme to which the licence relates&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [8] The OIC authorizes the Registrar and municipalities to issue BOT licences 
  on certain terms and conditions. Under s. 11(1)(b) of the OIC, a BOT licence 
  in Ontario must contain the following term and condition:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (b) the gross proceeds from the lottery shall be used for the 
  charitable or religious objects or purposes providing a direct benefit to the 
  residents of Ontario as set out by the licensee in the application for a licence, 
  less the cost of the prizes awarded and such reasonable and necessary expenses 
  actually incurred in the management and conduct of the lottery, and such expenses 
  shall be restricted to those set out in the terms and conditions of the licence;</p>    
<P>
  [9] The Registrar is also authorized under the OIC to set maximum fees for the 
  issuance of a BOT licence. Further, pursuant to the OIC, the Registrar sets 
  the size of the &quot;prize board&quot;, that is, the percentage of the proceeds 
  of the sale of BOTs that is to be set aside for the payment of prizes.</p>    <P>
  [10] Through the issuance of licences, the Registrar regulates the information 
  that must appear on BOTs, who may sell BOTs, and how they must be displayed 
  and handled. Further, under a typical licence, the Registrar sets the percentage 
  of the proceeds of the sale of BOTs that may be paid in commissions to ticket 
  vendors, gaming equipment suppliers, and gaming service suppliers. A typical 
  BOT licence also contains the following additional terms and conditions:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (i) charities are required to purchase their BOTs from a manufacturer 
  approved by the Registrar;</p>
<P class="indent">(ii) charities are prohibited from using monies from any source 
  other than the gross receipts of the sales of BOTs to pay for expenses related 
  to the BOTs lottery; and </p>
<P class="indent">(iii) charities are required to produce financial reports and 
  records, detailing the expenses incurred by them in the sale of BOTs.</p>
<P>
  (2) Introduction of the Provincial Fee</p>    <P>
  [11] Prior to 1997, the structure of the BOTs lottery scheme gave rise to opportunities 
  for fraudulent activities. In response, the production system for BOTs was restructured 
  to enhance enforcement measures and consumer protection. As part of the restructuring 
  measures, a provincial administration fee of a maximum of 5% of the gross selling 
  price of each box of BOTs was introduced in December 1997 (the &quot;Provincial 
  Fee&quot;). The licence application fee of a maximum of 3% of prizes remained 
  unchanged.</p>    <P>
  [12] The amount of the Provincial Fee was imposed on the prize board. The price 
  of the BOTs did not change upon introduction of the Provincial Fee. Rather, 
  the province reduced the prize board by approximately 5%, with the stated intention 
  of ensuring that the Provincial Fee had no impact on the net profit of charitable 
  organizations. Essentially, the Provincial Fee was intended to be revenue-neutral 
  for the charities, that is, the charities' net revenues from the sale of BOTs 
  would not be reduced, on account of the Provincial Fee, from pre- 1997 levels. 
  </p>    <P>
  (3) Net Profit Realized Under the BOTs Lottery Scheme</p>    <P>
  [13] The respondent's uncontradicted evidence on the summary judgment motion 
  indicated that the net profit realized by charities from the sale of BOTs following 
  the introduction of the Provincial Fee exceeded the net profit realized by them 
  prior to December 1997. Under the approved lottery game in place before December 
  1997, the net profit to charities was 5.7 cents per 50 cent ticket, or 11.43% 
  of the gross proceeds of the sale of BOTs. During the period from December 1997 
  to December 1999, the net profit to charities was 6.1 cents per 50 cent ticket, 
  or 12.14% of the gross proceeds of the sale of BOTs. Since December 1999, the 
  net profit to charities has been 5.8 cents per 50 cent ticket, or 11.63% of 
  the gross proceeds of the sale of BOTs.</p>    <P>
  [14] The appellant's financial records for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000 
  indicate that its net proceeds from the sale of BOTs for that year were $16,348. 
  During the same period, it paid Provincial Fees in the sum of $6,804. The Provincial 
  Fees remitted by the appellant during the two-year period ending June 30, 2000 
  were in the aggregate amount of $11,843.20.</p>    <P>
  (4) Collection of the Provincial Fee</p>    <P>
  [15] The BOTs lottery scheme involves several participants in addition to the 
  province, as the regulator, and charities, as licensees. They include municipalities, 
  ticket manufacturers, gaming equipment suppliers, gaming services suppliers, 
  and consumers. The respondents submit that the Provincial Fee is financed and 
  paid for by consumers, as the end-users of BOTs. In contrast, the appellant 
  alleges that it bore the burden of the Provincial Fee in connection with its 
  sales of BOTs and the Provincial Fee was not paid by the purchasers of BOTs, 
  thereby reducing the profit realized by the appellant from the sale of BOTs.</p>    <P>
  (5) Proceedings to Date</p>    <P>
  [16] On August 7, 2001, the appellant commenced proceedings against the respondents 
  under the Class Proceeding Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6, in which it claimed, 
  on its own behalf and on behalf of the members of the proposed class as defined 
  in the appellant's statement of claim: (i) a declaration that the Provincial 
  Fee contravenes s. 207(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, in consequence of which it 
  is ultra vires its enabling legislation, invalid, and of no force and effect; 
  (ii) in the alternative, a declaration that the Provincial Fee, as a form of 
  indirect taxation, is unconstitutional by reason of contravention of s. 92 of 
  the Constitution Act, 1867 (U.K.), 30 &amp; 31 Vict., c. 3; (iii) restitution 
  to the appellant and to each of the proposed class members for the amount of 
  the Provincial Fee remitted by or on behalf of each of them; and (iv) pre- and 
  post-judgment interest thereon pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C. 43.</p>    <P>
  [17] In June 2002, the respondents brought a motion under Rule 20 and subrules 
  21.01(1)(a) and (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 for 
  summary judgment. The respondents' motion, as framed, sought to &quot;strike 
  out&quot; the restitution and pre- and post-judgment interest claims of the 
  appellant. For the purpose of that motion, it is common ground that the motions 
  judge was invited to assume, without deciding, that the Provincial Fee is unconstitutional 
  on one or both of the grounds alleged by the appellant. Accordingly, the only 
  issue on the summary judgment motion was whether the appellant was entitled 
  to restitution and interest in respect of the Provincial Fee, as claimed.</p>    <P>
  [18] On September 20, 2002, the motions judge granted the respondents' motion 
  for summary judgment, and struck out the appellant's claims in its statement 
  of claim for restitution and pre- and post-judgment interest. Although he did 
  not expressly refer to Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, it is clear 
  from his brief reasons that the motions judge decided the respondents' motion 
  on the basis of that Rule.</p>    <P>
  II. ISSUES</p>    <P>
  [19] The parties have framed the issues on this appeal somewhat differently. 
  In my view, this appeal concerns two issues, namely, whether the motions judge 
  erred by implicitly concluding that no genuine issue for trial arises concerning: 
  (i) the question of who bore the burden of the Provincial Fee; and (ii) the 
  appellant's asserted entitlement to restitutionary relief, given the current 
  applicable jurisprudence regarding the law of restitution in relation to the 
  payment of an unconstitutional tax.</p>    <P>
  III. ANALYSIS</p>    <P>
  (1) The Applicable Principles on a Rule 20 Motion</p>    <P>
  [20] It is well-established that the moving party on a motion for summary judgment 
  under Rule 20 must establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact 
  requiring trial. When the moving party meets that onus, the party opposing summary 
  judgment must then demonstrate that its claim is one with a real chance of success:

  at 434-35. It must &quot;lead trump or risk losing&quot;: Meditrust Healthcare

  v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.); Dawson

  Ltd. (1994), 22 O.R. (3d) 25 (Gen. Div.); and Irving Ungerman Ltd. v. Galanis 
  (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.). Subrule 20.04 (1) sets out the applicable principle 
  in clear and straightforward terms:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 20.04 (1) In response to affidavit material or other evidence 
  supporting a motion for summary judgment, a responding party may not rest on 
  the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleadings, but must set out, 
  in affidavit material or other evidence, specific facts showing that there is 
  a genuine issue for trial.</p>    
<P>
  (2) Whether There is a Genuine Issue for Trial Concerning the</p>    <P>
  Question of Who Bore the Burden of the Provincial Fee</p>    <P>
  [21] The respondents led uncontradicted evidence on the summary judgment motion 
  that the terms of the appellant's BOT licence precluded it from paying the Provincial 
  Fee from any source other than the gross proceeds of the sale of BOTs. In addition, 
  the evidence before the motions judge demonstrated that:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (i) the appellant's net profit from the sale of BOTs was higher 
  after introduction of the Provincial Fee than it was prior to its introduction;</p>
<P class="indent">(ii) the Provincial Fee was imposed by the province on the prize 
  board, that is, on that part of the total proceeds of BOTs sales reserved for 
  the funding of prizes; </p>
<P class="indent">(iii) as acknowledged by the appellant on this appeal, the Provincial 
  Fee is first collected by BOTs manufacturers and is invoiced by them, at the 
  time of shipment of BOTs, to gaming equipment suppliers. Those suppliers then 
  invoice charities for the Provincial Fee upon shipment of BOTs to the charities. 
  Thereafter, when charities sell BOTs to consumers, they deduct the Provincial 
  Fee, together with other expenses, from the total gross proceeds of the sales 
  of BOTs;</p>
<P class="indent">(iv) also as acknowledged by the appellant on this appeal, the 
  appellant's financial records and reports, required of it under the terms of 
  its BOTs licence, indicate that it deducted the Provincial Fee as a disbursement 
  from its proceeds of the sale of BOTs when calculating annual net proceeds from 
  such sales; and</p>
<P class="indent">(v) charities, including the appellant, are entitled to obtain 
  a credit or refund for unsold BOTs.</p>
<P>
  [22] In my view, contrary to the assertion of the appellant on this appeal, 
  those facts established a prima facie case that the appellant did not bear the 
  burden of the Provincial Fee. Both the Provincial Fee collection and the applicable 
  BOTs refund systems support the conclusion that the Provincial Fee scheme is 
  a user-pay system, which is financed and indirectly, but ultimately, paid for 
  by consumers through reduction of the prize board.</p>    <P>
  [23] In the face of that evidence, while the appellant was not required on the 
  summary judgment motion to establish that it bore the burden of the Provincial 
  Fee, it was incumbent on it to adduce evidence on the motion, in affidavit or 
  other form, establishing specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue 
  for trial. While the failure to file responding evidence to a motion for summary 
  judgment will not inevitably result in summary judgment, the appellant had an 
  evidential burden, in the circumstances here, to show that the issue of who 
  bore the burden of the Provincial Fee was a genuine issue for trial. I conclude, 
  for the following reasons, that it did not discharge that burden.</p>    <P>
  [24] On the summary judgment motion, the appellant relied on an affidavit by 
  Robert Nichols, a director and an officer of the appellant. That affidavit was 
  sworn in August 2001, almost 11 months prior to the respondents' motion. It 
  concerned the corporate status of the appellant, the terms and conditions of 
  the appellant's BOT licence, manufacturer and gaming equipment supplier invoices, 
  and financial records and reconciliations of the appellant. It did not respond 
  to the direct evidence of the respondents regarding the impact on charities 
  of the Provincial Fee, the user-pay characteristics of the Provincial Fee scheme, 
  and the related collection and refund systems for the Provincial Fee. No additional 
  affidavit or other evidence was filed by the appellant. </p>    <P>
  [25] The summary judgment motion proceeded on the basis of written interrogatories. 
  In opposing the motion, in addition to the affidavit of Mr. Nichols, the appellant 
  also relied on the fact that the respondents had declined to answer a series 
  of questions posed in the interrogatories, which allegedly relate to the incidence 
  or burden of the Provincial Fee. The appellant argues that the issues raised 
  in the unanswered questions require expert evidence to be heard at trial. </p>    <P>
  [26] In my view, the appellant cannot rely on unanswered interrogatory questions 
  posed by counsel to ground its claim that a genuine issue for trial exists. 
  The appellant chose to lead no opinion or other evidence on the summary judgment 
  motion concerning the issues raised by the challenged interrogatory questions. 
  The questions themselves are not evidence, nor are the respondents' refusals 
  to answer those questions.</p>    <P>
  [27] Further, many of the relied-upon interrogatory questions concern theories 
  of economics, taxation, gaming, and zero sum mathematics, and the application 
  of those theories to the BOTs lottery scheme. The appellant led no evidence 
  before the motions judge concerning those theories to establish their content 
  or their application, if any, to the BOTs lottery scheme and the Provincial 
  Fee at issue here.</p>    <P>
  [28] On this appeal, the appellant argues that any analysis of the burden of 
  the Provincial Fee must be conducted on a macro, as opposed to a micro, basis 
  so as to take into account the proceeds of the sale of all BOTs in the province 
  and, presumably, the total revenues generated by the Provincial Fee on those 
  sales. The appellant urges us to consider the mathematics of the sale of successive 
  boxes of BOTs and the impact of such successive sales on purchasing consumers 
  and vendor charities. Similar arguments were advanced by the appellant before 
  the motions judge.</p>    <P>
  [29] However, there is simply no evidentiary foundation on the record before 
  this court to support the appellant's argument that inferences of fact could 
  be drawn on those matters to demonstrate that the appellant, in fact, bore the 
  burden of the Provincial Fee, or that there is a genuine issue for trial concerning 
  whether the appellant did so. Moreover, the motions judge was precluded on the 
  summary judgment motion from weighing the evidence, making findings of fact 
  or drawing inferences of fact, all of which are functions reserved to the trial 
  judge. The brief reasons of the motions judge indicate no error in that regard.</p>    <P>
  [30] I conclude that the appellant failed to discharge its evidential burden 
  on the summary judgment motion to demonstrate that a genuine issue for trial 
  arises concerning the question of who bore the burden of the Provincial Fee. 
  While the appellant's assertions concerning the application to the Provincial 
  Fee scheme of theories of economics, taxation, gaming, and zero sum mathematics 
  may theoretically have some foundation, the bald assertion by counsel of such 
  application, without supporting evidence, is insufficient to support the refusal 
  of summary judgment.</p>    <P>
  (3) Whether There is a Genuine Issue for Trial Concerning the</p>    <P>
  Appellant's Asserted Entitlement to Restitutionary Relief </p>    <P>
  [31] As I mentioned, at the invitation of the parties, the motions judge proceeded 
  on the assumption that the Provincial Fee is unconstitutional as a form of indirect 
  taxation by the province. On that assumption, he framed one of the key issues 
  on the motion as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The issue in the motion before me is whether the law is settled 
  to the effect that in order for a plaintiff to qualify for the benefit of an 
  order in restitution as to an unlawful tax paid to a government, that plaintiff 
  must show, on evidence, that it, he or she, bore the burden of the tax.</p>    
<P>
  [32] The motions judge concluded that, in Canada, that issue was settled in 
  the affirmative by the Supreme Court of Canada in Air Canada v. British Columbia, 
  [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1161, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd. v. British Columbia, [1989] 
  1 S.C.R. 1133 and Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Canada, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762.</p>    <P>
  [33] The appellant argues that the issue of whether recovery or restitution 
  is available for the payment of an unconstitutional tax has not been fully settled 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada. It submits, therefore, that its claim for restitution 
  regarding the Provincial Fee should not be determined summarily but, rather, 
  should proceed to trial.</p>    <P>
  [34] In my view, on the facts of this case, the appellant's argument fails for 
  the following reasons.</p>    <P>
  [35] The appellant failed to establish before the motions judge that, as the 
  holder of a BOT licence, it was deprived of profit from the sale of BOTs which 
  would otherwise have accrued to it but for the imposition of the Provincial 
  Fee. There was no demonstration by the appellant that it sustained any damage, 
  loss or detriment as a result of the introduction of the Provincial Fee.</p>    <P>
  [36] The price of BOTs is controlled by the province, the appellant is expressly 
  prohibited from using its own funds - other than the gross proceeds of the sale 
  of BOTs - to pay the Provincial Fee, the prize board was reduced by the province 
  to accommodate the Provincial Fee, and there is no evidence that payment of 
  the Provincial Fee reduced or otherwise suppressed the appellant's profit from 
  the sale of BOTs. Indeed, the evidence concerning the appellant's net profit 
  is to the contrary. Moreover, the appellant acknowledged before the motions 
  judge and before this court that it was not arguing that the Provincial Fee 
  caused a reduction in the sale of BOTs. In any event, there was no evidence 
  before the motions judge that the imposition of the Provincial Fee accounted 
  for decreases in the volume of the sales of BOTs. Finally, no evidence was led 
  by the appellant before the motions judge which challenged the respondents' 
  evidence that, under the BOTs regulatory scheme, consumers bear the burden of 
  the Provincial Fee, as the end-users of BOTs, by virtue of a reduced fund for 
  prize monies.</p>    <P>
  [37] Consequently, and under the current law regarding restitution as articulated 
  by a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Air Canada v. British Columbia, 
  supra, I am not persuaded that the motions judge erred in concluding, as he 
  implicitly did, that no genuine issue for trial arises concerning the appellant's 
  entitlement to restitutionary relief.</p>    <P>
  IV. DISPOSITION</p>    <P>
  [38] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondents are 
  entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed in 
  the amount of $5,000.00 inclusive of disbursements, Goods and Services Tax not 
  being exigible against the respondents.</p>
