<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bernard J. Manton dated May 3, 2002 
  ordering payment of the amount of a judgment in favour of Katia Hanna-Harik 
  and Michel Harik pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  ch. M-41.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondents are residents of Quebec who were involved in a motor vehicle 
  accident with a non-insured driver in Ontario in March 1996. Katia Hanna-Harik 
  (&quot;Katia&quot;) claimed damages for personal injuries arising from the accident 
  and Michel Harik (&quot;Michel&quot;) claimed damages for loss of care, guidance 
  and companionship under the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 61. Katia 
  asserted claims both in Ontario and in Quebec. Michel's claim was asserted only 
  in the Ontario action. Both resp-*ondents succeeded in Ontario, but Katia's 
  claim was rejected under Quebec's no-fault compensation scheme. The issue on 
  this appeal is whether their request for payment of the Ontario judgment under 
  the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O. 1990, ch. M-41 (the &quot;Act&quot;) 
  should be refused on account of s. 25(2) which provides that no payment from 
  the Fund shall include &quot;an amount that would not be payable by the law 
  of the jurisdiction in which such person resides.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondents' action against the uninsured driver in Ontario was defended 
  by counsel representing the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (&quot;the Fund&quot;). 
  Liability was not in issue. The Fund argued that Katia's injuries were not caused 
  by the accident and that, in any event, they did not meet the then applicable 
  threshold for non-pecuniary damages under Ontario law. In his detailed reasons 
  for judgment, Cunningham J. found that Katia had suffered a debilitating soft-tissue 
  injury as a result of the accident, and awarded her $33,783.68 for non-pecuniary 
  damages, plus $8,834.66 pre-judgment interest. The trial judge assessed Michel's 
  Family Law Act claim at $4,391.84 plus $1,148.50 pre-judgment interest, and 
  awarded the respondents $20,000 costs.</p>
<p>
  [3] Quebec's no-fault compensation scheme for injuries sustained in motor vehicle 
  accidents, established by the Loi sur l'assurance automobile du Qu&eacute;bec, 
  L.R.Q. ch. A-25, bars legal actions in court in Quebec for personal injuries 
  arising from motor vehicle accidents. The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'assurance 
  automobile du Qu&eacute;bec (the &quot;Soci&eacute;t&eacute;&quot;) determines 
  indemnities for personal injuries arising from motor vehicle accidents. There 
  is a maximum indemnity for non-pecuniary damages - in 1996 it was fixed at $132,622.00 
  - and a claimant's entitlement is determined by reference to a scale, fixed 
  by regulation, of specified percentages of the maximum indemnity based upon 
  categories of &quot;d&eacute;ficit anatomo-physiologique&quot;. The &quot;d&eacute;ficit 
  anatomo-physiologique&quot; is determined by medical experts who assess the 
  injury and categorize it in accordance with the regulation. </p>
<p>
  [4] Immediately following the accident, Katia filed for benefits from the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;. 
  Her claim for income replacement benefits was initially accepted but, shortly 
  thereafter, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; determined that she was able to return 
  to work and her income replacement benefits were terminated. Katia was unsuccessful 
  in her appeals to a review panel and the Tribunal administratif du Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
<p>
  [5] Katia also claimed non-pecuniary damages under the Quebec scheme. Her claim 
  was dismissed on the ground that she had suffered no permanent after-effects 
  of the accident. She appealed to a review panel and ultimately to the Tribunal 
  administratif du Qu&eacute;bec, but her appeals were dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [6] The respondents moved before the motions judge for an order pursuant to 
  s. 7 of the Act for payment of the damages awarded by the Ontario trial judge 
  in the action against the uninsured driver. The Fund resisted the motion on 
  the basis that any payment to the applicants was precluded by s. 25 of the Act 
  which provides as follows:</p>

  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[7] Counsel for the Fund submitted that, since the respondents were not entitled 
  to any payment under the Quebec scheme, s. 25(2) precluded any payment to them 
  from the Fund.</p>
<p>
  [8] The motions judge dismissed that argument and ruled that the word &quot;payable&quot; 
  in s. 25(2) should be interpreted as &quot;an amount that may, can or must be 
  paid&quot; rather than as meaning that there had to be an obligation to pay 
  the sum. As the amount claimed by the applicant was less than the maximum indemnity 
  permitted by the Quebec legislation, the motions judge allowed the application, 
  and granted an order requiring the Fund to pay the applicants the amounts awarded 
  in the initial Ontario judgment. The Fund appeals to this Court.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Fund submits that the motions judge erred in his interpretation of s. 
  25(2). It contends that this provision requires an applicant to establish not 
  only an entitlement to damages in Ontario, but also that the amount awarded 
  in Ontario would be awarded by the law of jurisdiction in which the claimant 
  resides. The Fund argues that by precluding payments &quot;that would not be 
  payable&quot; by the law of the claimant's place of residence, the legislature 
  intended to impose a requirement that there be an actual obligation to pay in 
  the specific circumstances presented by the claimant. The Fund relies upon the 
  use of the word &quot;accorderait&quot; in French version of the statute, noting 
  that &quot;accorderait&quot; means a sum of money that a person is under an 
  obligation to pay. The Fund submits that the dismissal of the respondents' claim 
  under the Quebec regime provides conclusive proof that there is no amount payable 
  by the law of the place of residence.</p>
<p>
  [10] To accept the interpretation advanced by the Fund requires a finding that 
  the legislature intended that there should be two trials of damages claims: 
  one under Ontario law, and the second under the extra-provincial law. This would 
  require the applicant to present expert evidence explaining both the extra-provincial 
  law and how the claim would be assessed under that law. The cost and inconvenience 
  of such a result is apparent. I would avoid it for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [11] Section 25(2) must be read in its entirety. I agree with counsel for the 
  respondent that s. 25(2) contemplates two stages of analysis. At the first stage, 
  one must determine whether the claimant is the resident of a jurisdiction &quot;in 
  which recourse of a substantially similar character to that provided by this 
  Act is afforded to residents of Ontario&quot;. Given the very significant differences 
  between the Ontario law relating to personal injury damages and Quebec's no-fault 
  scheme, there might be some question whether Quebec does afford &quot;substantially 
  similar&quot; recourse. However, that issue is not before us. The Fund conceded 
  the point before the motions judge, likely because of an agreement between Ontario 
  and Quebec providing for subrogation rights in cases involving compensation 
  paid to non-residents.</p>
<p>
  [12] If the schemes are &quot;substantially similar&quot;, one then proceeds 
  to the second stage dealing with the exclusion of payments of &quot;an amount 
  that would not be payable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the person 
  resides.&quot; When read in light of the requirement that the law of the place 
  of the claimant's residence provide &quot;substantially similar&quot; relief 
  to Ontario residents, I do not read this second element of s. 25(2) as requiring 
  the claimant to establish his or her right to precisely the same relief under 
  the law of his or her place of residence.</p>
<p>
  [13] This is remedial legislation that is designed to insure the protection 
  of persons injured by uninsured motorists on a &quot;truly reciprocal&quot; 
  basis: see Re Melanson v. Duncan, [1965] 2 O.R. 812 at 817 (H.C.J.); Young v. 
  Ontario (Minister of Finance) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 284 at 298-299 (S.C.J.). 
  To require a fact-specific inquiry into the precise amounts that would be payable 
  under the law of the jurisdiction of the claimant's place of residence would 
  add levels of procedural and evidential complexity to the determination of claims 
  under this scheme and undermine its reciprocal and remedial purpose. Such an 
  interpretation would go against the grain of the general presumption against 
  a multiplicity of proceedings, and would unduly complicate a process designed 
  to protect injured motorists vulnerable to accidents caused by uninsured drivers. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] I conclude that, when read in light of the requirement that the schemes 
  be &quot;substantially similar&quot;, the concluding words of s. 25(2) are intended 
  only to embrace general limits or caps on damages, not to require another fact-specific 
  determination under the foreign law. </p>
<p>
  [15] Accordingly, I am not troubled by the apparent inconsistency between the 
  findings of the Ontario judge and the determination of the Quebec regime that 
  the applicant's claim should be excluded. While the appellant did not cast its 
  argument in terms of issue estoppel, I would add here that different procedures 
  are followed in Ontario and in Quebec for the determination of these claims. 
  Different standards apply in the two jurisdictions. The trial judge in Ontario 
  heard several days of evidence and gave very careful and considered reasons 
  in which he concluded that the plaintiff had established a causal relationship 
  between the accident and the disabling injury from which she suffered. The applicant 
  is entitled to the benefit of that finding as against the Fund in Ontario and 
  her claim should not be defeated by the different treatment accorded her claim 
  under the Quebec scheme.</p>
<p>
  [16] It is conceded by the respondents that, under Quebec law, Michel has no 
  right corresponding to that conferred by the Family Law Act for damages for 
  loss of companionship and that, accordingly, the motions judge erred in granting 
  Michel an order for the payment of that award by the Fund.</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, but only to the extent of varying 
  the judgment to exclude payment of the amount awarded to Michel Harik. As the 
  respondents conceded this point, they are entitled to their costs of the appeal. 
  I would fix the costs, on a partial indemnity basis, at $8,000.</p>
