<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We have considered, with care, the submissions made by Mr. Harte and by 
  Mr. Brodsky, who appeared as amicus curiae, and have had regard, with the consent 
  of Mr. Shandler, to the material filed in court by Mr. Harte at the opening 
  of this appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] In an appeal such as the present case, the reviewing court must ask whether 
  the Review Board's risk assessment and disposition order was unreasonable in 
  the sense of not being supported by reasons that bear even a somewhat probing 
  examination: R. v. Owen, 2003 SCC 33, at para. 33. In our view, the Board's 
  disposition, ordering that the appellant continue to be detained but permitting 
  the person in charge to allow him privileges identified in the Board's order, 
  was reasonable and was, on the evidence before the Board, the least onerous 
  and least restrictive disposition available. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <br>
</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;M.A. Catzman J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;K. Feldman J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;E.E. Gillese J.A.&quot;</p>
