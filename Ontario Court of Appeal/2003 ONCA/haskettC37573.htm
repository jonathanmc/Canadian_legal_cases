<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Peter A. Cumming dated December 12, 
  2001.</p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.:</p>  <p>
  [1] The appellant is a representative plaintiff in two proposed class actions 
  brought against the respondent credit reporting agencies. The appellant's actions 
  were struck out on a motion under Rule 21.01(1)(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 
  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (&quot;Rule 21&quot;) as disclosing no reasonable cause 
  of action. On the original motion, the motion judge dealt with three theories 
  of liability: breach of fiduciary duty, invasion of privacy and negligence. 
  After dismissing the first two theories, the motion judge dealt with the negligence 
  claim by holding that although the respondents could owe the appellant a duty 
  of care, there were policy reasons for declining to consider a cause of action 
  in negligence. On the appeal, the appellant did not challenge the first two 
  rulings, but limited his claimed cause of action to negligence. For the reasons 
  which follow, I would set aside the order of the motion judge and allow the 
  appellant to proceed with the action at this stage against the Canadian respondents, 
  as a claim in negligence.</p>
<p>HISTORY OF THE CLAIM</p>  <p>
  [2] As this is an appeal on a Rule 21 motion, the &quot;facts&quot; are contained 
  in the Statement of Claim, and are taken to be true for the purpose of the analysis. 
  </p>  <p>
  [3] The appellant has an M.B.A. and is a real estate broker in Toronto. He was 
  obliged to make a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy in the early 1990's when 
  third parties breached their financial obligations to him during the recession. 
  Both prior to the circumstances which caused his bankruptcy and since his discharge 
  in November 1996, the appellant has met all of his financial obligations. He 
  was discharged from bankruptcy without conditions as his trustee was satisfied 
  that his bankruptcy resulted from circumstances beyond his control.</p>  <p>
  [4] However, since his discharge, the appellant has applied for and been denied 
  credit despite the fact that he had an uninterrupted earning record averaging 
  in excess of $75,000 per year, has been current on all debt, rent and car lease 
  obligations and has had significant net worth from his post-bankruptcy earnings. 
  </p>  <p>
  [5] The appellant's claim is against two Canadian credit reporting agencies, 
  Equifax Canada Inc. and Trans Union of Canada Inc., and their respective American 
  parent companies, Equifax Inc. and Trans Union LLC. The appellant claims that 
  he has been denied credit from credit grantors in Canada because the two Canadian 
  respondent credit reporting agencies &quot;have improperly and illegally included 
  information in [the appellant's] credit report which they are not entitled to 
  report and which is inaccurate.&quot; It is because of these actions by the 
  respondents that the appellant has not been freed of the consequences of his 
  bankruptcy, notwithstanding his discharge. The impugned information is of two 
  related types: (1) pre-bankruptcy debts that are released as a consequence of 
  the discharge (pursuant to s. 178(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c.B-3); and (2) accruing interest on those debts.</p>  <p>
  [6] The reason this reporting is alleged to be illegal is because of ss. 9(3)(a) 
  and (f) of the Consumer Reporting Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-33 which provide:</p>  
<p class="indent"> s. 9(3) A consumer reporting agency shall not include 
  in a consumer report, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) any credit information based on evidence that is 
  not the best evidence reasonably available;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) information regarding any judgments, collections 
  or debts that on their face are statute barred unless it is accompanied by evidence 
  appearing in the file that recovery is not barred by the expiration of a limitation 
  period;</p>
<p>
  [7] In respect of the proposed class action, the Statement of Claim goes on 
  to claim that in Canada there are approximately 80,000 individuals per year 
  who have debts that are effectively statute barred by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
  Act or other applicable legislation. The respondents routinely report this information 
  in their credit reports for a minimum of seven years. The respondents report 
  the statute-barred debts using a classification system that labels them as &quot;R-5&quot;, 
  &quot;R-7&quot;, or &quot;R-9&quot;. The appellant says that credit grantors 
  routinely deny credit when one of these classifications appears on the report 
  and that this is often done without giving the affected person an opportunity 
  to explain his or her circumstances. The respondents also allow those debts 
  to appear to accrue interest, which they do not, but which has the effect of 
  making the individual's debt load appear larger than it was or is.</p>  <p>
  [8] The appellant claims that the respondents are negligent and in breach of 
  their duty to the appellant and the class members in failing to comply with 
  the statutory requirement not to report statute barred debts and in failing 
  to implement procedures to remove the prohibited information from their reports. 
  In consequence, that negligence has caused harm to the members of the class, 
  as credit has been denied to them by credit grantors as a result of this improperly 
  reported information. Furthermore, because it is very difficult for an individual 
  to have the credit report corrected, the class members are often obliged to 
  incur expenses by retaining counsel or a credit rehabilitation company to have 
  the record corrected. The appellant claims that the damages suffered by the 
  class members include mental suffering, anguish, embarrassment, humiliation 
  and injury to reputation. The appellant also claims punitive damages.</p>  <p>
  [9] In respect of the parent companies of the Canadian respondents, the claim 
  is that they wholly own the subsidiaries and that they mandate their practices. 
  Furthermore, they take the earnings from the Canadian respondents thereby making 
  the Canadian respondents financially unable to redress the wrongs alleged by 
  the class members. The claim also alleges that the appellant's information has 
  been reported worldwide, although there is no allegation that he has applied 
  for or been rejected by any non-Canadian credit grantor. The appellant relies 
  on any relevant U.S. legislation that is comparable to the Canadian and provincial 
  legislation referred to in the claim.</p>
<p>THE MOTION</p>  <p>
  [10] Although this matter is pleaded as a class action, the Rule 21 motion was 
  brought in the ordinary course before the delivery of a Statement of Defence 
  or a certification motion in the class action proceeding. Therefore, the motion 
  claims that the pleading discloses no cause of action that can be asserted by 
  the individual appellant as well as by the members of the proposed class.</p>  <p>
  [11] The motion judge dealt with all of the causes of action asserted in the 
  Statement of Claim and articulated by counsel, including breach of fiduciary 
  duty, invasion of privacy and negligence. The motion judge held that there could 
  be no fiduciary relationship between the appellant and the respondents, and 
  that the Statement of Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action for invasion 
  of privacy. There is no appeal from those findings. </p>  <p>
  [12] The motion judge then turned to whether the action could proceed as a negligence 
  claim. He first noted that the action is not pleaded as a negligent misrepresentation 
  claim, nor is it an action for defamation. Again there is no dispute in this 
  court with respect to those observations.</p>  <p>
  [13] The motion judge articulated the test for determining whether the facts 
  as pleaded can sustain a claim in negligence, referring to the two part test 
  from Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.), approved 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in Kamloops v. Nielsen (City), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 
  2 at 10:</p>  
<p class="indent"> (1) a sufficient relationship of proximity to make 
  it reasonably foreseeable that carelessness by one party may cause damage to 
  the other;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) if so, do policy considerations either negative 
  or limit the scope of the duty, the class of persons to whom the duty is owed, 
  or the damages caused by a breach of the duty? </p>
<p>
  [14] The motion judge referred to LaForest J.'s articulation of the first branch 
  of the test in Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young (1997), 146 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 577 at 591 which reads as follows:</p>  
<p class="indent"> [D]etermining whether &quot;proximity&quot; exists 
  on a given set of facts consists in an attempt to discern whether, as a matter 
  of simple justice, the defendant may be said to have had an obligation to be 
  mindful of the plaintiff's interests in going about his or her business.</p>
<p>
  Applying this branch of the test to the facts before him, the motion judge concluded 
  that in the circumstances there could be the necessary relationship of proximity 
  to create a duty of care:</p>  
<p class="indent"> With respect to the first part of the test, on the 
  facts pleaded, in my view there is arguably a sufficient proximity between the 
  consumer reporting agency and the consumer plaintiff (even though they may have 
  no direct communications) such that the agency could reasonably foresee that 
  carelessness on its part in the reporting of inaccurate information might cause 
  harm and loss to the consumer. The provisions of the Act may be seen as providing 
  a reasonable standard to inform a common law prima facie duty of care.</p>  
<p>
  [15] However, the motion judge went on to hold that because the appellant's 
  claimed losses are &quot;pure economic&quot; losses which are only recoverable 
  in limited circumstances, the claim could not proceed unless it fit within or 
  was analogous to one of the recognized categories which allows recovery for 
  pure economic loss. The motion judge determined that the only possible recognized 
  exceptional category of economic loss that could be pertinent to the pleaded 
  facts was negligent misrepresentation upon which a person relies to his or her 
  detriment; however, that cause of action did not apply because the representations 
  made here were to third parties and not to the appellant.</p>  <p>
  [16] The motion judge also rejected the claim at the second stage of the analysis 
  based on two policy concerns. The first was the concern of potential indeterminate 
  liability in terms of time, amount and class, which he viewed as a serious risk. 
  </p>  <p>
  [17] The second policy concern was that there are alternative statutory routes 
  within the Consumer Reporting Act to address the problem, including: (a) methods 
  for disputing the accuracy or completeness of reported information and for having 
  the file corrected (s.13); (b) procedures for an aggrieved consumer to seek 
  the assistance of the Registrar and to appeal any decision to a tribunal for 
  a hearing (ss.14, 16); and (c) provisions empowering the Director, as defined 
  by the Ministry of Consumer and Business Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M-21, 
  to investigate and take action against transgressions of the Consumer Reporting 
  Act (ss.18, 21). The motion judge noted that the appellant had not pleaded any 
  attempt to obtain relief under any of the statutory routes.</p>  <p>
  [18] The motion judge concluded that it was plain and obvious that the appellant 
  had no reasonable cause of action against the respondents in negligence.</p>  <p>
  THE ISSUES</p>  <p>
  [19] There are two issues on the appeal:</p>  
<p class="indent"> (1) Can the action proceed at this stage as a claim 
  in negligence?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If so, can the action, as pleaded, proceed against 
  the two respondent American parent corporations?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>I. Can the Action Proceed as a Claim in Negligence?</p>
<p>(i) Legal Framework</p>  <p>
  [20] The Supreme Court of Canada recently revisited the Anns/Kamloops two-stage 
  test for determining if a duty of care exists and will found a cause of action 
  in negligence in Cooper v. Hobart, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537 and Edwards v. The Law 
  Society of Upper Canada, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562. The court confirmed that the two 
  stage test remains the applicable test and analysis in Canada. In so doing, 
  the court clarified the role of policy considerations at both stages of the 
  application of the test. I quote from Cooper :</p>  
<p class="indent"> In brief compass, we suggest that at this stage in 
  the evolution of the law, both in Canada and abroad, the Anns analysis is best 
  understood as follows. At the first stage of the Anns test, two questions arise: 
  (1) was the harm that occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the 
  defendant's act? And (2) are there reasons, notwithstanding the proximity between 
  the parties established in the first part of this test, that tort liability 
  should not be recognized here? The proximity analysis involved at the first 
  stage of the Anns test focuses on factors arising from the relationship between 
  the plaintiff and the defendant. These factors include questions of policy, 
  in the broad sense of that word. If foreseeability and proximity are established 
  at the first stage, a prima facie duty of care arises. At the second stage of 
  the Anns test, the question still remains whether there are residual policy 
  considerations outside the relationship of the parties that may negative the 
  imposition of a duty of care. It may be, as the Privy Council suggests in [Yuen 
  Kun Yeu v. Attorney General of Hong Kong, [1988] 1 A.C. 562] that such considerations 
  will not often prevail. However, we think it useful expressly to ask, before 
  imposing a new duty of care, whether despite foreseeabilty and proximity of 
  relationship, there are other policy reasons why the duty should not be imposed 
  (para. 30).</p>  
<p> [21] The first part of the test includes both reasonable foreseeability of 
  harm and the concept of &quot;proximity&quot;. The court stated that the term 
  proximity is used to characterize &quot;the type of relationship in which a 
  duty of care may arise,&quot; and that &quot;sufficiently proximate relationships 
  are identified through the use of categories&quot; (para. 31). The categories 
  are not closed and new ones may be identified as they arise. The use of categories 
  provides certainty on the one hand, but on the other hand also allows the law 
  to evolve with the introduction of new categories to fit novel situations as 
  they arise.</p>
<p> [22] The court lists the recognized categories at para. 36, concluding that: 
  &quot;[w]hen a case falls within one of these situations or an analogous one 
  and reasonable foreseeability is established, a prima facie duty of care may 
  be posited.&quot; The recognized categories the court listed are:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the defendant's act foreseeably causes physical 
  harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's property, including nervous shock;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) negligent misstatement;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) misfeasance in public office;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) duty to warn of the risk of danger;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) a municipality owes a duty to prospective purchasers 
  of real estate to inspect housing developments without negligence;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) governmental authorities which have undertaken a 
  policy of road maintenance owe a duty of care to execute that maintenance without 
  negligence;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) relational economic loss, related to the performance 
  of a contract in situations such as where the claimant has a proprietary interest 
  in property, the general averaging cases and joint venture cases (see for example 
  Canadian National Railway Co. v. Norsk Pacific Steamship Co., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 
  1021; Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., [1997] 
  3 S.C.R. 1210).<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p> [23] At the second stage of the Anns/Kamloops test, a court must consider 
  residual policy considerations. The residual considerations do not concern the 
  relationship between the parties, but rather, look to the broader effect that 
  recognition of the duty of care will have &quot;&#133;on other legal obligations, 
  the legal system and society more generally&quot; (para. 37). The policy issues 
  at the second stage concern broader societal and legal interests and include 
  more specific questions such as: &quot;[d]oes the law already provide a remedy? 
  Would recognition of the duty of care create the spectre of unlimited liability 
  to an unlimited class? Are there other reasons of broad policy that suggest 
  that the duty of care should not be recognized&quot;(Cooper, para. 37)? </p>
<p>
  [24] On a Rule 21 motion, the court applies this two-stage analysis to the facts 
  as pleaded in the Statement of Claim in order to determine not whether a duty 
  of care will be recognized, but whether it is plain and obvious that no duty 
  of care can be recognized. If it is not plain and obvious then the action can 
  proceed and the issue will be determined at a trial. See Hunt v. Carey, [1999] 
  2 S.C.R. 959 at 980. In that context, the court may well recognize potential 
  policy concerns at the second stage but should be circumspect in using those 
  policy concerns to determine, without a Statement of Defence and without any 
  evidence, that it is plain and obvious that there is no cause of action: Hughes 
  v. Sunbeam Corp. (Canada) (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 433 (C.A.) at para 35; Anger 
  v. Berkshire, [2001] O.J. No. 379 (C.A.) at para 8.</p>  <p>
  (ii) The Prima Facie Duty of Care</p>  <p>
  [25] At the first stage, the motions judge concluded that there was a relationship 
  of sufficient proximity to make it reasonably foreseeable that inaccurate reporting 
  of information by the credit agency could cause harm to the subject of the credit 
  report. He also referred to the provisions of the Consumer Reporting Act as 
  providing a reasonable standard to inform a common law duty of care. This conclusion 
  follows the approach set out in Canada v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (1983), 143 
  D.L.R. (3d) 9 (S.C.C.) which holds that although a statutory directive does 
  not, by implication, create a cause of action for breach of the statute, it 
  can inform a common law duty of care.</p>  <p>
  [26] I agree with the conclusion reached by the motion judge on the first stage 
  of the test, based on the analysis set out by the Supreme Court in Cooper and 
  Edwards: </p>  
<p class="indent"> (1) the relationship of the parties is one of proximity 
  and damage was reasonably foreseeable from the respondents' conduct;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the policy of the law should be to recognize the 
  relationship as one of proximity; </p>
<p class="indent">(3) the cause of action is analogous to the recognized 
  category of negligent misrepresentation, or it is novel and ought to be recognized 
  as a new category of negligence.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not agree with the conclusion of the motion judge 
  on the second stage of the test, again, applying the Supreme Court analysis: 
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) there are no policy reasons for limiting or denying 
  the duty of care and any potential policy issues do not make it plain and obvious 
  at this stage that the cause of action cannot be recognized.</p>
<p>(1) Relationship of Proximity</p>  <p>
  [27] The relationship between the credit reporting agency and the appellant 
  is that he is the subject of one or more credit reports prepared and published 
  by the respondents. It is the respondents who have chosen to provide information 
  about the appellant to third party credit grantors. It is reasonably foreseeable 
  that if the respondents are negligent in the way they gather and report the 
  information, and if they report inaccurate information, their actions could 
  cause credit grantors to either deny credit or to charge more than they otherwise 
  would. To the extent that a person such as the appellant authorizes, either 
  expressly or impliedly, the gathering and reporting of credit information - 
  and at this stage of the action we do not yet have evidence on that issue - 
  it is fair to say that any such authorization would normally be limited to accurate 
  and non-negligent reporting.</p>
<p>(2) Policy Issues Relating to Proximity</p>  <p>
  [28] In considering the proximity issue at the first stage of the Anns/Kamloops 
  test, one must also address whether, as a matter of policy, it is appropriate 
  to find these parties to be in a relationship of proximity giving rise to a 
  duty of care. In my view, the first stage policy analysis also supports recognition 
  of the duty of care.</p>  
<p> [29] Credit is an integral part of everyday life in today's society. Not only 
  people seeking loans, mortgages, insurance or car leases, but those who wish, 
  for example, to rent an apartment or even obtain employment may be the subject 
  of a credit report <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>, and its contents could well affect 
  whether they are able to obtain the loan, the job or the accommodation. Credit 
  cards are a basic form of payment but their availability is also limited by 
  one's creditworthiness. Without credit, one is unable to conduct any financial 
  transactions over the telephone or on the internet. As credit is so ubiquitous, 
  there is nothing exceptional about consumer reliance on credit reporters to 
  carry out their function not only honestly, but accurately, with skill and diligence 
  and in accordance with statutory obligations. </p>
<p> [30] The importance of the role of credit reporting agencies is reflected 
  in legislation enacted specifically to regulate and govern their operations 
  - in Ontario, the Consumer Reporting Act <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>. Section 9 of 
  the Act limits the information which can be reported in a consumer report. The 
  overall purpose of the limitations imposed appears to be to try to ensure that 
  credit grantors will treat consumers fairly based on the information they receive. 
  For example, the prohibition against reporting information more than seven years 
  old attempts to ensure that credit grantors are acting on current information 
  about a consumer. There is also a prohibition on reporting information as to 
  race, creed, colour, sex, ancestry, ethnic origin, or political affiliation 
  (s.9(3)(l)). This prohibition is in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights 
  Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H-19, s.1, and exists to protect consumers from a denial 
  of credit based on discriminatory factors. The fact that fairness to the consumer 
  is a clear legislative imperative within this legislation further supports the 
  policy basis for recognition of a relationship of proximity and a duty of care 
  on consumer reporting agencies to consumers about whom reports are made.</p>
<p>
  (3) Analogous Category or New Category</p>  <p>
  [31] The relationship of a credit reporting agency to the consumers about whom 
  reports are made is not the type of relationship which fits exactly into one 
  of the recognized categories. However, in my view, the situation in this case 
  is analogous to the relationship that founds a cause of action for negligent 
  misrepresentation and a prima facie duty of care may be posited on that basis. 
  Otherwise, this is a novel situation in which a new duty of care could be recognized. 
  </p>  <p>
  [32] The traditional elements for a successful negligent misrepresentation claim 
  were set out in the seminal case of Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. v. Heller &amp; Partners 
  Ltd., [1963] 2 All E.R. 575 (H.L.) and were affirmed by the Supreme Court in 
  Queen v. Congos Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 86 at 110:</p>  
<p class="indent"> The required elements for a successful Hedley Byrne 
  claim &#133;. (1) there must be a duty of care based on a &quot;special relationship&quot; 
  between the representor and the representee; (2) the representation in question 
  must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading; (3) the representor must have acted 
  negligently in making said misrepresentation; (4) the representee must have 
  relied, in a reasonable manner, on said negligent misrepresentation; and (5) 
  the reliance must have been detrimental to the representee in the sense that 
  damages resulted.</p>  
<p>
  [33] On the issue of reliance, Dean Feldthusen, in his book Economic Negligence: 
  The Recovery of Pure Economic Loss, 4th Ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 2000) at 
  p.131, makes the point that reliance on the representation by the plaintiff 
  is not a necessary factor per se, but is required in the analysis to demonstrate 
  the causal sequence leading to liability, and the effective assumption of responsibility 
  by the representor. </p>  
<p> [34] In this case we have the elements of negligent misrepresentation without 
  reliance by the affected consumer <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a>, but where the representor 
  has effectively assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the information because 
  of the potential harm which could be caused to the consumer if the contents 
  are inaccurate. This makes the case one that arguably does not fit exactly within 
  negligent misrepresentation, but one that is analogous to it.</p>
<p>
  [35] An example of a duty of care found to be owed to the subject of a negligent 
  misstatement in analogous circumstances is in the case of Spring v. Guardian 
  Assurance plc, [1994] 3 All E.R. 129, where the House of Lords considered the 
  issue of liability to subject employees for the negligent preparation of letters 
  of reference for employment. It held that there was a duty of care owed to the 
  subject of the reference by the provider of the reference not to prepare the 
  reference negligently. In their analyses, both Lord Goff and Lord Woolf referred 
  to the case of Hedley Byrne, supra, in holding that the relationship was one 
  which gave rise to a duty of care. Lord Goff opined that a duty of care arises 
  not only where the recipient of a statement acts in reliance upon it, but also 
  where employees who do not receive the representation nevertheless rely upon 
  the employer to exercise care in preparing the reference before making it available 
  to the recipient (pp. 146-147). In this regard, he wrote:</p>  
<p class="indent"> The fact that the inquiry in Hedley Byrne itself was 
  directed&#133;to whether the maker of the statement was liable to a recipient 
  of it who had acted in reliance upon it, may have given the impression that 
  this is the only way in which liability can arise under the principle in respect 
  of a mis-statement. But, having regard to the breadth of the principle as stated 
  in Hedley Byrne itself, I cannot see why this should be so. (p.146)</p>
<p>Applying these observations to the case before him, Lord Goff wrote:</p>  
<p class="indent"> &#133;when the employer provides a reference to a third 
  party in respect of his employee, he does so not only for the assistance of 
  the third party, but also, for what it is worth, for the assistance of the employee&#133;when 
  such a reference is provided by an employer, it is plain that the employee relies 
  upon him to exercise due skill and care in the preparation of the reference 
  before making it available to the third party. In these circumstances, it seems 
  to me that all the elements requisite for the application of the Hedley Byrne 
  principle are present. (pp.146-147)</p>  
<p>
  [36] This analysis can be applied to credit reporting agencies. They make statements 
  to third parties about consumers, knowing that the third parties are going to 
  rely on those statements in making important decisions that will affect the 
  particular consumers. They also therefore assume responsibility for the contents 
  of those statements because of the consequences of the reliance by the representee, 
  not to the representee itself, but to the subject of the report, who can be 
  denied credit, a job, or a place to live. </p>  <p>
  [37] However, even if the facts of the present case do not fit the existing 
  category of negligent misrepresentation, or are not analogous to it, that does 
  not end the matter. As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Cooper and in 
  Edwards, the categories of negligence are not closed, and courts may make reference 
  to the appropriate analytic criteria for determining whether a novel situation 
  gives rise to a duty of care.</p>  <p>
  [38] In Robinson v. Ontario New Homes Warranty Program (1994), 18 O.R.(3d) 269 
  (Gen. Div.), MacPherson J. was also obliged to analyze whether a claim for pure 
  economic loss arose where a negligent misrepresentation was made but caused 
  harm to a third party who did not rely on it to his detriment. There the holder 
  of a letter of credit had called on the letter improperly, knowing that the 
  plaintiff was a guarantor to the bank of the letter that was called on. </p>  <p>
  [39] In performing the two stage analysis, MacPherson J. first ruled out negligent 
  misrepresentation as a category for the cause of action because there was no 
  reliance by the third party guarantor on the improper statement to the bank. 
  He then considered whether the situation was a novel one where a duty of care 
  was owed. To determine proximity, he applied the proximity analysis from the 
  judgment of McLachlin J. in Norsk Pacific Steamship, supra, at p. 1153 which 
  identified two components of proximity: sufficient proximity of relationship 
  and proximity of causation of harm:</p>  
<p class="indent"> In determining whether liability should be extended 
  to a new situation, courts will have regard to the factors traditionally relevant 
  to proximity such as the relationship between the parties, physical propinquity, 
  assumed or imposed obligations and close causal connection. And they will insist 
  on sufficient special factors to avoid the imposition of indeterminate and unreasonable 
  liability. (p. 286).</p>  
<p>
  [40] MacPherson J. concluded that there was both relational and causal proximity 
  between the parties in the case before him: the parties were neighbours in the 
  Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.) sense, who knew of each other's 
  interests, and the action of the person who called on the letter of credit improperly 
  directly harmed the third party guarantor. Similarly, in this case, the relationship 
  between the credit reporting agency and the consumer who is the subject of the 
  report is one of proximity both in the relational and causal sense, if the facts 
  alleged in the Statement of Claim are proved to be true. </p>  <p>
  [41] In my view, whether as an analogous category to negligent misrepresentation 
  or as a new category, on the proximity analysis there is the basis to find a 
  duty of care owed in this case. </p>  <p>
  (4) Stage Two Policy Issues</p>  <p>
  [42] In the Cooper and Edwards cases, the Supreme Court has narrowed the applicability 
  of the second stage of the Anns/Kamloops test. The court explained that the 
  second stage of the test generally arises only where a new category is asserted 
  and not where the case falls within either an established or analogous category. 
  This is because where the category is already recognized, the policy considerations 
  that might negative recognition of such a duty have already been considered 
  and rejected as a bar to recognition.</p>  <p>
  [43] Although I view the circumstances here as analogous to the recognized category 
  of negligent misrepresentation, so that it is unnecessary to consider the second 
  branch of the Anns/Kamloops test, in my view it is nevertheless appropriate 
  to consider and weigh the policy issues which concerned the motion judge, on 
  the basis that the circumstances could be viewed as a new category. It is particularly 
  useful to canvass these concerns at this stage, as we are not deciding the issue 
  definitively, but only determining whether the action must be struck out as 
  clearly unavailable.</p>  <p>
  [44] Both policy issues that concerned the motion judge have been identified 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada as matters which might militate against recognition 
  of a duty of care. The first is indeterminate liability. The motion judge concluded 
  that to extend liability in this case &quot;would create a serious risk of imposing 
  liability in an indeterminate amount for an indefinite time to an indeterminate 
  class.&quot;</p>  <p>
  [45] I do not agree with that conclusion. First, the class of persons to whom 
  the duty would be owed is a group that is not only wholly within the knowledge, 
  but also the control, of the respondents. It is the consumers about whom reports 
  are made. LaForest J. dealt conclusively with this point in Hercules Management, 
  supra, where he held that the defendant's knowledge of the plaintiff is critical 
  to the policy issue of indeterminate liability, and that the issue of indeterminacy 
  becomes of no concern when the plaintiff's identity is known and the defendant's 
  statements are used for their intended purpose. (para. 37). See also NBD Bank, 
  Canada v. Dofasco (1999), 181 D.L.R. (4th) 37 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 59. In this 
  case, although the group may potentially be a large one, it is not indeterminate 
  in any way. </p>  <p>
  [46] Second, the timing of the potential harm and therefore of liability is 
  not indefinite. Generally, a credit report is made for a particular purpose 
  and would be acted upon in the normal course. If errors are corrected by the 
  credit reporting agency for future reports, then normally the adverse effect 
  of the inaccurate report would be spent. </p>  <p>
  [47] Finally, the amount of liability is also limited by the purposes for which 
  the report is sought, which purposes are known to the credit agency. The Supreme 
  Court made a similar analysis in Martel, supra, noting that while the quantum 
  of damages &quot;may be quite high, it is limited by the nature of the transaction 
  being negotiated.&quot; (at para. 59) Furthermore, although there is a claim 
  for consequential damages, it is by no means clear that such damages would be 
  recoverable as reasonably foreseeable rather than too remote or otherwise not 
  legally available.</p>  <p>
  [48] In my view, this is not a case like Hercules Management, where the Supreme 
  Court refused to recognize a duty of care owed by auditors to all shareholders 
  in their individual capacities as investors, because it would &quot;create the 
  spectre of unlimited liability to an unlimited class&quot; (Cooper at para. 
  37). </p>  <p>
  [49] The second policy issue recognized by the Supreme Court in Cooper and considered 
  by the motion judge was whether the plaintiff has recourse to alternative legal 
  remedies. The motion judge was of the view that there was no need to recognize 
  the cause of action because the legislation provides alternative means to deal 
  with the problem. The Consumer Reporting Act provides a mechanism for a consumer 
  to determine the data being kept about him or her, for disputing the accuracy 
  of the data, for seeking the assistance of the Registrar to investigate and 
  order that information be deleted or amended, and appeal to the tribunal under 
  the Act for a hearing. There is also provision in the Act for the Director (as 
  defined by the Ministry of Consumer and Business Services Act) to investigate 
  a contravention of the Consumer Reporting Act and seek a restraining order. 
  </p>  <p>
  [50] In my view, these provisions, although potentially helpful to a consumer, 
  should not bar recognition of a cause of action in damages, at least at this 
  stage. I take this view for four reasons. First, and most significantly, these 
  provisions do not provide a remedy in damages to a consumer. As the loss to 
  a consumer could be significant and cannot be overcome by the corrective measures 
  available, the alternative means may not be equivalent to recognition of the 
  cause of action. In this regard, I also note that the Act does not purport to 
  bar any civil cause of action. Second, and related to the first, the Act does 
  not provide for punitive damages, a remedy that can be potentially useful in 
  the context of class actions where one of the purposes of the action is deterrence 
  of illegal conduct. See Hollick v. City of Toronto, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158 (para 
  27). </p>  <p>
  [51] Third, the appellant has pleaded the difficulties, expense and inconvenience 
  of attempting to use the statutory procedures. This pleading can be explored 
  at a trial and, if substantiated, could weigh significantly in the policy analysis 
  against recognizing the statutory procedures as an acceptable alternative and 
  therefore a complete bar to a cause of action. </p>  <p>
  [52] Fourth, and related to the third, at trial the parties will be able to 
  lead evidence on the effectiveness of the statutory procedures, how often they 
  are used, how quickly they proceed and with what results. This information will 
  be available from the Ministry and can form the factual background necessary 
  to weigh the necessary policy considerations. A court should be reluctant to 
  dismiss a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action based on policy 
  reasons at the motion stage before there is a record on which a court can analyze 
  the strengths and weaknesses of the policy arguments. See Anger v. Berkshire 
  Investment Group Inc., supra, at para. 15 and Hughes v. Sunbeam Corporation 
  (Canada) Ltd., supra, at para. 35.</p>  <p>
  [53] Another issue raised by the respondents in opposing recognition of a duty 
  of care in these circumstances is, I believe, best addressed at this stage of 
  the analysis in the context of policy considerations. The issue was also raised 
  and addressed by the Law Lords in Spring, supra: that recognition of such a 
  cause of action would be an encroachment on the law of defamation and would 
  preclude reliance on certain defences available in that cause of action such 
  as qualified privilege. The argument is that the policy of the law should be 
  to preserve the common law cause of action for defamation which has been developed, 
  and, in many ways has become, in effect, codified within the common law. The 
  Law Lords rejected this argument. Lord Woolf reasoned that the subject of an 
  inaccurate letter of reference is not protected by the law of defamation because 
  where qualified privilege applies, the person would have to prove malice, placing 
  a disproportionate burden on the employee. He concluded that the law of defamation 
  provided an inadequate remedy to such an employee and therefore, extending the 
  law of negligence was justified in the circumstances (p.172).</p>  <p>
  [54] I agree that, at least at this stage of the proceedings, the law of defamation 
  should not preclude recognition of the relationship of proximity between credit 
  reporting agencies and consumers who are the subjects of credit reports. At 
  issue is not a person's general reputation in the community, but specific facts 
  which affect a consumer's credit-worthiness in the context of a specific inquiry. 
  Furthermore, in this case the statutory prohibition at issue is in respect of 
  reporting certain information post- bankruptcy, which may arguably be viewed 
  as true, depending on how the information is reported, that is, the existence 
  of outstanding judgments even though they have been released by the order of 
  discharge from bankruptcy. In the defamation context, truth is a complete defence 
  to an action. However, where the prohibition in the statute informs the common 
  law duty of care, the cause of action in negligence could encompass reporting 
  of such arguably &quot;true&quot; information.</p>  <p>
  [55] A thorough analysis of other policy considerations which could defeat the 
  extension of negligence in economic loss situations was recently conducted by 
  the Supreme Court in Martel, supra, where the court was not prepared to extend 
  the law to recognise a duty of care in the context of alleged negligence in 
  the conduct of commercial negotiations. Even in the absence of serious potential 
  for indeterminate liability, a number of secondary policy considerations led 
  the court to decline to extend the tort of negligence into commercial negotiations. 
  I note that this is not a case like that one, where the law is being asked to 
  regulate a commercial situation between two parties after the fact. There are 
  no social or economic benefits to be preserved by precluding consumers from 
  obtaining compensation for losses they suffered caused by improperly based credit 
  reports by credit reporting agencies. </p>  <p>
  Conclusion on the Negligence Issue</p>  <p>
  [56] In my view, the motion judge erred in concluding that it was plain and 
  obvious that the appellant has no cause of action against the respondents in 
  negligence and that the action must be struck out at this stage. I would allow 
  the appeal on that issue. </p>  <p>
  [57] In reaching this conclusion, I wish to make it clear that this finding 
  in no way speaks to the issue of the suitability of this action as a class action. 
  To strike the action at this stage would mean that no individual consumer could 
  bring an action against a credit reporting agency for damages suffered as a 
  result of a harmfully false credit report. However, whether the action can meet 
  the tests for certification of a class action including appropriate common issues, 
  the determination of preferable procedure and damages is left for another day. 
  In respect to common issues, clearly every denial of credit to the persons in 
  the proposed class may not be attributable to the inclusion of the information 
  identified in this action but could be attributable to other contents of the 
  report. Proof of causation is an issue both for an individual claim and in the 
  class action context.</p>  <p>
  [58] The appellant has asked for an opportunity to amend the Statement of Claim 
  to remove the causes of action that were struck out by the motion judge and 
  were not pursued on appeal and to clarify the pleading in negligence. In this 
  regard, the respondent Equifax Canada Inc. also submits that the claim could 
  have been struck out for failure to plead the necessary material facts to ground 
  a claim in negligence, including what information was published concerning the 
  appellant, when and to whom the impugned report(s) were made, whether and, if 
  so, when, credit was denied on that basis and the loss suffered. I would therefore 
  grant the appellant's request for an opportunity to amend the pleading to properly 
  plead the negligence claim.</p>
<p>II. The Action Against the American Respondents</p>  <p>
  [59] The motion judge did not have to deal with this issue as he dismissed the 
  entire claim. The American parent companies say that if the claim can proceed 
  against the Canadian corporations, it must still be struck out against the parent 
  corporations for three reasons: (1) the pleading does not plead material facts 
  necessary to support a cause of action against them; (2) there is no cause of 
  action against a parent company for failing to control a subsidiary company; 
  and (3) the pleading does not plead facts that would allow a court to pierce 
  the corporate veil and on that basis attribute liability for the conduct of 
  the subsidiary.</p>  <p>
  [60] As to the first issue, the pleading is clearly deficient in setting out 
  the material facts on which the claim against the parent company is based. The 
  only allegation involving the appellant is in para. 18 of the Statement of Claim 
  which says that the American parent corporations have reported the same prohibited 
  and inaccurate information about the appellant &quot;worldwide.&quot; There 
  is no allegation that the appellant has applied for or been denied credit &quot;worldwide&quot; 
  as a result of this action by the American parent corporations. Further, counsel 
  for the appellant conceded in oral argument that the reference to unspecified 
  American legislation analogous to the Canadian statutes referred to should be 
  struck out.</p>  <p>
  [61] The second and third issues can be dealt with together. The pleading not 
  only claims that the parent companies failed to control the actions of the subsidiaries, 
  but goes further and asserts that it is the parent companies which mandate the 
  policy of the subsidiaries to report the post-bankruptcy information the way 
  they do in the face of the relevant legislation. In order to found liability 
  by a parent corporation for the actions of a subsidiary, there typically must 
  be both complete control so that the subsidiary does not function independently 
  and the subsidiary must have been incorporated for a fraudulent or improper 
  purpose or be used by the parent as a shield for improper activity: 62947 Ontario 
  Limited v. Fleischer et al. (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 417 at 439-440 (C.A.); Gregorio 
  v. Intrans-Corp (1994), 115 D.L.R. (4th) 200 (Ont. C.A.) at 208; Transamerica 
  Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co. (1996), 28 O.R. (2d) 
  423 (Gen. Div.) affd. [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.).</p>  <p>
  [62] The pleading falls short of suggesting that the relationship of the respective 
  related respondent corporations is that of a conduit to avoid liability, nor 
  is there an allegation that the parent company controls the subsidiary for an 
  improper purpose.</p>  <p>
  [63] For the above reasons, the claims against the companies as pleaded must 
  be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.</p>  <p>
  Conclusion on the Second Issue</p>  <p>
  [64] I would strike out the portion of the pleading that asserts a claim against 
  the American parent corporations.</p>  <p>
  COSTS</p>  <p>
  [65] The appellant shall have his costs of the appeals as against the Canadian 
  respondents Equifax Canada and Trans Union of Canada. The U.S. respondents, 
  Equifax Inc. and Trans Union LLC, shall have their costs of the appeal against 
  the appellant. Counsel may provide bills of costs within 7 days of release of 
  these reasons, and brief responding submissions on costs may be provided within 
  7 days thereafter.</p>
