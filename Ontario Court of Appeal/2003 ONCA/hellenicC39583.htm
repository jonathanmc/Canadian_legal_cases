<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are of the view that the motions judge erred in principle in finding 
  there was prejudice due to inexcusable delay caused by the appellant that gave 
  rise to a substantial risk that a fair trial of the issues in the action will 
  not be possible.</p>
<p>[2] We agree that the overall length of time taken to reach this stage of proceeding 
  is inordinate. However, the prejudice alleged by the respondent is general in 
  nature. We note, for example, that there is no evidence that any necessary witness 
  has died, is incapacitated or cannot be located. See De Marco v. Mascitelli 
  (2001), 14 C.P.C. (5th) 384 at 391. We recognize that the respondent has been 
  handicapped in providing evidence of such prejudice by the failure of the appellant 
  to comply with undertakings. For that reason, we allow the appeal and set aside 
  the order dismissing the action, but without prejudice to the respondent to 
  move again to dismiss the action for delay on either of the following bases: 
</p>
<p class="indent">(i) In the event that the appellant does not provide answers 
  to the undertakings within thirty days; (In the circumstances, such failure 
  shall establish prejudice for the purposes of such a motion) or</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) on any other proper basis.</p>
<p>[3] In the circumstances, costs of the appeal and of the motion below shall 
  be to the respondent fixed in the amount of $14,000.00, inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T., payable forthwith.</p>
