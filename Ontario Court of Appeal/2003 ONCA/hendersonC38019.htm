<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Gladys I. Pardu, A. Donald 
  K. MacKenzie and Donald R. Cameron JJ.) dated November 30, 2001, which is reported 
  at [2001] O.J. No. 5137, and by leave of this court granted March 26, 2002.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [1] The issue raised in this appeal is whether the Registrar of the College 
  of Physicians and Surgeons (the &quot;College&quot;) has the jurisdiction to 
  refer new allegations of professional misconduct and incompetence of a member 
  of the College to the Discipline Committee after a discipline hearing has already 
  commenced against the member. </p>
<p>
  [2] The procedural history is important in this case in order to appreciate 
  the context in which the Registrar signed a newly Amended Notice of Hearing 
  containing the new allegations.</p>
<p>
  [3] On April 19, 2000, the Complaints Committee of the College referred to the 
  Discipline Committee allegations of professional misconduct made by Ms. S. against 
  Dr. Henderson. Ms. S., a former patient of Dr. Henderson, alleged that Dr. Henderson 
  had begun a sexual relationship with her when he was her doctor. </p>
<p>
  [4] On June 26, 2001, the College amended the Notice of Hearing to include a 
  new allegation that Dr. Henderson failed to maintain the standard of practice 
  of the profession relating to his care of Ms. S. The discipline hearing commenced 
  on August 7, 2001. Dr. Henderson pleaded not guilty to the charges in the Notice 
  of Hearing. Following the arraignment, the word &quot;patients&quot; was amended 
  to the singular &quot;patient&quot; in the Notice of Hearing.</p>
<p>
  [5] The hearing continued for four days and was adjourned at the conclusion 
  of the evidence of Ms. S. on August 10, 2001 to be resumed on October 22, 2001. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] On September 6, 2001, a College investigator advised counsel for Dr. Henderson 
  that the College had received a new complaint from another former patient, Ms. 
  H., who made her complaint to the College after reading a newspaper account 
  of the discipline hearing. </p>
<p>
  [7] After reviewing the new complaint, the Complaints Committee referred the 
  allegations relating to Ms. H. to the Discipline Committee on October 11, 2001. 
  On October 12, 2001, the Interim Registrar of the College signed the newly Amended 
  Notice of Hearing. In the newly Amended Notice of Hearing, the Registrar omitted 
  certain allegations of failure to maintain the standard of practice of the profession 
  that had been in the previous notice. The body of the new notice was otherwise 
  identical to the previous notice and was not changed to take into account the 
  allegations of Ms. H. It referred only to Appendix A, which contained the particulars 
  of the allegations of the original complainant, Ms. S. Although the body of 
  the Notice made no reference to the particulars of the allegations of Ms. H., 
  an Appendix B was added to the Notice containing the allegations of Ms. H. I 
  assume the failure to refer to Appendix B in the body of the Notice of Hearing 
  was an oversight which is of no moment in this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [8] On October 15, 2001, counsel for Dr. Henderson advised counsel for the College 
  that, in his view, the Discipline Committee's jurisdiction to amend a Notice 
  of Hearing was limited to minor or clerical amendments and that the Regulated 
  Health Professions Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 18 and its Schedule 2, Health Professions 
  Procedural Code (&quot;the Code&quot;) did not permit the prosecutor to bring 
  a new complaint forward in mid-hearing. Counsel for Dr. Henderson advised that 
  if the College intended to proceed with the new complaint on the continuation 
  of the hearing, consideration would be given to seeking judicial review. </p>
<p>
  [9] Counsel for the College responded the next day. Her letter set out the College's 
  position as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I believe that there may be some misunderstanding. I do not believe that Mr. 
  Perrier intends to move before the Discipline Committee to amend the Notice 
  of Hearing. Rather, my understanding is that the Complaints Committee has referred 
  further specified allegations of professional misconduct to the Discipline Committee, 
  and the Interim Registrar incorporated this new referral administratively into 
  a document called an Amended Notice of Hearing. Should it be your view that 
  the allegations ought not be heard together, the appropriate step to take would 
  be to bring a motion to sever the matters before the Discipline Committee. Should 
  it be your view that you will need an adjournment of the hearing, you can discuss 
  that with Mr. Perrier.</p>
<p>
  [10] Counsel for Dr. Henderson responded to the College's letter as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I have not been able to find any authority in support of the College's position. 
  If there is any authority, would you please refer me to it so that I can take 
  instruction which may avoid unnecessary applications.</p>
<p>
  [11] On October 23, 2001, counsel for Dr. Henderson sought to quash the newly 
  Amended Notice of Hearing before a single judge of the Divisional Court on the 
  basis that it was a nullity created by the Registrar in the absence of statutory 
  authority.</p>
<p>
  [12] Justice Then declined to decide the matter on the basis that the Discipline 
  Committee should first rule on the matter, and therefore, the application to 
  the Divisional Court was premature.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Discipline Committee reconvened on November 26, 2001, and counsel for 
  Dr. Henderson challenged the Committee's jurisdiction to proceed with the newly 
  Amended Notice of Hearing. The Committee decided to proceed and gave brief reasons 
  which included: </p>
<p class="indent"> We have decided to accept the Amended Notice of Hearing submitted 
  on November 26, 2001 and to have the hearing continue on that basis. This Panel 
  is not being asked to amend the Notice of Hearing and we have concluded that 
  s. 40 of the Code does not apply in this case. The correct procedure has been 
  followed by the College. The Complaints Committee has referred the new complaint 
  to the Discipline Committee. The Registrar has acted, as he has authority to 
  do, to include that new complaint in an Amended Notice of Hearing which has 
  been tendered to this Panel.</p>
<p class="indent">The Panel has considered whether the acceptance of the Amended 
  Notice of Hearing in any way prejudices Dr. Henderson or creates any impediment 
  to his defense so as to result in any unfairness. No evidence was introduced 
  to suggest prejudice or unfairness. In the circumstances of this case, the fact 
  that certain witnesses have testified and have been cross-examined at this stage, 
  in our view, does not prejudice Dr. Henderson or create unfairness. If appropriate, 
  we will entertain a request to recall those witnesses in relation to any new 
  matters raised by the amendment.</p>
<p class="indent">If there are any other concerns related to potential prejudice 
  or unfairness then we invite counsel to bring these to our attention at this 
  time so that we can determine whether they can be appropriately dealt with by 
  an adjournment or in some other matter.</p>
<p class="indent">We have concluded that proceeding with the hearing based on 
  the Amended Notice of Hearing is consistent with affording Dr. Henderson a fair 
  hearing and with our obligation to the public, the College and Dr. Henderson 
  to ensure that the hearing proceeds in a fair and appropriate manner.</p>
<p>
  [14] The Discipline Committee then adjourned the proceedings to permit counsel 
  for Dr. Henderson to renew his application for judicial review. The Divisional 
  Court, by order dated November 30, 2001, quashed the newly Amended Notice of 
  Hearing and fixed costs of the application in favour of Dr. Henderson in the 
  amount of $4,000. Pardu J. delivered the reasons for judgment of the court and 
  stated inter alia: </p>
<p class="indent"> The College did not move before the panel for an amendment 
  of the Notice of Hearing. The panel of the Discipline Committee was performing 
  an adjudicative function. The College plays many other roles; it regulates the 
  medical profession, investigates wrongdoing and prosecutes misconduct. The Registrar 
  of the College occupies a position akin to general manager of the College, an 
  administrative role, and has no power to alter the nature of ongoing proceedings 
  before a panel of the Discipline Committee. Interference with ongoing proceedings 
  undermines the independence of the adjudicative tribunal.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the precise limits of the Discipline Committee panel's 
  power to amend a Notice of Hearing, it is clear that the Registrar has no such 
  power, once the hearing has begun. S. 40 of the Health Professions Procedural 
  Code, schedule 2 to the Regulated Health Professions Act (99) S.O. c. 18 provides, 
</p>
<p class="indent10"> &quot;A panel may at any time permit a notice of hearing of 
  allegations against a member to be amended to correct errors or omissions of 
  a minor or clerical nature if it is of the opinion that it is just and equitable 
  to do so and the panel may make any order it considers necessary to prevent 
  prejudice to the member.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">S. 8 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act R.S.O. 1990 c. S.22 
  requires that,</p>
<p class="indent10">&quot;Where the good character, propriety of conduct or competence 
  of a party is an issue in a proceeding, the party is entitled to be furnished 
  prior to the hearing with reasonable information of any allegations with respect 
  thereto.&quot; [emphasis in original judgment] </p>
<p class="indent">Even if new allegations could be added to a complaint before 
  the panel of the Discipline Committee, it would be up to the panel to decide 
  whether that could be done without unfairness to the physician. [Hryciuk v. 
  Ontario (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 695 (Div. Ct.); Rev'd (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.)]</p>
<p class="indent">The Respondent College argues that the physician was treated 
  fairly, and that Notices of Hearing should not be treated with the formality 
  and rigour associated with Statements of Claim, however fairness does not cure 
  the absence of any statutory authority for the actions of the Registrar, and 
  does not mitigate the long term risks to the impartiality and independence of 
  the adjudicative tribunal, should an administrator be empowered to control any 
  part of the proceedings before a panel.</p>
<p>
  The Position of the College in this Appeal</p>
<p>
  [15] Counsel for the College submitted that the Interim Registrar did not require 
  express statutory authority to execute an amended Notice of Hearing after the 
  hearing has started. She submitted that the Registrar's action was purely administrative. 
  The College's Discipline Committee is the master of its own procedure and is 
  entitled to accept an amended Notice of Hearing. Absent a demonstration of unfairness, 
  there is no basis for the court to interfere.</p>
<p>
  [16] Counsel for the College further submitted that s. 8 of the Statutory Powers 
  Procedure Act and the common law requiring fairness and notice do not preclude 
  adding allegations of professional misconduct once a hearing has started. In 
  support of its position, counsel relied on the majority judgment of the Divisional 
  Court in Hryciuk v. Ontario (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 695 (Div. Ct.), at 709, reversed 
  on other grounds by this court at (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 1. I will have more to 
  say about this issue below.</p>
<p>
  [17] Finally, counsel for the College submitted that s. 40 of the Code is irrelevant 
  to the circumstances of the case at bar. Section 40 permits a panel of the Discipline 
  Committee to amend a Notice of Hearing by correcting errors or omissions of 
  a minor or clerical nature. Counsel observed that the amendments in this case 
  were not made by the Discipline Committee.</p>
<p>
  The Position of Dr. Henderson in this Appeal</p>
<p>
  [18] Counsel for Dr. Henderson submitted that the Code does not confer any power 
  on the Registrar to participate in discipline hearings, and in particular, it 
  does not confer any power on the Registrar to amend a Notice of Hearing that 
  is before a Discipline Committee.</p>
<p>
  [19] Counsel for Dr. Henderson argued that the power to amend a Notice of Hearing 
  is limited by s. 40 of the Code to correcting errors and omissions of a clerical 
  nature. In support of this submission, counsel submitted that other statutory 
  schemes expressly grant a broader power of amendment to professional discipline 
  committees. For example, the Saskatchewan Legal Profession Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, 
  c. L-10.1, s. 51(3) enables the hearing committee to amend, add to or substitute 
  the charge in the formal complaint where, during the course of the hearing, 
  the evidence showed that the conduct of the member may warrant a charge that 
  is different from or in addition to the original charge. Thus, if the legislature 
  intended that there be a broader power to amend a Notice of Hearing during the 
  course of a hearing, it would have expressly provided for it.</p>
<p>
  [20] Counsel for Dr. Henderson also relied upon a number of authorities which 
  stand for the proposition that where a statute confers the power to regulate 
  and discipline a member of a profession, the exercise of that power must be 
  strictly complied with.</p>
<p>
  [21] During the course of oral argument, counsel for the Dr. Henderson submitted, 
  apparently for the first time, that this is not an amendment case at all. He 
  submitted that what has occurred here is the joinder of two complaints. For 
  the Discipline Committee to have jurisdiction to hear the second complaint, 
  it must have been expressly referred to the Discipline Committee in accordance 
  with the Code.</p>
<p>
  [22] Under the Code, there are five distinct steps which lead to allegations 
  of professional misconduct or incompetence being placed before the Discipline 
  Committee. If any one step is missed, then the Discipline Committee lacks jurisdiction 
  to hear the matter. The five steps are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) a complaint must be made in writing or recorded on tape, 
  film, disk or other medium [s. 25(4)].</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) a panel of the Complaints Committee must investigate the 
  complaint [s. 25(1)].</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the Registrar must give the member notice of the complaint 
  [s. 25(5)].</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) after investigating the complaint, a panel of the Complaints 
  Committee may, inter alia, refer a specified allegation of professional misconduct 
  or incompetence to the Discipline Committee [s. 26(2)]. </p>
<p class="indent">(v) the chair of the Discipline Committee shall select a panel 
  from among the members of the Committee to hold a hearing of the allegations 
  of a member's professional misconduct or incompetence. [s. 38(1)].</p>
<p>
  [23] Counsel for Dr. Henderson submitted that the first four steps appear to 
  have been followed with respect to Ms. H.'s complaint. However, he submitted 
  that the fifth step - the selection of a panel of members of the Discipline 
  Committee by the chairman was never taken. Instead, the Interim Registrar simply 
  signed an amended Notice of Hearing and sent it to the panel already engaged 
  in hearing the allegations related to the complaint of Ms. S. </p>
<p>
  [24] Counsel for Dr. Henderson also relied upon Hryciuk, supra, in support of 
  his position. In that case, a judge was appointed, on the recommendation of 
  the Judicial Council, to conduct an inquiry under the Courts of Justice Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 into certain allegations of misconduct of Judge Hryciuk 
  involving sexual assault and remarks of a sexual nature. After Judge Hryciuk 
  had completed his defence, three new complaints were heard by the inquiry judge. 
  At the conclusion of the inquiry, the inquiry judge recommended that Judge Hryciuk 
  be removed from office.</p>
<p>
  [25] This court held that the inquiry judge had no statutory authority to hear 
  the new complaints. Abella J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Court, stated 
  at p. 13: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The three new complaints heard by the inquiry judge after Judge Hryciuk had 
  concluded his defence were not first made to, or investigated by, the judicial 
  council. These complaints could not, therefore, be entertained by her. The language 
  of the statute is unambiguous, and leaves no discretion to a judge conducting 
  a s. 50 inquiry to hear new complaints not previously screened by the judicial 
  council. Circumventing the statutory requirement that there be a prior vetting 
  by the judicial council defeats the whole purpose of the legislative scheme 
  and violates the mandatory nature of the two stage process set out in s. 46 
  of the Courts of Justice Act. </p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent">
  The inquiry judge had a specific, narrow mandate under the legislation: to conduct 
  an inquiry, not into the general question of whether Judge Hryciuk should be 
  removed, but into whether he should be removed because of these complaints referred 
  to her by the judicial council, namely, the two complaints referred to in the 
  Order in Council. By hearing three additional complaints, not so referred, she 
  exceeded her jurisdiction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [26] There is an abundance of judicial authority and academic commentary to 
  the effect that professional discipline legislation should be strictly complied 
  with and strictly construed by the courts. For example, see Gardner v. Law Society 
  of British Columbia (1991), 86 D.L.R. (4th) 334 (B.C.C.A.), C. (K.) v. College 
  of Physical Therapists (Alberta) (1999), 72 Alta. L.R. (3d) 77 (Alta. C.A.) 
  at 88, Bechamp v. Manitoba Association of Registered Nurses (1994), 115 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 287 (Man. C.A.) at 288 and P. St. J. Langan, Maxwell on the Interpretation 
  of Statutes, 12th ed. (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 1969) at 245. </p>
<p>
  [27] The underlying policy of the approach of strict construction of professional 
  discipline statutes is based on the theory that the consequences for a person 
  who is subject to the discipline process of his or her professional body carry 
  potentially grave consequences, including the loss of one's livelihood. The 
  ultimate penalty of disbarment or erasure is often referred to as a professional 
  death penalty. Given such consequences, the accused is entitled to have his 
  or her professional regulator strictly adhere to the express provisions of its 
  legislative mandate. Indeed, more than one case has referred to professional 
  discipline proceedings as quasi criminal in nature. See Piller and Association 
  of Ontario Land Surveyors, [2002] O.J. No. 2343 per Cronk J.A. (concurring) 
  at para. 59; College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario v. Boodoosingh (1990), 
  73 O.R. (2d) 478 (H.C.J.) at 479-80 (Div. Ct.), affirm'd (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 
  707, leave to appeal refused (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) xvi (S.C.C.); Re Matheson 
  and College of Nurses of Ontario (1979), 107 D.L.R. (3d) 430 (Ont. Div. Ct.) 
  at 432 and Re Stoangi and Law Society of Upper Canada (1978), 93 D.L.R. (3d) 
  204 (Ont. H.C.J.) 207.</p>
<p>
  [28] Accordingly, I do not accept the position of counsel for the College that 
  the Registrar does not require express statutory authority to execute an amended 
  Notice of Hearing after the hearing has commenced. In my view, the legislature 
  has made it clear in s. 40 of the Code that amendments after the hearing has 
  commenced are to be made by the panel seized with the case and are limited to 
  correcting errors or omissions of a minor or clerical nature.</p>
<p>
  [29] I accept the submission of counsel for Dr. Henderson that what was involved 
  in this case was joinder rather than the amendment of an existing Notice of 
  Hearing. The complaints of Ms. S. and Ms. H., and the allegations of professional 
  misconduct and incompetence derived from them, involved distinct and separate 
  offences. The joinder of the allegations of Ms. H. with those of Ms. S. involved 
  much more than the amendment of the original Notice of Hearing.</p>
<p>
  [30] The College did not follow the procedure set out in s. 38(1) of the Code. 
  The chair of the Discipline Committee did not select the panel to hold a hearing 
  into the allegations involving Ms. H. Rather, that process appears to have been 
  short circuited by the presentation of a newly Amended Notice of Hearing signed 
  by the Interim Registrar. Counsel for the College argued that the original selection 
  of the panel to hear the case against Dr. Henderson, involving the allegations 
  of Ms. S., was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s. 38(1). I disagree. 
  Based on the authorities cited above, including this court's decision in Hryciuk, 
  this is a case which calls for strict compliance with the express terms of the 
  statute. </p>
<p>
  [31] Finally, it is my view that the procedure adopted in this case offends 
  the provisions of s. 8 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where the good character, propriety of conduct or competence of a party is an 
  issue in a proceeding, the party is entitled to be furnished prior to the hearing 
  with reasonable information of any allegations with respect thereto.</p>
<p>
  [32] Counsel for the College, as already indicated, argued that s. 8 does not 
  prevent the adding of allegations of professional misconduct after a hearing 
  has commenced. I do not read the majority of the Divisional Court in Hryciuk 
  as assisting the position advanced by the College. The passage relied upon by 
  counsel for the College at page 709 raises the question of whether s. 8 precludes 
  evidence that comes to light in the course of a hearing as opposed to raising 
  new complaints after a hearing has commenced. That issue is not before us in 
  this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, Dr. Henderson was clearly entitled to be provided with the 
  particulars of the complaint of Ms. H. before the hearing commenced. The fact 
  that such information was not known to the College prior to the start of the 
  hearing does not relieve it of its obligation under s. 8. I appreciate that 
  the result in cases such as this is that the College will be unable to fulfil 
  its s. 8 obligation and therefore will not be able to proceed with new allegations 
  of professional misconduct or incompetence in a hearing which has commenced. 
  This is as it should be. In balancing the interest of the College in prosecuting 
  and punishing acts of professional misconduct and the interest of a physician 
  to a fair hearing when his or her professional life is at stake, the scale must 
  tip in favour of the physician. This is one of those cases. The College made 
  it clear at the outset of the case that it would be seeking the revocation of 
  Dr. Henderson's licence. </p>
<p>
  [34] I agree with the Divisional Court that the Discipline Committee's conclusion 
  that the physician was treated with fairness does not cure the absence of statutory 
  authority for the actions of the Registrar. </p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [35] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal on the merits.</p>
<p>
  COSTS</p>
<p>
  [36] The College appealed the costs order against it in the Divisional Court. 
  In view of the fact that the case raises an issue of some public importance 
  concerning the authority of the Registrar of the College, I would set aside 
  the costs order of the Divisional Court. On the application for leave to appeal 
  to this court, the panel which granted leave referred the costs of that application 
  to us. As to the costs of the appeal, counsel for Dr. Henderson suggested that 
  each side should bear its own costs. I would therefore make no order as to costs 
  of either the application for leave to appeal or the appeal.</p>
