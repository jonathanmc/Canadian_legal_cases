<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant appeals from the dismissal by Justice Jenkins of the motion 
  for certiorari which sought to quash the interlocutory orders of Justices Menzies 
  and Pockele. </p>    <P>
  [2] On certiorari, the question for Justice Jenkins was whether the subject 
  orders were made within the jurisdiction of the two judges. Our jurisdiction 
  in this appeal is similarly limited. Both orders under review dealt in part 
  with the necessity of providing a transcript for the appeal. We agree with Justice 
  Jenkins that those orders were within the jurisdiction of the judges hearing 
  the interlocutory motions. However, the propriety of the orders is not a jurisdictional 
  question and therefore was not a matter for Justice Jenkins or for this court 
  to determine. </p>    <P>
  [3] Justice Pockele also dealt with the question of whether London Health Science 
  Centre was a necessary party to the appeal. To the extent that he answered that 
  question in the affirmative, we interpret his order to mean that because London 
  Health Science Centre was granted intervenor status at the trial, it is entitled 
  to participate in the appeal in relation to the first issue raised on the appeal 
  as to the propriety of adding it as an intervenor. If, on the appeal, that issue 
  is decided in favour of the appellant, then it would follow that there would 
  be no further entitlement of London Science Centre to participate in the appeal. 
  To that extent, we agree with Justice Jenkins that the order of Justice Pockele 
  was made within his jurisdiction. An order as to the proper party status of 
  London Health Science Centre on a final basis is for the judge hearing the appeal. 
  </p>    <P>
  [4] The appellant also asks this court to order a bifurcated proceeding and 
  for that purpose to suspend the requirement that the transcript be ordered. 
  This court has no jurisdiction on this appeal to make that order. We note that 
  Justice Pockele has already decided that he would not suspend the order requiring 
  that the transcript be ordered for the appeal. However, he did suggest that 
  once the transcript is prepared, the parties may consider proceeding in a bifurcated 
  manner. His disposition of those issues was also within his jurisdiction and 
  is not subject to review. </p>    <P>
  [5] For these reasons the appeal is dismissed.</p>
