<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Emile R. Millette of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 27, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] On January 27, 2003, Millette J. stayed two charges of sexual interference 
  with a person under 14 years of age on the basis that the 31-month delay from 
  the time of the respondent's arrest to the proposed trial date violated his 
  right to be tried within a reasonable time as guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the 
  Charter. The Crown appeals.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge found that the delays in this case were mainly due to difficulties 
  encountered by the defence in serving parties with third-party record materials. 
  The trial judge attributed those delays to systemic or Crown delay.</p>
<p>
  [3] In our view, the trial judge erred. We are satisfied that approximately 
  15 months of the total delay of 31 months should not be characterized as systemic 
  delay, nor should it be attributed to the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [4] It is accepted that the reasonable time for intake in the Ontario Court 
  of Justice and in the Superior Court of Justice in this case was 2&frac34; months. 
  That time should be considered neutral. </p>
<p>
  [5] The first trial date was set for the week of June 11, 2001. The defence 
  had failed to prepare its material for a third-party records application and, 
  on June 8, 2001, requested an adjournment. The court adjourned the case to the 
  next assignment court on August 27, 2001. On that day, the court set the second 
  trial date for February 25, 2002. Eight-and-one-half months elapsed between 
  the first trial date and the second trial date. None of that time ought to be 
  attributed to systemic or Crown delay.</p>
<p>
  [6] On February 25, 2002, the case was adjourned again as there was difficulty 
  in locating the complainant. The defence was unable to serve her with the third-party 
  records application. It is worth noting that the defence only set about to serve 
  the complainant approximately two weeks before the trial date. The trial was 
  adjourned until November 25, 2002. The period of time between February 25 and 
  November 25, 2002, perhaps somewhat generously to the defence, may be characterized 
  as systemic delay.</p>
<p>
  [7] On the third trial date, November 25, 2002, the case was adjourned to January 
  6, 2003 at the assignment court, which set the trial date for March 24, 2003. 
  Two reasons played a role in the adjournment. The first related to the defence's 
  third-party records application. On October 8, 2002, the defence wrote the Crown 
  asking for the complainant's address. Approximately two weeks later, the Crown 
  responded, indicating that it was unaware of the complainant's whereabouts. 
  Ultimately, the complainant was located and, on November 18, 2002, seven days 
  before the trial, she was served with the material. However, she subsequently 
  indicated to the court that she wished to retain counsel and was not prepared 
  to proceed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The difficulty with the complainant not having counsel on November 25, 2003 
  may well have been avoided if the defence had set about to serve the complainant 
  before October 8, 2003. As early as January 2001, the defence had indicated 
  to the court its intention to bring a third-party records application. The trial 
  was first adjourned on June 8, 2001 because the defence was not ready to proceed 
  with that application. The trial was adjourned a second time on February 25, 
  2002 because of the difficulty in locating the complainant. After the second 
  adjournment, it would have been reasonable for the defence to anticipate the 
  need to serve the complainant sooner rather than later, recognizing that she 
  might be difficult to locate and that she might wish to retain counsel. Unfortunately, 
  the defence waited for over seven months before taking any steps. Ultimately, 
  the complainant was served seven days before the trial. However, because she 
  had not retained counsel, the trial was adjourned. </p>
<p>
  [9] A second factor that played a somewhat smaller role in the November 25, 
  2002 adjournment was the lack of availability of a Crown witness - N.C. - who 
  was in the hospital. The Crown was prepared to start the trial without Ms. C.; 
  the defence wished her attendance as a witness.</p>
<p>
  [10] On January 27, 2003, upon application by the defence, the trial judge stayed 
  the charges for undue delay. The fourth trial date was therefore never reached.</p>
<p>
  [11] In our view, the circumstances leading to the four-month adjournment on 
  November 25, 2002 are not such that the delay should be treated as systemic 
  or Crown delay.</p>
<p>
  [12] We are satisfied that a total of 15&frac14; months' delay should not be 
  counted as systemic or Crown delay; 2&frac34; months intake, 8&frac12; months 
  between the first and second trial dates and 4 months between the third and 
  fourth trial dates. The balance of approximately 16 months should be considered 
  as systemic delay.</p>
<p>
  [13] What constitutes an acceptable period of systemic or institutional delay 
  will vary depending on the nature and the circumstances of each case. There 
  are no fixed or inflexible time limits. However, based on the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's decisions in R. v. Askov, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199 and R. v. Morin, 
  [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, a period of 8 to 10 months' pre-committal and 6 to 8 months' 
  post-committal is the current &quot;administrative guideline&quot;. After allowing 
  for a reasonable neutral intake period, the permissible range for systemic or 
  institutional delay is between 14 and 18 months for matters to be heard in the 
  Superior Court of Justice.</p>
<p>
  [14] The systemic delays in this case come within the acceptable range for cases 
  to be heard in the Superior Court of Justice. The trial judge erred when he 
  concluded that, in the circumstances, the cumulative delay of 31 months was 
  unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [15] In our view, the delays in this case, properly characterized, do not constitute 
  an unreasonable delay and did not result in a breach of the respondent's s. 
  11(b) Charter rights. We therefore allow the appeal, set aside the stay of proceedings 
  and direct that the case proceed in the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
