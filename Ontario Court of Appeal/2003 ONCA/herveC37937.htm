<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Monique M&eacute;tivier dated February 
  7, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>AUSTIN J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The only issue in each of these appeals is whether the appellants, who 
  are respectively contractor and sub-contractors, are entitled to recover from 
  the Ontario Government retail sales tax they paid when they purchased building 
  materials for the construction of an office building in Ottawa for the federal 
  government.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Each plaintiff paid retail sales tax during construction. Each claimed 
  a refund, the claims were disallowed by the Minister of Finance of Ontario, 
  each filed a notice of objection and the Minister confirmed each disallowance. 
  The disallowances were appealed and all were dismissed by M&eacute;tivier J. 
  on February 7, 2002 following a trial based upon an Agreed Statement of Facts. 
  For the reasons which follow, I agree with the conclusion reached by the trial 
  judge and would dismiss the appeals.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Herv&eacute; Pomerleau Inc. (&quot;Pomerleau&quot;) carries on business 
  as a general contractor in St. Georges in the province of Quebec. At the relevant 
  time Pomerleau had an office in Ottawa. On April 14, 1993 Pomerleau, as general 
  contractor, entered into a contract with the federal government to build &quot;the 
  Mulligan Building&quot; on Walkley Road in Ottawa for $17,898,512.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Ciments et Tuiles de Beauce Inc. (&quot;Ciments&quot;) and Paul Ziebarth 
  Electrical Contractors Limited (&quot;Ziebarth&quot;) each entered into a fixed 
  price subcontract with Pomerleau to complete part of the work involved in erecting 
  the Mulligan Building. The work of all three appellants, Pomerleau, Ciments 
  and Ziebarth was carried out during the period 1993 to 1996.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In the course of that work, each of the appellants purchased materials 
  which were incorporated into the building and each paid Ontario retail sales 
  tax with respect to such purchases. After the work was completed, each requested 
  a refund upon the basis that the appellants were not the end users of the material 
  and that the materials were purchased and consumed by the owner of the building, 
  in this case the federal government, and were thus not subject to Ontario retail 
  sales tax. The claims were disallowed, the disallowances were confirmed and 
  the actions for refunds were dismissed.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The tax in question is imposed by the Retail Sales Tax Act, R.S.O. c. R.-31 
  (the &quot;RSTA&quot;) the relevant parts of which are as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">s. 2(1) Every purchaser of tangible personal property, 
  except the classes thereof referred to in subsection (2), shall pay to Her Majesty 
  in right of Ontario a tax in respect of the consumption or use thereof, computed 
  at the rate of 8 per cent of the fair value thereof.<br>
  s. 1(1) In this Act,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;consumer&quot; or &quot;user&quot; means a person 
  who,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) utilizes or intends to utilize in Ontario tangible 
  personal property or a taxable service for his, her or its own consumption or 
  for the consumption of any other person at his, her or its expense; or <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;consumption&quot; includes the use, and the incorporation 
  into any structure, building or fixture, of tangible personal property including 
  that manufactured by the consumer or further processed or otherwise improved 
  by the consumer and includes the provision by way of promotional distribution 
  of any tangible personal property or taxable service; (&quot;consommation&quot;)<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;purchaser&quot; means a consumer or person who 
  acquires tangible personal property anywhere, or who acquires or receives a 
  taxable service at a sale in Ontario, for his, her or its own consumption or 
  use, or for the consumption or use in Ontario of other persons at his, her or 
  its expense, or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire 
  the property or service for consumption or use in Ontario by the principal or 
  by other persons at his, her or its expense, and includes,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;use&quot; includes storage and the exercise of 
  any right or power over tangible personal property incidental to the ownership 
  of that property, but it does not include the sale of that property at a retail 
  sale or the keeping, retaining or exercising of any right or power over tangible 
  personal property shipped or brought into Ontario for the purpose of transporting 
  it subsequently outside Ontario for use thereafter solely outside Ontario or 
  for the purpose of being processed, fabricated or manufactured into, attached 
  to or incorporated into other tangible personal property to be transported outside 
  Ontario and thereafter used solely outside Ontario; (&quot;usage&quot;)</p>
  
<p>[7] The relevant General Conditions of the contract between Pomerleau and the 
  Queen, by which the subcontractors were also bound, included the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">GC 13.1 Subject to GC 14.7 all materials and plant and 
  the interest of the Contractor in all real property, licences, powers and privileges 
  purchased, used or consumed by the Contractor for the contract shall, after 
  the time of their purchase, use or consumption be the property of Her Majesty 
  for the purposes of the work and they shall continue to be the property of Her 
  Majesty<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">13.1.1 in the case of material, until the Engineer indicates 
  that he is satisfied that it will not be required for the work, and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">13.1.2 in the case of plant, real property, licences, 
  powers and privileges, until the Engineer indicates that he is satisfied that 
  the interest vested in Her Majesty therein is no longer required for the purposes 
  of the work.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">GC 13.2 Material or plant that is the property of Her 
  Majesty by virtue of GC13.1 shall not be taken away from the work site or used 
  or disposed of except for the purposes of the work without the consent of the 
  Engineer.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">GC 13.3 Her Majesty is not liable for loss or damage 
  from any cause to the material or plant referred to in GC13.1 and the contractor 
  is liable for such loss or damage notwithstanding that the material or plant 
  is the property of Her Majesty.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">GC 14.5 Notwithstanding the residency of the contractor, 
  the contractor shall pay any applicable tax arising from or related to the performance 
  of the work under the contract.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">GC 14.7 For the purpose of the payment of any applicable 
  tax or the furnishing of security for the payment of any applicable tax arising 
  from or related to the performance of the work under the contract, the contractor 
  shall, not withstanding the fact that all materials, plant and interest of the 
  contractor in all real property, licences, powers and privileges, have become 
  the property of Her Majesty after the time of purchase, be liable, as a user 
  or consumer, for the payment or for the furnishing of security for the payment 
  of any applicable tax payable, at the time of the use or consumption of that 
  material, plant or interest of the contractor in accordance with the relevant 
  legislation.
</p>
<p>[8] The Agreed Statement of Facts upon which this case was presented contains 
  both the French and English versions of the RSTA and the relevant parts of the 
  contract between Pomerleau and Her Majesty the Queen. It is not suggested that 
  the answer to the question now before the court turns upon or depends upon any 
  difference between the two versions.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The position of the appellants is that by virtue of the terms of the contract 
  between Pomerleau and the federal government (the &quot;Owner&quot;) and specifically 
  GC 13.1, the materials in issue became the property of the Owner immediately 
  upon purchase by Pomerleau and while they were still tangible personal property. 
  As a consequence, it is argued, the Owner became a &quot;purchaser&quot; within 
  the meaning of that word as defined by the RSTA. The materials were subsequently 
  incorporated into the Mulligan Building. This act would constitute &quot;consumption&quot; 
  of the materials within the meaning of that word as defined by the RSTA and 
  the Owner would be the &quot;consumer&quot; within the meaning of that Act. 
  The fact that the Owner, by virtue of its being the federal government, is tax 
  exempt, is irrelevant.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The appellants rely heavily on the decision in Bennett &amp; White (Calgary) 
  Ltd. v. Municipality District of Sugar City (No. 5), [1951] 4 D.L.R. 129 (P.C.) 
  to support their position. In that case, Bennett &amp; White, a contractor, 
  was engaged by the federal government to construct a dam. As in the instant 
  case, the contract provided that &quot;machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment 
  provided by the contractor . . . for the works . . . and not rejected . . . 
  shall from the time of their being so provided become and until the final completion 
  . . . be the property of His Majesty for the purposes of the said works&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The municipality was entitled and required to assess and tax both personal 
  and real property within its boundaries. In so doing it assessed both real and 
  personal property against Bennett &amp; White. Bennett &amp; White responded 
  to the effect that the property in question was subject to the contract with 
  the federal government and as such not subject to tax.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] The trial judge found in favour of Bennett &amp; White. His decision was 
  affirmed by the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division, but reversed by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada. It in turn was reversed by the Privy Council.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The person liable to pay the municipal tax was the &quot;owner&quot; or 
  the person &quot;in legal possession&quot; of the property. The Privy Council 
  held that the Crown was at all material times the owner of the property in question 
  by virtue of the contractual provision summarized above. The court went on to 
  comment on the legal positions of the Crown and the contractor as follows, at 
  146:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The true position, in their Lordships' view, is that 
  while the delivery on the Crown site was a delivery to the Crown and vested 
  ownership in the Crown, there was a notional or actual bailment or redelivery 
  of possession to the builders for the purpose of carrying out the building contract.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">If, therefore, no other considerations were involved 
  than those considered so far, the appellants [Bennett &amp; White] might be 
  judged to have been validly assessed qua persons in legal possession.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The Privy Council went on to conclude at p. 150 that &quot;this leaves 
  it open to doubt whether 'person in possession' covers a person in possession 
  of Crown property&quot; and concluded that the assessment in issue was invalid.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The appellants rely on this decision for the proposition that the Owner 
  became the owner of the materials when the materials were purchased by the appellants, 
  subject to &quot;a notional or actual bailment or re delivery of possession&quot; 
  of the materials to the appellants &quot;for the purpose of carrying out the 
  building contract&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The respondent Minister's position is that regard must be had not only 
  to who is a &quot;purchaser&quot; within the meaning of that word as defined 
  by the RSTA but also to who is a &quot;consumer&quot; within the meaning of 
  that Act. This is so because &quot;purchaser&quot; is defined as meaning &quot;a 
  consumer or person who acquires tangible personal property . . . for his, her 
  or its own consumption or use or for the consumption or use in Ontario of other 
  persons at his, her or its expense&quot;. &quot;Consumption&quot; is also defined 
  by the RSTA as including &quot;. . . . incorporation into any structure, building 
  or fixture, of tangible personal property . . . .&quot;. The Minister argues 
  that only the appellants fit the definitions of both &quot;purchaser&quot; and 
  &quot;consumer&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The Minister relies on the decisions in Cairns Construction Ltd. v. Saskatchewan, 
  [1960] S.C.R. 619 and Installations Electriques, G. Bradley Ltee. v. Nova Scotia 
  (Attorney General), [1987] N.S.J. No. 77 (N.S.S.C. (T.D.)) aff'd [1987] N.S.J. 
  No. 243 (N.S.S.C.(.A.D.)). In Cairns, what was in effect a retails sales tax 
  was imposed by the Education and Hospitalization Tax Act, R.S.S. 153, c. 61 
  s. 35. Cairns was a building contractor. He constructed houses, including some 
  built in part from component or prefabricated sections Cairns bought from others. 
  Cairns argued first that the tax was ultra vires and second, if intra vires, 
  that it had no application to his purchases of component or prefabricated parts 
  as he was not the end user.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The ultra vires argument turned on whether the tax was direct or indirect, 
  the province only having jurisdiction to impose direct taxes. It was decided 
  by the trial judge, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of 
  Canada that the tax was direct and thus intra vires the province.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] The second question turned upon the meaning of the words &quot;consumption 
  or use&quot; in the statute and whether Cairns' purchase of the prefabricated 
  parts for incorporation into houses being built for the purposes of sale constituted 
  such &quot;consumption or use&quot;. A &quot;retail sale&quot; was defined in 
  the Act as meaning a &quot;sale to a consumer or user for purposes of consumption 
  or use, and not for resale as tangible personal property&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Martland, J. speaking for the Supreme Court of Canada answered the question 
  as follows at p. 629:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the appellant was a &quot;user&quot; 
  of goods in question here and was made liable for payment of tax under s. 5(2) 
  of the Act. I would agree that the intention of the Act is to impose the tax 
  upon the final consumer or user of the personal property purchased. It was upon 
  that basis that the Privy Council upheld the New Brunswick legislation under 
  consideration in the Conlon case. But it also appears to me that a person who 
  purchases personal property and incorporates it into something else, in the 
  process of which it losses its own identity as personal property, is the final 
  user of that personal property so incorporated. The nails which were hammered 
  into the structure, the paint placed on the walls, or the shingles on the roof 
  were finally used for the purposes for which they were created when they became 
  a part of the building. Equally, the prefabricated parts were finally used when 
  they were incorporated into the houses which the appellant constructed. The 
  purchaser of a house would not thereafter use them as component parts. He would 
  make use of the completed house.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] That passage is sufficient to dispose of any argument that the appellants 
  are not liable because they were not the end users of the materials in question, 
  an argument which was raised earlier in these proceedings but not pursued in 
  this court.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] That passage is also referred to and relied upon by the trial judge, Nathanson 
  J. in his decision in Installations Electrique (supra). The plaintiff contractor 
  there was in much the same position as the three appellants in this case. He 
  claimed a refund of sales tax paid on materials purchased for use in the performance 
  of contracts with the Crown for the construction of airports at Sydney and Greenwood, 
  Nova Scotia.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] In passing it should be noted that the instant case was tried on an Agreed 
  Statement of Facts, paragraph 6 of which refers to the &quot;Construction Agreement 
  drafted in French&quot; as schedule &quot;A&quot; to the Agreed Statement of 
  Facts and to the &quot;English Version&quot;. Only the French version of the 
  agreement is signed and it is between Pomerleau and &quot;Sa Majest&eacute; 
  la Reine du Chef du Canada repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e par le ministre de Travaux 
  publics Canada&quot;. The &quot;English version&quot; is between &quot;Her Majesty 
  the Queen represented by the Minister of Public Works acting through Defence 
  Construction (1951) Limited&quot;. The anomaly is noteworthy because the contract 
  in issue in the Nova Scotia case is also with Defence Construction (1951) Limited 
  and the limited references in the reasons of the trial judge to the provisions 
  of the contract are in precisely the same language as is found in Schedule A 
  to the Agreed Statement of Facts in this case.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] As in the instant case and in Cairns, the issue in the Nova Scotia case 
  was liability for a retail sales tax, imposed there under the Health Services 
  Act. Three issues were raised, two of which are of interest in the instant case. 
  The first was that the contractor was not liable for retail sales tax because 
  the contractor was acting as agent for the Crown. The trial judge analysed the 
  evidence and found against the contractor in that regard. In the instant case 
  any suggestion of agency is ruled out by paragraph 29 of the Agreed Statement 
  of Facts which provides that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of the construction of the Mulligan Building, 
  neither HPI nor Ciments et Tuiles nor Ziebarth were acting as an agent of the 
  Crown in Right of Canada.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] &quot;Purchaser&quot;, &quot;consumption&quot; and &quot;use&quot; were 
  defined in the Health Tax Act of Nova Scotia as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1.(g) 'purchaser' means any person who acquires tangible 
  personal property at a sale in the Province for his own consumption or use &#133;&quot; 
  or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such property 
  for consumption, or use by such principal or other persons at his expense, . 
  . .<br>
  1(ba) 'consumption' or 'use' includes &#133; the incorporation into any structure, 
  building or fixture, of tangible personal property<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The trial judge dealt with the question as to identity of the purchaser, 
  consumption and use as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">These definitions leave me with no doubt that the plaintiff, 
  and not the federal Crown, was the purchaser of the construction materials for 
  the Sydney and Greenwood airports. Section 13.1 of the General Conditions of 
  the contracts which provides that all material acquired by the contractor for 
  the contract work becomes the property of Her Majesty for the purposes of the 
  work as of time of acquisition makes it clear that the acquirer was the plaintiff 
  and that the material did not become the property of Her Majesty until it was 
  first acquired by the contractor. The acquirer was not the federal Crown.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the plaintiff acquired the material for 
  its own consumption or use. Those words include the incorporation of materials 
  into a structure. Note that the structure need not be owned by the person who 
  incorporates the materials into it; it may be owned by another person. Here, 
  the plaintiff acquired the materials for the purpose of incorporating them into 
  structures at the airports. The plaintiff was the purchaser.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The trial judge then referred to the decision in Cairns and quoted from 
  Martland, J. as set out earlier in these reasons. <br>
</p>
<p>[28] The plaintiff's appeal from the decision of Nathanson, J. was dismissed, 
  the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia concluding its brief 
  endorsement with the statement that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In our opinion, no error was committed by Mr. Justice 
  Nathanson . . . . .<br>
</p>
<p>[29] In the instant case, the trial judge dealt with Bennett &amp; White, supra, 
  as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Bennett &amp; White, supra, is not helpful in the case 
  at bar. It can be distinguished on its facts. It focused on the question of 
  whether the Crown, or the contractor, was an &quot;owner&quot; or &quot;a person 
  in possession&quot;. The party, found to be either or both, would be assessable 
  under the taxing legislation, in that case. In the case at bar, the question 
  is whether the Crown, or the appellant in each case, is the ultimate or exclusive 
  user of the materials.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to what was urged on this Court by the appellants, 
  this Privy Council decision is merely persuasive, and I decline to follow it.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] The trial judge went on to say that she preferred the reasoning in Installations 
  Electriques and found that it was in accord with the Cairns decision and &quot;entirely 
  applicable to the cases at bar. The purchasers are the appellants; their consumption 
  consisted of incorporating the materials in the building. They are the users 
  targeted by the Retail Sales Tax Act&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The trial judge went on to deal with the nature of the Crown's interest 
  in the material purchased by the appellants as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I have also rejected the submission that the transfer 
  of property rights to the Crown equates to the sale of the property, and this, 
  before the materials were &quot;used&quot;. The language of the contract makes 
  it clear that the transfer of property to the Crown does not mean that the appellants 
  did not use or consume the materials. On the contrary, the appellants, as purchasers, 
  had the obligation to incorporate these materials into a building, to thus, 
  use and consume them in so doing - after which any surplus materials will be 
  theirs. The transitory nature of the incomplete property rights, held by the 
  Crown, does not affect this reality. The materials were acquired for the appellants' 
  own use, as set out in the definition in the Retail Sales Tax.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] I agree entirely with the reasoning of the trial judge as set out above 
  and on that basis would dismiss the appeal. On the case as pleaded and argued 
  I see no need to further define or analyze the precise limits of the Crown's 
  interest in the materials in issue.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Reference should be made to a Quebec decision relied upon by the appellants 
  in this court but not mentioned in the reasons of the trial judge. In January 
  1985, Construction M.R.C. Lt&eacute;e (&quot;MRC&quot;) contracted with the 
  Federal Crown for the construction of a laboratory for Agriculture Canada at 
  St. Hyacinthe, in Qu&eacute;bec. The contract included the same clauses CG 13.1, 
  13.2 and 13.3 as in the contract under consideration. The contract did not include 
  clause CG 14.7.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] The same issue respecting liability for the payment of retail sales tax 
  arose. MRC argued that it had paid the tax in error because the Federal Crown 
  was the last purchaser prior to incorporation of the material into the laboratory. 
  Cimon J. (Construction M.R.C. Lt&eacute;e c. Le Sous-Minstre Du Revenu du Qu&eacute;bec, 
  Quebec Court, #500-02-028187-891, February 10, 1993), deciding in favour of 
  the contractor ruled as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court is of the view, through the interpretation 
  of the words materials and plant set forth in paragraph CG1 of the contract 
  (R-1), that the transfer of ownership under the aforementioned paragraph CG13 
  is equal to a sale of movable property within the meaning of the Act and, consequently, 
  to a resale of the same property to the Federal Crown.<br>
  In its notes (p. 36), the Respondent maintains that a resale requires two: a 
  purchase and a resale, which is not the case in this matter. The Court does 
  not agree, because it is clear that for a transfer of property to the Federal 
  Crown, the Appellant must first have acquired it - necessarily implying a purchase 
  before resale.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Respondent makes much of the fact that Federal Crown 
  representatives explained to the Court the reasons why paragraph CG13 was stipulated 
  in the contract. In the view of the Court, it is of little importance to know 
  the reasons the Federal Crown originally had in mind in drafting that clause, 
  because regardless of the reasons, they absolutely cannot operate to restrict 
  the legal significance thereof. On thing is certain, the Federal Crown wished 
  to acquire, pursuant to a clause in its contract, ownership of the movables 
  purchased, used or provided by its contractor for the works, thus becoming the 
  last purchaser before they were incorporated in its immovable.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Respondent also argued the temporary nature of the 
  ownership attributed to the Federal Crown by paragraph CG13 in an attempt to 
  persuade the Court that the transaction cannot be a resale within the meaning 
  of the Act because of the limited nature of the ownership of the property transferred 
  to the Federal Crown. This is not relevant given the broad meaning of the word 
  sale cited above. Moreover, nothing in the testimony or documentary evidence, 
  indicates that, as stipulated in the aforementioned paragraph, the Federal Crown's 
  Engineer gave his written consent, and, even had he done so, this would not 
  have changed anything, given the broad meaning given to the word sale in the 
  Act.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In the same vein, Respondent refers to clause 8.1 of 
  paragraph CG8 of the General Conditions of the contract, which requires that 
  the Appellant indemnify the Federal Crown against recourses instituted by suppliers. 
  Respondent maintains that if paragraph CG13 constitutes a resale of the material 
  to the Federal Crown, if the price thereof were to remain unpaid, it would be 
  necessary to wait for the suppliers to institute a claim against the Crown as 
  owner; however, it submits that under that clause, the contractor bears the 
  risk and is liable for any default on its part, in other words, we are not dealing 
  with a resale within the meaning of the Act.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court does not agree with that argument, because, 
  in allowing that clause 8.1 could apply to the Respondent's assumption, such 
  a ruling would not operate to deprive the supplier from exercising any rights 
  that it may have as unpaid vendor against the Federal Crown; the latter could 
  then go against the Appellant under that clause; that is why it is there!<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Counsel for the appellants advised the court that this decision was appealed 
  and that the parties then settled. More importantly, as pointed out by counsel 
  for the respondent, the definition of &quot;sale&quot; and &quot;retail sale&quot; 
  in the relevant Quebec act did not include, as the Ontario act does, the concept 
  of &quot;consumption&quot;. As a consequence, the decision in MCR provides no 
  assistance in the instant case.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] General Condition 14.7 which is set out in paragraph 7 of these reasons 
  is relevant to the issue of costs. In Installations Electriques Nathanson, J. 
  pointed out that the tender documents contained language to the same effect:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We understand and agree that all applicable Federal, 
  Provincial and Municipal taxes, permits and fees are our responsibility and 
  are included in our tender price&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] In the light of these contractual provisions I see no reason why costs 
  should not follow the event. I would award costs against the appellants and 
  in favour of the Crown on a partial indemnity basis. I am advised by counsel 
  that they have agreed on the quantum of costs at $10,000 at the trial level 
  and in the same amount for this appeal I see no objection to awards in those 
  amounts and I would so order.<br>
