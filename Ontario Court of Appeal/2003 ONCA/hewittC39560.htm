<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown applies for leave to appeal the decision of Belch J., sitting 
  as summary conviction appeal court, allowing the respondent's appeal from his 
  conviction for assault by Wright J. in the Ontario Court of Justice. For the 
  reasons that follow, we grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and restore 
  the conviction.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] This is a case of domestic assault. The respondent and the female complainant 
  had lived together for about a year in a somewhat stormy relationship. The charge 
  against the respondent arose from an early morning altercation concerning which 
  the respondent and the complainant gave very different versions at trial, each 
  essentially claiming to have been the victim of an assault by the other. The 
  police officers who attended in response to the respondent's call, laid no charges 
  and were called as defence witnesses. However, within a day of the incident, 
  the complainant saw her doctor who was concerned by her injuries and called 
  the police following which charges were laid.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant and rejected that 
  of the respondent. He found that despite her intoxication and lack of cooperation 
  with the police at the time, the complainant's version of the incident, &quot;warts 
  and all&quot;, was supported by the injuries she had sustained. The trial judge 
  rejected the evidence of the respondent &quot;as not being capable of raising 
  a reasonable doubt&quot; and found that &quot;on the totality of the evidence&quot; 
  he was &quot;satisfied that the Crown has proved all essential elements beyond 
  a reasonable doubt.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Before the summary conviction appeal judge, the respondent argued that 
  the verdict was unreasonable, that different standards of scrutiny were applied 
  to the evidence of the respondent and the complainant, and that the trial judge 
  failed to resolve conflicts in the evidence and misapprehended essential portions 
  of the evidence. The appeal judge reviewed the evidence in some detail, noted 
  that the trial judge's findings of credibility were entitled to &quot;great 
  deference&quot; but also observed that an appeal court was entitled to overturn 
  an unreasonable verdict, even one based on findings of credibility. The key 
  portion of the appeal judge's reasons read as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Here, two police officers, one a 25 and the other a 21 year 
  veteran of the force, are called not by the Crown but by the defence. One testifies 
  the complainant had not been straightforward with him, the other says she was 
  evasive. Both testify the evidence at the scene was more consistent with the 
  appellant's evidence than that of the complainant. She is under the influence 
  of alcohol, he is not. She is agitated, he is calm. There is no mention of the 
  police officers' evidence in the reasons of the trial judge. The injuries to 
  the complainant's right buttock are singled out and found to be caused by a 
  hand, yet no explanation is offered for the fact that everyone, including the 
  complainant described the right buttock while the photograph is of the left.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am satisfied the testimony of the police officers raises a 
  reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant, and therefore I cannot support 
  the verdict of the trial judge as reasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In our view, the summary conviction appeal judge erred in law by failing 
  to apply the correct standard of review for unreasonable verdict and instead 
  simply substituted his opinion for that of the trial judge. The test is whether 
  the verdict is one that a properly instructed trier of fact, acting judicially, 
  could reasonably have rendered. This requires an appellate court to review, 
  analyze, and within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence 
  to ensure that the result &quot;does not conflict with the bulk of judicial 
  experience&quot;. However, it does not permit a de novo assessment of the evidence, 
  and an appellate court may not substitute its own view as to whether or not 
  there is a reasonable doubt, nor interfere as a result of any &quot;vague unease, 
  or lingering or lurking doubt&quot; that it might have: see R. v. Biniaris (2000), 
  143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). Rather that focus on the reasonableness of the verdict 
  according to this standard, the appeal judge essentially retried the case and 
  substituted his own view that the evidence of the police officers raised a reasonable 
  doubt.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] Before us, the respondent submitted that the trial judge made material 
  errors with regard to the evidence, particularly that of Dr. Molot. We are satisfied 
  that the trial judge did not err in this regard.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and restore the 
  conviction.</p>
