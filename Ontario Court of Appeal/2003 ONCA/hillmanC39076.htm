<p>On appeal from the order of Justice K.A. Langdon, dated September 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The motion judge concluded that the appellant could not assert the constructive 
  trust claims advanced in the proposed amendments to her claim because those 
  claims were res judicata based on a consent order made in previous proceedings 
  between the parties in Ireland. We are not satisfied that the respondent established 
  that the terms of the consent order extended to the claims which the appellant 
  seeks to advance. While it may be that the parties agreed to settle all claims, 
  including the claims the appellant now seeks to advance, at the time they entered 
  into the consent order in Ireland, the evidence on that point is conflicting 
  and it can only be resolved at trial. </p><P>
  [2] There is also conflicting evidence as to the respondent's domicile which, 
  in our view, can only be resolved at trial. Consequently, the respondent's claim 
  that the Ontario court had no jurisdiction to determine the constructive trust 
  claims as they related to the respondent's pensions, can only be determined 
  at trial. In so holding, we leave open the question whether the respondent's 
  domicile will necessarily be determinative of the court's jurisdiction to hear 
  either or both of the constructive trust claims which the appellant seeks to 
  advance at trial. The trial judge will decide that question. </p><P>
  [3] We also reject the respondent's contention that Ontario is not the appropriate 
  forum in which to litigate the constructive trust claims. In our view, the factors 
  in favour of Ireland as the appropriate forum are more than counterbalanced 
  by the fact that it is acknowledged that Ontario is the appropriate forum for 
  the determination of the appellant's support claims. As the support claim is 
  properly before the Ontario court, we cannot agree that the court should decline 
  to hear the constructive trust claims.</p><P>
  [4] The appeal is allowed and the order of the motion judge is set aside.</p><P>
  [5] Costs of the motion will be left to the trial judge. The appellant is entitled 
  to her costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $7,000.</p>
