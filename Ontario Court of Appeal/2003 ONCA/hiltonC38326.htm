<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Richard G. Byers of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 22, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] Michael Hilton worked for Norampac Inc., a paper mill operator in Trenton, 
  for fifteen years. He was an excellent worker. The company promoted him from 
  a unionized employee to a stock prep foreman and then to a tour foreman. His 
  work schedule included two weekends per month. In May 2000, Norampac required 
  its tour foremen to be on-call every sixth weekend and to do so without any 
  additional pay. Hilton refused, citing child care commitments. When he would 
  not reconsider his refusal, Norampac fired him.</p>
<p>
  [2] Hilton sued for wrongful dismissal. The parties agreed on most of the relevant 
  facts and on damages of $74,000. The trial judge, Byers J., found that the on-call 
  requirement amounted to a material change in Hilton's contract of employment, 
  and that, therefore, he had been wrongfully dismissed. Norampac raises four 
  grounds of appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. In finding that the on-call requirement was a material change 
  to the employment contract, the trial judge went beyond the terms of the parties' 
  agreed statement of facts.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Alternatively, the trial judge erred in finding that the 
  on-call requirement constituted a material change to the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge's conduct raised a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Hilton breached his duty to mitigate his damages by refusing 
  the on-call requirement during the notice period or until he found another job.</p>
<p>
  B. Discussion</p>
<p> <strong>First Ground of Appeal:</strong> Did the trial judge go beyond the 
  parties' agreed statement of facts?</p>
<p> <strong>Second Ground of Appeal:</strong> Did the trial judge err in finding 
  that the on-call requirement was a material change to Hilton's contract of employment?</p>
<p>
  [3] These first two grounds of appeal are best considered together. Norampac 
  contends that the parties agreed to limit the trial judge's fact-finding and 
  that in finding a material change to the employment contract, the trial judge 
  exceeded the limits of the parties' agreement. Alternatively, Norampac contends 
  that, on the agreed facts, the on-call requirement did not constitute a material 
  change to Hilton's employment contract. </p>
<p>
  [4] To put these contentions in context I will briefly review the agreed facts 
  and then what the parties asked the trial judge to do. The following is a summary 
  of the agreed facts, and a few additional relevant facts that were not contested. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] Hilton began working for Norampac in 1985. He was promoted to stock prep 
  foreman in 1990, and to tour foreman in 1994. As tour foreman he supervised 
  twelve production employees. He worked twelve-hour shifts, and at the end of 
  each shift he had to arrange a smooth transition to the next shift, which typically 
  took a half an hour to an hour and a half. Up until April 2000, Hilton's terms 
  of employment had not required that he be on-call. </p>
<p>
  [6] However, beginning in May 2000, Norampac required all four of its tour foremen 
  and two superintendents to be on-call on average every sixth weekend from 5:00 
  p.m. Friday to 6:00 a.m. Monday. The company gave two reasons for the on-call 
  requirement: relief for its two superintendents, who until then had been on-call 
  every weekend; and &quot;cross-over training&quot; for the tour foremen. </p>
<p>
  [7] The posted schedule did not stipulate any additional compensation for being 
  on-call. Later, Norampac offered an additional day off, usually the Friday after 
  an on-call weekend, but no additional pay.</p>
<p>
  [8] The other three tour foremen accepted the on-call requirement, but Hilton 
  refused to do so. He had four young children, his wife had just started a part-time 
  job that required her to work weekends, and he did not trust outside caregivers. 
  He therefore told the company that family commitments prevented him from taking 
  on this added job responsibility. </p>
<p>
  [9] Hilton told Norampac of his refusal to be on-call verbally on May 2, 2000, 
  in writing on May 10 and at a meeting with management on May 24. On May 25, 
  he received a letter from the company giving him one week at home with pay to 
  reconsider his refusal. On May 31, he wrote the president of Norampac to explain 
  his situation. Hilton noted in his letter that he had declined a promotion to 
  paper machine superintendent the previous year because of his family obligations. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] Hilton met with management on June 5, 2000. He maintained his refusal to 
  be on-call on weekends. He proposed being on-call during the week, which the 
  company refused. He then asked to be demoted to a union position, which the 
  company also refused. The two sides exchanged letters the same day. In his letter, 
  Hilton reiterated: &quot;I cannot commit to my scheduled weekends off due to 
  the fact that I have small children and responding on short notice would be 
  impossible.&quot; Management responded by saying that he had until noon on June 
  7 to reconsider his refusal. Hilton had to take his daughter to the hospital 
  during the evening of June 6. He did not respond to the company's ultimatum. 
  On June 7, Norampac fired Hilton on the ground that he had &quot;refused to 
  accept the duties and responsibilities of tour foreman.&quot; It gave him no 
  severance pay. </p>
<p>
  [11] In their agreed statement of facts, the parties asked the trial judge to 
  decide two questions. They asked him to decide whether Hilton knew that Norampac 
  had offered an extra day off in compensation for the on-call requirement. The 
  trial judge answered that Hilton did not know. The parties also asked the trial 
  judge to decide how long a tour foreman would typically spend at the paper mill 
  during an on-call weekend. He answered by stating that on average an on-call 
  tour foreman would receive two to three calls and would be at the mill for three 
  hours. </p>
<p>
  [12] In their agreed statement, the parties stipulated that the trial judge 
  was &quot;to limit any further finding of fact&quot; to these two questions. 
  Norampac relies on this stipulation in submitting that the trial judge went 
  outside the parties' agreement in finding a material change to the employment 
  contract. In effect, Norampac submits that in making this finding the trial 
  judge exceeded his jurisdiction. It says that but for this stipulation it would 
  have called further evidence.</p>
<p>
  [13] I do not accept this submission. The parties agreed that the on-call requirement 
  had not been a term of Hilton's employment contract. In the light of that agreed 
  fact, the trial judge was entitled to decide whether the introduction of the 
  on-call requirement amounted to a material change in the employment contract. 
  In so deciding he did not exceed his jurisdiction. He simply applied the law 
  on constructive dismissal to the facts before him. To accede to Norampac's submission 
  would have required the trial judge to abdicate his duty and his authority to 
  resolve Hilton's claim, which was a claim for wrongful dismissal based on a 
  material change to his employment contract. </p>
<p>
  [14] Alternatively, Norampac submits that the trial judge erred in holding that 
  the on-call requirement constituted a material change to the contract. Norampac 
  argues that it was entitled to change Hilton's work schedule, and that when 
  he refused to comply with the change, it could dismiss him for cause. I do not 
  agree with this submission.</p>
<p>
  [15] The question the trial judge had to answer was whether, viewed from the 
  perspective of a reasonable person in Hilton's situation, Norampac's unilateral 
  imposition of the on-call requirement substantially altered the essential terms 
  of Hilton's employment contract. See Farber v. Royal Trust Co., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 
  846 at 858. Or, in the trial judge's language, was the on-call requirement &quot;under 
  all the circumstances, a material change&quot; to Hilton's contract? In answering 
  this question affirmatively, the trial judge emphasized that the on-call requirement 
  meant that some months Hilton would have had to work three weekends. The trial 
  judge also held that, although he accepted Hilton's explanation for refusing 
  the on-call requirement, his reasons were irrelevant. He was entitled to refuse 
  for no reason at all. Thus, Norampac could dismiss Hilton only by giving him 
  reasonable notice. </p>
<p>
  [16] The question of whether the on-call requirement constituted a material 
  change to the contract is a question of mixed fact and law. Norampac does not 
  argue that the trial judge applied the law incorrectly. His finding of a material 
  change turns on his assessment of the facts, and, in my view, has little precedential 
  value. Therefore, on appeal his finding is entitled to deference. See Housen 
  v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at 256ff. </p>
<p>
  [17] It seems to me that a trier of fact could reasonably find that the unilateral 
  imposition of additional hours of weekend work without pay materially changed 
  the terms of Hilton's employment. See Randall Scott Echlin &amp; Jennifer M. 
  Fantini, Quitting for Good Reason (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2001) at 406ff. 
  As this finding was available to the trial judge on the evidentiary record before 
  him, I see no basis to interfere with it. Accordingly, I would not give effect 
  to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  Third Ground of Appeal: Did the trial judge's conduct raise a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias?</p>
<p>
  [18] After Hilton gave his evidence in chief, but before he was cross-examined, 
  and before Norampac led its own evidence, the trial judge &quot;as is my practice&quot; 
  gave the parties &quot;some comments&quot; on what he had heard so far. He said: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Sit down. As is my practice, I propose to make some 
  comments on what I've heard so far. And depending on how the facts unfold, they 
  may or may not be helpful to counsel. I'm not inviting an argument. I'm just 
  giving you some comments and some thoughts. </p>
<p class="indent">Assuming for the moment that I accept the plaintiff's evidence 
  as he has described it, and it looks to be generally supported by the written 
  material, then I don't think he was entitled to be fired. </p>
<p class="indent">Now that's all very nice. The more difficult problem is, the 
  consequences. This fellow was apparently a real good worker, and went out and 
  got another job. And got some unemployment insurance. So they got to be taken 
  off things. </p>
<p class="indent">So my sense is that we might be looking at the range of 15 months, 
  less deductions. So we can't be looking at that much money. We cannot be looking 
  at that much money. And we're looking at another two to three days of trial 
  and the costs of that.</p>
<p>
  [19] Norampac submits that the trial judge's comments show that he had prejudged 
  both Hilton's credibility and the merits of the case. Although acknowledging 
  that the threshold for a finding of bias is high, Norampac contends that the 
  trial judge's comments crossed the line. See Marchand (Litigation Guardian of) 
  v. Public General Hospital Society of Chatham (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.) 
  at para. 131; R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484.</p>
<p>
  [20] The trial judge's comments would have been far better left unsaid, but 
  they do not show that he had prejudged the case. His words show that his views 
  were tentative. Thus, he prefaced his comments by saying &quot;depending on 
  how the facts unfold&quot;. And he said nothing further during the course of 
  the trial that suggested he had closed his mind to Norampac's position. Moreover, 
  at the trial Norampac's counsel made no objection to the trial judge's comments. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] This case differs from Osterbauer v. Ash Temple Ltd. (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 
  697, where this court found that a trial judge's interventions gave the impression 
  that he had prejudged the case and thus met the test for reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. In that case, the trial judge intervened numerous times, expressed 
  firm views about the merits of the case and prevented the losing party from 
  fully advancing its position. Here, the trial judge intervened only once, the 
  views he expressed were not firmly held, and he did not prevent Norampac from 
  fully presenting its case. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [22] That said, it seems to me that the trial judge's &quot;practice&quot; is 
  unwise. In a case like this one, where his decision replicates his preliminary 
  comments, the losing party may justifiably feel aggrieved. In other circumstances, 
  with little more, a finding of bias might be made out. In my view, the trial 
  judge would better serve the interests of justice by discontinuing this &quot;practice&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  Fourth Ground of Appeal: Did Hilton breach his duty to mitigate by refusing 
  the on-call requirement?</p>
<p>
  [23] Norampac submits that to fulfil his duty to mitigate his damages, Hilton 
  was obliged to accept the on-call requirement during the period of reasonable 
  notice or until he found another job. It relies on this court's judgment in 
  Mifsud v. MacMillan Bathurst Inc. (1989), 70 O.R. (2d) 701 at 709-10, where 
  McKinlay J.A. discussed the employee's obligation to mitigate by accepting a 
  different position within the company - in Mifsud, a demotion albeit with no 
  loss of pay: </p>
<p class="indent"> Is the situation substantially different when an employer does 
  not wish to dismiss an employee but, being unsatisfied with his performance, 
  or for some other valid reason, wishes to place him in a different position 
  at the same salary? Why should it not be considered reasonable for the employee 
  to mitigate his damages by working at the other position for the period of reasonable 
  notice, or at least until he has found alternative employment which he accepts 
  in mitigation?</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the transfer to a new position may constitute 
  in law a constructive dismissal does not eliminate the obligation of the employee 
  to look at the new position offered and evaluate it as a means of mitigating 
  damages. In all cases, comparison should be made to the contractual entitlement 
  of the employer to give reasonable notice and leave the employee in his current 
  position while a search is made for alternative employment. </p>
<p>
  [24] Hilton did not have a similar obligation to accept the on-call requirement. 
  As McKinlay J.A. pointed out at 710: &quot;[T]here are many situations where 
  the facts would substantiate a constructive dismissal but where it would be 
  patently unreasonable to expect an employee to accept continuing employment 
  with the same employer in mitigation of his damages.&quot; This is one of those 
  situations. The trial judge implicitly found that it would not have been reasonable 
  to expect Hilton to comply with the on-call requirement. I therefore would not 
  give effect to Norampac's argument on mitigation. </p>
<p>C. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [25] I would not interfere with the trial judge's finding that the on-call requirement 
  was a unilateral and material change to the employment contract, which Hilton 
  was entitled to refuse to accept. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. Hilton 
  is entitled to his costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. I would 
  fix those costs at $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services 
  Tax. </p>
