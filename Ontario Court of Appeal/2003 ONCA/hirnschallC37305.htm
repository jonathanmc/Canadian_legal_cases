<p>On appeal by Josef Hirnschall from the conviction imposed by Justice Panet 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated November 6, 2001, 
  the Crown seeking leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Justice Panet 
  on December 11, 2001.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] On October 13, 1998, the Rooney Hotel, a local landmark in the town of Eganville, 
  burned to the ground. The appellant, Mr. Hirnschall, was charged with intentionally 
  or recklessly setting the fire. He pleaded not guilty and was tried by a jury. 
  He represented himself. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown presented a strong, if not overwhelming, case. Mr. Hirnschall 
  held a $250,000 first mortgage on the hotel. The owner of the hotel had gone 
  bankrupt and the property had no equity. Mr. Hirnschall and his family were 
  the beneficiaries under the hotel's insurance policy in an amount that exceeded 
  the mortgage debt. The policy would have expired the day after the fire. </p>
<p>
  [3] The evening of the fire, the appellant was seen going to and from the hotel 
  in a conspicuous disguise. He twice went into a shed at the back of the hotel 
  - the exact spot where the fire started. The door to the shed was locked both 
  before and after the fire. The appellant had a key. The expert evidence ruled 
  out accidental causes of the fire. </p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Hirnschall testified and denied that he had set the fire. The jurors 
  obviously rejected his denial. They convicted him of arson. The trial judge 
  imposed an eighteen month conditional sentence, on lenient terms, which permitted 
  Mr. Hirnschall to spend about eight months of his sentence with his family in 
  Austria. He has now served his sentence. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks either an acquittal 
  or a new trial. The Crown cross-appeals against Mr. Hirnschall's sentence. It 
  asks that he be incarcerated and that he be ordered to pay restitution. For 
  the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal. 
  </p>
<p>
  B. The Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant argued five grounds of appeal. We called on the Crown only 
  on the first ground: the appellant's submission that &quot;oath helping&quot; 
  infected the trial and the trial judge neither stopped it nor warned the jury 
  to disregard it.</p>
<p>
  [7] This submission refers to two pieces of evidence: the opinion evidence of 
  one of the police officers, Sergeant Leppert; and the appellant's six-hour videotaped 
  interview, which the trial judge ruled was given voluntarily and, thus, went 
  to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [8] Several times during his cross-examination of Sergeant Leppert the appellant 
  elicited from the witness an opinion on his own guilt. In answer to these questions, 
  Sergeant Leppert testified that the appellant was guilty of the offence of arson. 
  He said that he believed the appellant had intentionally set the fire and had 
  tried to get rid of his disguise. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant argued that this opinion evidence was improper and prejudicial 
  and that the trial judge should have either curtailed the questioning or, at 
  a minimum, instructed the jury to disregard the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [10] I agree that the opinion evidence should not have been admitted. As the 
  appellant was self-represented, it would have been preferable had the trial 
  judge intervened to prevent Mr. Hirnschall from pursuing a line of questioning 
  that was not helping him. </p>
<p>
  [11] But it seems to me that the trial judge's failure to do so neither amounted 
  to an error of law nor prejudiced the appellant. It was not an error of law 
  because, as Hill J. commented in R. v. Romanowicz, [1998] O.J. No. 12 (Gen. 
  Div.) at para. 34 aff'd on other grounds 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (C.A.), though 
  a trial judge is obliged to provide reasonable assistance &quot;at the end of 
  the day&#133; the unrepresented accused has the right to make strategic decisions 
  and to defend himself or herself at whatever level of competence and effectiveness 
  the accused brings to the case.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [12] Sergeant Leppert's opinion evidence did not prejudice the appellant for 
  several reasons: </p>
<ul>
  <li> later in his testimony, in answer to yet another question trying to elicit 
    his opinion about the appellant's guilt, Sergeant Leppert made it clear that 
    &quot;&#133; my job, sir, is not to determine your innocence or guilt. My 
    job is to bring the facts to the court and to allow the court and the trier 
    of fact to determine your innocence and guilt. You have not been found guilty 
    at this point.&quot;</li>
  <li>On four other occasions when the appellant embarked on a similar line of 
    questioning with other witnesses, the trial judge did intervene to pre-empt 
    any opinion about the appellant's guilt. Each time the trial judge stated 
    either that the question was inappropriate or that it was a matter for the 
    jury to decide.</li>
  <li>Midway though Sergeant Leppert's cross-examination, the trial judge instructed 
    the jury on the presumption of innocence and the Crown's obligation to prove 
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>
  <li>The Crown did not rely on Sergeant Leppert's evidence or otherwise draw 
    the jury's attention to it. Indeed, in her closing address, the Crown did 
    not even mention Sergeant Leppert's name. </li>
  <li>In his final instructions, the trial judge explained that the jury was the 
    sole arbiter of the facts and that they must decide guilt or innocence on 
    their assessment of the evidence alone. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus, although Sergeant Leppert's opinion evidence was not admissible, it did 
  not prejudice the appellant's right to a fair trial. I turn to the appellant's 
  video-taped interview.</p>
<p>
  [13] During this lengthy interview, the police officers asked the appellant 
  many questions that were in the nature of cross-examination. These questions 
  were invariably leading and, in most instances, suggestive of the appellant's 
  guilt. On appeal, Mr.Gold contended that the jury should have been given a strong 
  warning not to infer guilt from the tenor of the police's questions. </p>
<p>
  [14] Although it would have been better had the trial judge given the warning 
  argued for by Mr. Gold, again I am not persuaded that the trial judge's failure 
  to do more than he did amounted to reversible error. The instructions that he 
  did give were adequate to remove any real risk of prejudice from the way the 
  police questioned the appellant. I would, therefore, not give effect to this 
  first ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [15] I shall deal briefly with the appellant's other four grounds of appeal. 
  The appellant submitted that the verdict was unreasonable. He pointed to the 
  absence of any gasoline odour on his clothing and the police's failure to find 
  an accelerant. In the face of an otherwise very powerful Crown case, these two 
  points do not make out an unreasonable verdict. </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred in refusing to 
  grant him an adjournment to call two witnesses on his change of venue application 
  and then erred in dismissing the application. Both decisions were within the 
  trial judge's discretion. We found no reviewable error in his exercise of discretion.</p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant further submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to 
  advise him that he was entitled to call his own expert on the cause of the fire. 
  We found no error here. The appellant extensively cross-examined the Crown's 
  expert and called evidence in his own defence. It defies common sense that he 
  did not know of his right to call an expert. </p>
<p>
  [18] Finally, the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred either in failing 
  to permit him to address the jury last as he had requested, or in failing to 
  tell him of his right to ask to reply to the Crown's closing. The appellant 
  called a defence. Thus, under s. 651 (3) of the Criminal Code, he was required 
  to address the jury first. Although in R. v. Rose (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 449 
  (S.C.C.) at para. 136, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that a trial judge 
  has discretion to permit an accused to reply to a Crown address &quot;in the 
  clearest cases of unfairness&quot;, we found no unfairness here. Throughout 
  the trial the Crown made its theory of liability abundantly clear to the appellant 
  and the Crown's closing was not marked by any impropriety. </p>
<p>
  [19] I would, therefore, dismiss the appellant's conviction appeal. Before turning 
  to the sentence appeal, I think it should be said that the trial judge greatly 
  assisted the appellant throughout the trial. On several occasions this court 
  has said that a trial judge has a duty to provide reasonable assistance to a 
  self-represented litigant. The trial judge more than met that duty. </p>
<p>
  C. The Crown's Cross-Appeal on Sentence</p>
<p>
  [20] On its cross-appeal, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to sentence Mr. Hirnschall to a reformatory term and in failing to order him 
  to pay restitution. </p>
<p>
  a) Did the trial judge err in imposing a conditional sentence?</p>
<p>
  [21] Mr. Hirnschall was 58 years old when he was sentenced. He had been diagnosed 
  with an untreatable brain aneurysm. He had no previous criminal record. The 
  trial judge found that Mr. Hirnschall was not a risk to re-offend and that serving 
  his sentence in the community would not endanger its safety. The trial judge 
  also concluded that serving the sentence in the community was consistent with 
  sentencing principles of denunciation and general deterrence. He rejected the 
  Crown's request for a reformatory term. Instead, he imposed an eighteen-month 
  conditional sentence, less two months credit for pre-trial custody. </p>
<p>
  [22] The conditions were not onerous. Mr. Hirnschall was ordered to perform 
  one hundred hours of community service. He was confined to his house only between 
  6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., which meant he could leave during the day. He was permitted 
  to leave the country with his supervisor's permission. Indeed, the trial judge 
  added &quot;in my view it would be reasonable for you to leave to jurisdiction 
  or leave the country if necessary for you to obtain treatment for your medical 
  condition&quot;. Mr. Hirnschall took advantage of this condition. The week after 
  he was sentenced, with his supervisor's permission, he went to Austria where 
  his family lived for three and a half months. He did the same thing the following 
  winter. Therefore, he spent about one half of his conditional sentence out of 
  the country. He completed serving his conditional sentence a few months ago. 
  </p>
<p>
  [23] The Crown, nonetheless, submitted that we should now sentence Mr. Hirnschall 
  to a short jail term. In support of this submission, Ms. Yuen contends that 
  we should give less credit for the conditional sentence than we otherwise would 
  because Mr. Hirnschall spent so much of the sentence out of the country. </p>
<p>
  [24] I have little doubt that the conditional sentence was &quot;demonstrably 
  unfit&quot; when it was imposed. I agree with the Crown that it did not reflect 
  either the gravity of the offence or Mr. Hirnschall's moral blameworthiness. 
  The catalogue of considerations in favour of a jail term was overwhelming. Mr. 
  Hirnschall destroyed a local landmark; he put the lives of several fire fighters 
  at risk; the fire destroyed one business and caused financial hardship to many 
  others; and Mr. Hirnschall committed the offence entirely out of greed, his 
  desire to reap the benefits of the insurance proceeds.</p>
<p>
  [25] Moreover, other than the absence of a previous criminal record, little 
  can be said in mitigation. Mr. Hirnschall has shown no remorse. He led no evidence 
  to suggest jail posed any greater risk to his health. The trial judge ought 
  to have sentenced him to a term of imprisonment. </p>
<p>
  [26] Indeed, a conditional sentence for Mr. Hirnschall seems out of step with 
  the recent judgments of this court in arson cases. An example is R. v Fox, [2002] 
  O.J. 2496 (Ont. C.A.), a seemingly less serious arson. In that case, after a 
  night of drinking, the youthful accused pushed a parked car into a lamppost 
  with his truck, broke into a cottage and inadvertently set it on fire. The cottage 
  was not occupied but its owner was elderly and had not insured either the building 
  or the content. The damage was estimated at $10,000 to $15,000. </p>
<p>
  [27] The accused was sentenced to a twelve-month conditional sentence. Because 
  of the accused's current employment out of the province, the panel saw &quot;no 
  good purpose&quot; in converting the conditional sentence to a custodial sentence. 
  Nonetheless, the panel observed at para. 3 that &quot;the sentence imposed by 
  the trial judge was unfit for such a serious offence&quot;, and increased the 
  conditional sentence to twenty months. </p>
<p>
  [28] Even if a conditional sentence for Mr. Hirnschall were appropriate, the 
  conditions themselves were demonstrably unfit. If the public is to have confidence 
  in the conditional sentencing regime, the conditions must have teeth. This court 
  and the Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly said that the conditions must 
  include reasonable restrictions on an offender's liberty. See, for example, 
  R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61; R. v. Dalton, [2001] O.J. No. 4290 (C.A.) 
  at para. 1; R. v. Smith, [1999] O.J. No. 2694 (C.A.) at para. 11. The conditions 
  imposed on Mr. Hirnschall were virtually meaningless. </p>
<p>
  [29] That said, we must decide whether it is now appropriate to accede to the 
  Crown's submission and incarcerate Mr. Hirnschall. As in other cases, the passage 
  of time works against the Crown's position. Mr. Hirnschall has served his sentence. 
  I see no merit in the Crown's contention that the credit Mr. Hirnschall receives 
  for having served his sentence should be reduced because of the lengthy period 
  of time he spent in Austria. Mr. Hirnschall served the sentence he was ordered 
  to serve. The conditions of his sentence permitted him to travel to Austria 
  for medical treatment with his supervisor's permission. He sought and obtained 
  that permission. The Crown has not alleged that in travelling to Austria he 
  breached any condition of his sentence. Mr. Hirnschall's trips abroad cannot 
  be held against him. </p>
<p>
  [30] Giving him full credit for having served his sentence and bearing in mind 
  the trial Crown sought no more than a reformatory term, I do not consider it 
  now in the public interest to incarcerate Mr. Hirnschall. I would, therefore, 
  not give effect to this part of the Crown's sentence appeal.</p>
<p>
  b) Did the trial judge err in failing to order restitution?</p>
<p>
  [31] The Crown also contended that the trial judge erred in failing to make 
  restitution orders for the financial losses suffered by the business tenants 
  in the hotel. In my view, the trial judge did not err. The Crown did not prove 
  the facts needed to support orders for restitution.</p>
<p>
  [32] In this court the Crown sought restitution orders for the following losses: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) a $500 deductible paid by one tenant to its insurer;<br>
  b) $21,919.18 paid by Dominion of Canada to its insured, another tenant in the 
  building; and<br>
  c) the sums of $48,167.00 and $43,724.95 paid by the Co-Operators to two insureds 
  who were also tenants in the building. </p>
<p>
  [33] These amounts represent losses sustained because of the fire. But under 
  s. 738 (1)(a) of the Criminal Code, the court's jurisdiction to make a restitution 
  order is circumscribed. &quot;In the case of damage to, or the loss or destruction 
  of, property of any person as a result of the commission of the offence,&quot; 
  a restitution order is limited to &quot;an amount not exceeding a replacement 
  value of the property&quot;. The Crown led evidence of loss. It led no evidence 
  of replacement value. Typically, businesses are insured for losses in addition 
  to the replacement value of their property. Yet the Crown did not put the relevant 
  insurance policies in evidence. It provided little or no breakdown of the amounts 
  paid by the insurers. Although restitution orders would have been entirely appropriate 
  in this case, because of the lack of proof, I see no basis to make them.</p>
<p>
  D. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [34] I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
