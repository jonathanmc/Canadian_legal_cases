<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sidney N. Lederman of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated January 9, 2003, reported at (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 18.</p>
<h2> <strong>BY THE COURT:</strong> </h2>
<h3 class="underline"> I. Overview</h3>
<p> [1] In <em>R. v. Parker (2000)</em>, 146 C.C.C. (3d) 193, this court held 
  that the criminal prohibition against the possession of marihuana in s. 4 of 
  the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (&quot;<em>CDSA</em>&quot;) 
  was of no force or effect, absent a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption 
  from that prohibition. The court suspended its declaration for a year to allow 
  the Government of Canada (the &quot;Government&quot;) to address the constitutional 
  deficiency. The Government responded with the <em>Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</em>, 
  S.O.R./2001-227 (June 14, 2001) (&quot;<em>MMAR</em>&quot;). Those 
  regulations permitted the possession, and in some cases, the production of marihuana<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  by individuals (or in limited circumstances, production, by their designates) 
  who met the medical criteria established in the <em>MMAR</em>. On these appeals, 
  the court must decide whether Lederman J. erred in holding that the scheme set 
  out in the <em>MMAR</em> was not a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption 
  to the criminal prohibition against possession of marihuana.</p>
<p> [2] This case is not about the social or recreational use of marihuana, but 
  is about those with the medical need to use marihuana to treat symptoms of serious 
  medical conditions. We have concluded that for those people the <em>MMAR</em> as drafted 
  by the Government do not create a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption. 
  Our reasons for so concluding differ somewhat from those of Lederman J. So does 
  the remedy we would impose, namely to declare invalid only five specific sections 
  of the <em>MMAR</em>. This renders constitutional the medical exemption as described 
  in the remaining provisions of the <em>MMAR</em>, thereby rendering the possession prohibition 
  in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> constitutional: <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. The interests of justice 
  are best served by removing any uncertainty as to the constitutionality of the 
  possession prohibition while at the same time providing for a constitutionally 
  acceptable medical exemption.</p>
<h3 class="underline"> II. History of the Proceedings</h3>
<p> [3] The appeals come from three civil applications heard together by Lederman 
  J. One application was brought on behalf of Mr. Hitzig and seven others (the 
  &quot;Hitzig application&quot;). These applicants sought a declaration that 
  the <em>MMAR</em> were unconstitutional and a further declaration that the prohibition 
  against possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> was of &quot;no force and 
  effect&quot; in accordance with the decision of this court in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. The second application was brought by Mr. Parker in person. He also sought 
  an order declaring the prohibition against possession of marihuana in the <em>CDSA</em> 
  unconstitutional, and further asked the court to continue his personal exemption 
  from that prohibition and the prohibition against cultivation of marihuana. 
  The third application was brought by Mr. Turmel and Mr. Paquette in person. 
  This application was broader than the Hitzig application. In addition to challenging 
  the <em>MMAR</em>, these applicants argued that the prohibition against the possession 
  of marihuana amounted to a &quot;genocidal violation&quot; of the right to life 
  in s. 7 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> of all persons, in that 
  marihuana consumption could prevent healthy people from becoming ill. Messrs. 
  Turmel and Paquette sought a declaration that the possession prohibition was 
  of no force and effect, and requested &quot;personal judicial exemptions&quot; 
  from that prohibition.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p> [4] In considering the merits of the s. 7 <em>Charter</em> claims advanced on the applications, 
  Lederman J. rejected Mr. Turmel's contention that the criminalization of the 
  possession of marihuana violated the right to life of all persons. He next analyzed 
  the provisions of the <em>MMAR</em> and concluded that the applicants, save Mr. Turmel, 
  had established a threshold violation of their right to liberty and their right 
  to security of the person. Lederman J. completed his s. 7 analysis by considering 
  whether those threshold violations were in accord with the principles of fundamental 
  justice. He focused on two issues, the eligibility conditions set by the <em>MMAR</em> 
  and the source of supply for those who did qualify for a medical exemption. 
  He concluded that the process put in place by the regulations to determine eligibility 
  for a licence to possess or grow marihuana &quot;might be cumbersome&quot; and 
  some of the criteria &quot;onerous&quot;, but that it was not inconsistent with 
  the principles of fundamental justice. He went on, however, to hold that the 
  absence of a legal supply of marihuana for those persons who were entitled to 
  possess under the <em>MMAR</em> offended basic tenets of the legal system and was inconsistent 
  with the principles of fundamental justice. He further held that the infringement 
  was not saved by s. 1. His judgment reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> [1] This court orders and declares that the provision of the 
  <em>Marijuana Medical Access Regulations</em>, S.O.R./2001-227 made by the Governor-in-Council 
  on 14 June, 2001, pursuant to subsection 55(1) of the <em>Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act</em>, SC 1996, c. 19 (the <em>MMAR</em>) are constitutionally 
  invalid and are of no force and effect;</p>
<p class="indent">[2] This court orders the suspension of the foregoing declaration 
  for a period of six months.</p>
<p> [5] The Government appeals, alleging error in the holding that the Government's 
  failure to provide a legal source of medical marihuana for those entitled to 
  possess it constituted a violation of s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Hitzig applicants 
  support this aspect of the judgment below. They cross-appeal, however, alleging 
  that Lederman J. erred in holding that the eligibility criteria in the <em>MMAR</em> 
  did not contravene s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Government resists the cross-appeal, 
  relying on the reasons below. In the course of these proceedings, the issue 
  raised on the Government's appeal was referred to as the &quot;supply&quot; 
  issue and the issue raised on the cross-appeal was described as the &quot;eligibility&quot; 
  issue.</p>
<p> [6] Messrs. Parker, Turmel and Paquette appeal, alleging that Lederman J. 
  failed to address their claim that the criminal prohibition of the possession 
  of marihuana amounted to a &quot;genocidal violation&quot; of the right to life 
  found in s. 7. They also argue, having found that the <em>MMAR</em> were constitutionally 
  inadequate, that Lederman J. should have declared s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> to be of 
  no force and effect in accordance with this court's decision in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. The Government resists these appeals and also purports to cross-appeal, 
  advancing the same argument it raises on its appeal in the Hitzig application. 
</p>
<p> [7] The appeals and cross-appeals described above were heard in a single proceeding 
  along with four other related appeals.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  These reasons address only the appeals described above. The other appeals are 
  dealt with in separate reasons. We will consider the appeal and cross-appeal 
  arising out of the Hitzig application first, followed by a consideration of 
  any unresolved issues arising out of the appeals brought by Messrs. Parker, 
  Turmel and Paquette.</p>
<h3 class="underline"> III. The Hitzig Appeals</h3>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(i) The Medical Marihuana Problem</strong></p>
<p> [8] There is a strong body of opinion supporting the claim that marihuana 
  offers some individuals invaluable relief from a variety of debilitating symptoms 
  associated with serious long-term illnesses such as AIDS, cancer and epilepsy. 
  This support is based largely on personal experience and anecdotal evidence 
  of individuals and their doctors. In 1999 the Government began to develop a 
  policy with respect to the use of marihuana for medical purposes. That policy 
  is a work in progress. Some of those who are seriously ill and gain significant 
  relief from some of their symptoms by using marihuana see the government policy 
  as a mean-spirited and grudging attempt to do only what the law absolutely demands. 
  This viewpoint is understandable but ignores the complexity of the problem faced 
  by the Government.</p>
<p> [9] On the one hand, the courts, relying on evidence of individuals' personal 
  experiences and anecdotal evidence have determined that some seriously ill persons 
  derive substantial medical benefit from the use of marihuana. The pronouncements 
  in these cases reflect the normal process of judicial fact-finding made in the 
  context of an adjudicative process based on the evidence and arguments led by 
  the parties in a given case. These factual findings have in turn provided the 
  basis for the legal conclusion that s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> requires that a medical 
  exemption be carved out of any criminal prohibition against the possession of 
  marihuana.</p>
<p> [10] On the other hand, scientists, who approach questions of medical benefit 
  and risk quite differently than do the courts, remain uncertain as to the benefits 
  derived from the use of marihuana and concerned about the potential risks inherent 
  in that use. The scientists regard the anecdotal evidence relied on by the courts 
  as sufficient reason to conduct proper scientific inquiries into the medicinal 
  use of marihuana, but not as justifying any conclusions as to the benefit of 
  the drug. The scientists contend that the medicinal value of marihuana, if any, 
  as a treatment for various symptoms can only be determined through properly 
  conducted, rigorously reviewed long-term clinical studies. The same scientists 
  have expressed strong concerns about the health risks attendant upon the long-term 
  use of marihuana, particularly when it is smoked. There is some research indicating 
  that the long-term smoking of marihuana carries with it many of the risks associated 
  with cigarette smoking. </p>
<p> [11] In developing a medical marihuana policy, the Government must respect 
  individual constitutional rights as defined by the courts but, at the same time, 
  be guided by the opinions of its medical experts concerning the health and safety 
  of its citizens. As a legal policy, the medical marihuana policy must meet the 
  requirements of s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. As a medical policy, it must reflect current 
  scientific understanding of the medicinal benefits and risks flowing from the 
  use of marihuana, particularly when it is smoked.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(ii) Overview of the Arguments </strong></p>
<p> [12] The Hitzig applicants accept, for the purposes of these proceedings, 
  that the Government can constitutionally criminalize the possession of marihuana.<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  They also accept that the Government may regulate access to marihuana for medical 
  purposes without violating s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. For its part, the Government 
  accepts, in accordance with <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, that a criminal prohibition 
  against the possession of marihuana will be constitutional only if it is accompanied 
  by a medical exemption from that prohibition which is consistent with s. 7 of 
  the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p> [13] Mr. Michaelson, counsel for the Government's appeal, acknowledges that 
  under the <em>MMAR</em> many individuals who are entitled to possess and/or grow marihuana 
  for medical purposes will have to go to the black market, at least initially, 
  to obtain the necessary supply of marihuana or marihuana seeds. He submits that 
  the absence of a legal supply of marihuana has nothing to do with state action, 
  but reflects the fact that marihuana is not an approved drug under the regulatory 
  scheme that applies to all therapeutic drugs in Canada. He emphasizes that the 
  regulatory scheme contemplates a private sector manufacturer and distributor 
  who are prepared to make the case for the approval and distribution of a particular 
  drug. Marihuana is not approved because no one has stepped forward to take it 
  through the regulatory process. Mr. Michaelson contends that Lederman J. misinterpreted 
  s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> as imposing a positive obligation on the Government to ensure 
  the security of those individuals in need of medical marihuana by providing 
  them with a safe and legal supply of the drug for them. He argues that s. 7 
  does not require positive action by the state, but instead interdicts governmental 
  interference with individual liberty or security of the person where that interference 
  does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p> [14] Counsel next argues that even if individual liberty or security interests 
  are infringed by the absence of a legal supply of marihuana, that violation 
  is consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. In support of this 
  contention, counsel argues that individuals who will obtain a licence to possess 
  under the regulations will also obtain a licence to cultivate either personally 
  or through a designate, or will access marihuana through the same &quot;unlicensed 
  suppliers&quot; they used before the <em>MMAR</em> came into effect. Counsel argues that 
  those who obtain licences to possess marihuana are long-term &quot;self medicators&quot; 
  who will face no significant impediment to filling their medical needs albeit 
  in many cases, through the black market. Lastly, counsel seeks refuge in s. 
  1 of the <em>Charter</em>, submitting that if the <em>MMAR</em> violate s. 7, that violation can 
  be justified under s. 1.</p>
<p> [15] The Hitzig applicants respond that the <em>MMAR</em>, combined with the criminal 
  prohibitions against possession, distribution and cultivation in the <em>CDSA</em>, impact 
  on both their liberty interest and their right to security of the person. They 
  argue that the Government's scheme significantly limits their ability to make 
  fundamental personal medical choices involving the treatment of very serious 
  illnesses. The Hitzig applicants argue that the absence of a legal source of 
  supply from which their legitimate medical needs can be filled is a direct result 
  of state action that permits the lawful possession of marihuana for medical 
  purposes, but does not provide for a legal supply to meet that recognized need. 
  They contend that the absence of a legal source of supply is a direct result 
  of both the <em>MMAR</em> and the criminalization of the conduct of anyone who would 
  supply medical marihuana to individuals entitled to possess it for medical purposes. 
  Lastly, the Hitzig applicants contend that a scheme, which drives seriously 
  ill people who have a demonstrated medical need for marihuana to the black market 
  to meet that need, is obviously and profoundly contrary to the principles of 
  fundamental justice and cannot be saved by s. 1.</p>
<p> [16] On the cross-appeal, the Hitzig applicants contend that the <em>MMAR</em> provisions 
  governing eligibility for the medical exemption violate s. 7 in that they interfere 
  with individual liberty and security of the person in a manner which is inconsistent 
  with the principles of fundamental justice. Initially, the Hitzig applicants 
  attacked several aspects of the regulatory scheme. However, in argument, counsel 
  focused on the requirement that one, and sometimes two, medical specialists 
  must complete detailed declarations establishing the medical prerequisites to 
  the granting of a licence to possess or produce the drug. The Hitzig applicants 
  submit that the limited availability of specialists, their relative ignorance 
  of the medicinal qualities of marihuana, and the reluctance of many specialists 
  to become involved in the <em>MMAR</em> process effectively renders the possession exemption 
  in the <em>MMAR</em> illusory for many individuals who have a medical need to use marihuana. 
  The Hitzig applicants also contend that the specialist requirements are arbitrary 
  in that they do not meaningfully advance any legitimate interest the Government 
  has in controlling the use of marihuana for medical purposes.</p>
<p> [17] The Government responds that the eligibility requirements, and in particular 
  the specialist requirements, strike a proper balance between individual rights 
  and the Government's responsibility to protect public health and safety. The 
  Government contends that the medicinal value of marihuana is largely unproved 
  and that there are genuine risks associated with its use. Relying on comments 
  by this court in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, the Government says that medical approval, 
  as a prerequisite to a licence to possess marihuana, is an obvious and justified 
  requirement. The Government goes on to submit that the benefits/risk analysis 
  will vary depending on the patient's condition and the symptom to which the 
  marihuana use is directed. In some cases the risk will be lower and in others 
  the potential benefit will be more problematic. The Government contends that 
  a scheme requiring different levels of medical scrutiny is responsive to the 
  different combinations of benefits and risk that may exist and reflects the 
  reality of the current state of knowledge concerning the medical use of marihuana. 
  The Government also submits that the record does not support the Hitzig applicants' 
  contention that the specialist requirements have rendered the possession exemption 
  illusory. The Government points out that Lederman J. rejected this argument 
  and contends that his rejection constitutes a finding of fact which must be 
  given deference. Lastly, the Government stresses that it is not for this court 
  to determine whether the eligibility requirements in the <em>MMAR</em> are ideal or even 
  necessary. The court's function is to determine only whether the scheme clears 
  the constitutional hurdle of s. 7. </p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(iii) The Applicants</strong></p>
<p> [18] All of the Hitzig applicants, with the exception of Mr. Hitzig, are seriously 
  ill individuals who have used marihuana for many years to successfully treat 
  one or more of the symptoms associated with their illnesses. These symptoms 
  include pain, nausea, lack of appetite, seizures and spasticity. Four of the 
  applicants have received licences to possess marihuana under the <em>MMAR</em>. One of 
  those four, Mr. Dvorak, has also received a licence to personally produce marihuana 
  to meet his medical needs. The three remaining applicants have not applied for 
  licences to possess or produce. They contend that they cannot get the specialist 
  support needed to obtain licences to possess under the <em>MMAR</em>. They attribute 
  this to difficulties in getting access to a specialist, combined with the specialists' 
  reluctance, based on advice from professional medical organizations and the 
  primary insurer of doctors in Canada, to become involved in the <em>MMAR</em> process.</p>
<p> [19] The Government does not accept the applicants' explanations for their 
  failure to get the support of a specialist. Ms. Devries, one of the three applicants 
  without a licence to possess, did not make any effort to obtain a specialist's 
  support for her <em>MMAR</em> application until just days before she was to be cross-examined 
  on her affidavit. Others with the same and similar conditions as Ms. Devries 
  have received possession exemptions under the <em>MMAR</em>. The other two applicants 
  who have not applied, Mr. Renda and Mr. Van de Kemp, suffer from medical problems 
  for which the Government contends that current medical wisdom suggests marihuana 
  is not an appropriate medication. </p>
<p> [20] Mr. Hitzig operated the Toronto Compassion Centre, which provided a supply 
  of medicinal marihuana to seriously ill individuals for more than three years 
  until it was raided by the police and closed down. He attempted to obtain an 
  exemption for the Centre, prior to the <em>MMAR</em> coming into force, but eventually 
  concluded, based on legal advice, that he could not. Mr. Hitzig's affidavit 
  contains vivid evidence of the risks associated with cultivating marihuana under 
  the present legal regime. He has been robbed and beaten by criminals, and raided 
  and arrested by the police.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(iv) The Applicants' Supply of Medical Marihuana</strong></p>
<p> [21] The applicants all meet their medical marihuana needs through a combination 
  of self-cultivation and purchase on the black market. They described the significant 
  problems associated with both sources of supply. Some are too ill and are physically 
  unable to grow their marihuana. Others do not have the facilities to grow their 
  own. Still others are concerned about exposing themselves and family members 
  to the risks inherent in producing a product for which there is a thriving black 
  market. Production by designates is also not a viable alternative to many for 
  a variety of reasons. The applicants described the many problems associated 
  with the actual cultivation. Growing marihuana that is suitable for medicinal 
  use is no easy task. It is time consuming and labour intensive. Crops can fail 
  entirely or yield insufficient marihuana to supply the grower's medical needs.</p>
<p> [22] The problems associated with the purchase of medicinal marihuana on the 
  black market are numerous and, in most cases, obvious. As with any black market 
  product, prices are artificially high. High prices cause real difficulty for 
  seriously ill individuals, many of whom live on fixed incomes. Black market 
  supply is also notoriously unpredictable. The supplier of marihuana today may 
  have moved on by tomorrow or may have been closed down by the police. In addition 
  to unpredictability, there is no quality control on the black market. Purchasers 
  do not know what they are getting and have no protection against adulterated 
  product. This is particularly problematic for some whose illnesses involve allergies, 
  or stomach ailments that can be aggravated by the consumption of tainted products. 
  Resort to the black market may also require individuals to consort with criminals 
  who are unknown to them. In doing so, they risk being cheated and even subjected 
  to physical violence. Finally, the evidence of the applicants makes it abundantly 
  clear that requiring law-abiding citizens who are seriously ill to go to the 
  black market to fill an acknowledged medical need is a dehumanizing and humiliating 
  experience. </p>
<p> [23] The Government accepts that reliance on the black market to fill a medical 
  need would in most cases raise supply problems. It maintains, however, that 
  marihuana is unique in that there is an established part of the black market, 
  which the Government calls &quot;unlicensed suppliers&quot;, that has for many 
  years provided a safe source of medical marihuana. The Government argues that 
  those who want to use marihuana for medical purposes have been &quot;self-medicating&quot; 
  for years and know full well where to go to obtain the necessary medical marihuana. 
  It is the Government's contention that this particular part of the black market 
  does not present the problems that are generally associated with purchase of 
  product on the black market. The application record offers some support for 
  this contention. Many of the applicants do have well-established &quot;friendly&quot; 
  sources in the black market from which they can safely acquire reliable medicinal 
  marihuana. It is ironic, given the Government's reliance on this part of the 
  black market to supply those whom the Government has determined should be allowed 
  to use marihuana, that the police, another arm of the state, shut down these 
  operations from time to time, presumably because they contravene the law. </p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(v) The Legislative Context</strong></p>
<p> [24] Marihuana is a &quot;drug&quot; as defined under s. 2 of the <em>Food 
  and Drugs Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27 (&quot;<em>FDA</em>&quot;), and it 
  is a &quot;substance&quot; as defined under s. 2 of the <em>CDSA</em>. Its distribution 
  is controlled by both Acts and regulations passed under them. Its possession 
  is controlled by the <em>CDSA</em>. </p>
<p> [25] Insofar as marihuana is said to have medicinal value, it qualifies as 
  a drug under the <em>FDA</em>. With two exceptions, the distribution of marihuana, like 
  the distribution of any drug to which the <em>FDA</em> applies, is prohibited unless 
  that drug has been approved by the appropriate Government agency. The approval 
  process is found in regulations enacted under the <em>FDA</em> and turns on an assessment 
  of the potential risks and benefits flowing from the proposed therapeutic use 
  of the drug. The Government acts as a regulator only. It does not develop or 
  market new drugs. That process is left to private manufacturers and distributors. 
  They develop new products through research and clinical trials and apply to 
  the Government for approval of those products. The development of new drugs 
  and obtaining approval for their distribution in Canada is a long process that 
  may last many years and cost many millions of dollars. </p>
<p> [26] Although two synthetic cannabinoids containing some of the active ingredients 
  found in marihuana have been developed and approved for distribution in Canada, 
  the private sector has shown little interest in developing marihuana as an approved 
  drug. Various explanations are offered for this lack of commercial interest, 
  including difficulties inherent in patenting a plant-based substance, the complexity 
  of the various active agents found in marihuana, the uncertainty in the scientific 
  community of the medicinal value of the drug, concerns as to the potential harm 
  caused by the long-term smoking of marihuana, and the longstanding, virtual 
  absolute criminal prohibition against its possession and distribution. In argument, 
  we were told that marihuana is not an approved drug anywhere in the world.</p>
<p> [27] As indicated above, there are two exceptions to the prohibition in the 
  <em>FDA</em> against the distribution of an unapproved drug. First, drugs may be distributed 
  in the course of an approved clinical trial. These trials are part of the process 
  which may eventually lead to the approval of a drug. Clinical trials have been 
  part of the Government policy in relation to the medicinal use of marihuana 
  since 1999. There are presently two small clinical trials underway in Canada. 
  The Government does not suggest that these clinical trials could provide a licit 
  source of medical marihuana for those authorized to possess it under the <em>MMAR</em>. 
</p>
<p> [28] The second exception to the prohibition against the distribution of an 
  unapproved drug are found in the provisions of the <em>Food and Drug Regulations</em> 
  which establish the Special Access Program (&quot;SAP&quot;)<a href="#5">[5]</a>,<a name="r5"></a> 
  formerly known as the &quot;Emergency Drug Release&quot; program. Under these 
  regulations, the Government may authorize a manufacturer to release an unapproved 
  drug to a practitioner for distribution to a specific patient in an emergency 
  situation. SAP is commonly used to obtain drugs that are not approved in Canada 
  but have been approved in another jurisdiction for use by seriously ill persons 
  suffering from diseases like AIDS and cancer. SAP depends on the existence of 
  three things, a manufacturer who is willing to provide the drug, a doctor who 
  is willing prescribe it, and a patient who is willing to give his or her informed 
  consent to the use of an unapproved drug. SAP contemplates approval on a case-by-case 
  basis. Each application may precipitate a dialogue among Health Canada officials, 
  the manufacturer, and the doctor as to the advisability of the use of the drug 
  for a specific patient and the availability of the drug.</p>
<p> [29] Unsuccessful attempts have been made in the past to access medical marihuana 
  through SAP. The Government takes the position that the criteria governing SAP 
  do not permit distribution of marihuana to many of the individuals who would 
  qualify for a licence to possess under the <em>MMAR</em>. Counsel for the Hitzig applicants 
  do not suggest that SAP, as presently administered, offers these individuals 
  a licit source of medical marihuana. In any event, SAP assumes that there is 
  a manufacturer available to supply the drug. Prairie Plant Systems (&quot;PPS&quot;) 
  is the only authorized grower of marihuana in Canada, but the marihuana it grows 
  is owned by the Government. The availability of marihuana through SAP would 
  depend on the willingness of the Government to use its supply of marihuana to 
  fill the needs of any who qualified for medical marihuana under SAP. </p>
<p> [30] In addition to the regulation of marihuana as a drug under the <em>FDA</em>, 
  marihuana is a Schedule II controlled substance under the <em>CDSA</em>. Section 
  4 of the <em>CDSA</em> prohibits possession of marihuana &quot;except as authorized 
  by the regulations&quot;. Section 5 of the <em>CDSA</em> makes it a criminal 
  offence to traffic in marihuana. Trafficking is defined so widely as to encompass 
  virtually every form of distribution of the drug. Depending on the amount distributed, 
  the offence is punishable by up to life imprisonment. Under the present law, 
  unless he or she is a designated producer under the <em>MMAR</em>, a person 
  who supplies the holder of a licence to possess marihuana with a supply of marihuana 
  that is within the terms of the licence to possess is guilty of trafficking 
  in a narcotic. The recipient of the drug is not a party to the trafficking: 
  <em>R. v. Greyeyes</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 825. The recipient commits no crime 
  as long as the possession is consistent with the terms of the licence granted 
  under the <em>MMAR</em>. In addition, s. 56 of the <em>CDSA</em> permits the 
  Minister to &quot;exempt any person or class of persons or any controlled substance&quot; 
  from the application of any of the provisions of the Act or regulations if, 
  &quot;in the opinion of the Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical 
  or scientific purpose&quot;.</p>
<p> [31] The regulations referred to in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> are the <em>Narcotic 
  Control Regulations</em>, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1041 (&quot;<em>NCR</em>&quot;) and 
  the <em>MMAR</em>. The <em>NCR</em> control the distribution of narcotics through licensed 
  dealers. There is no licensed dealer of marihuana in Canada who is able to supply 
  marihuana to those with the medical need for it. All other <em>CDSA</em> Schedule 
  I and II drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are commercially produced and 
  available through licensed dealers in Canada, albeit under strict restrictions. 
</p>
<p> [32] In addition to its domestic legislation, Canada's drug laws must also 
  accord with its international obligations. Canada is a party to several United 
  Nations drug conventions controlling the importation, exportation, distribution 
  and use of various drugs, including marihuana.<a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="r6"></a> 
  The basic aim of these conventions is to limit the use of drugs like marihuana 
  to medical and scientific purposes only. The conventions require governments 
  to control the importation and exportation, production and distribution of identified 
  drugs like marihuana and also to combat the abuse of and the illicit trade in 
  those drugs.</p>
<p> [33] Canada must report to various international organizations on its actions 
  concerning marihuana and other drugs covered by the conventions. The Government 
  argues that the <em>MMAR</em> has put Canada sufficiently in the forefront of the recognition 
  of the use of marihuana for medical purposes that it has attracted concern from 
  a leading international organization.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(vi) The Development of a Medical Marihuana Policy</strong><a href="#7">[7]</a><a name="r7"></a> 
</p>
<p> [34] Prior to 1999, there was no process by which persons using marihuana 
  for medical purposes could be exempted from the general criminal prohibition 
  against possession. In March 1999, the Government took its first steps towards 
  developing a legislative response to the demand for medical marihuana. These 
  steps were taken in response to court challenges to the constitutionality of 
  the possession prohibition absent a medical exemption. The Minister of Health 
  announced that the Government policy would include research into the medical 
  use of marihuana, clinical trials, formulation of appropriate guidelines for 
  medical use, and development of access to a safe supply of the drug. In June 
  1999, the Minister spoke of: </p>
<p class="indent"> Moving forward on a research plan that includes establishing 
  a quality Canadian supply of medicinal marihuana and a process to access it 
  &#133;</p>
<p> [35] At the same time, he announced a $7.5 million program, the Medical Marihuana 
  Research Program, which was designed to promote research and fund clinical trials 
  into the medical use of marihuana. </p>
<p> [36] In June 1999, the Government issued its first exemption under s. 56 of 
  the <em>CDSA</em>. While the terms of s. 56 were broad enough to permit the Minister 
  to exempt individuals from all provisions of the <em>CDSA</em>, exemptions were granted 
  only with respect to the prohibitions against possession and cultivation of 
  marihuana. Individuals who received a s. 56 exemption could grow the marihuana 
  they needed to meet their medical needs. If they could not do so, they had to 
  continue to use the black market. </p>
<p> [37] In July 2000, this court held in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, that the 
  medical exemption scheme based on s. 56 of the <em>CDSA</em> was constitutionally 
  inadequate in that it depended on the unfettered exercise of the Minister's 
  discretion. The Government set to work fashioning a legislative response to 
  <em>Parker</em> which would produce a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption 
  within the one year for which the court had suspended its declaration of invalidity.</p>
<p> [38] In December 2000, the Minister of Health announced that the Government 
  had entered into a five-year contract with PPS to produce a domestic supply 
  of marihuana for the Government. He said: </p>
<p class="indent"> The marihuana will be made available to people participating 
  in structured research programs and authorized Canadians using it for medical 
  purposes who agree to provide information to my department for monitoring and 
  research purposes.</p>
<p> [39] The <em>MMAR</em> came into force on July 30, 2001. The Regulatory Impact Analysis 
  Statement (the &quot;Statement&quot;) that accompanied the proclamation of the 
  <em>MMAR</em> described them as providing seriously ill Canadians with &quot;access&quot; 
  to marihuana for medical purposes while the medical efficacy of the drug is 
  being investigated. By July 2001, when the <em>MMAR</em> came into effect, the Government 
  had changed its position and decided that the marihuana being grown by PPS was 
  not suitable for medical use and would be used exclusively for research purposes. 
  Hence, those with medical need could not access the marihuana owned by the Government 
  and being grown for it by PPS. The Statement observed that: </p>
<p class="indent"> Health Canada will be evaluating various options to ensure 
  patients have access to a safe high quality supply of marihuana for medical 
  purposes.</p>
<p> [40] The most recent Government response to the medical marihuana problem 
  is an interim policy brought forward by regulation on July 8, 2003, shortly 
  before these appeals were heard. The interim policy is a direct response to 
  the declaration by Lederman J. that the <em>MMAR</em> was unconstitutional, combined 
  with the expiry of the six month suspension of that order granted by Lederman 
  J., and this court's refusal to stay that declaration pending these appeals. 
  As a result of these developments, the Government was faced with a declaration 
  that arguably rendered the crime of possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> 
  of no force and effect for all purposes. The interim policy was an attempt to 
  save the criminal prohibition in s. 4 as it applied to individuals other than 
  those who qualified for a medical exemption under the <em>MMAR</em>. </p>
<p> [41] The Government announced in the interim policy that marihuana seeds and 
  dried marihuana grown by PPS for the Government would be made available to individuals 
  who had obtained a medical exemption under the <em>MMAR</em> or under s. 56 of the <em>CDSA</em>. 
  It was made abundantly clear in the Statement that accompanied the regulation 
  that this interim policy would remain in place only &quot;while clarification 
  was being sought from the courts&quot;.</p>
<p> [42] The Crown placed this interim policy before the court by way of fresh 
  evidence. Counsel for the Hitzig applicants advised the court that of the four 
  Hitzig applicants who were entitled to possess marihuana under the <em>MMAR</em>, two 
  had applied for a supply of marihuana under the interim policy and two were 
  in the process of gathering the material needed to make their applications.</p>
<p> [43] The Government did not ask the court to pass on the constitutionality 
  of the <em>MMAR</em> as modified by the interim policy, and it did not suggest that the 
  interim policy should have any effect on the outcome of this appeal. The interim 
  policy was put before the court so that we would be aware of the current state 
  of affairs.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(vii) The <em>MMAR</em></strong></p>
<p> [44] The relevant parts of the <em>MMAR</em> are attached as an appendix to these reasons. 
  Before examining specific provisions, it is helpful to take an overview. The 
  regulations recognize that marihuana is a medically appropriate medication for 
  the treatment of various symptoms associated with various serious illnesses. 
  This recognition is consistent with the Government policy first announced in 
  March 1999, well before this court's decision in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. The regulations 
  further recognize that the determination of when marihuana is a medically appropriate 
  medication and the amount of marihuana which is appropriate for that purpose 
  are decisions that should be made by qualified doctors and not by Government 
  officials, or by the users of medical marihuana. </p>
<p> [45] The regulations provide for the issuing of an authorization to possess 
  (&quot;ATP&quot;) where an applicant can meet the medical criteria set out in 
  the regulations. An applicant who acquires an ATP can possess marihuana without 
  fear of criminal prosecution as long as the possession is within the terms and 
  within the amounts provided for in the ATP. The regulations also provide for 
  authorizations to grow the marihuana needed to fill an ATP holder's medical 
  needs. The ATP holder may personally acquire a licence or a person designated 
  to grow the marihuana for the ATP holder may acquire a licence to grow. As long 
  as those individuals stay within the terms of their licences, the criminal prohibitions 
  against the cultivation, trafficking and possession of marihuana do not apply 
  to them. </p>
<p> [46] We turn now to the specifics of the <em>MMAR</em>. Lederman J. described these 
  provisions very clearly and we borrow heavily from his reasons in our description. 
  Part I of the <em>MMAR</em> creates the framework by which seriously ill people may obtain 
  authorizations to possess marihuana for medical purposes. The regulations designate 
  three categories of application by reference to symptoms associated with medical 
  conditions. Category 1 refers to persons whose symptoms are associated with 
  a terminal illness. A terminal illness is defined as a medical condition for 
  which the prognosis is death within 12 months. Category 2 applications refer 
  to patients who have specific symptoms identified with specified, long-term 
  or chronic conditions set out in a schedule to the regulations. For example, 
  category 2 applies to cancer or AIDS patients who suffer from severe nausea. 
  Category 3 is a &quot;catch all&quot; and potentially includes all patients 
  with symptoms associated with medical conditions other than those who fall within 
  category 1 or 2.</p>
<p> [47] Applications made by category 1 applicants must be supported by a declaration 
  from a medical practitioner containing the information required in the regulations. 
  Applications made by category 2 applicants must be supported by a declaration 
  from a medical specialist. Applications made by category 3 applicants must be 
  supported by declarations from two medical specialists. The Government attempts 
  to justify these distinctions as to the medical material needed to support applications 
  in the various categories on the basis that the medical conditions and symptoms 
  associated with each category require a different level of medical scrutiny. 
  For category 1 applicants, long-term risks are virtually irrelevant, thereby 
  justifying a lower level of medical scrutiny. For category 2 patients, long-term 
  risks are potentially significant, but there is an established body of scientific 
  evidence, in the Government's view, that category 2 applicants may benefit from 
  the use of marihuana. The requirement that a specialist make the medical declaration 
  required for category 2 applicants reflects the benefits/risks assessment involved 
  for patients who fall within category 2. Category 3 patients face the same long-term 
  risks as category 2 patients, but, again according to the Government, there 
  is virtually no scientific evidence that marihuana could benefit these persons. 
  Because of the reduced potential benefit, the Government takes the position 
  that it is appropriate to require that the application be vetted and supported 
  by a second medical specialist. </p>
<p> [48] An individual who seeks an ATP must complete a personal declaration in 
  addition to providing the required medical declaration or declarations. The 
  applicant's declaration must contain the information set out in s. 5. Section 
  5(1)(e) is worth particular note: </p>
<p class="indent"> The declaration of the applicant under paragraph 4(2)(a) <span class="underline">must 
  indicate</span> &#133;</p>
<p  class="indent"> (e) that the authorization as sought in respect of marihuana 
  <span class="underline">either</span></p>
<p  class="indent"> (i) <span class="underline">to be produced by the applicant 
  or a designated person</span>, in which case the designated person must be named, 
  or</p>
<p  class="indent"> (ii) <span class="underline">to be obtained under the <em>Narcotic 
  Control Regulations</em> in which case the licensed dealer</span> who produces 
  or imports the marihuana must be named. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [49] To comply with s. 5(1)(e), an applicant must identify one of two legal 
  sources from which the applicant indicates he or she intends to obtain the marihuana 
  for which the ATP is sought. The form which must be completed by all applicants 
  is consistent with the terms of s. 5(1)(e). In reality, many who apply for an 
  ATP cannot identify a legal source from which they will obtain their marihuana. 
  As indicated above, there are no licensed dealers of marihuana in Canada who 
  could provide ATP holders with marihuana. Thus, no ATP applicant can possibly 
  identify a licensed dealer as the potential source of supply for his or her 
  marihuana. In addition, many ATP applicants do not apply for licences to produce 
  either personally or through a designate. The Government acknowledges that some 
  30 percent of those who have received ATPs have not obtained a licence to cultivate 
  marihuana either personally or through a designate. On a literal reading of 
  s. 5(1)(e), it is difficult to understand how these applicants obtained an ATP.</p>
<p> [50] The contents of the medical declarations required for all three categories 
  of applicants are set out in ss. 6 and 7 of the <em>MMAR</em>. Section 6(1) requires 
  that all medical declarations identify: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the applicant's medical condition and the symptom associated with the condition 
    which gives rise to the application;</li>
  <li>the category into which the applicant falls;</li>
  <li>the daily dosage and suggested mode of administration;<a href="#8">[8]</a><a name="r8"></a> 
    and</li>
  <li>the period for which the use of the marihuana is recommended if it is less 
    than 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<p> [51] Section 6(2) requires that for category 1 applicants the medical declaration 
  must be completed by a medical practitioner. The declaration must indicate that: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the applicant has a terminal illness;</li>
  <li>all conventional treatments for the symptom have been tried or considered;</li>
  <li>the recommended use of marihuana would mitigate the symptom;</li>
  <li>the benefits from the use of marihuana would outweigh any risks associated 
    with its use; and</li>
  <li>the medical practitioner is aware that marihuana is an unapproved drug under 
    the <em>Food and Drug Regulations</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p> [52] Section 6(3) refers to category 2 applications. The medical declaration 
  must be made by a certified medical specialist. The specialist must indicate 
  his or her area of specialty and its relevance to the treatment of the applicant's 
  medical condition. He or she also must confirm that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>all conventional treatments for the symptom have been tried or considered 
    and each of them is inappropriate for one of the reasons specified in s. 6(3)(b);</li>
  <li>the recommended use of marihuana would mitigate the symptom;</li>
  <li>the benefit from the use of marihuana would outweigh any risks associated 
    with its use, including long-term risks; and</li>
  <li>he or she is aware that marihuana is not an approved drug under the <em>Food 
    and Drug Regulations</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p> [53] Section 6(4) deals with category 3 applications. A specialist must complete 
  a medical declaration like that required for category 2 applications, except 
  he or she must specify why the other potential treatments are considered inappropriate. 
</p>
<p> [54] Section 7 of the <em>MMAR</em> requires that category 3 applications 
  provide a second medical declaration from a specialist. As with category 2 applications, 
  this specialist must identify his or her specialty and the relevance of that 
  specialty to the treatment of the applicant's condition. The second specialist 
  must also confirm that he or she is aware of the basis for the application and 
  that the symptom identified in the application relates to the medical condition 
  identified by the applicant. The second specialist must indicate that he or 
  she has reviewed the applicant's medical file, discussed the case with the specialist 
  making the first declaration, and agrees that the use of marihuana would mitigate 
  the symptom and that the benefits would outweigh the risks, including the long-term 
  risks. The second specialist is not required to consider whether all other treatments 
  have been tried or at least considered, or whether they would be medically inappropriate. 
  Finally, the second specialist, like the first, must acknowledge that he or 
  she is aware that marihuana is not an approved drug under the <em>FDR</em>.</p>
<p> [55] Pursuant to Ss 11 and 12 of the <em>MMAR</em>, the Minister has very 
  little discretion to refuse an ATP once the necessary personal and medical declarations 
  have been completed. The limited role played by the Minister is no doubt an 
  attempt to cure the major defect in the previous scheme identified in <em>R. 
  v. Parker, supra</em>. </p>
<p> [56] Section 23 allows an individual to assist an ATP holder in the administration 
  of the daily dosage of marihuana. The assistance is limited to the rather narrow 
  circumstances described in s. 23. </p>
<p> [57] Part 2 of the <em>MMAR</em> addresses licences to produce marihuana to fill the 
  needs of ATP holders. As indicated above, there are two kinds of licences described 
  in the regulations, a personal-use production licence (&quot;PPL&quot;) and 
  a designated-person production licence (&quot;DPL&quot;). The former is issued 
  to an ATP holder and the latter is issued to an individual who will grow the 
  necessary medical marihuana for an ATP holder. Applications for licences to 
  produce must identify the site where the proposed production is to take place, 
  where the marihuana will be stored, and describe the security measures that 
  will be implemented at the proposed production and storage sites. </p>
<p> [58] Persons applying for a DPL must be eighteen years of age and must not 
  have been convicted, inside or outside of Canada, of a designated drug offence 
  in the previous ten years. A designated person may hold only one DPL and production 
  must be strictly in accordance with the terms of the licence. He or she may 
  grow marihuana for only one person and may not produce it in common with more 
  than two other licensed holders. A person who serves as a designated producer 
  cannot be compensated. These restrictions effectively eliminate the potential 
  licensing of &quot;compassion clubs&quot; like the one formerly operated by 
  Mr. Hitzig. </p>
<p> [59] If the application meets the criteria in the <em>MMAR</em>, the Minister may refuse 
  to issue a licence only on limited grounds. Where a licence is issued, it must 
  include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the address of the site where the marihuana is to be produced and stored; 
  </li>
  <li>the maximum number of marihuana plants that may be grown and the maximum 
    amount of marihuana that may be stored. These amounts are calculated by formulae 
    set out in the <em>MMAR</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p> [60] There are also provisions in the <em>MMAR</em> which require licensed producers 
  to keep detailed records. Inspectors may enter property where marihuana is being 
  grown or stored without prior authorization to inspect and to examine the records 
  of the licensed producer.</p>
<p> [61] The <em>MMAR</em> appear to contemplate two other licit sources of marihuana to 
  meet the medical needs of ATP holders. First, as described above, there are 
  references to licensed dealers in Part 1 of the <em>MMAR</em>. In addition to those references, 
  s. 70 of the <em>MMAR</em> refers to a medical practitioner obtaining marihuana from 
  a licensed dealer for the purpose of selling or furnishing it to an ATP holder. 
  These provisions are meaningless, at least at present, as there is no licensed 
  marihuana dealer in Canada.</p>
<p> [62] Section 51 of the <em>MMAR</em> refers to the second potential legal source of 
  marihuana for ATP holders. That section authorizes the Minister or a designate 
  to import and possess marihuana seeds for the purpose of delivery to a holder 
  of a licence to produce. It is doubtful whether, under present international 
  laws governing the importation of marihuana, the Minister could import marihuana 
  seeds from a licit source outside of Canada to supply those seeds to a person 
  authorized to possess or produce under the <em>MMAR</em>. In any event, there is no suggestion 
  that the Minister has any intention of using s. 51 to supply ATP holders with 
  a legal source of supply to meet their medical needs. </p>
<p> [63] There was considerable evidence adduced on the Hitzig application concerning 
  the actual operation of the <em>MMAR</em> since their implementation in July 2001. From 
  the applicants' perspective, the regulations are cumbersome, slow and unnecessarily 
  impede access to, what for the applicants is a vital medical treatment. The 
  Government's evidence describes the steps that have been taken by Health Canada 
  to make the application process &quot;user friendly&quot;. These steps include 
  the developments of forms that are said to be easy to complete and the preparation 
  of brochures that explain to applicants and their doctors how the various forms 
  should be completed. </p>
<p> [64] Statistics for the first ten months of the operation of the <em>MMAR</em> 
  (July 30, 2001 - June 7, 2002) indicate that 565 applications for ATPs were 
  made, and 299 were granted. Sixteen had been abandoned, and of the remaining 
  250 outstanding applications, 28 had not yet been reviewed by the authorities 
  and 222 had been reviewed and found to be incomplete.<a href="#9">[9]</a><a name="r9"></a> 
  Only a small number of the incomplete applications were lacking the necessary 
  medical documentation. Applications for ATPs increased gradually over the ten-month 
  period. Once an application is complete, Health Canada takes two or three weeks 
  to complete its assessment and if the application meets the criteria, issue 
  the appropriate licence. </p>
<p> [65] Of the 299 ATPs granted, 39 were for category 1 applications, 254 were 
  for category 2 applications and 6 were for category 3 applications. About 20 
  percent of the medical declarations required for the category 1 applications 
  had been completed by specialists, although under the regulations they could 
  have been completed by a general practitioner. All of the other approved ATP 
  required declarations from at least one medical specialist. </p>
<p> [66] During this initial period, the Government issued 194 PPLs and 14 DPLs. 
  The remaining 91 ATP holders (30%) have no possible legal source for their medical 
  marihuana. Even those with a licence to produce must acquire the initial seeds 
  on the black market unless they have a crop under cultivation at the time they 
  receive their licence to produce. </p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(viii) The Supply of Medical Marihuana under the <em>MMAR</em></strong></p>
<p> [67] It is acknowledged by the Government that despite references to licensed 
  dealers, and the importation of marihuana seeds, the <em>MMAR</em> were not intended 
  to provide for the supply of marihuana to those with the medical need for it, 
  apart from strictly limited self cultivation and designated-producer growing. 
  As Ms. Cripps-Prawak, the principal Government affiant said: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="underline">These regulations do not authorize 
  the sale or distribution of marihuana</span>. Instead by way of overview, the 
  regulations establish a compassionate framework to allow people who are suffering 
  from serious illnesses to possess and cultivate marihuana for medical purposes 
  while the substance is being researched as a possible medicine &#133; . [Emphasis 
  added.]</p>
<p> [68] Although references have already been made to the effect of the absence 
  of any legal source of supply on potential ATP holders, it is helpful to summarize 
  those effects, given the issue raised on the Government's appeal. </p>
<ul>
  <li>an ATP holder who does not have a licence to produce marihuana and for whom 
    a designated person is not authorized to produce marihuana can only obtain 
    the drug from the black market;</li>
  <li>an ATP holder who obtains a licence to produce marihuana or for whom a designated 
    person is authorized to produce marihuana can only obtain the seeds necessary 
    to commence production on the black market; </li>
  <li>an ATP holder who has a licence to produce or for whom a designated person 
    is authorized to produce who has an adequate supply at the time authorization 
    to produce is granted and who can maintain that supply, can obtain the marihuana 
    necessary to meet his or her medical needs without going to the black market;</li>
  <li>a designated producer who is not already growing marihuana must go to the 
    black market to obtain the first seed; and</li>
  <li>a designated producer must expend the time and cost required to grow the 
    marihuana without being paid, and with no economies of scale.</li>
</ul>
<p> [69] Under the <em>MMAR</em>, no one with an ATP risks criminal conviction for the 
  possession of marihuana if that possession is within the terms of the ATP. Similarly, 
  no person with a licence to produce risks criminal conviction if the cultivation 
  and possession are within the terms of that licence. To this extent, the <em>MMAR</em> 
  have clearly addressed the constitutional problem confronted in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. If they can comply with the <em>MMAR</em>, persons are not required to choose 
  between using a medically necessary drug and committing a crime.</p>
<p> [70] The <em>MMAR</em>, however, address access only for those who can grow their own 
  marihuana or get a designate to do it for them. The evidence leaves no doubt 
  that many individuals who have received ATPs and many who would be entitled 
  to receive ATPs under the <em>MMAR</em> cannot possibly grow their own marihuana. Many 
  of these individuals are not only seriously ill, but they are significantly 
  physically handicapped. Cultivation by a designate is an answer for some, but 
  by no means all, of these people. Mr. Hitzig's affidavit makes it clear that 
  serving as a designate has real costs and risks. The possibility of getting 
  someone else with the requisite skill to grow the necessary marihuana for an 
  ATP holder is further restricted by the provisions in the <em>MMAR</em> which prohibit 
  a designate from being compensated for his or her services, limit designates 
  to growing for only one ATP holder, and restrict the pooling of licences to 
  produce to no more than three growers.</p>
<p> [71] The record here makes clear that these limitations on supply in the <em>MMAR</em> 
  present real and significant challenges to ATP holders. Many individuals who 
  establish the requisite medical need under the <em>MMAR</em> and obtain ATPs will have 
  to go to the black market on a more or less regular basis to maintain their 
  supply of medical marihuana. As the Government acknowledged in argument, the 
  <em>MMAR</em> scheme assumes the existence of the black market in marihuana. Indeed, 
  it depends on the black market. Without the black market, the scheme set out 
  in <em>MMAR</em> would be a sham. In short, in their actual operation, the <em>MMAR</em> require 
  what is, as far as we know, a unique partnering of the Government and the black 
  market to fill serious and recognized medical needs. </p>
<p> [72] The premise underlying the <em>MMAR</em>, that seriously ill people, some of whom 
  are so sick it is anticipated they will die within a year, can grow their own 
  medicine, have a friend grow it, or get it on the black market, is puzzling. 
  It is explained, in our view, by the assumption implicit in the <em>MMAR</em> and specifically 
  articulated by the Government in its factum, that those who will seek an ATP 
  will be long-time medical marihuana users who have an established pattern of 
  self-medication. According to this assumption, these persons will have no difficulty 
  filling their medical marihuana needs either through cultivation or from &quot;unlicensed&quot; 
  reliable sources. This first assumption reveals a second. In relying on the 
  scheme in the <em>MMAR</em> as an appropriate response to the problem identified in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, the Government must assume that a segment of the black market 
  has provided and will continue to provide a reliable and suitable source of 
  medical marihuana for those in need. </p>
<p> [73] The evidence adduced on the Hitzig application belies both of the assumptions 
  described above. Many long-term users of marihuana for medical reasons are unable 
  to produce their own marihuana for a variety of reasons and cannot obtain a 
  designate to produce it for them. Those individuals must go to the black market 
  and have experienced significant difficulties in doing so safely. They go to 
  the black market only because they have no choice. Moreover, the assumptions 
  have no application to potential ATP holders who have not established a pattern 
  of self-medication and have no prior contact with the marihuana black market. 
  Nothing in the <em>MMAR</em> suggests that the scheme is limited to experienced medical 
  marihuana users. </p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(ix) Section 7 of the <em>Charter</em> </strong></p>
<p  class="indent10"><strong> (a) The approach</strong></p>
<p> [74] Section 7 of the <em>Charter</em> reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 
  person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the 
  principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p> [75] The analytical approach to a s. 7 claim has been described both as a 
  two-step and a three-step process: <em>Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. 
  K.L.W.</em>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 519 at 562; <em>R. v. White</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 
  417 at 436; and <em>R. v. Malmo-Levine</em>; <em>R. v. Caine</em> (2000), 145 
  C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 244 (B.C.C.A.) (now on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: 
  [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 361 (QL)). Choreographical differences aside, the approaches 
  are the same in substance. We will address the s. 7 claim, as Lederman J. did, 
  in two stages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Has the government action resulted in a threshold violation of one or more 
    of the rights described in s. 7?</li>
  <li>If there is a threshold violation, is it inconsistent with the principles 
    of fundamental justice?</li>
</ul>
<p> [76] The inquiry at the first stage requires the identification of the individual 
  interests said to be infringed and a determination of whether those interests 
  fall within the meaning of the phrase &quot;life, liberty and security of the 
  person&quot; in s. 7: <em>Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)</em>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307 at 339. At the first stage the court must also decide whether 
  any identified individual interest which it has found to be sheltered under 
  s. 7 has been infringed by some form of state conduct. This need not be by way 
  of the criminal law, but encompasses any state action taken in enforcing and 
  securing compliance with the law: <em>Gosselin v. Quebec (A.G.)</em>, [2002] 
  S.C.J. No. 85 at paras. 77, 81 (QL). </p>
<p> [77] The second stage of the s. 7 inquiry is reached only if there is a threshold 
  violation of a right protected by s. 7. At the second stage the court must articulate 
  the principle or principles of fundamental justice engaged in the circumstances 
  of the case. Once the operative principle or principles have been identified, 
  the court must decide whether the threshold infringement found in the first 
  stage of the analysis is inconsistent with the pertinent principle or principles 
  of fundamental justice: <em>R. v. White, supra</em>.</p>
<p> [78] All parts of the s. 7 analysis must be sensitive to the specific context 
  in which the claim is made. Context for the present purposes includes the factual 
  matrix in which the claims are advanced, the nature of the alleged rights affected 
  by the state conduct, the nature of the interference with those rights by the 
  state, and the interests relied on by the state in support of its conduct. Context 
  encompasses the effect as well as the purpose of the impugned state conduct. 
  Where legislative provisions are in play, context refers to the language of 
  the statute and the legislative and common law history leading up to the enactments 
  of the challenged provisions: <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, at 224-25; <em>Winnipeg 
  Child and Family Services, supra</em>, at 562; and <em>R. v. Morgentaler</em>, 
  [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30 at 61-63, per Dickson C.J.C.</p>
<p> [79] The Government's appeal and the cross-appeal brought by the Hitzig applicants 
  both engage the s. 7 analysis. The former is directed at the absence of a legal 
  source of supply of medical marihuana and the latter at the eligibility requirements, 
  particularly the specialist requirements, controlling access to an ATP. The 
  first stage of the s. 7 analysis, that is whether there is a threshold violation 
  of individual rights, is the same for both the supply issue raised in the Government's 
  appeal and the eligibility issue raised on the cross-appeal. The second stage 
  of the inquiry, that is whether any threshold infringement is inconsistent with 
  the principles of fundamental justice, requires a separate consideration of 
  the two issues. </p>
<p  class="indent10"> <strong>(b) Stage one: is there a threshold violation of 
  s. 7? </strong></p>
<p> [80] This question must be addressed in the context of those with the medical 
  need to take marihuana. It is they who are entitled to a constitutionally sound 
  medical exemption from criminal sanction for possession. However, before going 
  further, we should note that there is no need in this case to define the precise 
  extent of that group. For example, we need not address what need be shown to 
  establish the medical necessity to take marihuana or how grave a medical condition 
  must be in order to qualify. There is no dispute that the Hitzig applicants 
  include persons with such a need and that those with this need must be afforded 
  a constitutionally sound medical exemption if the criminal sanction against 
  the possession of marihuana is to stand.</p>
<p> [81] Equally, we should make clear that this case is not about those whose 
  &quot;need&quot; to consume marihuana is not medical but simply social or recreational. 
  These people have no s. 7 rights that are engaged by the discussion in this 
  case: <em>R. v. Clay</em> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 276 (Ont. C.A.) (now on appeal 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada: [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 492 (QL)).</p>
<p> [82] For the purposes of this discussion the <em>MMAR</em> are best viewed in the context 
  of the <em>CDSA</em> as constituting a regulatory regime which places strict controls, 
  backed by criminal sanctions, on the acquisition and the use of marihuana by 
  those who have medical need of it.</p>
<p> [83] Our analysis at stage one is greatly assisted by the reasons of this 
  court in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>. In that case, the context in which the rights 
  to liberty and security of the person were considered was identical to this 
  case in its most important aspect. There, as here, those whose s. 7 rights were 
  at stake require access to marihuana for medical reasons, to treat the symptoms 
  of serious medical conditions. There, as here, the state had placed barriers 
  between them and the marihuana necessary for their health. </p>
<p> [84] However, in one particular respect, the context in <em>Parker</em> was 
  somewhat different. There Mr. Parker's rights to liberty and security of the 
  person had to be considered in the context of a simple and unqualified criminal 
  prohibition against possessing marihuana. Here the context is the <em>MMAR</em>, 
  which permit the possession of marihuana without criminal sanction but only 
  if specific eligibility conditions are met and only by making certain presumptions 
  concerning the source of supply. </p>
<p> [85] As we have described, the main eligibility conditions set by the <em>MMAR</em> 
  begin by requiring that an individual have a symptom associated with a medical 
  condition that fits within one of three specific categories. The individual 
  must have support from a physician willing to declare that all conventional 
  treatments have been tried or at least considered and that marihuana would mitigate 
  the symptom, with benefits that outweigh the risks. The physician must also 
  specify the daily dosage limit for the individual. For categories two and three 
  the physician cannot be the individual's general practitioner but must be a 
  specialist. And for category three, the support of a second specialist is required.</p>
<p> [86] An individual with the medical need to take marihuana who cannot meet 
  these conditions cannot obtain a medical exemption and is subject to the criminal 
  sanction against possessing marihuana found in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. An individual 
  with the same need who has not obtained a medical exemption for any other reason 
  is subject to the same sanction. In the same way, an individual with this need 
  who possesses more than the authorized amount of the medication is subject to 
  the criminal sanction, even if that individual has obtained a medical exemption. 
</p>
<p> [87] Thus, while the medical exemption scheme means that individuals who need 
  to take marihuana for medical reasons are not automatically subjected to criminal 
  sanction, the <em>MMAR</em> set up stringent conditions with which these individuals 
  must attempt to comply in order to use the medication they require. If they 
  do not do so they must risk conviction and imprisonment or forego their serious 
  medical needs.</p>
<p> [88] We have also described the constraints on the sources of supply of marihuana 
  for those with the medical need to use it that accompany the <em>MMAR</em>. Apart from 
  the wholly theoretical option of obtaining marihuana from a licensed dealer, 
  an individual must declare that the exemption is sought in respect of marihuana 
  that comes from one of two sources in order to get a medical exemption. Either 
  the individual is to produce it personally or it is to be produced for him or 
  her by a licensed designated person who cannot be paid for doing so and who 
  can neither grow marihuana for more than that individual nor in combination 
  with more than two other designated producers. The third option in the <em>MMAR</em> 
  (that is, obtaining the marihuana from a dealer licensed under the <em>NCR</em>) is theoretical 
  only since there are now no such dealers. </p>
<p> [89] Where individuals cannot grow the marihuana they require (and many cannot 
  for a variety of reasons, including their health) and cannot secure a designated 
  producer (for a various reasons, including the constraints imposed by the <em>MMAR</em> 
  on these producers) they go beyond the declarations they have made if they seek 
  to acquire the medication they need in any other way. And anyone who would supply 
  marihuana to them would face the criminal prohibition in s. 5 of the <em>CDSA</em>.</p>
<p> [90] Given this context, we turn to whether the rights to liberty and security 
  of the person of those with the medical need to take marihuana are engaged by 
  this scheme of medical exemption.</p>
<p> [91] As <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em> points out, the liberty interest of these individuals 
  can be considered in two ways. First, viewed more narrowly, their right to liberty 
  is at risk in the context of this medical exemption due to the threat of criminal 
  prosecution and imprisonment arising from their need to possess and use marihuana 
  for medial purposes. This risk manifests itself in several ways. The risk clearly 
  exists for those who do not have an ATP because they cannot clear the eligibility 
  hurdles set up by the <em>MMAR</em>. It also exists for those with medical need who do 
  not have an ATP for any other reason (although in each case that other reason 
  may be a factor in assessing compliance with the principles of fundamental justice). 
  Further, even for those with an ATP, this aspect of the liberty interest is 
  at risk should they stray outside the conditions set for their possession by 
  the <em>MMAR</em>. For example, the <em>MMAR</em> authorize an ATP holder to possess marihuana, 
  but only in a strictly limited quantity, beyond which there is no exemption. 
</p>
<p> [92] The right to liberty can also be properly viewed more broadly, to include 
  the right to make decisions of fundamental personal importance. See <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, at 228-29. Viewed in this way, s. 7 requires that if the state seeks 
  to interfere with these decisions, it must comply with the principles of fundamental 
  justice in doing so. Like the other rights encompassed by s. 7 this aspect of 
  the right to liberty is protected not just in the context of the criminal law, 
  but against any deprivation that occurs as a result of an individual's interaction 
  with the justice system and its administration. </p>
<p> [93] Here, as in <em>Parker</em>, there is no doubt that the decision by those 
  with the medical need to do so to take marihuana to treat the symptoms of their 
  serious medical conditions is one of fundamental personal importance. While 
  this scheme of medical exemption accords them a medical exemption, it does so 
  only if they undertake an onerous application process and can comply with its 
  stringent conditions. Thus, the scheme itself stands between these individuals 
  and their right to make this fundamentally important personal decision unimpeded 
  by state action. Hence the right to liberty in this broader sense is also implicated 
  by the <em>MMAR</em>.</p>
<p> [94] It is equally clear that the right to security of the person of those 
  with the medical need to use marihuana is implicated in the circumstances of 
  this case. In <em>Parker, supra</em>, this court reviewed the jurisprudence 
  and concluded that this right encompasses the right to access medication reasonably 
  required for the treatment of serious medical conditions, at least, when that 
  access is interfered with by the state by means of a criminal sanction. In <em>Gosselin, 
  supra</em>, (which postdated <em>Parker</em> by two and one-half years) the 
  Supreme Court of Canada made clear that this interference by the state need 
  not be by way of the criminal law, provided it results from the state's conduct 
  in the course of enforcing and securing compliance with the law. </p>
<p> [95] In this case, the <em>MMAR</em>, with their strict conditions for eligibility 
  and their restrictive provisions relating to a source of supply, clearly present 
  an impediment to access to marihuana by those who need it for their serious 
  medical conditions. By putting these regulatory constraints on that access, 
  the <em>MMAR</em> can be said to implicate the right to security of the person 
  even without considering the criminal sanctions which support the regulatory 
  structure. Those sanctions apply not only to those who need to take marihuana 
  but do not have an ATP or who cannot comply with its conditions. They also apply 
  to anyone who would supply marihuana to them unless that person has met the 
  limiting terms required to obtain a DPL. As seen in <em>Rodriguez v. British 
  Columbia (A. G.)</em>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, a criminal sanction applied to another 
  who would assist an individual in a fundamental choice affecting his or her 
  personal autonomy can constitute an interference with that individual's security 
  of the person. Thus, we conclude that the <em>MMAR</em> implicate the right 
  of security of the person of those with the medical need to take marihuana.</p>
<p> [96] Having found that this scheme of medical exemption engages the rights 
  of liberty and security of the person of those with the medical need to use 
  marihuana, we must determine whether it can be said to deprive these individuals 
  of those rights for the purposes of the s. 7 analysis. </p>
<p> [97] In its narrower aspect, the right to liberty is clearly violated because 
  those with the medical need to use marihuana are exposed to conviction and imprisonment 
  if they do not meet the eligibility conditions for or otherwise do not possess 
  an ATP or if they acquire and possess marihuana outside the strict conditions 
  of the ATP. In those circumstances, they are subject to the criminal prohibition 
  in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>.</p>
<p> [98] It is no answer at this stage of the s. 7 analysis to say that there 
  is no risk to the right to liberty because those in medical need can possess 
  marihuana lawfully simply by applying for an ATP, meeting the eligibility conditions 
  and observing the other conditions that are part of the ATP process. While the 
  reasonableness of these conditions may be relevant in determining whether the 
  <em>MMAR</em> conform to the principles of fundamental justice they clearly represent 
  significant barriers imposed by the state standing between those with medical 
  need and their use of marihuana, unaffected by criminal sanction. Simply put, 
  the <em>MMAR</em> do not remove the real risk of conviction and imprisonment for those 
  who must acquire and use marihuana to meet their medical needs. The <em>MMAR</em> thus 
  interfere with this aspect of their right to liberty.</p>
<p> [99] As we have said, the right to liberty, viewed more broadly, encompasses 
  the right to make decisions that are of fundamental personal importance, such 
  as the decision to use marihuana when necessary to control symptoms of serious 
  medical conditions. For those with that need, the <em>MMAR</em> undoubtedly constitute 
  a serious intrusion into a decision of fundamental personal importance. In order 
  to use the marihuana they require, they must comply with the various conditions 
  specified in the ATP process or face the threat of criminal prosecution. In 
  placing these significant hurdles in their way the state has interfered with 
  this broader aspect of their right to liberty.</p>
<p> [100] Turning to the right to security of the person, this court concluded 
  in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, that the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> deprives 
  those with the medical need to use marihuana of that right because it prevents 
  them from using that medication on pain of criminal prosecution. </p>
<p> [101] In coming to its conclusion, this court in<em> Parker</em> relied on 
  the description by Sopinka J. of the right to security of the person in the 
  context of medical treatment which is found in <em><em>Rodriguez, supra</em></em>, at 
  587-88: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, then the judgments of this Court in <em>Morgentaler</em> 
  can be seen to encompass a notion of personal autonomy involving, at the very 
  least, control over one's bodily integrity free from state interference and 
  freedom from state-imposed psychological and emotional stress. In <em>Reference 
  re Ss 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra</em>, Lamer J. 
  (as he then was) also expressed this view, stating at p. 1177 that &quot;[s]ection 
  7 is also implicated when the state restricts individuals' security of the person 
  by interfering with, or removing from them, control over their physical or mental 
  integrity&quot;. <em>There is no question, then, that personal autonomy, at 
  least with respect to the right to make choices concerning one's own body, control 
  over one's physical and psychological integrity, and basic human dignity are 
  encompassed within security of the person, at least to the extent of freedom 
  from criminal prohibitions which interfere with these</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [102] As we have said, <em>Gosselin, supra</em>, at para. 77, affirmed that 
  s. 7 protects the individual against the state impinging on life, liberty or 
  security, not just through the process of the criminal law, but more generally 
  through state action taken in the course of enforcing and securing compliance 
  with the law. </p>
<p> [103] The medical exemption scheme puts those people at risk of prosecution 
  and imprisonment when they use the medication they need but do not have an ATP 
  or cannot observe its conditions. Moreover, the <em>MMAR</em> provide them with very 
  limited and ineffective access to marihuana through their own PPL or from a 
  DPL holder. Apart from this, the criminal prohibition in s. 5 of the <em>CDSA</em> applies 
  to anyone who would supply them with marihuana. The reality of supply thus is 
  that this criminal sanction stands between those in medical need and the marihuana 
  they require. That is the effect of the <em>MMAR</em>.</p>
<p> [104] Even apart from these criminal sanctions for non-compliance, the <em>MMAR</em> 
  constitute significant state interference with the human dignity of those who 
  need marihuana for medical purposes. To take the medication they require they 
  must apply for an ATP, comply with the detailed requirements of that process, 
  and then attempt to acquire their medication in the very limited ways contemplated 
  by the <em>MMAR</em>. These constraints are imposed by the state as part of the justice 
  system's control of access to marihuana. As such, they are state actions sufficient 
  to constitute a deprivation of the security of the person of those who must 
  take marihuana for medical purposes. They are state actions within the administration 
  of justice that stand between those in medical need and the marihuana they require.</p>
<p> [105] In summary, we conclude that the <em>MMAR</em> constitute a scheme of medical 
  exemption which deprives those who need to take marihuana for medical purposes 
  of the rights to liberty and security of the person. This is a threshold violation 
  of s. 7. We are therefore required to turn to the question of whether this deprivation 
  is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p  class="indent10"> <strong>(c) Stage two: Is the threshold violation inconsistent 
  with the principles of fundamental justice?</strong></p>
<p  class="indent15"><strong> (1) <em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
<p> [106] The phrase &quot;the principles of fundamental justice&quot; in s. 7 
  is of necessity general and abstract. The court must articulate with as much 
  precision as possible the core principles of our legal system engaged by the 
  specific state action in issue and the specific alleged deprivation of the individual's 
  rights. In articulating the operative principles, the court must avoid describing 
  those principles at a level of generality that suggests little more than a personal 
  assessment of the wisdom of the impugned state conduct. The principles of fundamental 
  justice are not the constitutional equivalent of equity's Chancellor's foot: 
  <em><em>Rodriguez, supra</em></em>, at 590-91.</p>
<p> [107] Context is crucial to both the identification of the operative principles 
  of fundamental justice and the determination of whether any threshold violation 
  of an individual's rights under s. 7 is consistent with the principles of fundamental 
  justice at play: <em>R. v. White, supra</em>, at 436-40. The Hitzig applicants 
  assert the right to make a fundamental personal decision concerning how best 
  to treat serious symptoms associated with life threatening medical problems: 
  <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, at 228-29. The Government has recognized since 
  1999, that for some seriously ill individuals, marihuana is a medically useful 
  and appropriate medication. The Government has accepted that those individuals 
  must be able to obtain and use marihuana for medical purposes without fear of 
  criminal prosecution. At the same time, however, the Government is obliged to 
  protect the public health and safety of all of its citizens through the regulation 
  of the medicinal use of substances like marihuana. The Government contends that 
  public health and safety concerns include potential health risks from long-term 
  use, the Government's need to comply with stringent international controls on 
  the use and distribution of marihuana, and the Government's obligation to combat 
  the criminal drug trade, which includes the illicit distribution of marihuana 
  for non-medical purposes.</p>
<p> [108] The nature of the individual right asserted and the purpose animating 
  the Government action are important contextual considerations at the second 
  stage of the s. 7 analysis. The actual effect of the state action is an equally 
  important contextual consideration. State action that may on its face be benign 
  or even promote individual interests may, in its actual operation, be inconsistent 
  with the principles of fundamental justice: <em>R. v. Morgentaler, supra</em>. 
  The Hitzig applicants stress the effects of the scheme implemented by the <em>MMAR</em> 
  in asserting a violation of their s. 7 rights both in respect of the supply 
  issue and the eligibility issue.</p>
<p  class="indent15"> <strong>(2) <em>The supply issue and the principles of fundamental 
  justice</em></strong></p>
<p> [109] It is undeniable that the effect of the <em>MMAR</em> is to force individuals 
  entitled to possess and use marihuana for medical purposes to purchase that 
  medicine from the black market. As Lederman J. put it at para. 159: </p>
<p class="indent"> As a result, the regulatory system set in place by the <em>MMAR</em> 
  to allow people with a demonstrated medical need to obtain marijuana simply 
  cannot work without relying on criminal conduct and lax law enforcement. &#133; 
</p>
<p> [110] Lederman J. found that the absence of a legal supply of marihuana for 
  people entitled to possess and use it under the <em>MMAR</em> resulted in a breach of 
  s. 7, holding at para. 160: </p>
<p class="indent"> To my mind, this aspect of the scheme offends the basic tenets 
  of our legal system. It is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice 
  to deny a legal source of marijuana to people who have been granted ATPs and 
  licences to produce. Quite simply, it does not lie in the government's mouth 
  to ask people to consort with criminals to access their constitutional rights. 
  &#133;</p>
<p> [111] We agree with the conclusion reached by Lederman J. He does not, however, 
  expressly identify the principle or principles of fundamental justice which 
  he finds are violated by the failure to provide for a legal source of supply. 
  In attempting to identify that principle or principles, we begin with the words 
  of Lamer J. (as he then was) in the seminal case of <em>Reference re s. 94(2) 
  of the Motor Vehicle Act (British Columbia)</em>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 at 503, 
  512: </p>
<p class="indent"> In other words, the principles of fundamental justice are to 
  be found in the basic tenets of our legal system. They do not lie in the realm 
  of general public policy, but in the inherent domain of the judiciary as guardian 
  of the justice system. &#133;<br>
  [T]hey [the principles of fundamental justice] represent principles which have 
  been recognized by common law, the international conventions, and by the very 
  fact of entrenchment in the <em>Charter</em>, as essential elements of a system 
  for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity 
  of the human person and the rule of law. </p>
<p> [112] The rule of law, identified by Lamer J. as a bulwark of our administration 
  of justice, has been described as &quot;the root of our system of government&quot; 
  and a &quot;highly textured expression, importing many things&quot;: <em>Reference 
  re Secession of Quebec</em>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217 at 257. Several principles 
  of fundamental justice, including some which are entrenched in the <em>Charter</em>, 
  trace their roots to various components of the rule of law (e.g., s. 9, s. 11(g), 
  s. 11(h)). At its most general level, the rule of law refers to the regulation 
  of the relationship between the state and individuals by pre-established and 
  knowable laws. The state, no less than the individuals it governs, must be subject 
  to and obey the law: <em>Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights</em>, [1985] 
  1 S.C.R. 730 at 748-51; <em>Reference Re Amendment of the Constitution of Canada</em>, 
  [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753 at 805-06; and <em>R. v. Campbell</em>; <em>R. v. Shirose</em>, 
  [1999] 1 S.C.R. 565 at 582-83. </p>
<p> [113] The state's obligation to obey the law is central to the very existence 
  of the rule of law. Without this obligation, there would be no enforceable limit 
  on the state's power over individuals. Human dignity, the second essential component 
  of the administration of justice identified by Lamer J. in <em>Reference re 
  s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act&cedil; supra</em>, could not long survive 
  a system where the Government was free to do as it saw fit without regard to 
  established laws.</p>
<p> [114] The state's obligation to obey its own laws not only serves as an invaluable 
  brake on the exercise of state power against the individual, it also makes the 
  state a role model for its citizens. By adhering to the law, the state encourages 
  its citizenry to do likewise: <em><em>Rodriguez, supra</em></em>, at 608. Because it 
  obeys and honours the law, the state can assume the moral high ground, which 
  justifies state prosecution and punishment of individuals who break the law. 
  As the entrapment jurisprudence demonstrates, loss of that moral high ground, 
  through for example, active solicitation of criminal conduct, will foreclose 
  prosecution by the state: <em>R. v. Mack</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903.</p>
<p> [115] The state's obligation to obey the law is fundamental to our system 
  of justice. No one would argue that it does not have general acceptance among 
  reasonable people: <em>Rodriguez, supra</em>, at 607. The state's obligation 
  to obey the law is well established at common law through the process of judicial 
  review, is implicitly recognized in the preamble to the <em>Constitution Act, 
  1867</em>, (U.K.), 30 and 31 Vict., c. 3, is expressly recognized in the preamble 
  to the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, and is further recognized in s. 52 of 
  the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>. We have no hesitation in concluding that 
  the state's obligation to obey the law is a principle of fundamental justice.</p>
<p> [116] The <em>MMAR</em> do not require the state to violate the law. They do, however, 
  create an alliance between the Government and the black market whereby the Government 
  authorizes possession of marihuana for medical purposes and the black market 
  supplies the necessary product. The <em>MMAR</em> provide a viable medical exemption 
  to the prohibition against possession of marihuana only as long as there are 
  individuals who are prepared to commit a crime by supplying the necessary medical 
  marihuana to the individuals that the Government has determined are entitled 
  to use the drug. At the same time, the <em>MMAR</em> force seriously ill individuals 
  who have been found to be in need of medical marihuana to consort with criminals 
  to fill that medical need. Forcing sick people to go to the black market to 
  get their medicine can only discourage respect for the law and at the same time 
  signal that the medical needs of these people are somehow not worthy of the 
  same kind of consideration as other medical needs. </p>
<p> [117] A Government scheme that depends on the criminal element to deliver 
  the medically necessary product, and that drives those in need of that product 
  to the black market strikes at the same values that underlie the state's obligation 
  to obey the law. The <em>MMAR</em>, far from placing the Government in the position of 
  a positive role model or on the moral high ground, are calculated to bring the 
  law into disrepute and devalue the worth and dignity of those individuals to 
  whom the <em>MMAR</em> are applied. The Government's obligation to obey the law must 
  include an obligation to promote compliance with and respect for the law. </p>
<p> [118] The inevitable consequences of the absence of a legal source of marihuana 
  for those who have been determined to be in medical need of the drug are inconsistent 
  with the fundamental principle that the state must obey and promote compliance 
  with the law. In our view, the absence of a legal source of supply renders the 
  <em>MMAR</em> inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice. </p>
<p> [119] There is an alternative approach to the second stage of the s. 7 inquiry 
  which also leads to the conclusion that the provisions in the <em>MMAR</em> 
  are inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice. This alternative 
  approach begins by recognizing that it is a principle of fundamental justice 
  within our legal system that the individual rights identified in s. 7 may be 
  subordinated, at least to some extent, to substantial and compelling collective 
  interests: <em>Godbout v. Longueuil (City)</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844 at 898-900, 
  per La Forest J.; and <em>R. v. Pan</em> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 61-62 
  (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [2001] 2 S.C.R. 344 at 386-89. </p>
<p> [120] The application of this approach to the principles of fundamental justice 
  requires that the court determine whether there is a substantial and compelling 
  state interest served by the impugned state action which has resulted in the 
  threshold violation of the individual rights identified in s. 7. If the action 
  is in furtherance of a substantial and compelling interest, then the question 
  becomes whether the state action imposes an undue burden on the individual's 
  rights:<em> R. v. Beare</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387 at 401-04. Determining when 
  the balance struck by the state can be said to effect a fair balance between 
  state interests and individual rights can be a very difficult question which 
  pushes the court to the brink of the forbidden world of policy-driven decision 
  making.</p>
<p> [121] In this case, however, the Government's attempt to rely on the assertion 
  that the <em>MMAR</em> serve a substantial and compelling collective interest justifying 
  the absence of any legal source of medical marihuana fails at its most basic 
  level. The substantial and compelling interest advanced by the Government is 
  the need to preserve and promote public health and safety. We accept that this 
  can be a substantial and compelling collective interest for the purposes of 
  s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. However, a scheme which depends on the criminal black market 
  and which forces individuals to go to the black market to obtain necessary medical 
  treatment cannot possibly further public health and safety. In fact, it has 
  the opposite effect. By failing to provide for a lawful source of medical marihuana, 
  the <em>MMAR</em> not only compromise individual rights, but undermine the very collective 
  interests which the Government contends are promoted by these regulations. Lederman 
  J. made this point at paras. 161, 163: </p>
<p class="indent"> That the Government relies on the criminal underworld in this 
  manner is rather surprising when it has declared that the goals of the <em>MMAR</em> 
  and its interlocking regulatory scheme include controlling the illicit drug 
  trade and upholding Canada's international narcotics control obligations. &#133;<br>
  As a result, production licences offer the applicants an illusory remedy which 
  can only be accessed through reliance on black market distributors. Despite 
  ostensibly being concerned with avoiding diversion and illegal use of marihuana, 
  to say nothing of conforming with international drug conventions, the <em>MMAR</em> 
  force medical marihuana users into the arms of suppliers whom the state has 
  deemed criminal drug dealers. This position is untenable, and is certainly not 
  consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. </p>
<p> [122] Our conclusion that a scheme which does not provide for lawful access 
  to medical marihuana is inconsistent with s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> should 
  not surprise anyone who has read this court's decision in <em>R. v. Parker, 
  supra</em>, or the decision of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in<em> R. 
  v. Krieger</em> (2000), 225 D.L.R. (4th) 164, aff'd (2003), 225 D.L.R. (4th) 
  183 (C.A.), leave to appeal sought by Canada: [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 114 (QL). 
  Although neither case dealt with the <em>MMAR</em>, both made it clear that 
  any medical exception to the criminal prohibition against possession of marihuana 
  would have to address not just possession, but also the means of obtaining the 
  drug needed for the medical purpose. In determining that the prohibition against 
  cultivation of marihuana in the former <em>Narcotic Control Act</em> was unconstitutional 
  absent an adequate medical exception, Rosenberg J.A. said in <em>Parker</em>, 
  at 249-50: </p>
<p class="indent"> To conclude, the deprivation of Parker's right to liberty and 
  security of the person because of the complete prohibition on the possession 
  of cultivation of marihuana in the former <em>Narcotics Control Act</em> does 
  little or nothing to enhance the state interest. In my view, Parker established 
  that his rights under s. 7 were violated by the absolute prohibition of cultivation 
  of marihuana in the <em>Narcotics Control Act</em>. Parker has no practical 
  means of obtaining the drug for his medical needs. I did not understand the 
  Crown to suggest that we should distinguish between the possession and cultivation 
  for medical use, for the purpose of the s. 7 analysis.</p>
<p> [123] Rosenberg JA reached the same conclusion with respect to the cultivation 
  prohibition in the <em>CDSA</em>, saying, at 262-63: </p>
<p class="indent"> However, it is apparent from these reasons and the reasons 
  dealing with the cultivation offence under the <em>Narcotics Control Act</em> 
  that if the cultivation prohibition had been before this court, I would hold 
  that it too infringes Parker's s. 7 rights. <span class="underline">Since there 
  is no legal source of supply of marihuana, Parker's only practical way of obtaining 
  marihuana for his medical needs is to cultivate it. In this way, he avoids having 
  to interact with the illicit market and can provide some quality control</span>. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [124] We read Rosenberg JA as requiring &quot;a practical way of obtaining&quot; 
  the necessary medical marihuana as an integral part of any legitimate medical 
  exemption. We also read him as clearly eliminating the black market as a suitable 
  means of obtaining the necessary medical marihuana.<a href="#10">[10]</a><a name="r10"></a></p>
<p> [125] The trial judge in <em>R. v. Krieger, supra</em>, concluded that the 
  cultivation prohibition in the <em>CDSA</em> was unconstitutional, opining at 
  178-79: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="underline">Obtaining a s. 56 exemption from the 
  Minister of Health triggers the absurdity that an individual who has been granted 
  an exemption has the legal right to produce, possess and use cannabis marihuana. 
  However, in order to obtain the product, the individual is required to participate 
  in an illegal act, since whoever sells the exempted person either the raw cannabis 
  marihuana or the seeds to grow their own does so in breach of s. 5(2) of the 
  <em>CDSA</em>.&#133;</span> </p>
<p class="indent">I am not satisfied that the absurdity that I mentioned above 
  has been properly addressed. In my view, when a minister has the discretion 
  to allow someone an exemption to produce and use a substance for proper medical 
  purposes, that substance must be something that is available to the individual 
  by legal means at the time exemption is granted. <span class="underline">As 
  a s. 56 exemption has no practical purpose without a legal source for cannabis 
  marihuana, s. 56 cannot serve to delineate the boundaries of the Applicant's 
  s. 7 rights or to justify violation of those boundaries</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [126] In affirming the trial decision, the Alberta Court of Appeal said, at 
  para. 5: </p>
<p class="indent"> We agree with the trial judge that s. 56 [<em>CDSA</em>] creates an 
  absurdity because there was no legal source of marihuana. That absurdity is 
  not removed by the fact that the respondent had a personal supply at the time 
  the charge was laid. There is no evidence as to how long the supply would last 
  nor as to the duration of the potential s. 56 exemption.</p>
<p> [127] The previous appellate decisions dealing with the constitutionality 
  of medical exemptions to the prohibition against marihuana possession point 
  directly at the result reached by Lederman J. on the supply issue. </p>
<p> [128] Thus, we conclude that in setting up a scheme of medical exemption which 
  depends on an illicit source of supply, the <em>MMAR</em> do not accord with the principles 
  of fundamental justice.</p>
<p  class="indent15"> <strong>(3) <em>The eligibility issue and the principles 
  of fundamental justice</em></strong></p>
<p> [129] Before Lederman J., the Hitzig applicants argued that in depriving those 
  who need to use marihuana of their rights to liberty and security of the person, 
  the <em>MMAR</em> do not accord with the principles of fundamental justice because they 
  throw up so many barriers to eligibility for a medical exemption for marihuana 
  that it effectively remains unavailable to many seriously ill people who need 
  it.</p>
<p> [130] Lederman J. rejected this argument, concluding that the application 
  process, the specialist requirement and the daily dosage provisions are neither 
  arbitrary nor unrelated to the objectives of the <em>MMAR</em> and they did not render 
  the scheme an illusory medical exemption from the criminal prohibition.</p>
<p> [131] On their cross-appeal, the Hitzig applicants seek to reverse that finding 
  in this court. In addressing the eligibility issue, they raised a number of 
  aspects of the <em>MMAR</em> in their written material: the daily dosage limits imposed 
  by the scheme; the reliance on physicians to determine if marihuana is needed 
  by the individual; and the requirement for support from specialists to qualify, 
  unless the individual is terminally ill. In argument, the focus was very much 
  on the last of these. </p>
<p> [132] We will deal with each of these in turn, but in the end we differ with 
  Lederman J.'s. conclusion in only one respect. In our view, only the requirement 
  for a second specialist for individuals in category 3 has been shown by these 
  applicants not to accord with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p> [133] The legal context for this analysis is best provided by the balancing 
  approach to the principles of fundamental justice that we already have described. 
  Here, it is useful to begin with the words of McLachlin J. (as she then was) 
  in <em>Cunningham v. Canada</em>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 143 at 151-52: </p>
<p class="indent"> The principles of fundamental justice are concerned not only 
  with the interest of the person who claims his liberty has been limited, but 
  with the protection of society. Fundamental justice requires that a <em>fair 
  balance</em> be struck between these interests, both substantively and procedurally. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [134] This approach is elaborated in <em>Godbout, supra</em>, at 899-900, 
  where La Forest J. said this on behalf of the three judges who dealt with s. 
  7 in that case: </p>
<p class="indent"> But just as this Court has relied on specific principles or 
  policies to guide its analysis in particular cases, it has also acknowledged 
  that looking to &quot;the principles of fundamental justice&quot; often involves 
  the more general endeavour of balancing the constitutional right of the individual 
  claimant against the countervailing interests of the state. In other words, 
  deciding whether the principles of fundamental justice have been respected in 
  a particular case has been understood not only as requiring that the infringement 
  at issue be evaluated in light of a specific principle pertinent to the case, 
  but also as permitting a broader inquiry into whether the right of life, liberty 
  or security of the person asserted by the individual can, in the circumstances, 
  justifiably be violated given the interests or purposes sought to be advanced 
  in doing so. To my mind, performing this balancing test in considering the fundamental 
  justice aspect of s. 7 is both eminently sensible and perfectly consistent with 
  the aim and import of that provision, since the notion that individual rights 
  may, in some circumstances, be subordinated to substantial and compelling collective 
  interests is itself a basic tenet of our legal system lying at or very near 
  the core of our most deeply rooted juridical convictions. We need look no further 
  than the <em>Charter</em> itself to be satisfied of this. Expressed in the language of 
  s. 7, the notion of balancing individual rights against collective interests 
  itself reflects what may rightfully be termed a &quot;principle of fundamental 
  justice&quot; which, if respected, can serve as the basis for justifying the 
  state's infringement of an otherwise sacrosanct constitutional right.</p>
<p> [135] Related to this principle is the concept described by Sopinka J. in 
  <em>Rodriguez, supra</em>, where he said that if the state action which causes the deprivation 
  does little or nothing to enhance the state's interest, it can properly be seen 
  as arbitrary and not in accordance with fundamental justice. In such circumstances 
  there cannot possibly be a fair balance between the individual's rights and 
  the collective interests. Sopinka J. put it this way, at 594: </p>
<p class="indent"> Where the deprivation of the right in question does little 
  or nothing to enhance the state's interest (whatever it may be), it seems to 
  me that a breach of fundamental justice will be made out, as the individual's 
  rights will have been deprived for no valid purpose. This is, to my mind, essentially 
  the type of analysis which E. Colvin advocates in his article &quot;Section 
  Seven of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>&quot; (1989), 
  68 <em>Can. Bar Rev.</em> 560, and which was carried out in <em>Morgentaler</em>. 
  That is, both Dickson C.J. and Beetz J. were of the view that at least some 
  of the restrictions placed upon access to abortion had no relevance to the state 
  objective of protecting the foetus while protecting the life and health of the 
  mother. In that regard the restrictions were arbitrary or unfair.</p>
<p> [136] The first way in which the Hitzig applicants say that the conditions 
  of the <em>MMAR</em> do not comply with fundamental justice is the daily dosage limit 
  they place on the amount of marihuana that an ATP holder can possess at any 
  point in time. They argue that this is unreasonable because, given the unpredictability 
  of the strength and quality of the marihuana that is available, this limit may 
  well deprive the individual of sufficient medication to properly control the 
  symptoms of his or her serious medication condition.</p>
<p> [137] This argument fails for two reasons. First, the state has a substantial 
  and compelling interest in ensuring that the dosages of this medication are 
  no greater than necessary both to protect vulnerable patients from an untested 
  drug and to ensure against the diversion of any excess to the illicit drug trade. 
  A daily limit fixed by a doctor is a reasonable way to achieve both ends. Second, 
  if the daily dosage limit proves inadequate to treat the symptom properly, the 
  <em>MMAR</em> provide for it to be raised on medical recommendation, so that the individual's 
  medical need is met. Thus, the daily dosage limit cannot be said to impose an 
  undue burden on individual rights and represents a fair balance between the 
  individual interest and the state interest.</p>
<p> [138] The second attack on the eligibility barriers created by the <em>MMAR</em> focuses 
  on the use of physicians as gatekeepers in the sense that every application 
  must be supported by a doctor and it is that doctor who must declare that marihuana 
  is recommended to mitigate the symptom involved. It is argued that this places 
  unwarranted power to determine whether an individual receives a medical exemption 
  in the hands of physicians rather than letting the individual decide for him 
  or herself or having the Minister of Health do so. It is further argued that 
  the serious concerns of several central medical groups about the gatekeeper 
  role for physicians means that doctors will not assist individuals to obtain 
  medical exemptions.</p>
<p> [139] Again, we do not agree. Whether marihuana will mitigate the particular 
  symptom of an individual with a particular serious medical condition is fundamentally 
  a medical question. Just as physicians are relied on to determine the need for 
  prescription drugs, it is reasonable for the state to require the medical opinion 
  of physicians here, particularly given that this drug is untested.<a href="#11">[11]</a><a name="r11"></a> 
  The second argument is answered by Lederman Js finding that despite the concerns 
  of central medical bodies, a sufficient number of individual physicians were 
  authorizing the therapeutic use of marihuana that the medical exemption could 
  not be said to be practically unavailable. This finding of fact is entirely 
  reasonable on the record in this case and we would not interfere with it. Of 
  course, if in future physician co-operation drops to the point that the medical 
  exemption scheme becomes ineffective, this conclusion might have to be revisited. 
</p>
<p> [140] The third attack on the eligibility conditions of the <em>MMAR</em>, and the 
  one focused on in the argument before us, rests on the requirement that the 
  physician support for a medical exemption for individuals in category 2 and 
  category 3 must come from specialists. Again, the Hitzig applicants make two 
  arguments in mounting the attack.</p>
<p> [141] First, they say that because marihuana is an untested medication there 
  is no justification for requiring medical support beyond the individual's own 
  general practitioner since the specialist has no knowledge advantage. They say 
  that when this is combined with the practical difficulties that exist in accessing 
  specialists, particularly in rural areas, the specialist requirements for categories 
  2 and 3 constitute an unreasonable barrier which significantly interferes with 
  those in medical need from accessing the medication they require.</p>
<p> [142] In our view, this argument too does not succeed. In order to qualify 
  for a medical exemption, both individuals in category 2 and those in category 
  3 must have a declaration from a specialist practising in an area of medicine 
  relevant to the treatment of the individual's medical condition causing the 
  symptom to be mitigated. The declaration must say that all conventional treatments 
  for the symptom have been tried or considered and why each is medically inappropriate. 
  The requirement for a declaration in this form serves substantial and compelling 
  state interests. First, it serves the state interest in protecting the health 
  and safety of its citizens in relation to an untested drug. Second, it serves 
  the state interest in complying with international conventions aimed at restricting 
  the use of drugs such as marihuana save for legitimate medical and scientific 
  purposes. A specialist in the treatment of the particular medical condition 
  is likely to have more knowledge than a general practitioner of the complete 
  range of possible treatments, including ones that may just be emerging. The 
  specialist requirement thus better assures that marihuana is used only if no 
  other more conventional medication is effective. Given that marihuana is an 
  untested drug, this is a substantial and compelling state interest. So too is 
  compliance with international conventions that are designed to restrict the 
  use of drugs save for legitimate medical and scientific purposes a state interest 
  which the specialist requirement also serves. </p>
<p> [143] Moreover, on this record, the Hitzig applicants simply have not shown 
  that the specialist requirement is a significant impediment to obtaining a medical 
  exemption. Only one of these applicants, Ms. Devries, can point to any difficulty, 
  due to a lack of access, in getting specialist support for her application, 
  and there is some doubt that this individual sought actively to meet this requirement, 
  because she first spoke to a specialist only a few days before her cross-examination 
  in this proceeding. Here as well, Lederman Js finding of fact, at paras. 154-56, 
  that the specialist requirement does not make the medical exemption practically 
  unavailable, is entirely reasonable and not open to interference by this court. 
  However, as with the concern over physician co-operation, should the passage 
  of time reveal that access to specialists is a significant practical impediment 
  a different conclusion might be reached. Thus, on this record we conclude that 
  the specialist requirement does not constitute an undue constraint on the individual's 
  ability to get a medical exemption and represents a fair balance between the 
  interests of the individual and the state.</p>
<p> [144] However, in our view, the second argument in this attack does have merit. 
  The Hitzig applicants simply say that the requirement to have a second specialist 
  support the application for an individual in category 3 does little or nothing 
  to enhance the state's interest and in that sense represents an arbitrary restriction.</p>
<p> [145] We agree. The second specialist requirement is clearly an additional 
  restriction on the acquisition of a medical exemption by those in category 3. 
  Yet it is hard to see that the second specialist adds anything that could be 
  said to advance the state interest. The second specialist is no differently 
  qualified than the first. Ironically, the second specialist is not asked at 
  all to opine about the availability of other possible treatments, which is the 
  principal justification advanced by the state for any specialist involvement. 
  Rather, the second specialist is required only to agree with the first specialist 
  that marihuana would mitigate the symptom and that the benefits outweigh the 
  risks. And in doing so the second specialist does not see the individual but 
  merely reviews the medical file. In these circumstances the requirement for 
  a second opinion adds so little if any value to the assessment of medical need 
  that it is no more than an arbitrary barrier standing between an individual 
  in category 3 and a medical exemption. In this particular respect only, the 
  eligibility conditions of the <em>MMAR</em> do not accord with the principles of fundamental 
  justice.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(x) The s. 1 Analysis </strong></p>
<p> [146] Having found that this scheme of medical exemption violates s. 7, it 
  remains to consider s. 1. Can the Government demonstrate that the offensive 
  aspects of the <em>MMAR</em> constitute a reasonable limit that is demonstrably justified 
  in a free and democratic society? We agree with Lederman J. that the answer 
  to this is no. Indeed, we are in substantial agreement with his reasons.</p>
<p> [147] In the course of our s. 7 analysis, with respect to both eligibility 
  and supply, we have undertaken a balancing between the interests of the state 
  and the interests of the individual and have concluded that the offending provisions 
  of the <em>MMAR</em> do not advance the collective interest sufficiently to justify the 
  limitation which they place on the individual's rights. The factors which we 
  considered there are also germane to the s. 1 analysis. Hence, we do not think 
  it necessary to repeat in detail the balancing exercise in relation to s. 1, 
  particularly since there, unlike s. 7 the onus of justification rests on the 
  state, making the state's task that much harder.</p>
<p> [148] Suffice it to say that we agree with Lederman J. that the <em>MMAR</em> seek 
  to provide a medical exemption while pursuing the objectives of better public 
  health and safety and effective narcotic drug control consistent with Canada's 
  international treaty obligations. We accept that these objectives are pressing 
  and substantial.</p>
<p> [149] However, like Lederman J., we conclude that both offending aspects of 
  the <em>MMAR</em> clearly fail the first step in the proportionality test required by 
  s. 1. There is simply no rational connection between either of the two offending 
  aspects of the scheme of medical exemption and these important objectives.</p>
<p> [150] The first aspect is the eligibility requirement that those individuals 
  in category 3 have the support of a second specialist. As we have said, this 
  requirement is at best redundant. It adds no value to the application and does 
  little or nothing to advance the state objective. In particular it does nothing 
  to promote public health and safety. And it is entirely irrelevant to effective 
  narcotic drug control. There is no rational connection between this requirement 
  and the state objectives.</p>
<p> [151] The second aspect is the maintenance of significant barriers between 
  individuals with the medical need to use marihuana and a licit supply of the 
  medication which they require. As we have described, the effect of the <em>MMAR</em> 
  is to force seriously ill individuals to seek the medication they need from 
  the black market with all the risks of tainted product that this presents. Exposing 
  these individuals to these risks does not advance the objective of better public 
  health and safety. Rather, it is contrary to it. Equally, driving business to 
  the black market is contrary to better narcotic drug control. Here again there 
  is an absence of rational connection with the state objectives.</p>
<p> [152] Thus, neither aspect of the <em>MMAR</em> which we have found to contravene s. 
  7 can be saved by s. 1.</p>
<p  class="indent"> <strong>(xi) The Appropriate Remedy</strong> </p>
<p> [153] Having found that the <em>MMAR</em> do not create a constitutionally valid medical 
  exemption to the criminal prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>, we must now shape 
  a declaration under s. 52 of the <em>Charter</em> which responds to the constitutional 
  shortcomings of the <em>MMAR</em>. We must then determine whether that order should be 
  suspended. As we shall explain, we have concluded that a precisely targeted 
  declaration is appropriate and that it should not be suspended. In this case, 
  the same considerations which dictate the relatively narrow focus of our declaration 
  of invalidity militate against any suspension of that order. We will identify 
  and address those factors subsequently, as they apply to both the scope and 
  timing of the remedy we would grant. First, however, we must turn to the order 
  proposed by the Hitzig applicants.</p>
<p> [154] The Hitzig applicants argue that the appropriate remedy for the constitutional 
  deficiency in the scheme of medical exemption crafted by the Government is the 
  declaration granted by Lederman J., namely that the <em>MMAR</em> in their entirety are 
  constitutionally invalid and of no force or effect. In their cross-appeal they 
  also seek a declaration that the criminal prohibition against possession in 
  s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> is of no force or effect in relation to marihuana. Of course, 
  without the invalidity of the marihuana prohibition in s. 4, an order declaring 
  the <em>MMAR</em> to be of no force or effect would leave those in medical need of marihuana 
  with no way to possess it without criminal sanction.</p>
<p> [155] We find the remedy contended for by the Hitzig applicants to be overly 
  broad and inadequately tailored to the constitutional deficiencies in the <em>MMAR</em>. 
  Section 52(1) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> requires the court to strike 
  down any law that is inconsistent with the Constitution, but only &quot;to the 
  extent of the inconsistency&quot;. This invites some precision in selecting 
  a remedy.</p>
<p> [156] Dealing first with the eligibility deficiencies in the <em>MMAR</em>, it is true 
  that the declarations sought by these applicants have the effect of removing 
  the barrier of criminal sanction for possession of marihuana by those in medical 
  need of it. However, the remedy proposed by the respondents achieves this result 
  only by striking down the <em>MMAR</em> in their entirety and by coupling this with the 
  invalidation of the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. The latter declaration 
  would exempt from criminal sanction all those who possess marihuana, not just 
  those who must do so out of medical necessity. Thus, the remedy sought goes 
  well beyond the eligibility deficiencies in the medical exemption crafted by 
  the appellant. In that sense the remedy sought by these respondents is simply 
  too broad.</p>
<p> [157] Turning to the supply deficiency in the <em>MMAR</em>, the remedy proposed by 
  these respondents does nothing to address this constitutional defect. Even if 
  the entirety of the <em>MMAR</em> and the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> were 
  declared invalid, those with a medical need for marihuana would remain without 
  a licit source of supply. The proposed solution is simply not tailored to meet 
  that problem. </p>
<p> [158] Rather, we think that the remedy must be more specifically targeted 
  to the constitutional shortcomings that we have identified in the <em>MMAR</em>.</p>
<p> [159] First, as to its eligibility provisions, we have found that the requirement 
  for a second specialist is unnecessary and violates the s. 7 rights of those 
  in medical need who come within category 3. We would simply declare that requirement, 
  found in ss 4(2)(c) and s. 7 of the <em>MMAR</em>, to be of no force or effect. 
</p>
<p> [160] We have also found that the <em>MMAR</em> violate the s. 7 rights of those with 
  a medical need for marihuana because they fail to effectively remove the state 
  barriers to a licit source of supply. As we have described, these barriers encompass 
  a broad array of state actions: the <em>MMAR</em>, the provisions of the <em>FDA</em> and the 
  <em>CDSA</em> and the regulations made thereunder and ultimately the criminal sanction 
  applied to anyone (except a DPL holder) who supplies marihuana to an individual 
  with a medical need for it.</p>
<p> [161] We have earlier described the ineffectiveness of the DPL provisions 
  of the <em>MMAR</em> to ensure a licit supply to ATP holders. That ineffectiveness appears 
  to stem very largely from two prohibitions in the <em>MMAR</em>. First, a DPL holder 
  cannot be remunerated for growing marihuana and supplying it to the ATP holder 
  (s. 34(2)). Second, a DPL holder cannot grow marihuana for more than one ATP 
  holder (s. 41(b)) nor combine his or her growing with more than two other DPL 
  holders (s. 54). These barriers effectively prevent the emergence of lawfully 
  sanctioned &quot;compassion clubs&quot; or any other efficient form of supply 
  to ATP holders. Indeed, when asked in argument which specific barriers had to 
  be removed to provide for a lawful source of supply, counsel for the Hitzig 
  applicants immediately cited these provisions.</p>
<p> [162] As the record makes clear, there are a number of people who already 
  have a source of marihuana and wish to engage in compassionate supply of it 
  to those in medical need. Indeed the Government's case rested in large part 
  on their existence. It argued that they effectively serve as &quot;unlicensed 
  suppliers&quot; for ATP holders. It may be that not all of these people would 
  satisfy the requirements to become DPL holders set out in the <em>MMAR</em>. However, 
  we are satisfied that, on this record, enough would do so that taken together 
  with existing DPL holders, the DPL mechanism as modified could then provide 
  a licit source of supply to ATP holders. Once this modification is implemented, 
  ATP holders would therefore no longer need to access the black market to get 
  the marihuana they need.</p>
<p> [163] Nor for DPL holders drawn from &quot;unlicensed suppliers&quot; is there 
  a &quot;first seed&quot; problem requiring that they enter the black market. 
  They already have their first seed. For future DPL holders who do not have their 
  first seed, the constitutional problem presented by their need to access the 
  black market once in order to get that first seed is far less than the problem 
  under the <em>MMAR</em>, where ATP holders themselves are mostly unable to obtain designated 
  producers and, not being healthy enough to grow their own marihuana, must regularly 
  and repeatedly access the black market.</p>
<p> [164] However, even this limited first seed difficulty would be eliminated 
  if future DPL holders who did not already have their first seed could access 
  the Government supply to obtain it. The regulation that was brought into force 
  on July 8, 2003 would appear to provide for just that solution. </p>
<p> [165] Taking these considerations together, we conclude that the remedy which 
  most directly addresses the constitutional deficiency presented by the absence 
  of a licit supply of marihuana is to declare invalid sections 34(2), 41(b) and 
  54 of the <em>MMAR</em>. This will allow all DPL holders to be compensated, to grow for 
  more than one ATP holder, and to combine their growing with more than two other 
  DPL holders. Provided that the regulation of July 8, 2003 remains in place and 
  is acted upon, there is no need to declare that the Government has a constitutional 
  obligation to provide the first seed to those DPL holders who do not have one.</p>
<p> [166] The declarations of invalidity we propose remove the single unconstitutional 
  barrier to eligibility and sufficient barriers to supply that ATP holders will 
  be reasonably able to meet their medical needs from licit sources. As a result, 
  the <em>MMAR</em> as modified become a constitutionally sound medical exemption to the 
  marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. While the record before us sustains 
  this conclusion, it is conceivable that, as events unfold, further serious barriers 
  could emerge either to eligibility or to reasonable access to a licit source 
  of supply. Should that happen, the issue of the appropriate remedy might have 
  to be revisited in a future case.</p>
<p> [167] The final question we must consider is whether to suspend our declarations. 
  We address this in the context of the guidance provided by Lamer C.J.C. in <em>Schachter 
  v. Canada</em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679 at 717: </p>
<p class="indent"> The question whether to delay the application of a declaration 
  of nullity should therefore turn not on considerations of the role of the court 
  and the legislature, but rather on considerations listed earlier relating to 
  the effect of an immediate declaration on the public.</p>
<p> [168] Chief Justice Lamer was referring to any potential public danger, threat 
  to the rule of law, or denial of benefit to deserving persons that could arise 
  if there were no suspension. None are applicable here. Indeed an immediately 
  effective order would reduce any potential public danger and the threat to the 
  rule of law by providing ATP holders with an effective alternative to the black 
  market.</p>
<p> [169] Not only is the suspension of our order not justified under the ratio 
  of <em>Schachter</em>. There are five factors specific to this case which weigh 
  against any suspension of our order. As will be apparent, these considerations 
  have also shaped the scope of our remedy albeit viewed from a somewhat different 
  perspective. Viewed in that context, they speak to the targeted declaration 
  we have determined to be appropriate. Viewed in the context of the timing of 
  that declaration, they also speak against any suspension.</p>
<p> [170] First, if we do not suspend our order, there will immediately be a constitutionally 
  valid exemption in effect and the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> 
  will immediately be constitutionally valid and of full force and effect. In 
  <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>, this court declared the prohibition invalid as of July 
  31, 2001 if by that date the Government had not enacted a constitutionally sound 
  medical exemption. Our decision in this case confirms that it did not do so. 
  Hence the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 has been of no force or effect since 
  July 31, 2001. Since the July 8, 2003 regulation did not address the eligibility 
  deficiency, that alone could not have cured the problem. However, our order 
  has the result of constitutionalizing the medical exemption created by the Government. 
  As a result, the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 is no longer inconsistent with 
  the provisions of the Constitution. Although Parliament may subsequently choose 
  to change it, that prohibition is now no longer invalid, but is of full force 
  and effect. Those who establish medical need are simply exempted from it. This 
  consequence removes the cloud of uncertainty from the marihuana prohibition 
  in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> - a cloud which we were told in argument has created very 
  considerable confusion for courts and law enforcement agencies alike. A suspension 
  of our remedy would simply have continued that undesirable uncertainty for a 
  further period of time.</p>
<p> [171] Second, in argument, counsel for the Government strongly urged that 
  if we found the <em>MMAR</em> to be constitutionally flawed, we should be as precise 
  as possible in specifying the corrective measures to be taken. Our remedy quite 
  precisely determines the barriers in the <em>MMAR</em> which, if removed, would render 
  it a constitutionally sound medical exemption to s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. Our order 
  represents a minimal intrusion on the Government's scheme of medical exemption. 
  It leaves untouched the licensed possession aspect of the scheme and modifies 
  the licensed production aspect of it only enough to make it constitutionally 
  acceptable.</p>
<p> [172] Third, we acknowledge that the Government could choose to address the 
  constitutional difficulty by adopting an approach fundamentally different from 
  that contemplated in the <em>MMAR</em>. The alternatives range from the Government acting 
  as the sole provider, to the decriminalization of all transactions that provide 
  marihuana to an ATP holder. Indeed, even if the Government is content with the 
  solution contained in the <em>MMAR</em> as modified by our order, it may seek to impose 
  reasonable limits, provided they do not impede an effective licit supply, for 
  example on the amount of compensation that a DPL holder can claim or on the 
  size of the operation that a DPL holder can undertake.</p>
<p> [173] If the Government wishes to adopt any of these alternatives, that decision 
  could be taken quickly, given the obvious thought that has gone into the development 
  of its policy on the medical use of marihuana. Moreover, it can easily be implemented 
  with dispatch, simply by regulation. An amendment to the <em>CDSA</em> is not necessary.<a href="#12">[12]</a><a name="r12"></a> 
  In the meantime, the constitutional rights of those in medical need will be 
  respected.</p>
<p> [174] Fourth, a central component of the Government's case is that there is 
  an established part of the black market, which has historically provided a safe 
  source of marihuana to those with the medical need for it, and that there is 
  therefore no supply issue. The Government says that these &quot;unlicensed suppliers&quot; 
  should continue to serve as the source of supply for those with a medical exemption. 
  Since our remedy in effect simply clears the way for a licensing of these suppliers, 
  the Government cannot be heard to argue that our remedy is unworkable.</p>
<p> [175] Finally an order that is not suspended gives immediate recognition to 
  the s. 7 rights of those whose serious illnesses necessitate that they use marihuana. 
  Some of these people are terminally ill. To suspend our remedy if they may die 
  in the meantime is, in our view, inconsistent with fundamental <em>Charter</em> values.</p>
<p> [176] In summary, we would dismiss the Government's appeal and allow the cross-appeal 
  of the Hitzig applicants, but only in one specific respect. However, because 
  of our conclusion about the proper remedy, we would alter the judgment appealed 
  from by setting aside its first two paragraphs and substituting an order declaring 
  that the second specialist requirement (s. 4(2)(c) and s. 7) and sections 34(2), 
  41(b) and 54 of the <em>MMAR</em> are of no force and effect. We would not disturb the 
  order as to costs made below nor order costs in this court.</p>
<h3 class="underline"> IV. The <em>Parker, Turmel </em>and <em>Paquette</em> Appeals</h3>
<p> [177] The applications brought below by Mr. Turmel, Mr. Parker and Mr. Paquette 
  attack the constitutionality of the criminal prohibition against the possession 
  of marihuana in the <em>CDSA</em> on the basis that marihuana is a medically necessary 
  drug. Because the issues were so common, these applications were heard together 
  with the application brought by the Hitzig applicants. All these applications 
  were disposed of by Lederman J. in one set of reasons. </p>
<p> [178] Mr. Turmel, Mr. Parker and Mr. Paquette all brought in-person appeals 
  from Lederman J. In argument, we heard submissions from Mr. Turmel and Mr. Parker. 
  Mr. Paquette was not present, although he did file a factum. </p>
<p> [179] The position put forward in this court by these appellants differ in 
  only two respects from the case as put forward by the Hitzig applicants. Thus, 
  we need only deal with these two arguments.</p>
<p> [180] First, Mr. Turmel and Mr. Parker argue that the criminal prohibition 
  on the possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> is a &quot;genocidal&quot; 
  violation of the s. 7 right to life in that it prohibits healthy Canadians from 
  using marihuana to prevent the onset of serious medical conditions such as epilepsy. 
</p>
<p> [181] The simple answer to this is that, as Lederman J. found, there was no 
  medical evidence presented that the smoking of marihuana by healthy individuals 
  has any prophylactic effect whatsoever. Moreover, as this court found in <em>R. 
  v. Clay, supra</em>, s. 4 is overbroad only in that it extends to those who 
  need to use marihuana because they already have a serious medical condition. 
  The &quot;prophylactic use&quot; argument, particularly, where there is no evidence 
  upon which to found it, cannot be squared with <em>Clay</em>. </p>
<p> [182] For his part, Mr. Paquette argued in his factum that the marihuana prohibition 
  in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> violates his own right to life. This too is an argument 
  with no evidence to support it. While Mr. Paquette has not applied for a medical 
  exemption under the <em>MMAR</em>, he has been granted a series of exemptions under s. 
  56 of the <em>CDSA</em> which have permitted him to lawfully possess marihuana. The <em>MMAR</em> 
  therefore have not prevented him from possessing marihuana without criminal 
  sanction, and thus could pose no threat to his right to life.</p>
<p> [183] Thus, it is unnecessary to examine either argument further. In summary, 
  we reject both of them and would dismiss the Turmel, Parker and Paquette appeals.</p>

  SUPPLY BY A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER</p>
<p>70. A medical practitioner who has obtained marihuana from a licensed dealer

  <em>R. v. Caine</em> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (B.C.C.A.). </p>

  1988, December 19, 1988, UN Doc. E/Conf. 82/15, Can. T.S. 1990 No. 42.</p>
<p><a name="7"></a><a href="#r7">[7]</a> The history of that policy is traced 
  in the reasons of Lederman J. at paras. 9-21; in <em>R. v. Parker, supra</em>; 
  and in <em>Wakeford v. Canada </em>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 65 (C.A.) (leave to 
  appeal dismissed: [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 147 (QL)). </p>
<p><a name="8"></a><a href="#r8">[8]</a> Section 9 of the <em>MMAR</em> requires 
  additional information where the recommended daily dosage is above 5 grams.</p>
<p><a name="9"></a><a href="#r9">[9]</a> The Government has released more timely<em> 
  MMAR</em> application and authorization statistics on the website of its Office
  of Cannabis Medical Access. This material is available at http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hecs-sesc/ocma/stats/stats.htm 
  However, the court did not consider the more recent statistics because they 
  did not form part of the record in these appeals and because the parties did 
  not have an opportunity to address them.</p>
<p><a name="10"></a><a href="#r10">[10]</a> We see no inconsistency between the 
  holding in <em>Parker</em> and this court&#146;s refusal in the subsequent case 
  of <em>Wakeford v. Canada</em> (2002), 58 OR (3d) 65 (C.A.) to make an order 
  compelling the Government to supply marihuana to the holder of a medical exemption. 
  Nothing said in <em>Parker</em>, or in this case, compels the Government to 
  supply marihuana to anyone. Furthermore, the refusal to make the order in <em>Wakeford</em> 
  was based on specific findings of fact, including the fact that the Government 
  did not have access to a safe supply of marihuana. Those facts were supported 
  by the evidence adduced in <em>Wakeford</em>, but some of them are inconsistent 
  with the evidence heard in this case. </p>
<p><a name="11"></a><a href="#r11">[11]</a> Every jurisdiction in the United States 
  that has enacted a law to permit the medical use of marihuana by seriously ill 
  persons requires the prior approval of a physician in order to access this drug. 
  As of the time these appeals were heard, eight states had enacted such laws: 
  Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. 
  Similar bills were before the state Legislatures in Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
  New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wyoming.</p>
<p><a name="12"></a><a href="#r12">[12]</a> See the reasons of this court in<em> 
  R. v. J.P. </em>(C40043), at paras. 19-27, being released concurrently with 
  these reasons.</p>
