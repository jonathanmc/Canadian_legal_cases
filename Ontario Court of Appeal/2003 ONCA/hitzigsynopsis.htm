<p class="boldcenter">Synopsis of <em>Hitzig et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen</em>; 
  <em>Parker v. Her Majesty the Queen</em>; <br>
  and <em>Paquette and Turmel v. Her Majesty the Queen </em></p>
<p>The federal government has recognized since 1999 that the possession and use 
  of marihuana for medical purposes by individuals who can demonstrate medical 
  need should not be a crime under the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>. 
  In June 1999, the government began to issue ministerial permits allowing individuals 
  to possess and cultivate marihuana for medicinal purposes. In July 2000, this 
  court held in <em>R. v. Parker</em> that a scheme that depended entirely on 
  how the Minister of Health chose to exercise his or her discretion was unconstitutional. 
  The court gave the government one year to fix the constitutional defect. </p>
<p>The government responded in July 2001 with the <em>Marihuana Medical Access 
  Regulations</em> (<em>MMAR</em>). The <em>MMAR</em> recognize that marihuana 
  is a medically appropriate medication for the treatment of various symptoms 
  associated with various serious illnesses. They also recognize that the determination 
  of when marihuana is a medically appropriate medication and the amount of marihuana 
  that is appropriate are decisions that should be made by qualified physicians 
  and not by government officials or by the users of marihuana. </p>
<p>The <em>MMAR</em> provide that an authorization to possess (ATP) marihuana 
  shall be issued where an applicant meets the medical criteria set out in the 
  regulations. They also provide for authorizations to grow the marihuana needed 
  to fill an ATP holder's medical needs. The ATP holder may personally acquire 
  a licence (PPL) or a person designated to grow the marihuana for the ATP holder 
  may acquire a licence (DPL). </p>
<p>Following promulgation of the <em>MMAR</em>, several seriously ill individuals 
  brought a joint application in the Superior Court of Justice challenging their 
  constitutionality. On January 9, 2003, Justice Sidney N. Lederman concluded 
  that, because the <em>MMAR</em> failed to provide a legal supply of marihuana 
  for persons entitled to possess it for medicinal purposes, the regulations are 
  constitutionally invalid and of no force and effect. However, he suspended his 
  declaration of invalidity for a period of six months.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2003, shortly before these appeals were heard, the government brought 
  forward an interim policy making available for approved medical users marihuana 
  seeds and dried marihuana grown for the government. However, the interim policy 
  was to be in place &quot;only while clarification was being sought from the 
  courts&quot; and the government did not ask the court to pass on the constitutionality 
  of the <em>MMAR</em> as modified by the interim policy nor suggest that the 
  interim policy should have any effect on the outcome of these appeals. </p>
<p>In a judgment released today, a panel of the Court of Appeal, consisting of 
  Justices David Doherty, Stephen Goudge and Janet Simmons unanimously dismissed 
  the federal government's appeal of Justice Lederman's decision. </p>
<p>The court accepted that the evidence filed on the application establishes that 
  many individuals who have or would be entitled to receive an ATP will have to 
  go to the black market on a more or less regular basis to maintain their supply 
  of medical marihuana. The court observed that many of these individuals are 
  not only seriously ill, they are also significantly physically handicapped and 
  therefore cannot possibly grow their own marihuana. Moreover, because of restrictions 
  in the <em>MMAR</em>, cultivation by a designate (DPL holder) will be an answer 
  for only some of the persons who qualify. </p>
<p>The court noted that the <em>MMAR</em> scheme assumes the existence of the 
  black market and indeed depends on it, but that medical marihuana users have 
  experienced significant difficulties in accessing the black market safely. The 
  court concluded that a scheme that authorizes possession of marihuana by seriously 
  ill individuals but which drives some of them to the black market to meet their 
  recognized medical needs undermines the rule of law and fails to create a constitutionally 
  valid medical exemption to the criminal prohibition against possession of marihuana 
  contained in s. 4 of the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to holding that the absence of a legal supply of medical marihuana 
  makes the <em>MMAR</em> constitutionally defective, the court determined that 
  the requirement in the <em>MMAR</em> that some applicants have the support of 
  a second specialist physician to establish medical need is unconstitutional. 
  Primarily because the second specialist is not asked to opine about the principal 
  justification advanced by the government to support specialist involvement, 
  namely, the availability of other possible treatments, the court determined 
  that the second specialist requirement is an arbitrary barrier that adds little 
  or nothing to the assessment of medical need.</p>
<p>Rather than strike down the <em>MMAR</em> in their entirety and declare that 
  the marihuana prohibition contained in s. 4 of the <em>Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act</em> continues to be of no force and effect, the court crafted 
  a narrower remedy more specifically targeted to the constitutional shortcomings 
  it had identified, striking down only the following specific provisions of the 
  <em>MMAR</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the prohibition against compensating a DPL holder for growing marihuana 
    and supplying it to an ATP holder; </li>
  <li>the provision preventing a DPL holder from growing marihuana for more than 
    one ATP holder;</li>
  <li>the prohibition against a DPL holder producing marihuana in common with 
    more than two other DPL holders; and </li>
  <li>the second specialist requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The court concluded that the same considerations that justified the narrow 
  focus of its remedy militated against suspending it. The court said that unlike 
  a broader declaration, this narrow remedy would create a constitutionally valid 
  medical exemption, making the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>Controlled 
  Drugs and Substances Act</em> immediately constitutionally valid and of full 
  force and effect and removing any uncertainty concerning the validity of the 
  prohibition. In addition, the court noted that its order represents a minimal 
  intrusion on the government's scheme of medical exemption. It leaves untouched 
  the licensed possession aspect of the <em>MMAR</em> and modifies the licensed 
  production aspect only enough to make it constitutionally acceptable. Moreover, 
  the remedy crafted by the court merely clears the way for licensing those suppliers 
  upon whom the government scheme attempted to rely. Finally, the court said that 
  if the government chooses to adopt a fundamentally different approach to the 
  medical exemption issue or if it chooses to impose additional reasonable limits 
  on the present scheme, the government can do so easily and with dispatch, by 
  way of regulation. </p>
<p>The court emphasized that its decision applies only in respect of persons who 
  establish a medical need to use marihuana to relieve symptoms of serious illnesses 
  and that it does not apply to persons who wish to use or possess marihuana for 
  social or recreational purposes.</p>
<p>The court dismissed two additional related appeals brought by three individuals 
  whose applications for constitutional declarations were also heard by Justice 
  Lederman, holding that no further relief was warranted based on the evidence 
  adduced in those applications.</p>

<p class="boldcenter">Synopsis of <em>R. v. J.P.</em> </p>
<p>In its concurrently released decision of <em>R. v. J.P.</em>, the court confirmed 
  that the offence of possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em>Controlled Drugs 
  and Substances Act </em>was of no force and effect on April 12, 2002 (the date 
  the young person was charged) because, as of that date, there was no constitutionally 
  valid medical exemption to the marihuana prohibition as required by <em>Parker</em>. 
  However, the court concluded that the scope of the marihuana possession prohibition 
  is subject to change by regulation. </p>

<p class="boldcenter">Synopsis of <em>R. v. Turmel</em>. </p>
<p>In its concurrently released decision of<em> R. v. Turmel</em>, the court rejected 
  the appellant's argument that its decision in <em>R. v. Parker</em> had the 
  effect of removing marihuana from Schedule II of the <em>Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act</em>. The court confirmed that the declaration in <em>Parker 
  </em>was limited to the offence of possession of marihuana contained in s. 4 
  of the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act </em>and that the offence of 
  possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contained in s. 5(2) 
  of the Act continued to exist on May 26, 2003 (the date Mr. Turmel was charged).</p>
