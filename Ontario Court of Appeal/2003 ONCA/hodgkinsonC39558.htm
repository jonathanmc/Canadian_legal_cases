<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Romain W.M. Pitt of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 21, 2003.</p>
<p>
  MORDEN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Introduction</p>
<p> [1] The basic issue in this appeal is whether the respondent insurance company 
  is obliged, under the terms of a homeowner&#8217;s policy it issued to the appellant, 
  to defend the appellant in an action commenced against him in which the plaintiffs 
  seek damages for defamation. Justice Pitt, by reason of a provision in the policy 
  that excluded coverage if the damage was &#8220;caused by an intentional &#8230; 
  act&#8221; by the insured, dismissed an application by the insured in which 
  he sought a declaration that the respondent had a duty to defend the action. 
  The insured appeals from this decision<a href="#1">[1]</a> <a name="r1"></a>. 
  From the foregoing, it may be seen that the issue on this appeal is whether 
  the applications judge was right in concluding, on the material in the record, 
  that by reason of the &#8220;intentional act&#8221; exclusion the duty to defend 
  was not engaged. For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the applications 
  judge&#8217;s disposition is correct.<a href="#2">[2]</a> <a name="r2"></a></p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] The facts bearing on the issue to be resolved are, necessarily, to be found 
  in the pleadings in the defamation action against the insured (Non-Marine Underwriters, 
  Lloyd&#8217;s of London v. Scalera, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 551 at paragraphs 79 and 
  80). In what follows I shall set forth the material allegations in the pleadings.</p>
<p>
  [3] The corporate plaintiff in the defamation action is a public company that 
  carries on business &#8220;as a traditional and internet-based investment bank 
  which raises capital online for small market capitalization companies and provides 
  online trading services&#8221;. The individual plaintiff is the president and 
  chief executive officer of the corporate plaintiff and a barrister and solicitor 
  in good standing with the Law Society of Upper Canada.</p>
<p>
  [4] The plaintiffs allege that the defendant, during a six-week period in 2002, 
  published messages by posting them on a message board devoted to the corporate 
  plaintiff that is part of an internet web-site operated by StockHouse Media 
  Corporation. The statement of claim extensively quotes extracts from the postings 
  relating to the plaintiffs&#8217; trading activities, investigations into them 
  by regulatory authorities, and a lawsuit against them. </p>
<p>
  [5] The statement of claim alleges that the postings meant and were understood 
  to mean that the plaintiffs: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) were improperly trading with inside knowledge and were 
  participating in inappropriate practices;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) had been investigated by the Investment Dealers Association 
  and the Ontario Securities Commission with the result that fines were levied;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) were defendants in recent litigation commenced against 
  them that was meritorious and because of it the corporate plaintiff would become 
  insolvent.</p>
<p>
  [6] The plaintiffs allege generally that &#8220;[b]y reason of the above defamatory 
  Postings, the plaintiffs have suffered injury to their character, credit and 
  reputation and [the corporate plaintiff] has suffered damages to its trade and 
  business&#8221;. The statement of claim also alleges that the postings were 
  made &#8220;falsely and maliciously&#8221; and &#8220;were intended to interfere 
  with the economic relations of [the plaintiffs]&#8221;.</p>
<p>
  [7] In his statement of defence, the insured admits that he wrote the extracts 
  from the postings alleged in the statement of claim but denied generally that 
  any of the words in the postings were defamatory of either plaintiff. He further 
  pleads that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) insofar as the words in the extracts consist of statements 
  of fact the said words convey only their natural and ordinary meaning, and they 
  are substantially true;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the words in the postings were not capable of being understood 
  to bear any of the meaning alleged in the statement of claim or any defamatory 
  meanings; and </p>
<p class="indent">(3) insofar as the words in the extracts consist of statements 
  of fact, they are substantially true, and insofar as the words consist of expressions 
  of opinion, they are fair comment on a matter of public interest reasonably 
  drawn from the facts, made by the defendant in good faith and without malice.</p>
<p>
  The Insurance Policy</p>
<p>
  [8] As indicated at the outset of these reasons, the policy is a homeowner&#8217;s 
  property policy which includes coverage for liability. The liability coverage 
  section in the policy includes the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> We will pay all sums which you become legally liable to pay 
  as compensatory damages because of bodily injury or property damage.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;.</p>
<p class="indent">You are insured for claims made against you arising from </p>
<p class="indent">1. Personal Liability &#8211; legal liability arising out of 
  your personal actions anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;.</p>
<p>
  [9] The exclusion provision reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You are not insured for claims arising from: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#8230;.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) bodily injury or property damage caused by any intentional 
  or criminal act or failure to act by </p>
<p class="indent">(a) by any person insured by the policy; or </p>
<p class="indent">(b) any other person at the direction of any person insured 
  by this policy; [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [10] The duty to defend provision contains the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Under Coverage E [legal liability], we will defend any suit against you alleging 
  bodily injury or property damage and seeking compensatory damages, even if it 
  is groundless, false or fraudulent.</p>
<p>
  The Applications Judge&#8217;s Reasons</p>
<p>
  [11] The applications judge first decided that the claim against the insured 
  was covered by the general property damage provision in the policy. There is 
  no appeal from this decision. The judge, however, went on to dismiss the application 
  on the basis that the &#8220;intentional act&#8221; exception, set forth above, 
  was applicable. On this issue, he said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Intentionality</p>
<p class="indent">[8] Notwithstanding the requirement that exclusion clauses are 
  to be construed narrowly, I am satisfied that the cause alleged by the plaintiff 
  for its damages, is the intentional act of the applicant (defendant).</p>
<p class="indent">[9] I do not share the applicant&#8217;s view that either the 
  alleged truth of the impugned allegations, or the need to have their truth, 
  falsehood, or impact determined at trial, forecloses the duty of this Court 
  to find that the act was or was not intentional. On an application of this nature, 
  the entire enquiry to be conducted by this Court is on the pleadings alone. 
  See Longarini v. Zuliani (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 527 at 531 (C.A.).</p>
<p class="indent">[10] Even if ultimately it may be demonstrated that the impugned 
  allegations were true thereby exculpating the defendant, this Court is concerned 
  only about the allegations in the pleadings as they stand now.</p>
<p class="indent">[11] The applicant submits that he truthfully expressed, in 
  substance, the view that the plaintiff was unethical and its business not financially 
  viable. The plaintiff has alleged that those allegations were false and damaged 
  it. Clearly the allegations were intentional. The assertion of their truthfulness 
  is further cogent evidence of their intentional character. While it is not for 
  this Court to determine at this stage whether they were either true or damaging, 
  that, however, does not militate against a finding that the allegations were 
  intentional. Wilkinson v. Security National Insurance Co. [(1999), 249 A.R. 
  282 (Q.B.] and Blanchard v. Halifax Insurance Co. [(1996), 184 N.B.R. (2d) 271 
  Q.B.] are clearly distinguishable from this case, and I do not feel obliged 
  to follow them.</p>
<p>
  The Parties&#8217; Submissions</p>
<p>
  [12] The insured submits that the applications judge erred in failing to apply 
  the proper test for the &#8220;triggering&#8221; of the &#8220;intentional or 
  criminal act&#8221; exclusion clause in the policy. In this regard, the insured 
  submits, the insurer bears the burden of showing what is &#8220;essentially 
  a state of mind to commit a criminal offence&#8221;. In this regard he refers 
  to C. Brown et al Insurance Law in Canada, looseleaf, 4th ed, (Toronto: Carswell, 
  2002) at p. 18-178. The insured, referring to Brown at pp. 18-178 and 18-179, 
  stresses the distinction between an intention to act so as to cause injury and 
  an intention to commit an act that causes injury and submits that it is key 
  to whether the exclusion applies in any particular case.</p>
<p>
  [13] Having regard to the foregoing, the insured submits that the applications 
  judge erred in concluding that the exclusion clause applied simply on the basis 
  that the insured intended to publish the alleged defamatory statements without 
  going on to examine whether he intended to injure the plaintiffs. In this regard 
  he places particular reliance on the legal fact that defamation is not a tort 
  that requires an intent to injure but is, rather, a tort of strict liability.</p>
<p>
  [14] From this the insured submits that the cases concerned with the intentional 
  torts are inapplicable to this case. There was and could be no evidence whatsoever 
  before the court on the issue of the insured&#8217;s intention to defame and, 
  accordingly, there was no basis for finding that the allegations were intentional 
  in the sense required by law to invoke the exclusion clause.</p>
<p>
  [15] The insured also submitted, as apparently he did before the applications 
  judge, that if, as he pleaded, his statements were true or he believed them 
  to be true, he could not have intended to defame because the truth is not defamatory.</p>
<p>
  [16] In addition to this basic argument, the insured submits that the applications 
  judge misapprehended the cases of Wilkinson v. Security National Insurance Co. 
  (1999), 249 A.R. 282 (Q.B.) and Blanchard v. Halifax Insurance Co. (1996), 184 
  N.B.R. (2d) 271 (Q.B.) and thereby failed to apply the law properly to the facts 
  of this case.</p>
<p>
  [17] In response, the insurer submits that certain torts entail an intent to 
  injure so that the intent to commit the act brings &#8220;in its train the intent 
  to cause the harm&#8221;, citing G.H.L. Fridman, The Law of Torts in Canada, 
  2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2002) at p. 20, with the suggestion that this proposition 
  covers the present case. In this regard, the insurer submits that with defamation 
  the intent to injure is bound in the making of the alleged defamatory statement, 
  citing Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyds of London v. Scalera, supra, a decision 
  concerned with sexual assault and one to which I shall return on more than one 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [18] The statement of the test for determining when the duty to defend is engaged 
  is not in issue. I refer to Scalera at paras. 74 and 75 which quoted the following 
  from the reasons for the court given by McLachlin J. in Nichols v. American 
  Home Assurance Co., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801 at pp. 810-11 and 812: </p>
<p class="indent"> Thus far, I have proceeded only by reference to the actual 
  wording of the policy. However, general principles relating to the construction 
  of insurance contracts support the conclusion that the duty to defend arises 
  only where the pleadings raise claims which would be payable under the agreement 
  to indemnify in the insurance contract. Courts have frequently stated that &#8220;[t]he 
  pleadings govern the duty to defend&#8221;: Bacon v. McBride (1984), 6 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 96 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 9. Where it is clear from the pleadings that the 
  suit falls outside of the coverage of the policy by reason of an exclusion clause, 
  the duty to defend has been held not to arise: Opron Maritimes Construction 
  Ltd. v. Canadian Indemnity Co. (1986), 19 C.C.L.I. 168 (N.B.C.A.), leave to 
  appeal refused by this Court, [1987] 1 S.C.R. xi.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, it is not necessary to prove that the obligation 
  to indemnify will in fact arise in order to trigger the duty to defend. The 
  mere possibility that a claim within the policy may succeed suffices. In this 
  sense, as noted earlier, the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">Other Canadian authority overwhelmingly supports the view that 
  normally the duty to defend arises only with respect to claims which, if proven, 
  would fall within the scope of coverage provided by the policy&#8230; .</p>
<p class="indent">The same view generally prevails in the United States. &#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">[C]onsiderations relat[ing] to insurance law and practice, as 
  well as the authorities, overwhelmingly support the view that the duty to defend 
  should, unless the contract of insurance indicates otherwise, be confined to 
  the defence of claims which may be argued to fall under the policy. That said, 
  the widest latitude should be given to the allegations in the pleadings in determining 
  whether they raise a claim within the policy.</p>
<p>
  [19] From this it can be seen that the duty to defend arises only with respect 
  to claims which, if proven, would be covered by the policy. Is it possible that 
  a claim that is covered by the policy in this case may succeed? The answer to 
  this question turns on whether the claim is excluded from coverage by the &#8220;intentional 
  act&#8221; exclusion and the answer to this requires an examination of the allegations 
  in the pleadings and the issues to which they give rise.</p>
<p>
  [20] I deal first with the meaning of &#8220;bodily injury &#8230; caused by 
  any intentional&#8230; act.&#8221; The insured is right in his submission that 
  these words require more than an intentional act that, in fact, causes injury. 
  They require, on the part of the insured, the intent not only to do the act 
  but, also, in doing the act, the intent to injure. This was decided in Scalera 
  at para. 92 and is not in issue.</p>
<p>
  [21] The next question is: what does the intent to injure require in the context 
  of a defamation action? A defamatory statement is one that tends to lower a 
  person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally (Jowitt&#8217;s 
  Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1977) at p. 
  578). It is an injury to a person&#8217;s reputation. Accordingly, an intent 
  to lower a person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society would 
  be an intention to injure that person by injuring his or her reputation. </p>
<p>
  [22] Before moving on I shall return to the applications judge&#8217;s reasons. 
  He appears to have decided the case against the insured simply by reason of 
  his conclusion that &#8220;[c]learly the allegations were intentional&#8221;, 
  a statement that counsel for the insured does not dispute. On the face of his 
  reasons the judge does not appear to have examined the question of intention 
  to injure.</p>
<p>
  [23] I turn now to the strict liability aspect of defamation. Generally, the 
  tort does not require fault on the part of the defendant. &#8220;Reputation 
  is so stringently protected that liability for publishing defamatory statements 
  attaches without any showing of fault. Liability does not depend on the intention 
  of the defamer, but on the fact of defamation&#8221; (J.G. Fleming, The Law 
  of Torts, 9th ed. (Sydney: LBC Information Services, 1998) at pp. 595-96). Strict 
  liability is modified by the requirement that the publication itself must have 
  been intended or negligent (Fleming at p. 599).</p>
<p>
  [24] The strict liability feature of defamation is shown by the fact that a 
  defendant in a defamation action may not have intended either that his or her 
  statement to be defamatory or that he or she did not intend in the statement 
  to refer to the plaintiff at all. If the statement is in fact defamatory because 
  of extrinsic facts unknown to the defendant and it could reasonably be thought 
  to refer to the plaintiffs, the defendant will be liable (Fleming at pp. 596-97). 
  In each of these cases the defendant would be liable without having had any 
  intention to injure the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>
  [25] Before pursuing the issue of intention further, as it arises in the present 
  case, I shall deal with the insurer&#8217;s submission based on Scalera. In 
  Scalera, the defendant, who was insured under a homeowner&#8217;s policy, was 
  sued in an action claiming damages for sexual assaults. The policy in question 
  contained an exclusion provision that is the same as the one in the present 
  case. It excluded coverage for &#8220;bodily injury or property damage caused 
  by any intentional or criminal act&#8221; by the insured. The Supreme Court 
  of Canada held that the plaintiff&#8217;s claim could not trigger coverage under 
  the policy because it involved an intent to injure. In arriving at this conclusion, 
  the court held (paragraph 133 per Iacobucci J., concurred in by McLachlin J. 
  at para. 44) that &#8220;[o]ne who engages in objectively non-consensual sexual 
  activity will be presumed to have intended harm; whether or not he subjectively 
  intended harm will not change the injurious nature of his actions, and will 
  not deny an insurer its bargained-for exclusion of intentionally injurious activities.&#8221; 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] The insurer&#8217;s submission, as I understand it, is that, similarly, 
  in a defamation case, if a defendant is found liable &#8220;fault is legally 
  inferred&#8221;. With respect, having regard to the general strict liability 
  basis of the tort, fault cannot be an automatic inference. Further, in the context 
  of the present case, what must be inferred is not fault, which could include 
  negligence, but, rather intent. </p>
<p>
  [27] With all of the foregoing in mind, what would be necessarily involved in 
  a finding of liability against the insured in this case? Is there any possibility 
  that the insured could be found liable without this conclusion necessarily involving 
  the implicit finding that the insured intended to lower the plaintiffs&#8217; 
  reputations, i.e. to injure them?</p>
<p>
  [28] What light is cast on this question by the pleadings? Although I do not 
  consider it to be determinative, I note that the statement of claim (paragraphs 
  6 and 9) alleges that the insured acted &#8220;falsely and maliciously&#8221; 
  (emphasis added) in publishing his statement about the plaintiffs and that the 
  insured &#8220;had the intention of injuring the plaintiffs&#8217; economic 
  relations with shareholders and business partners&#8221; (paragraph 12). I say 
  these allegations are not determinative because, although they allege intentional 
  conduct on the part of the insured, liability in the defamation action is not 
  legally dependant on a finding of intent. The allegations do, however, clearly 
  state the plaintiffs&#8217; basic position respecting the insured&#8217;s motivation 
  and intention.</p>
<p>
  [29] I turn now to the statement of defence and the three defences which were 
  raised in response to the claim. The first defence is that the statements are 
  true. It would not follow from the fact that the insured thought that the statements 
  were true that he did not intend to lower the reputation of the plaintiffs. 
  It would mean that he intended to do this justifiably. Further, assuming that 
  the truth of the statements did, somehow, relate to the intent to injure issue, 
  if the action were dismissed because of this defence there would not be a claim 
  within the policy and, accordingly, there would be no duty to indemnify or to 
  defend. See Scalera, paras. 39, 44 and 138.</p>
<p>
  [30] Next, the insured pleads that his statements concerning the plaintiffs 
  are not defamatory. I appreciate that this is a question of fact to be decided 
  by the trier of fact at the end of a trial but, at this stage, I can fairly 
  express my opinion on whether they are capable of being defamatory. Clearly, 
  they are. If the insured were to be found liable, this would involve the finding 
  that the statements were defamatory. If the trial court were to dismiss the 
  action by reason of this defence, the claim would fall outside the policy and 
  there would no duty to defend or to indemnify. The same line of reasoning applies 
  with respect to the defence of fair comment. </p>
<p>
  [31] What is clear from the statement of defence is that it negates the possibility 
  that the publication was accidental &#8211; that is, not intended &#8211; and 
  that the insured did not have the plaintiffs in mind in making his statements. 
  Further, if the statements are found to be defamatory and the insured is held 
  liable, it would be totally unrealistic not to conclude that, in making the 
  statements, the insured did not intend to lower the plaintiffs&#8217; reputation. 
  His pleading that the statements were true is consistent only with the view 
  that they were made with the intention of warning others of the plaintiffs&#8217; 
  unethical behaviour and lack of financial viability. There is no room for concluding 
  that it was not an essential part of this intention that the plaintiffs&#8217; 
  reputation be lowered.</p>
<p>
  [32] The following statement in W.P. Keeton et al, Prosser and Keeton on The 
  Law of Torts, 5th ed. (St.. Paul: West, 1984) at p. 802, which describes &#8220;the 
  typical case of defamation&#8221;, is a preface to a consideration of other 
  defamation cases where &#8220;the defendant&#8217;s intent or state of mind 
  may differ significantly from that present in the typical case just assumed&#8221;: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the typical case of defamation, the publisher (1) realized that the statement 
  made was defamatory, (2) intended to refer to the plaintiff, and (3) intended 
  to communicate it to a third person or persons. Thus, the publisher clearly 
  acted with the intent to discredit another.</p>
<p>
  I think that the present case falls fairly within the class of the &#8220;typical 
  case&#8221;.</p>
<p>
  [33] I shall now consider the insured&#8217;s submission that because his statements 
  were true, or he believed them to be true, he could not have intended to defame 
  because the truth is not defamatory. The answer to this is that although the 
  falsity of the defendant&#8217;s statements is an element of the cause of action 
  for defamation, it is not an element of defamation itself. Defamation exists 
  once a statement has been published lowering the plaintiff&#8217;s reputation 
  whether it is true or not. There is a legal presumption of falsity after defamation 
  is established (P. Milmo &amp; W.V. H. Rogers, eds., Gatley on Libel and Slander, 
  9th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1998) at para. 1.5 and Elliott v. Friesen 
  (1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 409 (H.C.J.), aff&#8217;d 45 O.R. (2d) 285 (C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to S.C.C. refused May 3, 1984).</p>
<p>
  [34] I should deal with one more aspect of Scalera. In deciding whether there 
  was a claim that could fall within the coverage of the policy, Iacobucci J. 
  said in para. 93: &#8220;If the elements of a tort claim require proof of conduct 
  that also proves an intent to injure, there will be no duty to defend because 
  any potentially successful claim would fall under the exclusion clause&#8221;.</p>
<p>
  [35] Because it is not necessary to prove the defendant&#8217;s intent to injure 
  the plaintiffs in a defamation action, I accept that this proposition has no 
  direct application to the facts of the present case as disclosed in the pleadings. 
  However, I read the statement in Scalera as affording one example of a claim 
  that would fall under the exception clause, an example that was directly relevant 
  to the facts of that case, but not as indicating the only way in which a case 
  could fall within the exception. It is the wording of the exception provision 
  itself, &#8220;damage &#8230; caused by any intentional &#8230; act&#8221;, 
  that must be applied. This wording does not exclusively require an intentional 
  tort.</p>
<p>
  [36] It appears that the insured accepts this interpretation. In his factum, 
  he submits that &#8220;[t]he law requires that there be a finding of fact that 
  there was an intention to commit an act to injure, or that the tort is an intentional 
  tort, before the &#8216;intentional or criminal act&#8217; exclusion clause 
  is triggered&#8221;. This recognizes that it is not only with intentional torts 
  that the case may fall with the exception.</p>
<p>
  [37] As I said earlier, the insured submitted that the applications judge erred 
  in not applying two decisions cited to him, Wilkinson v. Security National Insurance 
  Co., supra and Blanchard v. Halifax Insurance Co., supra. It will be recalled 
  that the applications judge said that they were clearly &#8220;distinguishable&#8221;. 
  In light of my reasons set forth above, which are dispositive of the issue before 
  the court, and of the fact that this court is not bound by either of these decisions, 
  it is not necessary to deal with this submission. However, because the insured 
  appears to have advanced the submission as a separate ground of appeal, I shall, 
  briefly, consider it.</p>
<p>
  [38] In Blanchard, the insured made an application for an order that her liability 
  insurer had a duty to defend her in a defamation action. The court in paragraph 
  19 of the reasons observed that from the pleadings there was an argument that 
  the insured&#8217;s allegedly defamatory statements were made &#8220;accidentally 
  in the nature of &#8216;a slip of the tongue&#8217; or &#8216;a poor choice 
  of words&#8217;&#8221; and that, accordingly, the intentional acts exclusion 
  in the policy did not apply. This feature of the acts in Blanchard is sufficient 
  to distinguish it from the present case. I would also note that the court&#8217;s 
  reasons were, strictly, dicta because the application for an order to defend 
  was dismissed on the basis of the &#8220;business&#8221; exclusion in the policy.</p>
<p>
  [39] In Wilkinson, the court held that the liability insurer in a homeowner&#8217;s 
  policy was under the duty to defend its insured who was a defendant in a defamation 
  action. I do not think that I need go further than to note that following its 
  analysis of the allegations in the pleading, the court concluded in para. 36 
  that it was not clear &#8220;what basis, if any, will be used to impose liability&#8221; 
  and that assuming the insured &#8220;made the statements at all, his intention 
  will be a finding of fact for the trial judge&#8221;. The only comment that 
  I need make is that my analysis of the pleading in the present case does not 
  lead me to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [40] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed in the amount 
  of $4,450.00.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The plaintiffs in the action against 
  the insured also seek damages for intentional interference with economic relations. 
  The applications judge did not consider the applicability of the duty to defend 
  provision to the defence of this claim and it was not addressed on the argument 
  before us. Accordingly, I shall not consider it in these reasons.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> If the correct conclusion is that there 
  is a duty to defend, the appellant has raised other issues: whether the insurer 
  has the duty to defend the claim for punitive damages and whether, by reason 
  of a submitted conflict of interest on the part of the insurer, the insured 
  is entitled to representation by counsel of his own choice. The applications 
  judge did not deal with these questions and, in light of my disposition of the 
  basic question raised, neither shall I.</p>
