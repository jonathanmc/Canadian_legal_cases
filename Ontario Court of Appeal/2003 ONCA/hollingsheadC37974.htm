<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Paul Hermiston dated October 25, 2001 
  and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Paul Hermiston dated November 
  9, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="center">Released Orally March 27, 2003</p>    
<P>
  [1] In our view the charge was adequate to warn the jury that they could not 
  use evidence relating to one count in their evaluation of another count. This 
  encompasses counts each supported by the evidence of a different complainant.</p>    <P>
  [2] As to propensity, it would have been preferable for the trial judge to clearly 
  warn against reasoning on the basis that the appellant was the kind of person 
  who would have committed the offences charged. However, he did caution the jury 
  that they could not find that because the appellant did one thing he must have 
  done the other. In this case that was adequate, particularly given that there 
  were only two complainants and no evidence of non-criminal disreputable conduct. 
  </p>    <P>
  [3] Secondly, the trial judge adequately put the theory of the defence and did 
  not err in commenting on his view of whether the witnesses had colluded. The 
  jury would not have misunderstood because this issue could have been relevant 
  to them only for credibility purposes.</p>    <P>
  [4] As to the sentence, the Crown concedes that the appellant should get credit 
  for one month due to his post-conviction, pre-sentence time in custody. Apart 
  from that we would dismiss the sentence appeal. It was open to the trial judge 
  to find that all incidents alleged had been proven and to sentence on that basis. 
  The sentence imposed is not unfit. This was a case where the complainants were 
  either to be believed or not as to their evidence about all the incidents alleged. 
  In our view, the jury's verdict can only be taken as their finding that all 
  incidents were sufficiently established. </p>    <P>
  [5] The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is 
  granted and the global sentence is reduced by one month.</p>
