<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice S.E. Lang dated January 3, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>The Appeal</p>
<p>[1] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in holding that the parties 
  had not reached an enforceable agreement by the middle of October 1999. According 
  to the appellants, the parties had reached an agreement whereby the appellants 
  would become the new fur salon licensee for the respondent. </p>
<p>[2] We have the benefit of the trial judge&#146;s detailed and careful review 
  of the evidence. She also made clear findings of fact. The trial judge concluded 
  that while the parties were in serious negotiations, they had not reached agreement 
  on several terms which she held were essential to the existence of the agreement 
  alleged by the appellants. Among the terms which the trial judge held had not 
  been agreed upon was the term concerning the length of the licence. Counsel 
  for the appellants, quite correctly, conceded that the term of the proposed 
  licence was an essential term of any licence agreement. If there was no agreement 
  as to the term of the licence, there was no enforceable contract. Consequently, 
  if this aspect of the trial judge&#146;s judgment can withstand scrutiny on 
  appeal, the appeal must fail. </p>
<p>[3] After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge said:</p>
<p class="indent">The term of the contract was a matter of ongoing negotiations.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence supports the conclusion that 
  the parties had not agreed upon the length of time for which the appellants 
  would have the licence. In coming to that conclusion, the trial judge did not 
  consider irrelevant factors, did not materially misapprehend the evidence and 
  did not fail to consider relevant evidence. The evidence was far from all one 
  way. It was for the trial judge to sort through that evidence and reach the 
  necessary findings of fact. In doing so, she did not err. </p>
<p>The Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>[5] The cross-appellant (the Bay) contends that the trial judge erred in finding 
  that it misrepresented to the appellants its ability to terminate its existing 
  licence agreement. From the outset of the discussions, the Bay represented that 
  it could terminate the existing agreement on ninety days notice when, on the 
  facts as found by the trial judge, it knew or ought to have known that it could 
  not do so or, at a minimum, that there was a significant &#147;obstacle to termination 
  of the licence&#148;. The trial judge&#146;s finding as to the nature of the 
  representation made by the Bay and her finding that it was negligently made, 
  was amply supported by the evidence. </p>
<p>[6] The evidence leaves no doubt but that the appellants relied on the misrepresentation. 
  The Bay submits, however, that given the commercial context in which the negotiations 
  were taken place, it was not reasonable for the appellants to rely on the respondent&#146;s 
  representation. We cannot agree. The reasonableness of a party&#146;s reliance 
  in cases of negligent misrepresentation requires a fact-specific inquiry. Given 
  the history of these negotiations and the central importance to both parties 
  of the appellants&#146; ability to step into the role of licensee the following 
  February, it was reasonable for the appellants to take steps to be in a position 
  to take over the fur salon operation in reliance on the Bay&#146;s representation 
  as to its ability to terminate the ongoing lease. The steps the appellants took 
  as a result of that reliance were reasonable and were properly considered in 
  assessing the damages flowing from the negligent misrepresentation. The Bay&#146;s 
  heavy reliance on Martel Building Ltd. v. Canada, [2000] 3 S.C.R. 860 is misplaced. 
  Martel was not a case of negligent misrepresentation. Rather, it dealt with 
  the claim that principles applicable to economic loss flowing from negligent 
  misrepresentation should be applied to allegations of mere negligence in the 
  conduct of negotiations.</p>
<p>[7] The Bay also took issue with the damages awarded on the negligent misrepresentation 
  claim. The Bay conceded that the appellants had incurred damages, but argued 
  that they had failed to properly distinguish between losses arising out of the 
  negligent misrepresentation and losses which arose because of the appellants&#146; 
  assumption that they would obtain the licence agreement. While it is fair to 
  say that the appellants&#146; damage claim lacked specificity in some areas, 
  it was sufficient to establish that losses in the nature of professional fees 
  and employees&#146; salaries were incurred as a result of the negligent misrepresentation. 
  The trial judge did not pretend that the figures she arrived at represented 
  any kind of mathematical calculation. In our view, the figures she arrived at 
  reasonably reflected the fact that some, but by no means all, of the professional 
  fees and employees&#146; salaries paid by the appellants were attributable to 
  the respondent&#146;s negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The Costs Appeal</p>
<p>[8] The Bay also requested leave to appeal the judgment as to costs and asked 
  that it be varied to substitute a lesser amount for costs than the $250,749.65 
  awarded to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>[9] The Bay&#146;s factum limited its appeal respecting costs to one item, 
  an award of $115,000 for an experts&#146; report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 
  the plaintiffs&#146; accounting witness. The claim in the bill submitted by 
  the plaintiffs was for the full cost to them of $116,726 including GST. Accordingly, 
  the award constituted virtually full indemnity for this disbursement.</p>
<p>[10] The trial judge dealt with this item as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">The second main point of contention was the amount charged 
  by way of experts&#146; fees. In this case, the plaintiff submits accounts both 
  for PriceWaterhouseCoopers (the expert that produced reports and testified at 
  trial) and for Friedman &amp; Friedman (the plaintiff&#146;s accounting firm). 
  The onus is on the plaintiff to establish that, at the time, the disbursement 
  was a reasonable one reasonably necessary for the trial of the matter. If the 
  plaintiff submits an account that satisfies those requirements, I will allow 
  it unless there is some reason to persuade me to a contrary result.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">PriceWaterhouseCoopers produced two detailed reports 
  and testified at trial. Expert evidence on the claimed loss quantification was 
  a major issue at trial. This expert has produced accounts giving details of 
  the time spent on different matters. The accounts include time to prepare the 
  expert to give evidence and to prepare argument for counsel on the accounting 
  issues. While the defendant takes issue with this part of the report, it no 
  doubt contributed to trial efficiency to have the accountant brief counsel and 
  assist with damages submissions. Provided there is no duplication of effort, 
  I cannot take exception to the expert&#146;s account in that respect. The administrative 
  costs claimed in the accounts, however, are not detailed. I have no information 
  to determine whether they are reasonable. I have deducted a modest amount from 
  the accounts to reflect the lack of information. I allow the expert&#146;s account 
  at $115,000.00 inclusive of GST.</p>
<p>[11] The cross-appellant raised two complaints respecting this allowance: first, 
  that the onus was on the party awarded costs to justify them and second, what 
  might be called the partial indemnity factor. In the circumstances, we are not 
  prepared to interfere on the justification point.</p>
<p>[12] The partial indemnity argument is to the effect that, the award being 
  on a partial indemnity basis by agreement between the parties, the trial judge 
  erred in law in making an award constituting virtually full indemnity.</p>
<p>[13] It is suggested that authority for this proposition is to be found in 
  r. 57.01, in Tariff A, Part I (the &#147;new&#148; Costs Grid) and in Tariff 
  A, Part II Disbursements, items 26 and 28. These latter items deal with the 
  allowing of &#147;reasonable amounts&#148; for expert&#146;s reports and expert 
  testimony &#147;reasonably necessary for the conduct of a proceeding&#148;. 
  It was conceded that no reliance was being placed on any recent change in the 
  rules or Tariff and that the argument now being made could equally have been 
  made prior to the coming into force of the relatively recent amendments respecting 
  &#147;partial indemnity&#148; and &#147;substantial indemnity&#148;.</p>
<p>[14] Reliance was placed on the decision of Nordheimer J. in Pearson v. Inco 
  Ltd., [2002] O.J. No. 3532. This decision dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s motion 
  to certify a class action. Having decided to award costs to the defendants, 
  apparently on a partial indemnity basis, the motion judge then dealt with a 
  claim by Inco for &#147;$154,722.50 in fees, $103,070.36 for expert&#146;s fees 
  and $6,013.34 in disbursements&#148;. After dealing with legal fees, the motion 
  judge continued:</p>
<p class="indent">In addition there are disbursements to be considered. 
  I do not intend to go through the disbursements line by line. The disbursements 
  sought, outside of the witness fees, are appropriate disbursement items and 
  the amounts appear to be reasonable. I would allow them at $6,000. The other 
  issue is the amount of approximately $100,000 paid to witnesses. I consider 
  that the approach to the recovery of fees paid to expert witnesses ought to 
  be exactly the same as the approach to the fees to be recovered by counsel. 
  The court should consider what is fair in terms of hours and rates as well as 
  the overall amount and should then fix an amount which it is reasonable for 
  the losing party to pay. In so doing, the court is not bound by what the client 
  may have actually had to pay the expert. Further, if a witness, lay or expert, 
  had to travel to be cross-examined, then the losing party is required to pay 
  the reasonable travel expenses of the witness. However, the losing party is 
  not required to pay for travel time nor for travelling expenses that are not 
  reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">In considering the fees for witnesses, I would observe 
  that some of the amounts sought are out of proportion to the contribution which 
  the experts made to the proceeding. For example, more than $25,000 is sought 
  for the work of Clayton Research. That amount includes time for eight different 
  people at rates up to $285 per hour. Such fees are beyond what the unsuccessful 
  party should have to pay on a partial indemnity basis. Similarly, the fees charged 
  by Mr. Becking, insofar as his expenditure of time is revealed, include travel 
  time and hotel expenses which it is not clear was necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">In the result, I would allow those disbursements as 
  follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Ron Pearson $3,500</p>
<p class="indent">Frank Clayton (and those assisting him) $10,000</p>
<p class="indent">Brian Watts $5,000</p>
<p class="indent">George Becking $20,000</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I must consider whether the resulting amounts 
  of $72,000 for fees plus disbursements of $6,000 and witness fees of $38,500 
  are reasonable amounts to fix for costs of this four day certification motion. 
  I do not believe that they are. The total of these amounts is, no doubt, much 
  more than this representative plaintiff would have expected to have to pay by 
  way of costs. Having said that, however, and as I said in Gariepy, it seems 
  to me that a representative plaintiff who institutes a proposed class proceeding 
  of this scope must, or should, realize that the costs associated with doing 
  so are going to be substantial. This same representative plaintiff would no 
  doubt have expected to recover a significant amount by way of costs if he had 
  been successful and there is no sound basis for the costs to differ greatly 
  just because the certification motion was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end result, balancing the actual work done against 
  the existing range of costs awards on other certification motions, I fix the 
  costs of Inco at $45,000 for fees and $40,000 for disbursements (including the 
  witness fees) for a total of $85,000. (emphasis added)</p>
<p>[15] Counsel for the cross-appellant in the instant case relies upon the italicized 
  sentences as authority for the proposition that where an award is being assessed 
  on a partial indemnity basis, even where it is determined that a witness is 
  reasonably necessary and his or her expert&#146;s fees are reasonably calculated 
  at say $10,000, some further deduction is appropriate to reflect the fact that 
  the award is intended to be only partial indemnification.</p>
<p>[16] We agree that the sentences relied upon can be construed as supporting 
  that proposition. Nordheimer J. himself, however, does not appear to have applied 
  that interpretation in that same case. His award was on a partial indemnity 
  basis. The claim for disbursements was $6,013.34 and he allowed $6,000 or substantial 
  indemnity.</p>
<p>[17] No other authority was cited for the principle in issue and the collective 
  experience of this panel of this court is to the contrary. To be explicit, it 
  is our experience that both under the party-and-party costs regime and the newer 
  partial indemnity regime, disbursements, including witness fees, are assessed 
  upon the basis of what was actually spent, reduced if appropriate to what is 
  reasonably spent. The resulting figure is not then further reduced by reason 
  of the fact that the indemnification is on a party-and-party or partial indemnity 
  basis as opposed to a solicitor-and-client or substantial indemnity basis. To 
  take an example, a witness&#146;s travel expense of $1,000 to travel first class/business 
  class by Air Canada from Ottawa to Toronto would, if the witness&#146;s attendance 
  from Ottawa by air was found reasonably necessary, be reduced to an economy 
  fare of $750 on the basis of &#147;reasonableness&#148; but would not be further 
  reduced by reason of the fact that the award was on a partial indemnity basis.</p>
<p>[18] In this regard, we question the distinction drawn by Nordheimer J. between 
  disbursements on the one hand and witness fees on the other. Both are found 
  in Part II of Tariff A under the heading &#147;Disbursements&#148;. In our experience, 
  witness fees, whether to expert or lay witnesses, are simply one class of disbursement. 
  Accordingly, we question the proposition that &#147;the approach to the recovery 
  of fees paid to expert witnesses ought to be exactly the same as the approach 
  to the fees recovered by counsel&#148;. Unless some custom has grown up, perhaps 
  in the context of class proceedings, upon which this statement is based and 
  which has not been drawn to our attention, we disagree with it. Legal fees which 
  are paid to lawyers for their own use are determined according to the principles 
  set out in rules 57 and 58 and Tariff A., Part I. Disbursements are assessed 
  according to Tariff A, Part II, items 26 and 28 of which deal specifically with 
  the reports and testimony of experts. Each of items 26 and 28 is expressly limited 
  to &#147;a reasonable amount&#148;. </p>
<p>[19] Part I, dealing with the fees of lawyers, clerks and students is expressly 
  divided into two scales &#150; partial indemnity and substantial indemnity. 
  No item in either scale is a flat figure; every item is &#147;up to&#148; so 
  many dollars per hour. Thus the potential fee of any lawyer of any experience, 
  can, accepting the number of hours engaged, be calculated to the penny either 
  on a partial indemnity basis or on a substantial indemnity basis. Those fees 
  so calculated can also be varied exercising the &#147;up to&#148; aspect of 
  the scale. In these ways, an assessment officer or judge can make adjustments 
  for efficiency, inefficiency, experience and a host of other factors, including 
  the partial or substantial nature of the award. </p>
<p>[20] Disbursements, including expert&#146;s fees, are dealt with under Part 
  II of Tariff A. Some of the items allow the amount &#147;actually paid&#148;. 
  Item 27 for instance reads simply:</p>
<p class="indent">The cost of the investigation and report of the Official 
  Guardian.</p>
<p>Other items allow simply &#147;a reasonable amount&#148;. There is no provision 
  for any alteration in the actual cost in the event of an award on a partial 
  indemnity basis. Nor is there any provision for the reduction of any item in 
  Part II beyond the requirements of &#147;reasonably necessary&#148; and &#147;reasonable 
  amount&#148;.</p>
<p>[21] Accordingly, in our view, the fees for the reports and testimony of experts 
  are to be dealt with as disbursements under Part II of Tariff A and recovery 
  of such fees is not to be treated in the same fashion as counsel fees. We agree 
  with the manner in which Lang J. dealt with the PriceWaterhouseCoopers account 
  in the instant case. We see no basis for the further reduction of that account 
  upon the basis that the award of costs under which it was assessed was for partial 
  indemnity only.</p>
<p>[22] A further objection was raised to the effect that some of the hourly rates 
  in the PriceWaterhouseCoopers account were as high as or higher than those in 
  the Costs Grid in Part I of Tariff A. This argument is not mentioned expressly 
  in the reasons of the trial judge. Whether or not raised below, she has dealt 
  with it implicitly by finding the total amounts reasonable. We find no error 
  in that conclusion. </p>
<p>[23] Leave to appeal costs is granted but that appeal is dismissed.</p>
