<h1>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h1>
<p>RE: KELVIN J. HUGHES (Respondent) - and - WATERLOO REGION DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD 
  (Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE: AUSTIN, CHARRON and CRONK, JJ. A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL: Stephen F. Gleave for the appellant, Kelvin J. Hughes In Person<br>
</p>
<p>HEARD: October 30, 2002</p>
<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice P.B. Hambly, sitting as a single judge 
  of the Divisional Court, dated January 25, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ADDENDUM ON COSTS</p>
<p>[1] This appeal was heard on October 30, 2002 and dismissed with costs payable 
  by the appellant to Mr. Hughes. The determination of the amount of those costs 
  was reserved pending receipt of submissions from the parties. Those submissions 
  have now been received.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Mr. Hughes has submitted a bill of costs totalling $7351. The appellant 
  argues that he is not entitled to recover any amount in excess of $1100. We 
  agree that the claim must be reduced. In the first place, the award is limited 
  to costs in this court, not in the courts below. In addition, there is no basis 
  for an award of costs on a substantial indemnity basis. Mr. Hughes is entitled 
  to costs on a partial indemnity basis. Nor is there any provision in the Tariff 
  for disbursements for medications such as Larezapam, amongst other matters.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Having regard to the limitations of the Tariff, it is our view that the 
  costs should be fixed at $3500 including fees, disbursements and G.S.T. and 
  we so order.
