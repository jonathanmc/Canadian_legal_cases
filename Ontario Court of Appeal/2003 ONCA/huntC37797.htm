<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Peter B. Hambly, of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated January 17, 2002, August 27, 2002 and September 4, 2002, reported 
  at [2002] O.J. No. 474, unreported, and [2002] O.J. No. 3508.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] TD Securities Inc. c.o.b. as TD Evergreen (&quot;TDE&quot;), TD Financial 
  Services and Mark Schram appeal from the January 17, 2002 judgment of Hambly 
  J. in which TD Securities Inc. is ordered to pay the respondents, Melville Hunt 
  and Marion Hunt, the sum of $59,319.00 plus interest and costs. The judgment 
  flowed from a determination, at trial, that a fiduciary relationship existed 
  between Schram (an investment advisor and employee of TDE) and the Hunts, and 
  the finding that Schram breached his fiduciary obligation through the unauthorized 
  sale of BCE shares owned by the Hunts. TD Securities Inc. was held vicariously 
  liable for Schram's conduct. Costs on a solicitor and client scale were awarded 
  against the appellants; they seek leave to appeal the costs award, as well.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Hunts cross-appeal, asking that the damage award be increased to reflect 
  loss of opportunity to sell the BCE shares as market prices increased.</p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that a fiduciary relationship 
  did not exist between the parties. I would allow the appeal on the merits, grant 
  leave to appeal the costs award and allow it, and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants carry on business as investment advisors and counsellors. 
  They buy and sell securities on behalf of their customers. </p>
<p>
  [5] In November 1996, the Hunts transferred their mutual fund holdings from 
  TD Asset Management Inc. to TDE. Their funds were held in a non-discretionary 
  cash account with TDE, under the terms of which TDE could make only those transactions 
  that had been authorized by the Hunts. Mark Schram was their investment advisor.</p>
<p>
  [6] The Hunts owned BCE shares for a lengthy period of time before November 
  1996. On March 3, 1997, the appellants sold some of the Hunts' BCE shares. The 
  Hunts claim that they never authorized the sale transaction. Schram contends 
  otherwise. The Hunts became aware of the sale within ten days of March 6, 1997, 
  which was the date the transaction was completed. They did not transfer the 
  shares to the appellants until March 7, 1997. In the weeks that followed the 
  sale of the BCE shares, they instructed Schram to purchase other securities 
  with the proceeds of sale, which he did. They continued to deal with the appellants 
  for a lengthy period after the sale of the BCE shares. </p>
<p>
  [7] The price of BCE shares rose and the Hunts commenced an action in July 1998, 
  against the appellants, for the loss in value of the BCE shares. Schram wrote 
  to the Hunts in December of 1998, suggesting that they transfer their account 
  to the investment counsellor of their choice. They transferred their account 
  from TDE to RBC Dominion Securities in December of 1999. </p>
<p>
  [8] At trial, the sale of the BCE shares on March 3, 1997 was found to be unauthorized. 
  The relationship between Schram and the respondents was held to be a fiduciary 
  one and the unauthorized sale of the shares was found to be a breach of the 
  appellants' fiduciary obligations. The Hunts were found to have not ratified 
  the sale of their BCE shares.</p>
<p>
  [9] Damages were held to crystallize as at July 8, 1998. They were assessed 
  as the difference between the value of BCE shares at July 8, 1998 and the value 
  of the replacement shares as at that date, with appropriate adjustments. Melville 
  Hunt's damages were assessed at $41,181.00. Marion Hunt's damages were assessed 
  at $18,138.00.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [10] In November 1996, Melville was seventy-five years of age. He was married 
  to Marion Hunt, then aged seventy-two. He had been employed by Savage Shoes 
  Limited for his entire working life. He had held various positions with the 
  company, including General Sales Manager for all Canadian divisions and Senior 
  Vice President. He served as a member of the Board of Directors. Melville Hunt 
  had been in charge of all of the family's financial investments throughout the 
  marriage. </p>
<p>
  [11] In the fall of 1996, Melville Hunt held mutual funds at TD Asset Management 
  Inc. He decided to purchase Toronto Dominion shares and was referred to Schram 
  at TDE. Melville Hunt met with Schram on November 4 and 8, 1996 to discuss his 
  holdings, strategy, goals and procedures. He was looking for guidance as to 
  how to improve the performance of his overall portfolio as well as the ability 
  to purchase securities. He told Schram that he and his wife held BCE shares 
  and that a $10,000 note had been redeemed from the sale of mutual funds at TD 
  Greenline and deposited by Melville Hunt into his bank account.</p>
<p>
  [12] After the two meetings, Melville Hunt decided to move his entire TD Asset 
  Management Inc. portfolio to TDE.</p>
<p>
  [13] On November 13, 1996, the Hunts met with Schram to complete forms to transfer 
  the investment account to TDE. New account application forms were completed. 
  The information about Melville Hunt was completed by Schram based on answers 
  given to questions that he asked and on the information that had been relayed 
  by Melville Hunt in the previous meetings about his investment experience, income, 
  risk tolerance and investment goals. A new account application form was completed 
  for Marion Hunt as well.</p>
<p>
  [14] The new account form described Melville Hunt as a person of average investment 
  knowledge. Melville Hunt agreed with that assessment. He received and retained 
  a copy of the application form.</p>
<p>
  [15] By November 28, 1996, the transfer of the Hunts assets from TD Asset Management 
  Inc. to TDE was complete. A non-discretionary cash account was set up. Under 
  its terms, Schram could trade in securities on behalf of the Hunts only with 
  their authorization.</p>
<p>
  [16] Also by November 28, 1996, Guardian mutual funds had been purchased for 
  Melville Hunt for the sum of $10,000. Melville Hunt met with Schram on November 
  29, 1996, to review his investment printout. Although he complained at the meeting 
  that he had not authorized the purchase of the Guardian funds, he instructed 
  Schram to sell TD Asset mutual funds and buy other investments, including a 
  further purchase of Guardian mutual funds in the amount of $40,000. The trial 
  judge found that Guardian was a good investment and that if Melville Hunt did 
  not initially approve of the Guardian purchase, he accepted it. </p>
<p>
  [17] As of March 3, 1997, Melville Hunt owned 1,472 shares of BCE stock and 
  Marion owned 923 shares of BCE stock. All the shares were either in their safety 
  deposit box at Canada Trust, or registered with Montreal Trust. None had been 
  physically delivered to TDE.</p>
<p>
  [18] On March 3, 1997, Schram sold 972 BCE shares of Melville Hunt and 377 BCE 
  shares of Marion Hunt. It was Schram's evidence that Melville Hunt telephoned 
  him on March 3, 1997, and instructed him to sell sufficient BCE shares so that 
  each of the Hunts would be left with 500 shares. He testified that the sale 
  was in accordance with the overall investment strategy that he had previously 
  discussed with Melville Hunt. Melville Hunt denied ever giving authority to 
  sell the shares. He said that the BCE shares were his &quot;nest egg&quot; and 
  to be kept for emergencies and the Hunts' retirement.</p>
<p>
  [19] The experts agreed that it was common practice, and the standard in the 
  investment industry, to buy and sell shares on verbal instructions, including 
  over the telephone.</p>
<p>
  [20] Schram testified that he had known before March 3, 1997, that the Hunts 
  owned BCE stock and had a rough idea that it comprised approximately 50% of 
  their total investments. There were numerous conversations between Melville 
  Hunt and Schram between November of 1996 and March 3, 1997 about the BCE shares. 
  Schram understood that Melville Hunt wished to sell some of the BCE shares. 
  He believed that such a course of action would be a good idea as he felt that 
  the BCE shares made up an overly large portion of the Hunts' portfolio. The 
  Hunts' expert agreed that there were too many BCE shares and that he would have 
  recommended that the Hunts sell some of them. </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge found that, apart from a $600.00 commission to Schram, 
  the appellants did not profit from the sale of the BCE shares. </p>
<p>
  [22] The Hunts were instructed by Schram's assistant to take their BCE shares 
  out of the safety deposit box and deposit them with Schram. They did so believing 
  that this made the BCE shares available for possible sale at a later date. </p>
<p>
  [23] The Hunts received the usual transaction slips confirming the sale of the 
  BCE shares within ten days of the completion of the transaction. Upon their 
  receipt, Melville Hunt called Schram and demanded to know &quot;What the hell 
  is going on?&quot; Schram allegedly responded, &quot;What is done, is done&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [24] By March 16, 1997, at the latest, the Hunts knew that the BCE shares had 
  been sold, and the proceeds were available for re-investment. On March 7, 1997, 
  Melville Hunt instructed Schram to purchase Chrysler Securities. The only funds 
  available to purchase these shares were proceeds from the BCE shares. The Hunts 
  did not authorize Schram to sell any other shares in order to raise funds for 
  the purchase of the Chrysler Securities. Less than a month later, Melville Hunt 
  instructed Schram to buy shares in CIBC, again using proceeds from the sale 
  of the BCE shares. This latter transaction was completed on April 2, 1997. The 
  investments made with the proceeds of sale were found to be good investments.</p>
<p>
  [25] In January of 1998, TDE sent out a questionnaire survey to its customers. 
  The Hunts completed it and returned it on February 3, 1998 with a letter to 
  Mr. Carney, the president of TDE Investment Services. In the letter, Melville 
  Hunt states that the sale of the BCE shares had caused him and his wife anguish 
  and that until receiving the survey he had not known to whom to turn. Melville 
  Hunt answered question 44 of the survey, listing a series of complaints including 
  that the BCE shares had been sold without specific instructions. Marion Hunt 
  answered question 44 of the survey by referring to the sale and complaining 
  that it took place before the shares were transferred, and just before a dividend 
  was declared. She also complained that her account had been improperly debited, 
  and asked that the matter be looked into and corrected. Many of the Hunts' survey 
  responses contained positive comments about Schram and TDE. The quality of service 
  was rated as consistently high. Schram's service record was rated as satisfactory. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] The trial judge found that TDE's investigation into the complaint was inadequate. 
  He noted that Schram did not report the matter of Melville Hunt's complaint 
  to him to the compliance department. He found that the responses sent to the 
  Hunts did not address all of their concerns. He found, also, that the responses 
  were based solely on Schram's version of events as no one interviewed the Hunts. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] The Hunts account with TDE was dormant after January 9, 1998.</p>
<p>
  [28] After receiving a letter from Mr. Strickland, Senior Vice President, dated 
  March 9, 1998, Melville Hunt drafted a handwritten letter in which he spoke 
  of the &quot;blind faith&quot; that he and his wife had in TDE and Schram. This 
  handwritten letter was not sent. The Hunts' son, Roger, was a lawyer. When he 
  learned of his parents' upset over the sale of the BCE shares, he used the draft 
  letter as the basis for his own letter, dated March 16, 1998, to Mr. Strickland 
  in which he set out the Hunts' complaints and demanded &quot;that which has 
  been done must be undone&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [29] Schram wrote the Hunts in December of 1998, suggesting that they transfer 
  their account to the investment counsel of their choice. The Hunts transferred 
  their investments from TDE to RBC Dominion Securities in December of 1999.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>
<p>
  [30] Four issues arise on this appeal.</p>
<p>
  1. Was there a fiduciary relationship between Schram and the Hunts?</p>
<p>
  2. Did the Hunts ratify the sale of the BCE shares?</p>
<p>
  3. What damages are the Hunts entitled to? In considering this issue, it must 
  be determined whether the Hunts had a duty to mitigate. </p>
<p>
  4. Ought the costs award below be set aside?</p>
<p>
  [31] The standard of review of a judge's factual findings and inferences drawn 
  from the facts is palpable and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 
  SCC 33, 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577. Questions of mixed fact and law involving the 
  application of a legal standard to a set of facts are generally also subject 
  to a standard of palpable and overriding error. If, however, it is clear that 
  the trial judge made some extricable error in principle with respect to the 
  characterization of the standard or its application, the error may amount to 
  an error of law, and a standard of correctness will apply.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #1: Nature of the Relationship</p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge found that Schram stood in a fiduciary capacity to the 
  Hunts because, at para. 98: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mark Schram had power that he could, if he chose, exercise unilaterally over 
  all the life savings of Mel Hunt and Marion Hunt. Mel Hunt and Marion Hunt placed 
  their trust in Mark Schram. They gave him their loyalty, even after they believed 
  that he had acted contrary to their instructions. Mel Hunt placed complete reliance 
  in the judgment of Mark Schram. In my view on the tests set out in Frame v. 
  Smith (supra) and Varcoe v. Stirling (supra) set out above, Mark Schram was 
  a fiduciary in his relationship with Mel and Marion Hunt.</p>
<p>
  [33] The appellants say that no fiduciary relationship existed between Schram 
  and the Hunts. Their contention rests primarily upon the fact that the Hunts 
  had a non-discretionary account with the appellants. Because the account was 
  non-discretionary, Schram did not have the authority or power to act on his 
  own accord in respect of the Hunts funds. In addition, the appellants contend 
  that Melville Hunt is not unsophisticated, that he did not place complete trust 
  and reliance in Schram, and that he was not vulnerable.</p>
<p>
  [34] The respondents point to the trial judge's findings in respect of vulnerability, 
  reliance, trust and power which underpin his finding of a fiduciary duty and 
  argue that there is no basis for interference with that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [35] For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the trial judge made 
  a palpable and overriding error in concluding that Schram stood in a fiduciary 
  relationship with the Hunts. This clear error arose when he found that Schram 
  had the discretion or power to unilaterally affect the Hunts' interests. While 
  Schram was in a position to be able to conduct an unauthorized sale of shares, 
  this ability did not characterize the relationship between the parties -- Schram 
  was not authorized to act unilaterally and, with the sole exception of the unauthorized 
  sale of the BCE shares, did not do so. Moreover, in making findings of vulnerability, 
  trust and reliance, the trial judge appears to have misapplied the relevant 
  legal principles. </p>
<p>
  [36] As this court affirmed in Cheseborough v. Willson [2002] O.J. No. 4299 
  (C.A.), at para. 2, &quot;the relationship of broker and client is not, in and 
  of itself, a fiduciary relationship but one that is dependant on the particular 
  facts. The relevant factors that must be considered in determining this question 
  are set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 
  S.C.R. 377.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [37] The Supreme Court of Canada dealt exhaustively with the matter of fiduciary 
  relationships in the case of financial advisors in Hodgkinson. In Hodgkinson, 
  a stockbroker with little experience in tax planning, hired an accountant to 
  advise him regarding his tax planning needs, particularly with respect to real 
  estate investments. The stockbroker relied heavily on the accountant's advice. 
  He bought four income tax sheltered properties, on the accountant's advice, 
  and lost heavily during a decline in the real estate market. It was later revealed 
  that the accountant had an interest in the properties that he had failed to 
  disclose. The stockbroker alleged breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract 
  against the accountant. </p>
<p>
  [38] The Court held that, in view of the professional relationship between the 
  parties that was based on trust, confidence and independence, and the plaintiff's 
  reliance on the defendant's advice, there was a fiduciary relationship and the 
  defendant was liable for breach of that duty.</p>
<p>
  [39] In Hodgkinson, La Forest J. adopts Wilson J.'s three-step analysis in Frame 
  v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, as &quot;rough and ready&quot; guidelines, or 
  indicia, that help courts determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists. 
  La Forest J. summarizes Wilson J.'s analysis, at para 30, as: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) scope for the exercise of some discretion or power; (2) that power or discretion 
  can be exercised unilaterally so as to effect the beneficiary's legal or practical 
  interests; and, (3) a peculiar vulnerability to the exercise. </p>
<p>[40] La Forest J. expands considerably on this analysis. His comprehensive 
  judgment in Hodgkinson can be summarized as identifying five interrelated factors 
  to be considered when determining whether financial advisors stand in a fiduciary 
  relationship to their clients: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Vulnerability - the degree of vulnerability of the client 
  that exists due to such things as age or lack of language skills, investment 
  knowledge, education or experience in the stock market.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Trust - the degree of trust and confidence that a client 
  reposes in the advisor and the extent to which the advisor accepts that trust. 
</p>
<p class="indent">3. Reliance - whether there is a long history of relying on 
  the advisor's judgment and advice and whether the advisor holds him or herself 
  out as having special skills and knowledge upon which the client can rely.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Discretion - the extent to which the advisor has power or 
  discretion over the client's account.</p>
<p class="indent">5 Professional Rules or Codes of Conduct - help to establish 
  the duties of the advisor and the standards to which the advisor will be held.</p>
<p>
  [41] It should be noted that the description of these five factors is not intended 
  to be exhaustive and that the evidence relevant to one factor may be relevant 
  also to a consideration of one or more of the other factors.</p>
<p>
  [42] In applying these factors, the words of Forsyth J. in a recent Alberta 
  Queen's Bench decision provide a helpful framework: </p>
<p class="indent"> [O]ne should consider the broker-client relationship to be 
  a spectrum. At one end is a relationship of full trust and advice. The broker 
  effectively makes all the decisions because of the great reliance and trust 
  reposed in him or her by the client&#133;. This is exacerbated where the account 
  is discretionary, such that the broker has the authority to make trades without 
  the client's consent or even knowledge &#133; Obviously, there is a fiduciary 
  relationship at this end of the spectrum&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">At the other end is a relationship where the broker is merely 
  an &quot;order-taker&quot; for the client, the client does not rely on any advice 
  from the broker, and the broker had no discretion. This was the case in Varcoe 
  itself. Relationships at this end of the spectrum lack the elements of a fiduciary 
  relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Most cases fall somewhere in the middle&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(Kent v. May (2001), 298 A.R. 71 at paras. 51-53, affd (2002), 
  317 A.R. 381 (C.A.))</p>
<p>Vulnerability</p>
<p>
  [43] The trial judge noted the Hunts' ages and Melville Hunt's poor health. 
  Implicitly, he found that the Hunts were vulnerable. However, there were other 
  findings which suggest that they were not vulnerable. For example, in the last 
  period of Melville Hunt's career with Savage Shoes, he was Senior Vice-president, 
  General Manager Sales for all of Canada and sat on its Board of Directors. In 
  Dyck v. Roulston, (1997), 36 B.C.L.R. (3d) 126, the British Columbia Court of 
  Appeal found no fiduciary duty to exist where a client was intelligent, operated 
  a successful business and made his choices freely. See also Varcoe v. Stirling 
  (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 204 (Gen. Div.), aff'd (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 574 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [44] Also, the trial judge found that Melville Hunt bought and sold shares over 
  the course of his adult lifetime, regularly monitored his accounts, and made 
  his own decisions about investments. It was Melville Hunt who decided to purchase 
  the Toronto-Dominion Bank stocks. It was also Melville Hunt's idea to purchase 
  the Chrysler shares, a purchase which he testified Schram was opposed to. </p>
<p>
  [45] In Zraik v. Levesque Securities, [2001] O.J. No. 5803 (C.A.) at para. 24, 
  an experienced entrepreneur with no prior experience in the futures market was 
  nonetheless a sophisticated commodities trader. The trial judge found that he 
  independently analysed commodities, including foreign currencies and precious 
  metals, and traded to such an extent that he recorded his gains and losses as 
  business income. This court upheld the trial judge's finding that there was 
  no fiduciary relationship saying, at para. 26: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The trial judge's findings destroy any basis for applying the criteria above 
  to establish a fiduciary relationship in whole or in part. There was no relationship 
  of dependency or vulnerability. Zraik monitored his own account closely and 
  gave instructions for every trade. He sought advice, but as we have seen he 
  did not always follow it.</p>
<p>
  [46] Further, this court in Zraik specifically warned, at para. 27, that &quot;[t]he 
  consequences of contractual negligence cannot change the contractual relationship 
  into an equitable one.&quot; In other words, one cannot reason backwards from 
  the fact that an individual is harmed by the unauthorized acts of their broker, 
  to the conclusion that they are vulnerable. Rather, the individuals and the 
  nature of the relationship must be examined. </p>
<p>
  [47] While Melville Hunt did not have the same degree of sophistication as the 
  appellant in Zraik, his investments were of a much simpler nature. The evidence 
  establishes that he retained control over his investments, sought Schram's advice 
  but made his own decisions.</p>
<p>
  [48] Finally, while the Hunts are elderly, and Melville Hunt was in frail health, 
  the evidence does not support the finding that these factors led to vulnerability 
  in the relevant sense. Upon discovering the unauthorized transactions, Melville 
  Hunt phoned and demanded to know &quot;what the hell's going on&quot;. Unsatisfied 
  with Schram's response, he went to see Schram &quot;with guns blazing&quot;.</p>
<p>
  Trust</p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge found that the Hunts placed their trust in Schram. However, 
  this finding cannot be supported in light of the fact that the Hunts opened 
  a non-discretionary account and, most importantly, operated it as such. </p>
<p>
  [50] In Hodgkinson, at pp. 409-10, La Forest J. said: </p>
<p class="indent"> [O]utside the established categories [of fiduciary relationship], 
  what is required is evidence of a mutual understanding that that one party has 
  relinquished its own self-interest and agreed to act solely on behalf of the 
  other party. This idea was well-stated in the American case of Dolton v. Capital 
  Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 642 P.2d21 (Col. App. 1982), at pp. 23-24, in 
  the banker-customer context, to be a state of affairs</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;which impels or induces one party &quot;to relax the care 
  and vigilance it would and should have ordinarily exercised in dealing with 
  a stranger.&quot; &#133; [and] &#133;has be found to exists where there is a 
  repose of trust by the customer along with an acceptance or invitation of such 
  trust on the part of the lending institution.</p>
<p class="indent">In relation to the advisory context,&#133;, there must be something 
  more than a simple undertaking by one party to provide information and execute 
  orders for the other for a relationship to be enforced as fiduciary. For example, 
  most everyday transactions between a bank customer and banker are conducted 
  on a creditor-debtor basis&#133;.Similarly, the relationship of an investor 
  to his or her discount broker will not likely give rise to a fiduciary duty, 
  where the broker is simply a conduit of information and an order taker&#133;[emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [51] A non-discretionary account reflects the conscious decision of the parties 
  to leave power and discretion in the hands of the investor. By its express terms, 
  Schram could not act without the Hunts' instructions. By choosing a non-discretionary 
  account, the Hunts expressly retained control over their investments.</p>
<p>
  [52] Schram had the means to act without instructions. But, apart from the single 
  unauthorized sale of BCE shares, he did not do so.</p>
<p>
  [53] In considering all five factors, a substance over form approach is to be 
  adopted. Thus, in respect of the question of trust, the simple fact that the 
  account was non-discretionary account is not dispositive of the matter. Had 
  there been a pattern of Schram acting without instruction despite the account 
  being designated non-discretionary, it is possible that a fiduciary relationship 
  could have been found. That is not the case, however. </p>
<p>
  [54] Trust is also a function of the length of the relationship. In Zivadinovich 
  v. Mehta, [1999] O.J. No. 338 (C.A.), for example, this court found, at para. 
  4, that an accountant was in a fiduciary relationship with a close friend, because 
  of the length of time over which he had provided the friend with financial advice. 
  Over a period of years, a relationship of absolute trust had developed, and 
  this consideration overshadowed the fact that there was no formal retainer between 
  the parties. </p>
<p>
  [55] In contrast, Melville Hunt met with Schram only twice before opening the 
  account and, while there was a longstanding relationship between the Hunts and 
  TD Bank, the Hunts relationship with TDE and Schram was just over three months 
  in duration at the time of the unauthorized sale.</p>
<p>
  [56] The degree of trust that Schram accepted was limited. The trial judge quotes 
  from a letter sent by Schram to the Hunts after the decision to move the accounts 
  had been made. In the letter, Schram said it was his job to &quot;assist&quot; 
  them in building a portfolio by providing &quot;timely advice and investment 
  recommendations&quot; and that he hoped their relationship would be based on 
  &quot;open and honest communications&quot;. It appears that Schram saw his role 
  as one of advising, but ultimately acting upon the Hunts' instructions. Indeed, 
  this is borne out by the trial judge's finding that, apart from the sale of 
  the BCE shares, Schram made no transactions unless so instructed by the Hunts. 
  </p>
<p>
  Reliance</p>
<p>
  [57] The question of reliance clearly overlaps with the reposing of trust. The 
  trial judge made a finding that &quot;Mel Hunt placed complete reliance on the 
  judgment of Schram&quot;. A number of other findings make this conclusion unreasonable. 
  </p>
<p>
  [58] In paragraphs 16-24 of the January 17, 2002 reasons for judgment, a number 
  of transactions are canvassed in detail. The trial judge found that they were 
  transactions in which Melville Hunt instructed Schram and Schram carried out 
  the instructions. In fact, the trial judge found &quot;Mr. Hunt agreed that 
  Mark Schram had followed his instructions in everything but the [purchase of 
  Guardian funds]&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [59] Melville Hunt made his own investment decisions with advice from Schram 
  that he could either accept or reject. As set out above, it was Melville Hunt 
  who decided to purchase Chrysler shares, and directed Schram to do so. Melville 
  Hunt authorized all of the investments purchased with the proceeds from the 
  BCE shares. </p>
<p>
  Discretion</p>
<p>
  [60] The Hunts' account was non-discretionary. Nonetheless, the trial judge 
  found, at para. 88, that Schram had the ability to act without authorization 
  in the sense that &quot;Mark Schram did not need the signature of Mel Hunt to 
  invest the Money Market Funds&quot;. The fact that Schram could make transactions 
  without the Hunts' signature does not address the question of whether Schram 
  had, in any meaningful way, power or discretion over the Hunts funds. The answer 
  to that question can only be that he did not. </p>
<p>
  [61] The agreement between the Hunts and the appellants was that decisions were 
  to be made only upon the Hunts instructions and the trial judge found that the 
  account was operated in that fashion. The fact that Schram breached the terms 
  of the contract on one occasion cannot transform the relationship into one characterized 
  as the unilateral exercise of power. The account was not only designated non-discretionary, 
  it was operated in that fashion. As such, the finding that Schram had unilateral 
  authority or power over the Hunts' financial interests is a palpable and overriding 
  error.</p>
<p>
  Professional Rules or Codes of Conduct</p>
<p>
  [62] The existence of professional rules or codes of conduct will influence 
  the standards set by the court for acceptable conduct in the profession. As 
  stated by LaForest J. in Hodgkinson, at p. 425: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In sum, the rules set by the relevant professional body are of guiding importance 
  in determining the nature of duties flowing from a particular professional relationship&#133;. 
  It would be surprising indeed if the courts held the professional advisor to 
  a lower standard of responsibility than that deemed necessary by the self-regulating 
  body of the profession itself.</p>
<p>
  [63] The trial judge did not make reference to professional rules or codes of 
  conduct but indicates that he heard testimony of two experts on the conduct 
  of investment advisors and agents. The trial judge found that Schram and TDE 
  failed to comply with industry standards for dealing with older clients and 
  for reporting and investigating complaints. His findings are justified on the 
  evidence. However, the complaints occurred after the unauthorized sale. The 
  conduct relating to the complaints does not operate to retroactively change 
  the nature of the relationship between the Hunts and the appellants in terms 
  of the unauthorized sale. </p>
<p>
  [64] In conclusion, a consideration of the five factors shows that the relationship 
  between the Hunts and the appellants is contractual in nature. </p>
<p>
  ISSUE #2: Ratification of the Sale of the BCE Shares</p>
<p>
  [65] The trial judge dealt with the issues of ratification and mitigation together. 
  He canvassed the relevant facts, noting that Melville Hunt was a person who 
  trusted institutions, the Hunts were generally satisfied with TDE, they made 
  continued complaints about the sale of BCE shares but also continued to process 
  transactions through TDE, they had faith that through the complaint process 
  the matter would be &quot;set right&quot; and, although Melville Hunt testified 
  that he came to accept the sale of the shares, this was belied by their response 
  to the questionnaire and the letter written by their son on their behalf to 
  TDE.</p>
<p>
  [66] The trial judge concluded that the Hunts did not ratify the sale of the 
  shares. For the following reasons, I see no reason to interfere with that finding. 
  </p>
<p> [67] Ratification, in the context of principal and agent, has been defined 
  as<a href="#1">[1]</a>:<a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he adoption and confirmation by one person with knowledge of all material 
  facts, of an act or contract performed or entered into in his behalf by another 
  who at the time assumed without authority to act as his agent. Essence of &quot;ratification&quot; 
  by the principal of act of agent is manifestation of mental determination by 
  principal to affirm the act, and this may be manifested by written word or by 
  spoken word or by conduct, or may be inferred from known circumstances and principal's 
  acts in relation thereto.</p>
<p>
  [68] From this, it can be seen that ratification must be based on knowledge 
  of all of the material facts and may be express or implied.</p>
<p>
  [69] The trial judge found that the Hunts had knowledge of the sale of BCE shares 
  within ten days of the completion of the transaction. Clearly, the Hunts never 
  expressly ratified the sale; no one contends otherwise. The question is, therefore, 
  whether the Hunts' ratified the sale of the BCE shares by implication.</p>
<p>
  [70] The appellants argue that ratification can be implied from the Hunts' conduct 
  in that they continued to process sale transactions through Schram for a lengthy 
  period after becoming aware of the unauthorized sale of the BCE shares. They 
  say that the Hunts were obligated to take positive steps to repudiate the sale 
  within a reasonable period after becoming aware of the unauthorized sale. To 
  permit the Hunts to repudiate the sale later than that, they contend, is to 
  give the Hunts the right to &quot;speculate at the broker's expense&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [71] In making these arguments, the appellants rely upon Grenkow v. Merrill 
  Lynch Royal Securities Ltd. (1983), 23 Man. R. (2d) 54 (Q. B.). In Grenkow, 
  at para. 24, the court found that by continuing to deal with the broker while 
  taking no steps to reverse unauthorized transactions, the plaintiff ratified 
  the broker's acts: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the present case, there is no doubt the plaintiff was well aware of MacFadden's 
  wrongful acts and yet deliberately chose to do nothing about it. In my view, 
  the cumulative result of the plaintiff's conduct, including the fact that the 
  plaintiff, knowing what MacFadden had done, used MacFadden to purchase the 600 
  shares of Hiram Walker in March, 1980, shows clearly that the plaintiff had 
  elected to adopt and to ratify MacFadden's unauthorized acts. And, in my respectful 
  opinion, it makes eminent good sense that the plaintiff in this case should 
  not be accorded the right &quot;to speculate at the broker's expense&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [72] In Forrest v. Gairdner &amp; C.O. Ltd. at el (1962), 33 D.L.R. (2d) 575, 
  the British Columbia Court of Appeal considered the situation where the plaintiff 
  expressly ratified four unauthorized sales, repudiated two others and remained 
  silent in respect of a further two sales for a period of about two and a half 
  months. The court stated that all of the circumstances should be considered 
  when determining whether ratification occurs. The court held, at p. 578, that 
  failure to notify within a reasonable time, in the circumstances, was some evidence 
  of ratification.</p>
<p>
  In my opinion this course of dealing established a tacit arrangement by which 
  the respondent was bound to elect within a reasonable time whether he would 
  accept or reject the unauthorized transaction. Respondent's failure to notify 
  the appellant within a reasonable time of his election would be some evidence 
  of ratification. In each of the six cases respondent notified appellant at once 
  of his election and paid for his purchase in cash on ratification. The only 
  delay was in the impugned transactions [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[73] Like the plaintiff in Grenkow, the Hunts continued to process transactions 
  through their broker after becoming aware of the unauthorized sale. However, 
  the facts of the instant appeal differ from those in Grenkow in one very significant 
  respect. Melville Hunt did not sit by and do nothing. He complained about the 
  unauthorized transaction as soon as he received the transaction slips in the 
  mail and he continued to complain about the unauthorized transactions thereafter. 
  The plaintiff in Grenkow, on the other hand, was silent about the unauthorized 
  sale even while he continued to process other transactions through the broker. 
  </p>
<p>
  [74] For the same reason, the instant appeal is distinguishable from Forrest. 
  In Forrest, the plaintiff remained silent with respect to the two impugned transactions 
  for a period of over two months. The plaintiff made clear whether he ratified 
  or repudiated six other unauthorized transactions. Silence in that situation 
  was held to amount to ratification. The instant appeal is not a situation of 
  silence. As has been noted, the Hunts notified the appellants right away that 
  they did not accept the sale and they maintained that stance thereafter.</p>
<p>
  [75] In my view, the Hunts' complaints amount to express repudiation of the 
  unauthorized sale. While continued dealings may be evidence of ratification, 
  it is not determinative. In my view, ratification cannot be implied in the face 
  of continuing repudiation even when the investor continues to use the broker 
  for other transactions. </p>
<p>
  [76] The Hunts were faced with shares that had been sold and a choice of what 
  to do with the proceeds. They chose to use the sale proceeds to make other investments. 
  In light of their continued express repudiation of the sale, the fact that they 
  did not choose to repurchase BCE shares does not amount to ratification by implication 
  nor does their continued course of dealing with Schram. </p>
<p>
  [77] As will become apparent in the discussion of mitigation, below, the finding 
  that there was no ratification is not tantamount to permitting the Hunts to 
  speculate at the broker's expense. The duty to mitigate limits the extent to 
  which the broker bears the risk of fluctuation in the market to those risks 
  for which he is reasonably held responsible. </p>
<p>
  ISSUE #3: Mitigation and Damages</p>
<p>
  [78] The trial judge held that the Hunts were required to mitigate by purchasing 
  replacement BCE shares &quot;on the date of the issue of the statement of claim, 
  namely, July 8, 1998&quot;. He held that damages were &quot;the difference between 
  the value of the BCE shares at that date [i.e. July 8, 1998] and the value of 
  replacement shares as at that date with appropriate adjustments&quot;. The damage 
  assessment closest to July 8, 1998 was prepared as at July 31, 1998; he used 
  the figures in that assessment to calculate the damage award. He gave no reasons 
  for choosing the date of issuance of the statement of claim as the mitigation 
  period. </p>
<p>
  [79] The appellants contend that, while the trial judge was correct in holding 
  that the Hunts had a duty to mitigate, he erred in finding that the duty to 
  mitigate &quot;crystallized&quot; on July 8, 1998. They maintain that damages 
  are to be assessed on the basis of the cost of replacement shares at the time 
  of the wrong. They argue that, in the circumstances, only a brief mitigation 
  period was warranted. On that basis, they ask that damages be calculated on 
  a date in March of 1997.</p>
<p>
  [80] The respondents cross-appeal on the issue of mitigation. Their arguments 
  are all founded on the premise that the unauthorized sale was a breach of fiduciary 
  obligation. They contend that the trial judge erred in failing to admit into 
  evidence the damage/compensation assessment they tendered that gave information 
  on the value of the BCE shares as at March 31, 2000 and April 30, 2000. They 
  submit, further, that the trial judge erred in holding that a duty to mitigate 
  arises in situations of breach of fiduciary duty and in the &quot;crystallization&quot; 
  date that he chose. They argue that the correct measure of damages for breach 
  of fiduciary duty is compensation for the loss of opportunity to sell the BCE 
  shares as market prices increased. They ask the court to vary the judgment and 
  award compensation to the Hunts on one of the following dates and in the corresponding 
  amounts: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Date:December 31, 1999March 31, 2000April 30, 2000 Mel Hunt$188,332.00$280,503.00$263,471.00	
  Marion Hunt$ 73,027.00$111,973.00$105,648.00</p>
<p>
  [81] Alternatively, the respondents contend that if a duty to mitigate does 
  exist in situations of breach of fiduciary duty, the duty did not arise in this 
  case because the appellants neglected or failed to reverse the transaction and 
  restore the shares to the Hunts when they had the power to do so or because 
  the appellants fully invested the Hunts in other securities thereby depriving 
  the Hunts of the means to mitigate. </p>
<p>
  Breach of Contract</p>
<p>
  [82] Having concluded that the unauthorized sale was a breach of contract, there 
  is no question but that the Hunts had a duty to mitigate. That being the case, 
  the mitigation period must be determined: when, in law, were the Hunts obliged 
  to purchase replacement shares?</p>
<p>
  [83] In Asamera, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the matter of 
  breach of contract for the unauthorized sale of shares. One party to the action 
  refused to return certain shares that another party had loaned to him. The wrongful 
  conduct resulted in the loss of shares that were publicly traded and readily 
  available on the market. </p>
<p>
  [84] At p. 664, the Court reiterated the injured party's obligation to mitigate 
  and established the general principle for determining the mitigation period: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subject always to the precise circumstances of each case, this will impose on 
  the injured party the obligation to purchase like shares in the market on the 
  date of breach (or knowledge thereof in the plaintiff) or more frequently within 
  a period thereafter which is reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [85] Several factors in Asamera resulted in the Court postponing the date of 
  mitigation from the date of the breach, including the large number of shares 
  involved, the volatility of the market, a request by the party in breach to 
  postpone acting on the claim, and the time required to arrange the financing 
  and careful re-acquisition of shares.</p>
<p>
  [86] More recently, in Laflamme, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada provided 
  further guidance on the kinds of factors that may postpone the duty to mitigate, 
  specifically in the context of a relationship based on trust.</p>
<p>
  [87] In Laflamme, an unsophisticated investor entrusted funds from the sale 
  of his business to a broker for discretionary investment. The purpose of the 
  investment was to provide retirement income. The investor later learned from 
  his auditor that some of the investments being made on his behalf were speculative 
  and that the broker was managing the portfolio on margin. The investor instructed 
  the broker to stop the margin transactions and to make only safe investments. 
  The broker failed to follow these instructions. Stock prices fell. After approximately 
  one year, the investor closed his account and sustained major losses.</p>
<p>
  [88] The Quebec Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff should have acted sooner 
  to mitigate his losses. The Supreme Court of Canada disagreed, saying (at paras. 
  53-54): </p>
<p class="indent"> In the case of injury resulting from mismanagement of a securities 
  portfolio, a flexible approach must be taken in determining what constitutes 
  a reasonable period of time for the client to act and mitigate the damages. 
  In particular, regard must be had to the client's level of experience and knowledge 
  of investments, and to the complexity of the situation.</p>
<p class="indent">I would add that the sense of trust that is characteristic of 
  a contract of mandate also has a significant impact on the state of mind of 
  a client who is the victim of a fault committed by a manager. In this case, 
  that trust lay in the belief acquired in the professional merit of the manager, 
  as a result of which a client, especially one who is not knowledgeable, may 
  be unable or at least reluctant to believe that the manager is incompetent. 
  Both that trust and the confusion resulting from a loss of trust will make it 
  particularly difficult for the victim to take charge of the situation. Awareness 
  of the extent of the injury dawns more slowly. The situation, which the manager 
  himself has create by representing himself as a professional worthy of trust, 
  must be taken into account before blaming the victim for any want of diligence 
  in mitigating damages, especially since the measures to be taken were not obvious 
  and responsibility for taking or advising those measures rested primarily on 
  the respondents, as knowledgeable dealers and managers. A number of options 
  were available: transfer the portfolio to another manager, sell the securities 
  held, or hold onto them in the hope that they would go up in value. Obviously, 
  it is easy to identify the right course of action in hindsight. At the time 
  however the decision was one that called for an assessment of highly complex 
  risks, and that involved risks of its own. The Laflamme family held onto the 
  securities. Should they be faulted for that? In the circumstances, we must conclude 
  that they are not to blame. </p>
<p>
  [89] Two decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal provide additional 
  insight into factors to be considered when determining the mitigation period. 
  </p>
<p>
  [90] In Hongkong Bank of Canada v. Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. (1990), 
  72 D.L.R. (4th) 161 (B.C. C.A.), a broker failed to sell bonds when so instructed 
  by his customer, the Hongkong Bank of Canada. The instruction was given on April 
  9, 1998. On April 16, 1998, the settlement date for the sale, the Bank discovered 
  the error but it was too late in the day to sell them to another broker that 
  day. The Bank made inquires during the remainder of the 16th. The three days 
  that followed were holidays. On April 20th, the Bank and the broker discussed 
  the matter and agreed to look into it further. On April 21st, the broker confirmed 
  its position that it had never been instructed to sell the bonds. The parties 
  discussed the possibility of arbitration over the two days that followed. On 
  April 23, the Bank sold the bonds. The value of the bonds had fallen consistently 
  throughout the parties' discussions. The trial judge assessed damages as the 
  difference between the price that would have been received if the instructions 
  had been followed and the price actually received on April 23. </p>
<p>
  [91] The Court of Appeal, however, held that &quot;subject to market conditions 
  and the plaintiff's knowledge and familiarity with the market, greater promptitude 
  in mitigation will be expected in a case involving the purchase or sale of marketable 
  securities&quot;. It concluded that there was sufficient time on April 21st, 
  after the broker confirmed that he would not purchase the shares, for the Bank 
  to sell them. Thus, a mitigation period of three business days, including the 
  date of discovery of the breach, was found to be reasonable. In reaching this 
  conclusion, the court said at 165: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There was ample time remaining on April 21st to have arranged for the sale of 
  the bonds. They could have been sold within a few minutes. The bank did not 
  lack knowledge of the market for Government of Canada bonds. It was not unfamiliar 
  with the securities market. In my view the bank should have acted with greater 
  promptitude. It should have sold the bonds on April 21, 1987, and should not 
  have waited until April 23, 1987, by which date the market for the bonds had 
  further declined.</p>
<p>
  [92] The British Columbia Court of Appeal considered the matter again in Secord 
  v. Global Securities Corp. (2003), B.C.L.R. (4th) 62. The result in Secord stands 
  in sharp contrast to that in Hongkong Bank. In Secord, a broker gave the plaintiff 
  inadequate advice with respect to options trading, thus exposing her to more 
  risk than she wished. In August of 1996, some six months after she ordered the 
  broker to cease trading in options, the plaintiff transferred her account to 
  another firm. The broker maintained that the plaintiff should have moved more 
  quickly to mitigate her losses. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's 
  finding that the plaintiff acted reasonably in taking six months to mitigate. 
  </p>
<p>
  [93] The court reviewed a number of cases, including Asamera, Hongkong Bank, 
  and Laflamme, and concluded at paras. 40-41: </p>
<p class="indent"> What I deduce from the cases is that in deciding on the extent 
  of the duty to mitigate and the appropriate measure of damages, a court must 
  have regard to the particular factual circumstances of the particular case in 
  order to arrive at a just result. Due regard must be paid to the nature of the 
  portfolio or the transaction in question and as well the experience and sophistication 
  of the client. A not entirely irrelevant factor is a consideration of whether 
  the relationship between the client and broker has entirely broken down to the 
  point where the broker has lost the confidence of the client. A client is not 
  necessarily to be faulted for failing to take advice from a broker in whom he 
  or she has entirely lost confidence as a result of inappropriate or unauthorized 
  conduct on the part of the broker. </p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the trial judge found, and in my view was 
  entitled on the evidence to find, that the brokers were not acting appropriately 
  in advising Mrs. Secord to embark on trading in options. Such a course was out 
  of accord with her expressed intentions as to what she wanted to achieve in 
  her portfolio. The course adopted led to significant losses as a result of the 
  option trading. The plaintiff said that she had zero trust in her advisors after 
  she examined what had happened in the Sailview account with regard to the options 
  trading. To suggest in those circumstances that she should follow advice from 
  them as to what to do about her portfolio seems somewhat unrealistic. Although 
  this client had some experience in trading securities, she was wholly unfamiliar 
  with options trading before she came to Global and even in 1996, it seems to 
  me that she was not knowledgeable or well informed about this type of trading. 
  I am of the view that she acted reasonably in taking a period of time to assess 
  the situation herself and in proceeding to find a new advisor in whom she would 
  have confidence.</p>
<p>
  [94] The fact that the Hunts' account was non-discretionary also has implications 
  for the mitigation period. In this respect, the comments of Sheppard J. in Cheseborough 
  v. Willson, [2001] O.J. No. 940 (Sup. Ct. Jus.), affirmed at [2002] O.J. No. 
  4299 (C.A.), are helpful. In Cheseborough, the trial judge found that there 
  was no fiduciary duty where a broker operated on the basis of the investor's 
  instructions. Like the instant appeal, there was an allegation that shares were 
  wrongfully disposed of. The plaintiff in Cheseborough pursued many avenues of 
  complaint following the sale but did not instruct the broker to repurchase the 
  shares or take any steps to repurchase them. Counsel for the plaintiff argued 
  that the broker was obliged to repurchase the shares on his own accord. Sheppard 
  J. rejected this argument, at para. 60, noting that the broker was obliged to 
  follow the plaintiff's instructions and without clear instructions, he could 
  not know how many of the shares to buy back and which shares to sell to raise 
  the funds. </p>
<p>
  [95] Turning then to a determination of the mitigation period in the instant 
  appeal, the starting point, according to Asamera, is that the obligation to 
  purchase like shares arises on the date of breach or knowledge thereof in the 
  injured party. This appropriately reflects the principle that underlies the 
  duty to mitigate; namely, that the injured party may not recover losses that 
  could have been avoided by him or her taking reasonable steps after the wrong. 
  </p>
<p>
  [96] But the process of determining the mitigation period is not a mechanical 
  one; the period must be a reasonable one, in light of all of the circumstances. 
  </p>
<p>
  [97] In determining what is reasonable, the case law suggests that the following 
  factors warrant consideration: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. ease of purchase of replacement shares -- which involves 
  considering the number of shares to be purchased, whether they are readily available 
  in the market, and the time and risk involved in their purchase, </p>
<p class="indent">2. the degree of sophistication and experience of the investor,</p>
<p class="indent">3. the degree of trust reposed in the broker, </p>
<p class="indent">4. whether the broker was obliged to follow the investor's instructions 
  in making transactions, and </p>
<p class="indent">5. whether the relationship between the investor and broker 
  has broken down to the point that the client has lost confidence in the broker. 
</p>
<p>
  [98] In my view, application of these factors leads to the conclusion that, 
  in the instant appeal, a brief mitigation period is reasonable. </p>
<p>
  [99] Repurchase of BCE shares would have been relatively easy. The shares were 
  readily available in the requisite quantities on the market. The sale proceeds 
  were available to the Hunts, thus they had the financial means to purchase replacement 
  shares. Unlike the investor in Laflamme, the Hunts were not faced with a complex 
  and difficult decision following the sale of the BCE shares. Had they wished 
  to re-acquire the shares, all that was necessary was for them to so instruct 
  Schram.</p>
<p>
  [100] None of the complicating factors evident in Asamera or Secord exist in 
  the instant appeal. Melville Hunt had experience in purchasing BCE shares, having 
  done so over a lengthy period prior to the unauthorized sale. While the Hunts 
  should not be held to the standard of promptitude imposed on sophisticated parties 
  such as the bank in Hongkong Bank, the simplicity of the issues facing the Hunts 
  following the unauthorized sale are much closer to that case. All that was required 
  of the Hunts was the repurchase of a relatively small quantity of a single, 
  readily available share. </p>
<p>
  [101] The Hunts' situation also differed from that of the investor in Secord 
  in terms of the degree of trust reposed by the investor in the broker. The Hunts 
  had a non-discretionary account and, with the sole exception of the unauthorized 
  sale of BCE shares, Schram was found to have followed the Hunts instructions 
  in every case. Like the broker in Cheseborough, Schram was not in a position 
  to unilaterally determine how to use the proceeds of the unauthorized sale. 
  Although his role was to advise the Hunts on how to invest their money, he was 
  obliged by the express terms of the agreement between them to follow their instructions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [102] The relationship between Schram and the Hunts had not broken down. As 
  noted, the Hunts instructed Schram on the use of the sale proceeds and continued 
  to use Schram for a number of months thereafter. Their relationship ended only 
  when Schram sent them a letter in December of 1998, asking that they move their 
  investments to the broker of their choice.</p>
<p>
  [103] The unauthorized sale took place on March 3, 1997, and the transaction 
  was completed on March 6. The trial judge found that the Hunts received transaction 
  slips confirming the sale of the BCE shares within a week to ten days of the 
  transaction. On March 7, 1997, Melville Hunt instructed Schram to purchase Chrysler 
  Securities. The only funds available to purchase these shares were proceeds 
  from the BCE shares. The Hunts did not authorize Schram to sell any other shares 
  in order to raise funds for the purchase of the Chrysler securities, which strongly 
  suggests that the Hunts knew of the sale on March 7, 1997. Based on the trial 
  judge's finding, by March 16, 1997 at the latest, the Hunts knew that the BCE 
  shares had been sold, and the proceeds were available for re-investment.</p>
<p>
  [104] Less than a month after instructing Schram to purchase the Chrysler shares, 
  Melville Hunt instructed Schram to buy shares in CIBC, again using proceeds 
  from the sale of the BCE shares. This latter transaction was completed on April 
  2, 1997.</p>
<p>
  [105] In my view, by April 2, 1997 at the latest, Melville Hunt was in a position 
  to decide whether to re-acquire BCE shares. He knew that the shares had been 
  sold, the proceeds were available and he was making decisions on how to use 
  those proceeds. To impose a duty to mitigate on the Hunts at a date later than 
  that would be to permit them to speculate at the broker's expense. For these 
  reasons, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in finding that 
  the reasonable mitigation period ran from the date of the unauthorized sale 
  (i.e. March 3, 1997) to the issuance of the statement of claim on July 8, 1998. 
  </p>
<p>
  [106] The trial judge found that the price of BCE shares dropped in the two-month 
  period following the unauthorized sale. As the mitigation period falls within 
  that two-month period, there was no loss in value of the shares. As a result, 
  the Hunts are entitled to recover only the costs associated with the unauthorized 
  sale namely, the taxes paid on the capital gains incurred as a result of the 
  sale, and the transaction costs and commissions paid on the sale of the BCE 
  shares. Had the Hunts purchased replacement BCE shares, they would have been 
  entitled to the associated transaction costs and commissions. In fact, the Hunts 
  purchased Chrysler and CIBC shares. The measure of damages extends to cover 
  the transaction costs and commissions paid on both those purchases, costs that 
  the Hunts would not have incurred but for the unauthorized sale of the BCE shares. 
  </p>
<p>
  Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>
<p>
  [107] Having determined that this appeal is properly disposed of on contractual 
  principles, strictly speaking I need not consider whether the duty to mitigate 
  would have arisen had the unauthorized sale amounted to breach of a fiduciary 
  obligation. That said, for the following reasons, I am of the view that the 
  same result would obtain had the appeal been decided on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [108] In Canson, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada discusses the applicability 
  of the concept of mitigation to compensation for breach of fiduciary duty. LaForest 
  J. reviewed the historical interaction of law and equity and the role that common 
  law concepts, such as mitigation, play in equitable claims including breach 
  of fiduciary duty. At p. 581, LaForest J. concludes that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  barring different policy considerations underlying one action or the other, 
  I see no reason why the same basic claim, whether framed in terms of a common 
  law action or an equitable remedy, should give rise to different levels of redress.</p>
<p>
  [109] In a concurring judgment in Canson, McLachlin J. (as she then was) emphasised 
  the distinction between compensatory damages in cases of tort or contract, and 
  equity. McLachlin J. reasons, at p. 545, that &quot;the better approach&#133;is 
  to look to the policy behind compensation for breach of fiduciary duty and determine 
  what remedies will best further that policy.&quot; She distinguishes the policies 
  behind tort and contract from those behind breach of fiduciary duty stating, 
  at p. 554: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In negligence and contract the law limits the actions of the parties who are 
  expected to pursue their own best interest. Each is expected to continue to 
  look after their own interests after a breach or tort, and so a duty of mitigation 
  is imposed. In contrast, the hallmark of fiduciary relationship is that the 
  fiduciary, at least within a certain scope, is expected to pursue the best interest 
  of the client. It may not be fair to allow the fiduciary to complain when the 
  client fails forthwith to shoulder the fiduciary's burden. This approach to 
  mitigation accords with the basic rule of equitable compensation that the injured 
  party will be reimbursed for all losses flowing directly from the breach. When 
  the plaintiff, after due notice and opportunity, fails to take the most obvious 
  steps to alleviate his or her losses, then we may rightly say that the plaintiff 
  has been &quot;the author of his own misfortune&quot;. At this point the plaintiff's 
  failure to mitigate may become so egregious that it is no longer sensible to 
  say that the losses which followed were caused by the fiduciary's breach. But 
  until that point, mitigation will not be required.</p>
<p>
  [110] McLachlin J. concludes, at p. 556, that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The plaintiff will not be required to mitigate, as the term is used in law, 
  but losses resulting from clearly unreasonable behaviour on the part of the 
  plaintiff will be adjudged to flow from that behaviour, and not the breach.</p>
<p>
  [111] In Hodgkinson, supra, LaForest J. reiterated his view that courts should 
  treat similar wrongs similarly, regardless of the particular cause of action 
  pleaded, except where the cause of action entails different policy considerations. 
  After citing his judgment in Canson, he states at p. 444, &quot;[i]n other words, 
  the courts should look to the harm suffered from the breach of the given duty, 
  and apply the appropriate remedy&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [112] The appellant in Hodgkinson invested in a real estate development on the 
  advice of his accountant, a specialist in real estate tax shelter investments. 
  The development fell through. The accountant did not disclose to the appellant 
  that he was acting for the developers at the time that he advised the appellant 
  to invest in the project. Had the appellant known that the he was not hiring 
  an independent advisor, he would not have invested. LaForest J. relates the 
  appellant's entitlement to equitable compensation in these circumstances, to 
  the common law doctrine of mitigation, at p. 452: </p>
<p class="indent">
  From a policy perspective it is simply unjust to place the risk of market fluctuations 
  on a plaintiff who would not have entered into a given transaction but for the 
  defendant's wrongful conduct. I observe that in Waddell, supra, Bramwell L.J. 
  conceded, at p. 680, that if restitutio in integrum had been possible, the plaintiff 
  could probably have recovered in full. Indeed counsel for the appellant argued 
  that the proper approach to damages in this case was the monetary equivalent 
  of a rescisionary remedy. I agree. In my view the appellant should not suffer 
  from the fact that he did not discover the breach until such time as the market 
  had already taken its toll on his investments. This principle, which I take 
  to be a basic principle of fairness, is in fact reflected in the common law 
  of mitigation, itself rooted in causation; see S.M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts 
  (3rd ed. 1993), at p. 515. In Asamera Oil Corp. v. Sea Oil &amp; General Corp., 
  [1979] 1 S.C.R. 633, this court held that in an action for breach of the duty 
  to return shares under a contract of bailment, the obligation imposed on the 
  plaintiff to mitigate by purchasing like shares on the open market did not commence 
  until such time as the plaintiff learned of the breach or within a reasonable 
  time thereafter [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [113] In this passage, LaForest J. reiterates that a wrongdoer is liable for 
  the harm that results from the wrongful conduct. However, the extent of that 
  liability is subject to the circumstances of the innocent party and the extent 
  to which the injured party is reasonably expected to react to and mitigate that 
  harm. </p>
<p>
  [114] The majority judgment in Hodgkinson, together with the judgment in Canson, 
  indicate that where a breach of fiduciary duty does not raise policy concerns 
  that militate against imposing a duty to mitigate, and the rationale behind 
  the common law duty to mitigate is applicable, then equity will impose the same 
  obligation to mitigate in order to avoid unnecessary loss.</p>
<p>
  [115] On this rationale, the Hunts had a duty to mitigate shortly after becoming 
  aware of the unauthorized sale. (For the reasons given above, the mitigation 
  period expired April 2, 1997.) While the application of the doctrine of mitigation 
  to cases of breach of fiduciary duty is subject to the policy concerns underlying 
  the law of fiduciaries, no policy concerns present themselves such that the 
  same claim should be resolved differently. Whether the wrongful sale of shares 
  is a breach of contract or of fiduciary duty, the Hunts were required to mitigate 
  shortly after discovering the breach.</p>
<p>
  [116] In light of these determinations on the duty to mitigate, the matters 
  raised by way of cross-appeal can be dealt with in summary fashion. The appellants 
  cannot be held liable for the Hunts' loss of opportunity to sell the BCE shares 
  given that the Hunts knew of the sale and could have directed the purchase of 
  replacement shares. Instead, they directed their broker to purchase alternate 
  investments. To hold otherwise would be to allow the Hunts to speculate at the 
  broker's expense.</p>
<p>
  [117] The Hunts cannot rely on lack of funds as a reason for failing to mitigate. 
  The lack of funds arose from their instructions to use the sale proceeds to 
  purchase alternate investments.</p>
<p>
  [118] I cannot accept that Schram should have reversed the sale or purchased 
  replacement shares on his own initiative because to do so would have been a 
  breach of the express terms of the agreement with the Hunts.</p>
<p>
  [119] In light of these determinations, it cannot be said that the trial judge 
  erred in refusing to admit into evidence damage assessments based on the value 
  of BCE shares at March 30, 2000 and April 30, 2000. </p>
<p>
  ISSUE #4: The Costs Award Below</p>
<p>
  [120] The appellants argue that the costs award below suffers from two types 
  of errors. First, they contend that it was an error to award the Hunts costs 
  of the trial on a solicitor and client basis. Second, they maintain that the 
  trial judge erred in determining the quantum. </p>
<p>1) Solicitor and Client Costs Award</p>
<p>
  [121] In his August 12, 2002 ruling on costs, the trial judge said this in awarding 
  the respondents costs of the action on a solicitor and client scale (at paras. 
  13-18): </p>
<p class="indent"> Mark Schram acted on his own. He breached his fiduciary duty 
  to the Hunts. Toronto Dominion Evergreen attempted to cover up his failure to 
  act on instructions. The conduct of the defendants became worse as the case 
  progressed. Mark Schram obviously lied in his evidence that he received telephone 
  instructions from Mr. Hunt. TD Evergreen never produced anyone at the trial 
  to explain the way that they handled the complaints. The defendants betrayed 
  the trust that the plaintiffs placed in them. To get the remedy to which they 
  were entitled they had to pursue the lawsuit to its final conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Melville Hunt was 75 and Marion Hunt was 73 when they retained 
  Mark Schram. At the trial Mr. Hunt was 80 and Mrs. Hunt was 77. Mr. Hunt was 
  in such poor physical health at the trial that his evidence had to be taken 
  at his home rather than in the courtroom. They live on a modest pension. They 
  have modest savings if they need them.</p>
<p class="indent">The only reasonable inference from the defendants' conduct is 
  that they made a calculated decision that the plaintiffs lacked the physical 
  strength and endurance and the financial resources to pursue the remedy to which 
  they were entitled to its conclusion. The defendants adopted the role of the 
  bully.</p>
<p class="indent">In the frequently quoted case of Apotex Inc. v. Egis Pharmaceuticals 
  and Novopharm Ltd. [1991] O.J. No. 1232 (Gen. Div.), Justice Henry stated the 
  following: </p>
<p class="indent15"> &quot;Furthermore, while the award of costs between parties 
  on the solicitor and client scale has traditionally been reserved for cases 
  where the court wishes to show its disapproval of conduct that is oppressive 
  or contumelious, there is also a factor that frequently underlies the award, 
  that is not necessarily expressed, that the successful party ought not to be 
  put to any expense for costs in the circumstances. That is a factor in my decision 
  in this case.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">Both principles apply to this case.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant shall pay to the plaintiffs their costs throughout 
  these proceedings on a solicitor and client scale.</p>
<p>
  [122] With respect, in my view, the above passage reveals reversible error. 
  I will deal first with the trial judge's reference to the principle that &quot;the 
  successful party ought not to be put to any expense for costs in the circumstances&quot; 
  and then consider his conclusion that the appellants' conduct was &quot;oppressive 
  or contumelious&quot; so as to justify solicitor and client costs.</p>
<p>
  Should the successful party be put to expense?</p>
<p>
  [123] The test for awarding costs on a solicitor and client scale is well established. 
  It was articulated by this court in Mortimer v. Cameron (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 
  1 and more recently in McBride Metal Fabricating Corp. v. H &amp; W Sales Co 
  (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 97. Both cases refer to the following passage from Orkin, 
  The Law of Costs, 2nd ed. (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 1993) at pp. 2-91 to 2-92: </p>
<p class="indent"> Costs on the solicitor-and-client scale should not be awarded 
  unless special grounds exist to justify a departure from the usual scale.</p>
<p class="indent">Such orders are not to be made by way of damages, or on the 
  view that the award of damages should reach the plaintiff intact, and are inappropriate 
  where there has been no wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="indent">An award of costs on the solicitor-and-client scale, it has 
  been said, is ordered only in rare and exceptional cases to mark the court's 
  disapproval of the conduct of the party in the litigation. The principle guiding 
  the decision to award solicitor-and-client cost has been enunciated thus: </p>
<p class="indent15">
  [S]olicitor-and-client costs should not be awarded unless there is some form 
  of reprehensible conduct, either in the circumstances giving rise to the cause 
  of action, or in the proceedings, which makes such costs desirable as a form 
  of chastisement.</p>
<p>
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [124] As this extract makes clear, solicitor and client costs are not to be 
  used as a means of shoring up a damages award nor are they a means to ensure 
  that a plaintiff is not put to any expense.</p>
<p>
  [125] Apotex should not be read as standing for the proposition that ensuring 
  that the successful party is not put to any expense is a self-standing justification 
  for awarding costs on a solicitor and client basis. Rather, the emphasis is 
  to be placed on the circumstances in Apotex, which involved the misuse of applications 
  for interlocutory injunctions. As this court stated in Church of Jesus Christ 
  of Latter Day Saints (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 389 at 398: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Apotex] established the proposition that the moving party for an interlocutory 
  injunction ought to pay the costs of the respondent on a solicitor and client 
  basis when the motion lacks merit and includes allegations of fraud, deceit, 
  and conspiracy. </p>
<p>
  [126] In the present case, there were no allegations of fraud, deceit or conspiracy 
  nor was there any suggestion that the action was improperly defended. In the 
  words of the trial judge &quot;both counsel delivered a high quality of advocacy 
  throughout the proceeding. As has been said by others, a trial is not a tea 
  party. The case was vigorously and skilfully defended by Mr. Finch.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [127] If the trial judge relied on the principle that the party ought not to 
  be put to any expense as a free standing ground upon which to award solicitor 
  and client costs, he erred. Thus, if the solicitor and client costs is justified, 
  it must be due to the appellants' misconduct and not the desire to indemnify 
  the Hunts.</p>
<p>
  The Appellants' Conduct </p>
<p>
  [128] The second reason given by the trial judge for awarding solicitor and 
  client costs relates to his finding that the appellants' conduct warranted sanction. 
  </p>
<p>
  [129] In reviewing this matter, it is useful to consider the alleged misconduct 
  in the pre-litigation conduct separately from conduct during the course of litigation.</p>
<p>
  [130] The pre-litigation conduct referred to by the trial judge was Schram's 
  unauthorized sale of shares and TDE's attempt to cover up Schram's actions. 
  This conduct was at the very heart of the proceedings and, as such, is compensable 
  in damages. To award costs on a solicitor and client basis is to compensate 
  the injured parties twice for the same wrongdoing. Costs are not to be used 
  in this fashion. See McBride, supra.</p>
<p>
  [131] I do not mean to suggest that conduct that constitutes a breach of fiduciary 
  duty can never found an award of solicitor and client costs but there must be 
  some aspect of the conduct that is not addressed through damages. </p>
<p>
  [132] For example, in Gerula v. Flores (1995), 126 D.L.R. (4th) 506, this court 
  held that solicitor and client costs were justified where the defendant surgeon 
  altered medical records to conceal the fact that he had operated on the wrong 
  disc during back surgery. The defendant relied on this deception in his pleadings 
  and throughout the pre-trial proceedings, admitting the truth only at trial. 
  The court found that the conduct was an attempt to frustrate the proceedings 
  through deception, and that it complicated the proceedings and lengthened the 
  conduct of the action prior to trial. The court found that the trial itself 
  was not lengthened due to the deception. Solicitor and client costs were awarded 
  only up to trial, after which they were awarded on a party-and-party scale.</p>
<p>
  [133] In Gerula, at pp. 528-29, the court relied on the judgment of Dubin J.A. 
  in Foulis v. Robinson (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.) which set out the following 
  principles: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Solicitor-and-client costs as opposed to party-and-party 
  costs will only be awarded in rare and exceptional cases.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A defendant is entitled to defend an action and to put a 
  plaintiff to the proof of his case.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where a defendant's acts are a deliberate attempt to frustrate 
  the proceedings by fraud or deception, where the conduct of the defendant is 
  calculated to harm the plaintiff, or where the unreasonable conduct of the defendant 
  compounds the complexity of the proceedings, there are proper grounds to order 
  solicitor-and-client costs.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The fact that the issue of liability was not contested at 
  trial and that the defendant did not give evidence at trial are not factors 
  which, by themselves, should result in an award of solicitor-and-client costs. 
</p>
<p>
  [134] In sharp contrast to Gerula, in the instant appeal Schram made no attempt 
  to deceive the Hunts. The Hunts were made aware of the fact that he sold the 
  BCE shares right after the sale transaction. </p>
<p>
  [135] What, then, of the trial judge's finding that TDE attempted to cover up 
  Schram's failure to act on instructions? On its face, this finding appears to 
  be akin to the circumstances in Gerula. Had the appellants deliberately attempted 
  to conceal Schram's wrongdoing, so as to prevent or frustrate the Hunts in pursuing 
  their action, such conduct might well support an award of solicitor and client 
  costs. In my view, however, the finding of a deliberate attempt to cover up 
  Schram's wrongdoing cannot be supported on the record.</p>
<p>
  [136] In his reasons, the trial judge addresses the inadequacy of TDE's investigation 
  into the Hunts' complaint. He finds that Melville Hunt complained about the 
  sale of shares soon after he discovered the transaction, that Schram was not 
  receptive to his concerns, and that Schram improperly failed to pass along those 
  concerns to the compliance department.</p>
<p>
  [137] The Hunts' written complaint was reviewed by Sasha Latka, in TDE's compliance 
  department, and forwarded to the branch manager in Waterloo on February 15, 
  1998. On February 27, 1998, Melville Hunt sent a note to Jeff Carney at TDE, 
  stating that he had not received acknowledgment of his letter and requesting 
  a reply as to what action was being taken. On that same day, Schram provided 
  his response to Mr. Latka. Schram's response was consistent with the position 
  he took at trial, namely that the Hunts had authorized the sale.</p>
<p>
  [138] The trial judge found that Schram's response did not address all of the 
  Hunts' concerns and, specifically, did not address Marion Hunt's allegations 
  that Schram had insisted that she remove her BCE shares from her safety deposit 
  box and deposit them with TDE, that Schram neglected to inform her that a dividend 
  was about to be paid on the shares, and that her account had been improperly 
  debited. Further, although Schram testified that he had provided Mr. Latka with 
  additional information that was not in his written response, the appellants 
  did not call Mr. Latka as a witness.</p>
<p>
  [139] The trial judge found that TDE based its response to the Hunts' complaints 
  on information provided by Schram only. He noted that both of TDE's letters 
  of response to the Hunts' complaints misstated the amount of funds transferred 
  by the Hunts to open their account by including the value of the BCE shares. 
  The trial judge found that this information could only have come from Schram 
  and concluded that the compliance department had not fulfilled its function 
  because it investigated only one side. </p>
<p>
  [140] The trial judge concluded, at para. 120: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The failure of compliance to interview the Hunts falls far below the standard 
  of conduct required of them in the industry. Their investigation of the complaints 
  of Melville Hunt and Marion Hunt that Mark Schram sold their BCE stock without 
  authority was a sham. The letters of Robert Strickland and Jacqueline Hatherly 
  are patronizing, demeaning and insulting. In a word, the conduct of compliance 
  is disgusting. In dealing with the complaints, Toronto Dominion Evergreen did 
  not comply with their fiduciary duty to the Hunts.</p>
<p>
  [141] Nothing in the record before this court supports the conclusion that TDE 
  deliberately attempted to cover up Schram's wrongdoing. Rather, the trial judge's 
  findings support the conclusion that TDE accepted Schram's version of events 
  and did not properly investigate the Hunts' complaints. While such a finding 
  may be relevant to the question of breach of fiduciary duty, it does not support 
  an award of solicitor and client costs. See McBride and Gerula, supra.</p>
<p>
  [142] The trial judge referred to three matters relating to the appellants' 
  conduct during the litigation: the failure of TDE to call a witness to explain 
  the handling of the complaint; his finding that Schram lied when giving testimony; 
  and, that TDE forced the Hunts to pursue their claim in the courts.</p>
<p>
  [143] With respect to the appellants' decision not to call Sasha Latka as a 
  witness, I note that there was no obligation on TDE to lead evidence with respect 
  to the conduct of the investigation. More importantly, as this court made clear 
  in Gerula, the decision by a defendant not to call evidence does not in itself 
  justify solicitor and client costs.</p>
<p>
  [144] I turn next to the trial judge's finding that Schram lied when he testified 
  that he received instructions to sell the BCE shares in a telephone call with 
  Melville Hunt. The trial judge found Melville Hunt credible and believed his 
  testimony that he did not authorize the sale. </p>
<p>
  [145] In addition to his general assessment of the parties' credibility, the 
  trial judge considered the fact that counsel for the appellants did not cross-examine 
  Melville Hunt on the alleged telephone conversation. He concluded from this 
  that Schram had raised the prospect of a telephone call for the first time in 
  his evidence. He rejected Schram's explanation that he had never had reason 
  to bring it up before. </p>
<p>
  [146] In my view, there is nothing exceptional about these findings of credibility. 
  They are precisely the kinds of assessments that trial judges are required to 
  make on a daily basis. Such findings cannot be said to constitute a &quot;rare 
  and exceptional circumstance&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [147] The appellants cite Roberts v. Wilson (1997), 10 C.P.C. (4th) 188 (B.C.S.C.) 
  for the proposition that, in general, adverse findings of credibility do not 
  justify the exercise of discretion to award costs on a solicitor and client 
  scale. Several other decisions from British Columbia support this conclusion 
  including Chan Estate v. Hwang, [1999] B.C.J. No. 875 (B.C.S.C.). I am of the 
  same view. </p>
<p>
  [148] In Chan, the court did award solicitor and client costs. The court disbelieved 
  the defendants but also found that they had presented forged documents to support 
  their defence and were in contempt of an order to produce certain other documents. 
  That conduct justified an award of special costs. </p>
<p> [149] Similarly, in Dical Investments Ltd. V. Morrison (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 
  549 (H.C.J.)<a href="#2">[2]</a>,<a name="r2"></a> Montgomery J. awarded solicitor 
  and client costs against a party who made numerous improper allegations against 
  the defendants with the result that the defendants had to retain separate counsel; 
  the party then dropped the claims. That same party also pursued an unreasonable 
  claim for damages, which it dropped only after cross-examining the plaintiff's 
  witness; it also repeatedly and intentionally misled the court, and swore a 
  false affidavit. </p>
<p>
  [150] Chan and Dical are examples of rare and exceptional cases; they go far 
  beyond adverse findings of credibility. There are no analogous factors in the 
  instant case. The proper consequence of disbelieving Schram's testimony was 
  the finding that the sale of shares was not authorized. </p>
<p>
  [151] The trial judge placed great emphasis on the fact that the Hunts were 
  forced to pursue litigation in order to achieve the remedy to which they were 
  entitled. He finds that, given the Hunts' ages and the poor physical health 
  of Melville Hunt, &quot;the only reasonable inference from the defendants' conduct 
  is that they made a calculated decision that the plaintiffs lacked the physical 
  strength and endurance and the financial resources to pursue the remedy to which 
  they were entitled to its conclusion.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [152] This reasoning is erroneous. </p>
<p>
  [153] As stated in cases such as Mortimer, McBride, Gerula, and Foulis, a defendant 
  is entitled to require the plaintiff to prove its claim. As the court in Foulis 
  stated at p. 776: </p>
<p class="indent"> An award of costs on a party-and-party scale does not result 
  in the defendant and third party litigating &quot;with total immunity&quot;. 
  Under our system defendants are entitled to put the plaintiff to the proof, 
  and there is no obligation to settle an action. Where the costs follow the event, 
  the length of the trial will be reflected in the bill of costs taxed. The fact 
  that the issue of liability was not seriously contested at trial, that the defendant 
  did not give evidence, that he pleaded guilty to criminal negligence, and that 
  no evidence was called by the defendant and third party on the issues of liability 
  and damages are not factors which, by themselves, merit punitive action in the 
  award of costs.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">There is great danger, in my respectful opinion, in a trial 
  Judge second-guessing, after the event, how a trial should be conducted, even 
  where the trial is presided over, as was the case here, by a trial Judge who 
  has had great trial experience at the bar.</p>
<p class="indent">By reason of the differences between the defendant and third 
  party, it was the view of their respective counsel that an admission of liability 
  could not be made. They were not compelled to admit liability, nor settle the 
  damages. There was no suggestion that the defendant and third party were using 
  the judicial process to harass the plaintiffs, nor could it be said that the 
  conduct of the defendant and third party constituted an abuse of process.</p>
<p>
  [154] With respect, there is no basis in the instant appeal on which to conclude 
  that the appellants were attempting to use the justice system to harass the 
  plaintiffs or that they committed an abuse of process. The fact that the Hunts 
  are elderly and that Melville Hunt is in poor physical health are factors to 
  which a defendant might properly be sensitive in the conduct of its defence. 
  However, they are not factors that, of themselves, can operate to deprive a 
  defendant of its right to defend the action or that compel settlement. The trial 
  judge's conclusion that the appellants &quot;adopted the role of the bully&quot; 
  and attempted to take advantage of the Hunts' vulnerability is premised on the 
  improper assumption that they had a positive duty to capitulate to the Hunts' 
  demands in the first place. </p>
<p>
  [155] Parties are encouraged to settle actions where possible; the Rules of 
  Court impose cost sanctions on parties who fail to accept offers to settle that 
  are ultimately found to have been reasonable or who fail to make reasonable 
  concessions. However, there can be no suggestion, particularly in light of the 
  results on appeal, that the appellants did not have an arguable defence. </p>
<p>
  [156] In summary, even if I were to accept the trial judge's finding that the 
  appellants were in breach of their fiduciary duty to the Hunts, the facts of 
  this case do not justify a departure from the usual principle that a successful 
  party is entitled to its costs on a party and party basis. </p>
<p>
  2) Quantum of Costs</p>
<p>
  [157] In addition to arguing that the trial judge erred in awarding costs on 
  a solicitor and client scale, the appellants argue that the quantum of costs 
  awarded by the trial judge is excessive for the following reasons. </p>
<p class="indent"> a) He awarded costs for legal work performed by the Hunts' 
  son, Roger Hunt, whom they were not obliged to compensate;</p>
<p class="indent">b) He applied the wrong hourly rate for Roger Hunt;</p>
<p class="indent">c) There was excessive duplication of work by the three different 
  solicitors who had carriage of the case;</p>
<p class="indent">d) Mr. Neeb was granted the maximum counsel fees available under 
  the new costs grid notwithstanding that the trial judge had earlier ruled that 
  the new costs grid did not apply;</p>
<p class="indent">e) He allowed recovery for work performed by Mr. Wellhauser 
  at $350/hour, when the only evidence showed his rate to be $150/hour;</p>
<p class="indent">f) The amount claimed for disbursements was excessive; and, 
</p>
<p class="indent">g) The costs award exceeded the amount recovered so as to be 
  punitive. </p>

<p>
  (a) Costs for Roger Hunt</p>
<p>
  [158] The trial judge awarded the Hunts costs for legal work performed by their 
  son, Roger Hunt. Roger Hunt was the first of three lawyers to be involved on 
  behalf of the Hunts and he remained involved throughout the proceedings. The 
  appellants argue that the trial judge erred in awarding costs for Roger Hunt's 
  legal work because the Hunts had no obligation to pay their son for his work. 
  I agree.</p>
<p>
  [159] As the trial judge set out in his ruling, entitlement to costs depends 
  on there being an obligation on the part of the client to pay the solicitor. 
  The trial judge cited Clark v. Nash, [1990] B.C.J. No. 727 (C.A.), which held 
  that &quot;[t]he award of costs is an indemnification in relation to that obligation. 
  The costs cannot exceed the amount of the obligation.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [160] The trial judge found that the Hunts had an obligation to compensate their 
  son for the work he performed. He based this conclusion chiefly on a letter 
  from Roger Hunt to James Neeb, dated July 4, 2002. The letter was sent after 
  the release of the trial judgment in answer to Neeb's inquiries regarding Roger 
  Hunt's bill of costs. There was no retainer agreement between the Hunts and 
  their son. The letter purports to explain Roger Hunt's fee agreement and his 
  reason for not docketing his time. The key portion of the letter reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The time that was expended by me was not recorded because it 
  was agreed between Mr. Buck and myself that we would be paid for our legal services 
  on the successful completion of the action and in the event that the action 
  did not succeed, we would not seek recovery from Mel and Marion Hunt.</p>
<p class="indent">I agreed however that if costs were not recovered on the conclusion 
  of this matter from the Defendants, I personally would have to compensate Mr. 
  Buck for the loss of income that the firm suffered.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Buck and I further agreed that if we recorded the time expended 
  in the Hunt file on our computer system, the monthly reports of work in progress 
  that we file with the bank would be misleading to the bank and in the event 
  that the action did not succeed and the account was not billed to the Hunts, 
  we would be left with the position of reporting a substantial write off to our 
  bankers. </p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, I kept few, if any, detailed dockets.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Buck and I did however meet regularly to discuss the status 
  of the matter and it has always been our agreement that the substantial costs 
  to this firm of prosecuting this action would be recovered on the conclusion 
  of the action from the Defendants or from me. </p>
<p>
  [161] The trial judge found that this letter reflected an agreement between 
  Roger Hunt and his parents, that he would be compensated for his work if the 
  matter were successfully resolved. </p>
<p>
  [162] In my view, in the circumstances of this case, this letter is incapable 
  of establishing that Roger Hunt has any claim to compensation for his work and 
  cannot form the basis for awarding costs for the work performed by him on the 
  file. I base this conclusion on a number of factors.</p>
<p>
  [163] First, there is no indication in the letter of the nature of the fee agreement 
  between Roger Hunt and his parents. Rather, it describes an agreement between 
  Roger Hunt and Mr. Buck. </p>
<p>
  [164] Second, the nature of the alleged agreement between Roger Hunt and Mr. 
  Buck is inconsistent with Roger Hunt's failure to keep track of the time spent 
  on this matter. </p>
<p>
  [165] This inconsistency is not addressed by the suggestion that Roger Hunt's 
  time was not recorded because the firm would only seek compensation if the Hunts 
  succeeded at trial. If time spent is to be compensated in some fashion, it is 
  no less important to keep track of that time just because the solicitor defers 
  billing until after the result is determined.</p>
<p>
  [166] The failure to keep dockets is not always fatal to a claim for costs. 
  In this case, the absence of dockets is evidence that there was no obligation 
  on the Hunts to compensate their son for time spent on their matter.</p>
<p>
  [167] For these reasons, the trial judge erred in awarding costs for the work 
  performed by Roger Hunt. </p>
<p> b) Roger Hunt's Hourly Rate</p>
<p>
  [168] In light of the finding above, it is not necessary to settle the appropriate 
  hourly rate for Roger Hunt.</p>
<p>c) Excessive Duplication of Work</p>
<p>
  [169] Having found that costs do not properly include time spent by Roger Hunt, 
  any concern regarding duplication of work occasioned by the transfer of the 
  file from Roger Hunt to Mr. Wellhauser must disappear.</p>
<p>
  [170] As the trial judge noted, the Hunts were entitled to change counsel and 
  retain Mr. Neeb after completion of discoveries and before trial. The trial 
  judge reviewed the work performed and found that there was no evidence of time 
  wasted and that the work was well done and helpful to both the court and the 
  plaintiffs. There is no reason to interfere with these findings.</p>
<p>
  (d) Counsel fees for Mr. Neeb</p>
<p>
  [171] The trial judge awarded Mr. Neeb the counsel fee he claimed, which was 
  $4000 per day and $2500 per half-day. The trial judge noted that this was the 
  maximum allowed under the new costs grid and that there was no evidence before 
  him of the amounts being allowed for senior counsel for counsel fee prior to 
  the amendments to the rules.</p>
<p>
  [172] The appellants point out that this rate over-indemnified Mr. Neeb, given 
  his hourly rate of $350, and the fact that counsel fees were in addition to 
  fees claimed for preparation for trial. They further note that Mr. Neeb's standard 
  retainer form, which was used as the basis for establishing his hourly rate, 
  did not specify a &quot;per day&quot; or &quot;half day&quot; trial fee.</p>
<p>
  [173] I agree with the appellants that given the trial judge's ruling that the 
  new costs grid did not apply, which is in no way contested on this appeal, there 
  was no basis for awarding costs for work performed by Mr. Neeb beyond his usual 
  hourly rate.</p>
<p> (e) Mr. Wellhauser's Hourly Rate</p>
<p>
  [174] The trial judge awarded costs for the work performed by Mr. Wellhauser 
  at an hourly rate of $350. The appellants argue that this rate is excessive, 
  given that the only evidence before the court showed that Mr. Wellhauser had 
  billed the Hunts on an interim basis at the rate of $150/hour. </p>
<p>
  [175] In a letter from Mr. Wellhauser to Roger Hunt dated June 7, 1999, he indicated 
  that his final bill would be based on the total time involved and an &quot;appropriate 
  hourly rate reflecting the result achieved.&quot; The trial judge found that 
  this statement was not meant to indicate a contingency fee arrangement. Rather, 
  he said, it reflected the laudable practice of assisting clients in bringing 
  forward meritorious claims, by agreeing to charge a modest fee if the matter 
  did not succeed. </p>
<p>
  [176] While it may be that Mr. Wellhauser was entitled to charge a higher rate 
  for the work performed, there was a paucity of evidence before the trial judge 
  as to the nature of the fee agreement between Wellhauser and the Hunts. In my 
  view, the trial judge was not entitled to assign a rate of $350/hour on the 
  sole basis that that rate was requested by counsel for the Hunts. There must 
  be some evidence or objective basis on which to determine Mr. Wellhauser's fees.</p>
<p>
  (f) Excessive disbursements</p>
<p>
  [177] The appellants argue that the amount claimed for disbursements is excessive. 
  They specifically take issue with $6,200 for Mr. Davidson, and $4,180 for Mr. 
  Evans, who provided expert evidence at trial. </p>
<p>
  [178] The trial judge found that the amount claimed for Messrs. Davidson and 
  Evans was substantial but that their evidence was of substantial assistance 
  to him and necessary to pursuit of the Hunts' claim. The trial judge was in 
  the best position to assess the value of this evidence and the reasonableness 
  of the expense. There is no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge's 
  assessment in this regard. </p>
<p>g) Excessive Costs </p>
<p>
  [179] The respondents were awarded $156, 935.47 in costs, an amount more than 
  double the damages award. The appellants argue that, in light of the disparity 
  between the two sums, the costs award is punitive and should be reduced. </p>
<p>
  [180] The disparity will be substantially reduced once the results of the appeal 
  are factored in. Costs will no longer be on a solicitor and client basis. There 
  will be no recovery for Roger Hunt's work and compensation for Mssrs. Neeb and 
  Wellhauser will be reduced. These adjustments may render this ground of appeal 
  moot. I will, however, consider the submissions of the parties on the matter. 
  </p>
<p>
  [181] The respondents argue that while the proportion between costs and recovery 
  is one factor the courts may consider in exercising their discretion to award 
  costs, the courts have placed little weight on this factor where the defendants 
  have put the plaintiffs to strict proof of their case and the plaintiffs have 
  succeeded. The respondents cite Genah v. Reg Quinn Ltd (c.o.b. Canadian Tire), 
  [2002] O.J. No. 2832 (Sup. Ct. Jus.) in support of this argument. </p>
<p>
  [182] In Genah, Stinson J. considered whether costs of $33,012 were excessive 
  when compared to a recovery of $50,000. Stintson J. concluded that the extent 
  of costs was explained by the fact that the defendants' failure to admit liability 
  forced the plaintiff to deal with multiple sets of defence counsel. He found 
  that, under rule 57.01(1)(g), the defendants' refusal to make admissions was 
  a very significant factor. At para. 24, he concluded that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  the principal reason for the costs being as high as they are is the intransigence 
  of the defendant in not admitting liability and making a settlement offer at 
  an early stage of the proceeding. The plaintiffs should not have to pay the 
  costs of the defendant's intransigence.</p>
<p>
  [183] As set out above and is obvious from the disposition of this appeal, the 
  appellants were not intransigent. </p>
<p>
  [184] That said, I see no basis for interfering with the costs award on the 
  grounds that it was excessive.</p>
<p>
  [185] The issues at trial were complex and the plaintiffs were required to prove 
  their claims on each issue. The trial judge reviewed the work performed by counsel 
  and found that it was of high quality, necessary, and of assistance to him.</p>
<p>
  [186] The trial judge properly applied the principles approved by this court 
  in Murano v. Bank of Montreal (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 222 (C.A.), of the approach 
  to be taken by a judge in fixing costs, laid down by Feldman J. (as she then 
  was) in Tri-S Investments v. Vong, [1991] O.J. No. 2292 (Gen. Div). I would 
  not have interfered with determination of quantum solely on the basis that it 
  was excessive. </p>
<p>
  3) The Costs Award Remedy </p>
<p>
  [187] For the reasons given, the trial judge erred in a number of ways in the 
  costs award. That determination, however, does not resolve the question of how 
  costs at trial should be awarded.</p>
<p>
  [188] In general, where a party is successful on appeal, the costs award at 
  trial is set aside and the appellant is awarded costs at trial and on appeal; 
  the court has the discretion to depart from this principle in appropriate cases. 
  See Kopij v. Toronto (Metropolitan), [1999] O.J. No. 239 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [189] The appellants have been largely successful on appeal. Having succeeded 
  on the major issues of breach of fiduciary duty and the mitigation period, judgment 
  against them is reduced to the nominal transaction costs in selling the shares. 
  They were largely successful in the costs appeal, as well. However, the trial 
  judge's finding of breach of contract remains and, in that regard, the Hunts 
  succeeded at trial.</p>
<p>
  [190] Unfortunately, I am unable to decide the matter of the costs below at 
  this time. </p>
<p>
  [191] In their costs submissions, the parties failed to address the situation 
  that came to pass, namely, that the appellants were found to be in breach of 
  contract but were not in a fiduciary relationship with the respondents and that 
  damages are limited to transaction costs. Further, while the trial judge refers 
  to offers to settle, this court has not been provided with those offers and 
  has not received submissions on the relevance of those offers in light of the 
  result on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [192] If the parties are not able to agree on the issue of costs at trial, they 
  shall make brief written submissions on the same no later than twenty days from 
  the date of release of these reasons.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [193] In summary, I have concluded that: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The relationship between the appellants and the Hunts was 
  contractual in nature. It was not a fiduciary relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Schram committed a breach of contract in selling the Hunts' 
  BCE shares on March 3, 1997, without authorization.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Hunts did not ratify the sale.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Hunts had a duty to mitigate by purchasing like shares 
  by April 2, 1997.</p>
<p class="indent">5. The Hunts are entitled to damages arising from the breach. 
  As the price of BCE shares was found to have dropped in the two months following 
  their sale, there was no loss in the value of the shares. The Hunts are to be 
  compensated for the other losses that flowed directly from the breach, namely: 
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> capital gains tax paid on the sale of the BCE shares,</li>
      <li> transaction costs and commissions paid on the sale of the shares,</li>
      <li> transaction costs and commissions paid on the purchase of Chrysler 
        and CIBC shares.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="indent"> 6. The costs award below is set aside. Failing agreement between 
  the parties on the matter, they are to make brief written submissions on the 
  same within twenty days of the date of release of these reasons. </p>
<p>
  [194] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed on issue #1 (fiduciary duty) and, in 
  part, on issue #3 (the mitigation period). The costs appeal is allowed in part. 
  The cross appeal is dismissed. Costs to the appellant fixed in the sum of $7,500, 
  inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
