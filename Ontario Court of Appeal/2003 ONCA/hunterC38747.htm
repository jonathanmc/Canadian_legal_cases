<p>On appeal from the order of Justice L. Snowie of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated August 1, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: April 30, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals the decision of the motions judge striking out her 
  statement of claim under rule 21.01 1(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure as 
  disclosing no reasonable cause of action against any of the respondents. <br>
  <br>
  [2] In her pleading, the appellant advances several claims against the respondents, 
  including malicious prosecution, conspiracy, improper prosecutorial and police 
  conduct (presumably amounting to abuse of process or public office), perjury 
  and obstruction of justice. Although the motions judge referred in her decision 
  to evidence regarding the trial proceedings against the appellant, our review 
  is confined strictly to the appellant's pleading.<br>
  <br>
  [3] We agree with the conclusion by the motions judge that the pleading contains 
  several fatal deficiencies. First, and most importantly, it fails to set out 
  all of the necessary elements of the asserted claims of malicious prosecution 
  and conspiracy. <br>
  <br>
  [4] Second, it also fails to set out material facts sufficient to support the 
  asserted causes of action. <br>
  <br>
  [5] Third, many of the allegations in the pleading are simply conjecture, assumptions 
  or speculation unsupported by material facts. In other instances, mere conclusions 
  of law are asserted. <br>
  <br>
  [6] Accordingly, in our view, there is no basis upon which to interfere with 
  the motions judge's decision, and the appeal is dismissed. The respondents are 
  entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed in 
  the amount of $2,000 in connection with Frank Faveri and the Ontario Ministry 
  of the Attorney General, and the further amount of $2,000 in connection with 
  Bev Bravener and Peel Regional Police Services, inclusive of disbursements and 
  Goods and Services Tax.</p>
