<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Robert G.S. Del Frate of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 21, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The Appellant, Kingsway General Insurance Company (&quot;Kingsway&quot;) 
  appeals the decision of Justice Robert G.S. Del Frate of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 21, 2002 made pursuant to Rule 22, the determination 
  of an issue prior to trial, on an Agreed Statement of Facts. The motion judge 
  held that the respondents' newly acquired vehicle was insured by Kingsway as 
  &quot;an additional automobile&quot; and that as a result Kingsway was obliged 
  to defend and indemnify the respondents, Gerry Kozowy (&quot;Kozowy&quot;) and 
  Bruce Thompson (&quot;Thompson&quot;). This appeal arises from the motion judge's 
  interpretation of section 2.2.1 of the Standard Ontario Automobile Policy. </p>
<p>
  [2] Section 2.2.1 reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> A newly acquired automobile is an automobile or trailer that 
  you acquire as owner and that is not covered under any other policy. It can 
  either be a replacement or an additional automobile. The replacement automobile 
  will have the same coverage as the described automobile it replaces. We will 
  cover an additional automobile as long as:</p>
<p class="indent">we insure all automobiles you own, and</p>
<p class="indent">any claim you make for the additional automobile is made against 
  a coverage we provide for all your other automobiles.</p>
<p class="indent">Your newly acquired automobile(s) will be insured as long as 
  you inform us within 14 days from the time of delivery and pay any additional 
  premium required.</p>
<p>
  [3] Subsequent to the decision being rendered and an appeal being filed the 
  parties agreed on a new fact that was not before the application judge. </p>
<p>
  [4] The agreed facts with the new fact highlighted in bold is as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Gerry Kozowy purchased a 1992 G.M.C. pick-up truck from 
  Eastside Automart Ltd. in Kenora on August 22, 1996 for the sum of $16,500.00.</p>
<p class="indent">2. At the time of the purchase Ms. Kozowy had a valid policy 
  of motor vehicle insurance with Kingsway General Insurance bearing policy # 
  169735 said policy insuring a 1988 Ford Aerostar mini van.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Kingsway General Insurance did not insure all of the automobiles 
  owned by Ms. Kozowy as she also owned a 1991 Ford &frac12; ton pick-up truck 
  that was NOT insured by Kingsway General Insurance Company.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The said 1991 Ford &frac12; ton pick-up truck was in operable 
  condition and was not insured by any insurance company as of September 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="indent">5. On September 1, 1996, Ms. Kozowy's 1992 G.M.C. pick-up was 
  involved in a single vehicle accident near Dryden, Ontario resulting in injuries 
  to Ms. Kavanaugh and the death of Mr. Hunter. At the time of the accident, the 
  Defendant, Bruce Thompson was operating the vehicle with Ms. Kozowy's consent.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Ms. Kozowy had not notified the insurer of her purchase of 
  the 1992 G.M.C. pick-up within 14 days of the purchase.</p>
<p class="indent">7. Ms. Kozowy purchased the vehicle as an additional vehicle 
  and not as a replacement vehicle. She intended to keep the Ford Aerostar van 
  on the road and insured.</p>
<p class="indent">8. Ms. Kozowy would have had to pay an additional premium for 
  the additional vehicle.</p>
<p>
  [5] On the statement of agreed facts before the motions judge the parties agreed 
  that the 1991 Ford truck was &quot;parked&quot;. There was no indication whether 
  the Ford truck was driveable and the motions judge refused to draw any inference 
  that it was. He held that the purpose of the requirement of having all vehicles 
  insured by the same insurer was to prevent any misunderstanding as to which 
  insurer ought to respond if the additional car is involved in an accident should 
  it become necessary. Here there is only one insurer. The motions judge further 
  held that since the accident had occurred within the 14-day notice period required 
  in the policy the additional vehicle was automatically insured. The original 
  insurance premium would necessarily include the risk of any additional coverage 
  for the 14-day notice period. </p>
<p>
  [6] On this appeal, in light of the newly agreed fact that the 1991 Ford was 
  operable, the focus of the argument was whether the precondition in s. 2.2.1 
  was met. The parties also made brief submissions on whether a newly acquired 
  automobile is automatically insured for fourteen days.</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondent submits that the words &quot;We insure all automobiles you 
  own&quot; should be read as having the words &quot; and that are insured&quot; 
  after them. We disagree that it is necessary to read in these words to give 
  effect to s. 2.2.1.</p>
<p>
  [8] On the facts we have now, the plain words of s. 2.2.1 require that the owner 
  insure with the insurer all of the automobiles he owns. If the insured owns 
  automobiles that he insures with another insurer or that he leaves uninsured, 
  the precondition is not met. </p>
<p>
  [9] There is nothing in the language of s. 2.2.1 to confine it to circumstances 
  whether there is another insurer. Because the 1991 Ford is operable it is an 
  &quot;automobile&quot; owned by the insured. (We do not know if the vehicle 
  was withdrawn from use so American authority to the effect that such a vehicle 
  is not an automobile for insurance liability purposes is inapplicable.) Since 
  that vehicle was not insured by the appellant the precondition in s. 2.2.1 was 
  not satisfied, and there is no insurance coverage on the newly acquired vehicle. 
  The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund must respond to the claim.</p>
<p>
  [10] We would not give effect to the argument that, if the precondition is met, 
  the automobile is not automatically insured for fourteen days under the policy. 
  Again, on the plain wording of s. 2.2.1 it is automatically insured for fourteen 
  days. </p>
<p>
  [11] The purpose of the precondition that all other vehicles be insured by the 
  same insurer is not entirely clear. It may be that if all other vehicles are 
  insured by the same insurer, there is a statutory inference that the insured 
  will also likely insure the newly acquired or replacement vehicle with the same 
  insurer thereby justifying the granting of a fourteen day period of coverage 
  under the existing policy.</p>
<p>
  [12] The change in the agreed facts and our conclusion on the new set of facts 
  require us to allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the motion judge and 
  in its place order that the appellant is not required to defend and to indemnify 
  the insured, and we so order. </p>
<p>
  [13] Counsel are agreed that the costs of the appeal should be fixed in the 
  amount of $5000. In our opinion these costs should include the costs of the 
  motion as well. As a result, we order that costs here and before the motions 
  judge be fixed in the amount of $5000 all inclusive payable to the appellant.</p>
