<p>GOUDGE J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This is a motion seeking leave to appeal to this court pursuant to the 
  provisions of s. 131 of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (the 
  POA).<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The applicants are corporate retailers who carry on two drug store operations 
  (known as Hy &amp; Zel's and Herbies) and a food convenience operation (known 
  as The Kitchen Table) and 25 retail employees.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] They were all charged with carrying on business on a proscribed holiday 
  contrary to the provisions of the Retail Business Holidays Act, S.O. 1990, c. 
  R.30, as amended (the RBHA).<br>
</p>
<p>[4] By agreement, the various charges were consolidated and tried together. 
  At trial defence counsel conceded that the retail businesses were in fact open 
  on the dates alleged, in violation of the RBHA. The only issue was the constitutional 
  validity of the RBHA as it stood following major amendments in 1993 and a smaller 
  amendment in 1996.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] At trial, Silverman J. heard considerable oral testimony and received a 
  great deal of affidavit evidence. In reasons which can most positively be described 
  as cryptic, he found that the RBHA contravened the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
  and as a result he stayed all charges.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The Crown appealed and McCombs J. found that the trial judge was required 
  by binding authority to uphold the constitutionality of the RBHA. He therefore 
  allowed the appeal and, since it was conceded that the applicants disputed no 
  other issues, he found them guilty as charged, and imposed fines on the corporate 
  applicants but stayed the sentences against the individual applicants.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The applicants seek leave to appeal both the finding of guilt and sentence. 
  Section 131 of the POA permits leave to be granted on a question of law alone 
  or as to sentence, provided it is considered essential in the public interest 
  or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] Turning first to the finding of guilt, whether the RBHA as amended, violates 
  the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is clearly a question of law. The applicants' 
  challenge focuses on s. 2(8) and s. 15, and to a much lesser extent s.7.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] Whether leave is required in the public interest or for the due administration 
  of justice is a more difficult question.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The Crown argues that the constitutionality of the RBHA has been tested 
  so often that the result of this challenge will be a forgone conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The history of these challenges is well known. The first culminated in 
  R. v. Edwards Books (1986), 2 S.C.R. 713. At that time the RBHA provided for 
  60 designated holidays namely every Sunday and eight other specified days. It 
  also had a narrow Sabatarian exemption. The challenge failed because the Supreme 
  Court of Canada held that the legislation did not violate s. 7 and that although 
  it did violate s. 2(a), the narrow Sabatarian exemption was enough to save it 
  under s. 1.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] In R. v. Paul Magder (1989), 16 O.R. (2d) 172 (Ont. C.A.) the same iteration 
  of the RBHA was found not to violate s. 15. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court 
  of Canada was denied.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] In Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Greater Atlantic and Pacific Co. of 
  Canada Ltd. (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 65 a second iteration of the RBHA was tested. 
  There had been a number of changes to the legislation since Edwards Books, but 
  primary among them was the Sabatarian exemption, which had been significantly 
  broadened. The Crown successfully argued in this court that as a result of these 
  amendments the RBHA was less threatening to freedom of religion and there was 
  now no breach of s. 2(a). Equally, the challenge to this iteration of the RBHA 
  based on s. 7 and s. 15 failed.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Leave to appeal was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada. The case proceeded 
  to that court styled as Hy and Zel's Inc. v. Ontario (A.G.) with constitutional 
  questions were stated by the court addressing the alleged violations of s. 2(a) 
  and s. 15, but not s. 7. However, the ultimate decision reported at [1993] 2 
  S.C.R. 675 did not address these questions. Rather it dismissed the appeal because 
  the appellants lacked standing. In the course of doing so Major J. writing for 
  the majority said this at paragraph 14:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The validity of holiday shopping legislation has been 
  challenged on many occasions. In Edwards Books, the Act was held to violate 
  s. 2(a) of the Charter but was a reasonable limit under s. 1. The present action 
  challenges amendments intended to eliminate the s 2(a) violation found. For 
  the purposes of these reasons only, I am prepared to assume that the numerous 
  amendments have sufficiently altered the Act in the seven years since Edward 
  Books so that the Act's validity is no longer a foregone conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] A third iteration of the RBHA was created by amendments in 1993 and 1996, 
  which remove all Sundays except Easter Sunday and Boxing Day as designated holidays. 
  I will refer to this as the 1993 version. The Crown argues that as a result 
  of these amendments the RBHA is now even more benign in relation to freedom 
  of religion. In other words, the Crown says that the constitutionality of the 
  1993 version is axiomatic.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] While there would seem to be considerable force in this argument, there 
  are a number of considerations that, in my view, make it important in the public 
  interest and for the due administration of justice that this question of law 
  be answered by this Court.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] First, while the second iteration of the RBHA was validated by this court 
  in Peel, supra, the challenge to the constitutionality of the amendments creating 
  this iteration raised issues of sufficient public importance that the Supreme 
  Court of Canada granted leave to appeal. Despite upholding the first iteration 
  in Edwards Books and Madger Furs, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada stated 
  constitutional questions asking whether the RBHA as changed by these amendments 
  violated sections 2(a) and 15 of the Charter. In disposing of that appeal Major 
  J. was prepared to assume for the purposes of his reasons that these numerous 
  amendments sufficiently altered the RBHA that even though they were intended 
  to increase compliance with the Charter the Act's validity was no longer a forgone 
  conclusion. Ultimately, however, the Supreme Court of Canada did not answer 
  the constitutional questions posed. Moreover, these amendments, particularly 
  the new Sabatarian exemption, all remain in the 1993 version. This history leaves 
  something of an unresolved constitutional question mark surrounding those amendments 
  in the face of the applicant's attack, based as it is on ss. 2(a) and 15, the 
  same sections which underpinned the unanswered questions in Hy and Zel's.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Second, not since 1991 in Peel, supra, has the RBHA been tested against 
  s. 15 of the Charter. As I have said, the Supreme Court of Canada granted leave 
  on this issue but did not decide it. Moreover, although it may not be relevant 
  to the s. 15 argument, the 1993 version is quite different from the second iteration 
  scrutinized in Peel. Most important however the equality analysis required by 
  s. 15 has evolved significantly over the years. As the Supreme Court of Canada 
  said in Law v. Canada, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 at 508:</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, in the brief history of this Court's interpretation 
  of s. 15(1) of the Charter, there have been several important substantive developments 
  in equality law, relating to, among other things, the meaning of adverse effects 
  discrimination, the role of context in identifying discrimination more generally, 
  and the indicia of an analogous ground.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] This evolution in equality law adds another question mark to the constitutional 
  validity of the 1993 version of the RBHA in the face of the applicant's s. 15 
  challenge. <br>
</p>
<p>[20] Third, while the difference in the quality of their reasons is palpable, 
  the two judges who have given their views in this case have come to opposite 
  conclusions on the constitutional issue presented by this case.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] Fourth, as the appeal judge made clear in his reasons for sentence, he 
  rejected the Crown's submission that this case should not be treated as a test 
  case. Had it begun as an application for a declaration of unconstitutionality, 
  as test cases often do, the applicants would have had the right to a decision 
  of a panel of this court on the ultimate question not just the view of a single 
  judge of this court on a leave application. Given that this is a test case about 
  the constitutionality of legislation, the applicant's ability to have a full 
  panel adjudicate the question should not be significantly affected by the route 
  the case has taken to get to this court. <br>
</p>
<p>[22] In summary, the unique history of this legislation arguably leaves some 
  uncertainty surrounding the validity of the 1993 version of the RBHA when tested 
  against s. 2(a) and s. 15 of the Charter. The same cannot be said for the challenge 
  based on s. 7 where nothing has arisen to disturb the finality of the decision 
  in Peel, supra.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] Ultimately, I think that in light of this history, the circumstances of 
  this particular case and the underlying importance of assuring the constitutionality 
  of legislation, any uncertainties surrounding the validity of the RBHA as amended 
  should be resolved head on by a panel of this court not by a single judge on 
  a leave application.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] I conclude therefore that it is essential in the public interest and for 
  the due administration of justice that leave to appeal from conviction be granted 
  on the question of whether the RBHA as amended infringes s. 2(a) or s. 15 of 
  the Charter and if so, whether it can be saved pursuant to s. 1.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] However, I can see no similar imperative behind the request to appeal 
  sentence. Indeed, this issue was not pressed in argument by the applicants. 
  Nevertheless, since the matter is proceeding as a test case, I would suspend 
  the sentences until the appeal is disposed of.<br>
