<p>On appeal from the order of Justice I.M. Gordon of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated February 19, 2002. <br>
</p>
<p>CARTHY J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The bankrupt company appeals from the dismissal by Gordon J. of its motion 
  to annul the bankruptcy.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Section 181(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 
  reads:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">181. (1) Where, in the opinion of the court, a receiving 
  order ought not to have been made or an assignment ought not to have been filed, 
  the court may by order annul the bankruptcy.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Hydra-Dyne was a substantial private company with over one hundred employees 
  and gross revenue of over $11 million dollars. Its president and principal shareholder 
  was Walter Dynes. In May of 2001, the National Bank of Canada called upon the 
  company for immediate repayment of over $1.8 million then owing to the bank. 
  The bank then entered into a forbearance agreement to give the company an opportunity 
  to obtain a replacement financing facility and had in the meantime installed 
  KPMG as a business monitor. In September the bank gave notice of defaults in 
  the forbearance agreement, including a failure to remit source deductions and 
  G.S.T. to the federal government and margin defaults to the bank. When these 
  defaults were not cured, the bank terminated its forbearance agreement and took 
  steps to close down the business. KPMG prepared and presented to Walter Dynes 
  the documentation for an assignment for the general benefit of creditors, including 
  a statement showing the assets and debts of the company. These were signed by 
  Dynes on November 6, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Section 49 of the Act reads in part: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">49. (1) An insolvent person or, if deceased, his legal 
  personal representative with the leave of the court, may make an assignment 
  of all his property for the general benefit of his creditors.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The assignment made under subsection (1) shall be 
  accompanied by a sworn statement in the prescribed form showing the property 
  of the debtor divisible among his creditors, the names and addresses of all 
  his creditors and the amounts of their respective claims and the nature of each, 
  whether secured, preferred or unsecured.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Dynes signed this document in the presence of the KPMG representative, 
  Stephen Cherniak, who then returned to his office to have a commissioner for 
  taking affidavits complete the jurat. The &quot;affidavit&quot; was then presented 
  to the Official Receiver and a trustee appointed.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] A motion followed to annul the bankruptcy alleging that the statement of 
  affairs was not properly sworn and did not accurately express the financial 
  position of the company, that it was not bankrupt, that Dynes had no authority 
  to sign on behalf of the company, that Dynes acted under duress, and that the 
  procedure followed was an abuse of process. These arguments were all pursued 
  before this court.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Justice Gordon recited the facts in far more detail than I have found necessary 
  and concluded at paragraph 61 of his reasons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[61] In summary, Hydra-Dyne was insolvent and there 
  is no abuse of process. Mr. Dynes has not satisfied the court there was lack 
  of appreciation of the nature and effect of the documents he signed nor was 
  there duress beyond the normal stress of financial insolvency. That Mr. Dynes 
  held himself out as able to bind the company is clear and in addition the director 
  or directors by their signatures knew that he signed for the company on major 
  banking documents. They cannot now come to the court and deny his authority. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[8] These conclusions are fully supported by the evidence and the only ground 
  which gives this court reason to hesitate is that based on the failure to swear 
  the affidavit before a Commissioner.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] It is a thin excuse for the KPMG representative to say that he was unaware 
  of the necessity for the commissioner to be present to swear the affidavit. 
  That requirement is plain on the face of the document. Further, the affidavit 
  is a document which initiates a judicial process and is relied upon as the foundation 
  of that process. A casual approach to the integrity of the document reflects 
  upon the process and should not be tolerated.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Having said that, the focus of the jurisprudence dealing with annulment 
  has been on the conduct of the debtor and the solvency of the debtor, giving 
  the motion judge a wide discretion to deal with the particular circumstances 
  of the instant case. See: Re: Bateman (1998), 10 C.B.R. (4th) 197 at 199-200 
  (N.S.S.C.); Re: Wale, [1996] O.J. No. 4489 at 4 (Gen. Div.); and Columbia Properties 
  Ltd. v. Commonwealth Mtge Corpn. (1964), 6 C.B.R. (N.S.) 321 at 325 (B.C.C.A.). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[11] In this case, Justice Gordon found that the statement of affairs contained 
  no substantial errors and that the debtor was clearly insolvent. It would defeat 
  that purpose of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act directed at protection of 
  creditors to now annul the bankruptcy and, thus, I would in this case agree 
  with the motion judge that no substantial injustice has been caused by the impropriety 
  in execution of the affidavit, or to put the converse, there would be an injustice 
  to the creditors to order annulment.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] I would therefore dismiss the appeal and also dismiss the cross-appeal 
  that seeks alternatively a declaration as to Dyne's authority to sign for the 
  company. No time in argument was devoted to the cross-appeal and it should be 
  dismissed without costs. The respondent should recover the costs of the appeal 
  fixed on a partial indemnity basis at $12,000 plus disbursements of $446.15 
  plus G.S.T., offset by $4,000 plus G.S.T. payable to the appellant for the motion 
  for security for costs.<br>
