<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice C.N. Herold of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 2, 1996.</p><p>
  GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] On August 22, 1994 the appellant killed her two sons. One boy was two years 
  old. The other was four. She beat them with a hammer and asphyxiated them with 
  plastic grocery bags. </p><p>
  [2] On May 2, 1996 the appellant was convicted of two counts of murder, having 
  instructed her counsel not to raise as a defence that she was not criminally 
  responsible on account of mental disorder. </p><p>
  [3] On her appeal from conviction, the only argument she makes is based on the 
  fresh evidence tendered in this court that not only is her present diagnosis 
  that of paranoid schizophrenia, but also that at the time she killed her sons 
  she was suffering from the effects of a severe paranoid psychosis and as a result 
  was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of her acts or of knowing 
  that those acts were wrong. She asks this court to set aside her conviction 
  and substitute the finding that she was not criminally responsible on account 
  of mental disorder (NCRMD).</p><p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow I would accept that argument, allow the appeal, 
  quash the conviction and find the appellant not criminally responsible on account 
  of mental disorder.</p><p>
  THE TRIAL</p><p>
  [5] The appellant was born on May 19, 1958. She had a very difficult childhood. 
  Her mother suffered from delusions and was hospitalized for a period of time 
  as a result of her mental health problems.</p><p>
  [6] The appellant met B. M. while at high school. They were married in 1979 
  but their relationship was not happy and they were divorced the next year. The 
  appellant pursued her own life until 1989 when, after several sessions with 
  a psychiatrist, she contacted B. M. again and they revived their relationship. 
  In 1989, they moved in together. Their two sons were born on March 1, 1990 and 
  October 3, 1991.</p><p>
  [7] By the summer of 1993, the relationship had deteriorated significantly. 
  On August 9, 1993 B. M. was incarcerated to serve a sentence for importing narcotics.</p><p>
  [8] In the same month, events took place which resulted in Mr. M.'s conviction 
  on January 27, 1994 for sexually assaulting the appellant and uttering death 
  threats to her. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.</p><p>
  [9] On December 11, 1993 the appellant attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping 
  pills. On December 16, 1993 she was diagnosed by her family doctor as suffering 
  from anxiety, depression and delusions of persecution. The doctor also noted 
  that she may be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. </p><p>
  [10] On December 21, 1993 the appellant was granted full custody of her sons 
  with Mr. M. being given visitation rights.</p><p>
  [11] Through the first eight months of 1994 the appellant expressed the fear 
  that Mr. M. was going to kill her and take the children away once he was released 
  from prison, or would send someone to do so while he remained in prison. She 
  told her close friend that she was being watched and spied upon, and that she 
  believed her car was being tampered with.</p><p>
  [12] Despite all this, many witnesses testified that the appellant was a very 
  good mother who devoted herself to her sons.</p><p>
  [13] By the summer of 1994, the appellant believed that events were building 
  to a climax. She began to think that Satanists might also be involved. She felt 
  that people were going to take her children and that she was going to die. </p><p>
  [14] In August 1994, she quit her job as an insurance broker which she had held 
  for four months. She also cancelled both her life insurance policies. On the 
  weekend of August 20/21 she took her sons to a nearby conservation area to camp, 
  although she appeared very ill prepared to do so. On Sunday night, August 21, 
  she checked into a local motel. The next morning, the bodies of her sons were 
  found in the motel room a short time after the appellant had been rescued while 
  attempting to commit suicide by setting herself and her car on fire a short 
  distance from the motel.</p><p>
  [15] The Crown's theory at trial was that the appellant killed her sons and 
  attempted to commit suicide because of her anger at her husband and her fear 
  of his taking the children away.</p><p>
  [16] The defence position at trial was that while the appellant was admittedly 
  guilty of manslaughter, she lacked the specific intent necessary to be convicted 
  of murder.</p><p>
  [17] The appellant did not testify. However, the defence did call Dr. Ben-Aron 
  who gave the only psychiatric evidence at trial. He had been retained by the 
  defence in early September 1994, shortly after the appellant was charged. He 
  interviewed her on seven occasions between then and March 1995. While his report 
  to defence counsel began with his determination that she met the threshold required 
  for fitness to stand trial, its major thrust was his opinion that her mental 
  state at the time was so impaired that she did not have the capacity to form 
  the specific intent to do the acts which caused the boys' death. In addition, 
  however, his report also gave his opinion that it could be argued that the appellant 
  was suffering from a mental disorder at the time she killed her sons and as 
  a result was not able to appreciate what she was doing.</p><p>
  [18] At trial, Dr. Ben-Aron was directed not to base his evidence on his interviews 
  with the appellant, since she had decided not to testify. Rather he gave his 
  evidence on the basis of hypothetical facts and the evidence of a number of 
  other witnesses for whom he had been present. His testimony concerned the appellant's 
  mental state at the time of the killing and its possible effect on her capacity 
  to form the specific intent required for murder. He said that the appellant 
  suffered from a major mental illness, namely a type of psychotic illness which 
  was a delusional disorder presenting a schizophrenic-like picture. He testified 
  that this could have significantly impaired her ability to form the intent to 
  do a specific act. However, his evidence was that he could not say that as a 
  result of her mental illness she lacked the necessary specific intent for murder, 
  but only that in his opinion this was a very real possibility.</p><p>
  [19] Dr. Ben-Aron gave no evidence at trial directed to the criteria for the 
  NCRMD defence set out in s. 16 of the Criminal Code. He did not address whether 
  the appellant's mental disorder rendered her incapable of appreciating the nature 
  and quality of the acts of killing her sons or of knowing that they were wrong.</p><p>
  [20] As I have said, at the conclusion of the trial the jury convicted the appellant 
  of two counts of second degree murder. It then went on to make a collective 
  recommendation that the appellant be eligible for parole after 10 years.</p><p>
  [21] On two occasions during the course of the trial, the trial judge made statements 
  both of which provide additional background for the fresh evidence application.</p><p>
  [22] The first occurred part way through the trial, when defence counsel asked 
  for a short adjournment to permit Dr. Ben-Aron to meet again with the appellant 
  to determine if she remained fit to stand trial. Dr. Ben-Aron did so and concluded 
  that in his opinion the appellant still met the threshold for fitness. However, 
  in granting the adjournment the trial judge made the following statement in 
  the absence of the jury:</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: This may then be an appropriate time for me to record, 
  in the absence of the jury, some observations that I have made since this trial 
  began and which have caused me, throughout the entire course of the trial, some 
  concern, which concern was alleviated to some substantial extent by the knowledge 
  that both Crown and defence have been and will, I am sure, continue to act responsibly 
  and bring matters to my attention as it becomes necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">The concern that I have had however, is this; and I make these 
  observations knowing that [I. M.] was present throughout the course of a very 
  thorough and comprehensive preliminary inquiry and is not hearing this evidence 
  even in a court room setting for the first time, that she has been given access 
  to substantial and complete Crown disclosure and that none of what we are hearing 
  at this trial is new to her. I readily acknowledge that this fact makes it somewhat 
  different than the response of others who are hearing it for the first time. 
</p>
<p class="indent">Even bearing that in mind, however, the demeanour of [I. M.] 
  since the trial began has been, for me at least, extremely unsettling. [I. M.] 
  has, throughout the course of the trial, sat in the prisoner's box directly 
  across from me and has had an expression which I cannot adequately describe 
  other than to state that - at the risk of appearing frivolous - she appears 
  to be sitting waiting for a tennis game to begin, and not even a terribly consequential 
  game at that.</p>
<p class="indent">She has had on her face a very benign expression with her mouth 
  in the form of a half-smile throughout the entire course of the proceedings 
  and has expressed absolutely no indication of reaction to the proceedings or 
  the evidence in the proceedings as it has gone in, whether the evidence is of 
  a somewhat non-controversial matter or whether it is, for example, the evidence 
  of pathologists and coroners. There has been absolutely no change in her extremely 
  unexpressive expression.</p>
<p class="indent">The only flicker of change that I have observed has been from 
  time to time when Mr. Silver has stood to begin a cross-examination, and it 
  has not necessarily been with respect to consequential witnesses in the sense 
  that the evidence would be expected to be controversial, when the expression, 
  as I can best describe it, appears to be along the lines of, 'I wonder what 
  he's going to ask this witness.' That expression lasts for, at the most, 20 
  or 30 seconds and then [I. M.] returns to the expressionless expression with 
  a slight smile that has otherwise been present.</p>
<p class="indent">I also note and have noted that the jury, at least from my vantage 
  point, appears to have developed a habit of not looking at [I. M.], even during 
  the course of some controversial evidence; perhaps, I have concluded, because 
  they too have had an eerie sense of unease in observing this expression, or 
  lack of expression.</p>
<p class="indent">I simply make those observations because, as I say, I have had 
  the concerns since almost the outset of the trial but have elected to keep them 
  to myself until such time as this matter has, as I suspected it might, arisen. 
  I simply put those observations on the record now.</p>
<p>
  [23] Then in sentencing the appellant, the trial judge said this:</p>
<p class="indent"> Two of the factors that weigh most heavily in favour of the 
  accused are her mental illness, the extent of which may never be known, at least 
  to the triers of fact and to me, but may eventually be known to the authorities 
  in prison. The mental illness of I. M., which is amply demonstrated not only 
  by the evidence of Dr. Ben-Aron which was not challenged, quite appropriately 
  in my view, but also the evidence of numerous Crown witnesses who gave evidence 
  of circumstances which had to have the jury from the first ten minutes of the 
  trial, wondering when and if the issue of &quot;not criminally responsible&quot; 
  would be raised.</p>
<p class="indent">As I indicated during the course of submissions, the accused 
  has exercised her Charter right not to avoid criminal responsibility on the 
  basis of mental disorder, and indeed, one may now never know whether or not 
  her mental illness would have gotten past the hurdle in any event. However, 
  the fact of her mental illness and the substantial nature of it, cannot be ignored, 
  nor can the evidence of Dr. Ben-Aron which indicates quite clearly that while 
  the mental illness is not an excuse, it is an explanation and probably the only 
  explanation that we will ever have for this tragic event. </p>
<p>THE FRESH EVIDENCE</p><p>
  [24] The fresh evidence tendered by the appellant in this court has four components: 
  an affidavit from each of the appellant, Dr. Ben-Aron, and defence counsel at 
  trial and the appellant's institutional and medical records over her past six 
  and one-half years in custody. The Crown cross-examined the appellant and Dr. 
  Ben-Aron at length but tendered no fresh evidence of its own. </p><p>
  [25] The appellant's fresh evidence is that against the advice of her counsel 
  she refused to permit him to raise the NCRMD defence and was adamant that she 
  would not testify at trial. She says that at that time she did not believe that 
  she suffered from a mental illness and did not want to go to a mental hospital.</p><p>
  [26] She discusses in some detail her tortured relationship with Mr. M., the 
  events leading up to the killing of her sons and her highly disturbed mental 
  state at that time. When she killed them she felt that she was trying to save 
  them from the hit man that she believed had been sent by her husband to kill 
  her and take her children away to be tortured and executed. She says that at 
  the time she thought it was the right thing, but did not appreciate what she 
  was doing.</p><p>
  [27] She describes how her mental health became even worse in prison until in 
  1999 she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was declared incapable 
  of consenting to treatment. She was then given anti-psychotic medication and 
  as a result has improved significantly and wishes to raise the NCRMD defence 
  in this court.</p><p>
  [28] She concludes her affidavit by saying that had she been treated with anti-psychotic 
  medication at the time of the trial, she is confident that she would have decided 
  differently and would have raised this defence.</p><p>
  [29] Dr. Ben-Aron's fresh evidence confirms that because of the appellant's 
  instructions to counsel, he was not asked to speak to the NCRMD defence at trial. 
  He makes clear that at that time, his view was that the appellant had such a 
  defence and he says that now with the additional insight he has derived from 
  the medical records about the appellant over the last six and one-half years, 
  he holds this opinion even more strongly. His affidavit states his opinion in 
  this categorical language:</p>
<p class="indent"> 6. It is my opinion that at the time that she killed her two 
  sons, the Applicant was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of 
  her acts or of knowing that those acts were wrong. The Applicant was clearly 
  suffering from the effects of a severe paranoid psychosis at the time of the 
  death of her sons.</p>
<p>
  [30] Dr. Ben-Aron concludes his affidavit by saying that in his opinion the 
  change in the appellant's instructions concerning the NCRMD defence is explained 
  as a result of the improvement caused by success in the treatment of her mental 
  illness.</p><p>
  [31] The fresh evidence from defence counsel makes clear that he was of the 
  opinion that an NCRMD verdict was quite possible on the evidence and that he 
  had recommended to the appellant that it be advanced but that she had adamantly 
  refused to allow it. Moreover, she was equally adamant in refusing to testify 
  which, in counsel's view, prevented a proper foundation from being laid for 
  the defence in any event.</p><p>
  [32] Before us, the appellant argues that the fresh evidence meets the criteria 
  set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 and that we should admit 
  it, set aside the conviction and substitute a verdict of not criminally responsible 
  on account of mental disorder.</p><p>
  [33] The Crown responds by contesting that the Palmer criteria are met and saying 
  that in any event the appellant made a tactical decision to waive the NCRMD 
  defence at trial and should not now be permitted to resile from that decision.</p><p>
  ANALYSIS</p><p>
  [34] The well-known criteria for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal were 
  laid out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Palmer at p. 775:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due 
  diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle 
  will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see McMartin 
  v. The Queen.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears 
  upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably 
  capable of belief, and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when 
  taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected 
  the result.</p>
<p>
  [35] Turning first to the due diligence criterion, there is no doubt that at 
  the time of trial Dr. Ben-Aron had formed the opinion that the appellant's mental 
  disorder made her incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of her acts 
  or of knowing that they were wrong. However, the appellant has explained that 
  she firmly instructed that this evidence not be led because she was then suffering 
  from a major but untreated mental illness. Dr. Ben-Aron confirms this. In my 
  view, it is clear that given the appellant's medical condition at the time, 
  the psychiatric evidence could not have been adduced at trial by due diligence. 
  </p><p>
  [36] Even if this were not so, I would not find a failure to satisfy this criterion 
  to be a bar to admitting the fresh evidence in this case. It is clear that where 
  the fresh psychiatric evidence is compelling and the interests of justice require 
  that it be admitted, the failure to meet the due diligence criterion should 
  yield to permit its admission. That is particularly so where, as here, the fresh 
  evidence raises for the first time the NCRMD defence, because that brings to 
  the analysis the principle of fundamental justice that a person who was not 
  criminally responsible at the time of the offence should not be convicted. See 
  R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579.</p><p>
  [37] There is no doubt that the fresh evidence satisfies the criterion of relevance. 
  The NCRMD defence speaks to a potentially decisive issue in the appellant's 
  trial.</p><p>
  [38] Moreover, it is apparent that the fresh evidence is reasonably capable 
  of belief by a trier of fact. Dr. Ben-Aron's evidence is clear and categorical. 
  It is founded on his interviews with the appellant, information from other witnesses 
  and her medical records. The Crown does not attack his credibility.</p><p>
  [39] The Crown points to several inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence. 
  However, they relate to her present descriptions of her beliefs and delusions 
  during that clouded period when her paranoid schizophrenia remained untreated. 
  They do not render her evidence incapable of belief. </p><p>
  [40] Finally, the Crown argues that the fresh evidence does not meet the fourth 
  criterion. The Crown says that the jury would necessarily have rejected the 
  NCRMD defence because it found that her assertion that because of her mental 
  illness she lacked the specific intention to commit murder did not raise a reasonable 
  doubt.</p><p>
  [41] There are two answers to this. First what Palmer requires is that the fresh 
  evidence if believed could reasonably be expected to have affected the result. 
  As I have said, the fresh evidence is clearly capable of belief. Once believed, 
  the potential effect of this evidence on the result is not hard to see.</p><p>
  [42] Second, and more important, the NCRMD defence now put forward is quite 
  distinct from the defence advanced at trial. The jury's conclusion that despite 
  her mental illness the appellant had the specific intention to do the acts for 
  which she was convicted does not mean that a jury acting reasonably would reject 
  the fresh evidence that as a result of her mental illness, she was incapable 
  of appreciating the nature and quality of her acts or of knowing that they were 
  wrong. The fresh evidence simply addresses a different issue; especially as 
  that evidence concerns whether the appellant knew her acts were wrong. See R. 
  v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303 at paras. 25-26.</p><p>
  [43] Hence I conclude that the fresh evidence put forward by the appellant satisfies 
  the Palmer criteria and should be admitted on appeal.</p><p>
  [44] The Crown also argues that the appellant made a rational decision at trial 
  to waive the NCRMD defence and should not now be permitted to resile from this 
  decision.</p><p>
  [45] I disagree. The fresh evidence demonstrates that the appellant's decision 
  at trial was a product not of tactics but of her untreated mental illness. As 
  is made clear in Warsing, supra, the special nature of the NCRMD defence requires 
  a more flexible approach to the principle that a defence disavowed at trial 
  cannot normally be raised on appeal. This case represents the prototypical risk: 
  that the mental disorder which would found an NCRMD defence could also significantly 
  impair the judgment of an accused at trial. In Warsing Major J. put it this 
  way at para. 59:</p>
<p class="indent"> While an accused is seldom allowed to &quot;hold back&quot; 
  a defence in anticipation of using it on appeal if convicted, Swain provides 
  that option and confirms that the policy concerns about raising an NCRMD defence 
  for the first time on appeal are not stringent because of the nature of the 
  defence of NCRMD. Swain confirms that it is a principle of fundamental justice 
  that a person who was not criminally responsible at the time of the offence 
  should not be convicted.</p>
<p>
  [46] Finally, there remains the matter of remedy. Section 686(1)(d) of the Criminal 
  Court gives this court the jurisdiction to set aside a conviction and find the 
  appellant not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. Indeed when 
  the NCRMD defence is raised for the first time on appeal this, rather than a 
  new trial, would appear to be the presumptive course. Major J. said this at 
  para. 65 of Warsing:</p>
<p class="indent"> It is my opinion that it is in the interests of justice that 
  Mailloux be read to recognize that where the defence of NCRMD is not raised 
  at the trial and if the court of appeal concludes that it cannot make a determination 
  with respect to NCRMD it is within the jurisdiction of the court of appeal in 
  avoiding a miscarriage of justice, to order a new trial. In most cases it is 
  likely that the court of appeal would have sufficient evidence to determine 
  the NCRMD question. It is only in cases where the facts are complex and the 
  court concludes that further evidence is required that a new trial would be 
  ordered. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [47] The ultimate issue presented to this court is simple: has the appellant 
  established the NCRMD defence on a balance of probabilities? In my view she 
  has and a new trial is not required. The facts, including the fresh evidence, 
  are not complex. The psychiatric evidence is strong and uncontradicted. The 
  Crown has been unable to point to anything in the appellant's medical records 
  since being in prison that is, in the least, inconsistent with Dr. Ben-Aron's 
  opinion. Indeed those records appear entirely consistent with it. I do not think 
  that any further evidence is required to dispose of this issue.</p><p>
  [48] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and find the 
  appellant not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. </p><p>
  [49] In accordance with s. 672.46 the appellant will remain in custody pending
