<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At the conclusion of argument, we indicated to counsel that this appeal 
  must be dismissed and that brief reasons would be provided. The appeal is from 
  the order of Stinson J. dismissing a motion by the Congr&eacute;s Ib&eacute;roam&eacute;rican 
  du Canada Inc. for leave to intervene in an application for a declaration that 
  certain provisions of the Radiocommunication Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-2 violate 
  s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and are therefore of 
  no force and effect. Stinson J. has been case managing this complex litigation 
  for some time. He delivered comprehensive reasons dealing with each of the points 
  raised by the appellant and we see no basis for interfering with his conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant submits that the motion judge made several errors in his 
  appreciation of the evidence. We are satisfied that none of the so-called errors 
  are of any significance. For example, the appellant alleged that the motion 
  judge must have ignored certain affidavits filed by Mr. Fitzgerald because he 
  only referred to one of those affidavits. However, when the reasons are read 
  as a whole it is clear that the motion judge not only was aware of the other 
  affidavits but took them into account.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Our principal concern on the appeal was whether the motion judge had properly 
  held that the Congr&eacute;s had no important perspective distinct from the 
  immediate parties. The motion was argued on the basis that the Congr&eacute;s 
  could provide additional material, not placed before the court by the parties, 
  concerning the impact of the legislation on consumers of satellite television. 
  The motion judge found that, &quot;it is apparent that, at least from an evidentiary 
  perspective, the applicants have attempted to articulate the concerns of members 
  of a variety of linguistic and ethnic minorities. There is no reason to doubt 
  that the applicants will not continue to advocate on behalf of the interests 
  of these various consumers.&quot; This finding is supported by the record.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] However, in oral argument the appellant attempted to avoid the impact of 
  this factual finding by arguing that it would provide evidence of the link between 
  minority language satellite television programming and the preservation and 
  promotion of Spanish language, culture, heritage and identity. This was not 
  put before the motion judge nor referred to in the appellant's factum in this 
  court. There is little evidentiary basis for this new argument. While the appellant 
  says that it will produce five affidavits to support this argument, those affidavits 
  were not presented to the motion judge nor in this court. We cannot give effect 
  to this argument.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] With respect to the other bases for intervention, we agree with the motion 
  judge. The evidence supports the motion judge's finding that the Congr&eacute;s 
  does not have a real, substantial and identifiable interest in the subject matter 
  of the application. The motion judge's extensive review of the record bears 
  out that determination. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] We are also satisfied that it was open to the motion judge to find that 
  the Congr&eacute;s is not a well recognized group with a special expertise and 
  a broad identifiable membership base. The Congr&eacute;s is a new organization 
  formed expressly for this litigation and does not have any members. The affidavit 
  of Mr. Fitzgerald does not demonstrate a special expertise. At most, it shows 
  that he has a particular interest in this litigation. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] The motion judge found that the proposed intervention would unduly delay 
  and quite possibly prejudice the determination of the rights of the parties. 
  As the case management judge he was ideally situated to make that finding. The 
  submissions from counsel on the appeal support that determination. There is 
  also no satisfactory explanation for the delay in bringing the motion. We do 
  not agree with the appellant that the proposed intervention could be accommodated 
  within the existing timetable. We also agree with the respondents that the proposed 
  intervention would result in a significant expansion of the proceeding. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] To conclude, we adopt the statement by the motion judge that &quot;it is 
  unlikely that the [Congr&eacute;s] can make a useful contribution to the resolution 
  of the application, without causing injustice to the immediate parties&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without costs.<br>
