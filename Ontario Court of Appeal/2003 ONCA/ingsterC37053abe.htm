<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence. 
  There was strong circumstantial evidence pointing to guilt. It was open to the 
  trial judge to reject the evidence of the defence. We see no basis to interfere. 
  The appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>[2] The sentence is within the appropriate range. The appellant's good behaviour 
  on bail, while commendable, is not such that warrants interference. The appeal 
  against sentence is dismissed.</p>
