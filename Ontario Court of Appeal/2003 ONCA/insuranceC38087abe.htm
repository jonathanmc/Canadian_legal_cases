<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge. The so-called 
  non-competition agreement formed part of the share purchase agreement by which 
  the appellant and the others sold a book of business and list of customers to 
  the respondent. </p>
<p>[2] Paragraphs 2 and 5 of the non-competition agreement have to be interpreted 
  in the light of the overall purpose of this transaction. Although the scope 
  of paragraphs 2 and 5 leave room for some ambiguity we think that the commercial 
  sense of the transaction precluded the appellant from doing business with his 
  former customers for 4 years. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $3,500 inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
