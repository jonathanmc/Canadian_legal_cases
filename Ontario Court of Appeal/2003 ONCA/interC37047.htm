<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Joseph R. Henderson, of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, dated August 24, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that Henderson J. made any error in law or principle 
  in this matter. He quite properly found, on the basis of authority of this court 
  in Deverell v. Anson, Hindon and Minden (Townships) (1998), 110 O.A.C. 372 (C.A.), 
  that the standard of review of the Treasurer's exercise of discretion is one 
  of reasonableness. </p>
<p>
  [2] Henderson J. made no error in finding that the Deputy Treasurer had exercised 
  his discretion in a reasonable manner. The evidentiary basis is clear that the 
  Deputy Treasurer fully considered all relevant factors in the exercise of his 
  discretion and we reject the contention that he in any way fettered that discretion.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellants seek to make the argument before us that they were prejudiced 
  by the respondent's failure to advise them of a &quot;secret practice&quot; 
  of accepting payment of the cancellation price after the expiry of the redemption 
  period but before the commencement of advertising for sale. We begin by noting 
  that this issue is raised for the first time before us even though it was clearly 
  open to the appellants to raise it before Henderson J. Having failed to raise 
  it below, it is not open to the appellants to now raise it. That said, we would 
  note that, in any event, the practice was not secret -- it was in the literature 
  and jurisprudence. Nor was it a practice inasmuch as the Treasurer was simply 
  following the directions of this court in Elliott v. City of Toronto (1999), 
  43 O.R. (3d) 392 (C.A.). And, finally, there is no evidence of any prejudice 
  to the appellants as a result of the failure to be apprised of the &quot;practice&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent 
  fixed in the amount of $15,000.</p>
