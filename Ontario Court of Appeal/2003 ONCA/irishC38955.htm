<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Hugh R. McLean of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated September 17, 2002.</p>
<p>DOHERTY J.A.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>[1] In July 1998, Barbara Irish, the respondent, made a claim for a dismemberment 
  insurance benefit under a group life insurance policy issued by the appellant, 
  Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada (&#147;Sun Life&#148;). Sun Life rejected the 
  claim for various reasons. In July 1999, Ms. Irish commenced this action against 
  Sun Life seeking a declaration that she was entitled to the dismemberment benefits 
  payable under the policy. Sun Life brought a motion for summary judgment contending 
  that the action was barred by the one-year limitation period in s. 206(1) of 
  the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. The motion judge rejected this submission 
  and dismissed Sun Life&#146;s motion. Sun Life appeals. I would allow the appeal 
  and dismiss the action.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>[2] Ms. Irish is covered under an accidental death and dismemberment policy 
  issued by Sun Life to her employer. That policy provides for a lump sum payment 
  upon total loss of the use of a limb as a result of an accident.</p>
<p>[3] On July 3, 1998, Sun Life received a claim for dismemberment benefits from 
  Ms. Irish. The claim was on a pre-printed three-part proof of claim form prepared 
  by Sun Life. The top part of the form was completed by Ms. Irish and described 
  her accident as a loss of feeling in her right leg following neurosurgery in 
  February 1997. The second part of the form was completed by Ms. Irish&#146;s 
  employer and provided employment related information. The third part of the 
  form was completed by Ms. Irish&#146;s doctor. He indicated that Ms. Irish&#146;s 
  left leg was paralyzed as a result of nerve damage caused during surgery undertaken 
  to eliminate intractable pain caused by shingles. </p>
<p>[4] Ms. Irish&#146;s claim was referred to a Sun Life medical consultant on 
  or about July 22, 1998. The consultant was asked to review the &#147;medical 
  documentation&#148; with a view to determining whether the injury suffered by 
  Ms. Irish was an &#147;accident&#148;. The medical consultant offered the opinion 
  that Ms. Irish had not lost the total use of her leg and that in any event the 
  injury to her leg was the result of a complication during surgery and not an 
  accident. The consultant&#146;s notes attached to his opinion refer to medical 
  information which was not in the proof of claim form and presumably came from 
  the &#147;medical documentation&#148; referred to in the request forwarded to 
  the consultant. The consultant&#146;s report was dated July 24, 1998. </p>
<p>[5] By letter dated July 31, 1998, Sun Life advised Ms. Irish that her claim 
  had been rejected. Echoing the comments of the medical consultant, Sun Life 
  advised Ms. Irish that her injury was not caused by an accident, and that the 
  loss of use of her leg was not total as required by the policy. Sun Life also 
  took the position that the proof of claim had not been filed within one year 
  of the alleged accident as required by the policy.</p>
<p>[6] Ms. Irish had retained counsel by May 1999. By letter dated May 11, 1999, 
  counsel told Sun Life that Ms. Irish objected to the position taken by Sun Life 
  as to her entitlement to the dismemberment benefit and would be &#147;pursuing 
  your company&#148; for those benefits. A statement of claim seeking among other 
  things, a declaration of Ms. Irish&#146;s entitlement to dismemberment benefits, 
  was issued on July 27, 1999, slightly more than a year after Sun Life received 
  her proof of claim and slightly less than a year after Sun Life rejected the 
  claim.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>[7] For the purpose of the motion, it was accepted that the policy was a life 
  insurance policy governed by Part V of the Insurance Act which includes ss. 
  203 to 218. Section 203 provides:</p>
<p class="indent">Where an insurer receives sufficient evidence of,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the happening of the event upon which insurance money becomes 
  payable;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the age of the person whose life is insured;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the right of the claimant to receive payment; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the name and age of the beneficiary, if there is a beneficiary,</p>
<p class="indent">it shall, within thirty days after receiving the evidence, pay 
  the insurance money to the person entitled thereto.</p>
<p>[8] Section 203 directs that the insurer pay the insurance money to the person 
  entitled to receive it within thirty days of the insurer receiving sufficient 
  evidence of the four facts identified in subsections (a) to (d). Where there 
  is a dispute as to the sufficiency of the evidence provided, ss. 208, 210 and 
  213 provide mechanisms for a judicial determination of that dispute. In addition, 
  s. 218 authorizes an application for an order requiring payment of the insurance 
  monies where the insurer does not make the payment within thirty days of receiving 
  the evidence referred to in s. 203. </p>
<p>[9] Section 206(1) contains the operative limitation period:</p>
<p class="indent">Subject to subsection (2), an action or proceeding against an insurer for the 
  recovery of insurance money shall not be commenced more than one year after 
  the furnishing of the evidence required by section 203 or more than six years 
  after the happening of the event upon which the insurance money becomes payable, 
  whichever period first expires [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[10] Sun Life and Ms. Irish agree that the one year limitation period referred 
  to in s. 206(1) governs this proceeding.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  They disagree, however, as to the date on which the one year period began to 
  run. Sun Life argues that time began to run when it received the proof of claim 
  on July 3, 1998. Ms. Irish contends that the limitation period could not start 
  until she received notice of the rejection shortly after July 31, 1998.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>[11] The motion judge referred to Ingram v. Imperial Life Assurance Co. of 
  Canada (1985), 53 O.R. (2d) 442 (L.J.S.C.), aff&#146;d (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 
  762 (H.C.J.) and Kissoondial v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America (1987), 
  60 O.R. (2d) 797 (C.A.) as authority for the proposition that the one year limitation 
  period commences only upon an unequivocal rejection of the claim by the insurer.</p>
<p>[12] I cannot agree with the motion judge&#146;s reading of these cases. In 
  Ingram, supra, the insurer communicated regularly with the claimant after the 
  claimant had filed the proof of claim. In those communications, the insurer 
  requested additional information. It subsequently rejected the claim. In these 
  circumstances, it was held that it could not be said that the insurer had sufficient 
  evidence of the facts referred to in s. 203 until the insurer rejected the case. 
  In the present case, the insurer did not request further information or in any 
  way suggest that the information provided by Ms. Irish was insufficient. To 
  the contrary, it communicated its rejection of the claim within thirty days 
  of receipt of the proof of claim. </p>
<p>[13] In Kissoondial, supra, the appellant could only succeed if the six year 
  limitation period referred to in s. 206(1) applied. If the one year limitation 
  period was applicable, the claim was well out of time regardless of whether 
  the one year period began with the filing of the proof of claim or the rejection 
  of the claim by the insurer. The court was not required to and did not choose 
  between those two potential dates. Grange J.A., for the court, did recognize 
  (and he cited Ingram in this context) that the conduct or inaction of the insurer 
  could delay the running of the one year limitation period. That caveat has no 
  application in this case. This claim was rejected in a timely and unequivocal 
  fashion. </p>
<p>[14] Neither Ingram, supra, nor Kissoondial, supra, supports the conclusion 
  that the limitation period described in s. 206(1) does not begin to run until 
  the claimant has notice that the claim has been rejected. If the legislature 
  had intended the limitation clock to run from the occurrence of that event, 
  it would have said so.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>[15] The one year limitation period in s. 206(1) runs from the &#147;furnishing 
  of the evidence required by s. 203&#148;. The evidence required by s. 203 is 
  &#147;sufficient evidence&#148; to establish the facts referred to in subsection 
  (a),(b), (c) and (d). Those are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the happening of the event giving rise to the obligation to pay the claim 
    [s. 203(a)];</li>
  <li>the age of the claimant [s. 203(b)];</li>
  <li>the right of the claimant to receive payment [s. 203(c)]; and</li>
  <li>the name and age of the beneficiary, if any [s. 203(d)].</li>
</ul>
<p>[16] Subsection (a) refers to the event which gives rise to the obligation 
  to pay the benefit. In the context of this case, the subsection required Ms. 
  Irish to provide sufficient evidence of her &#147;accident&#148; and of her 
  total loss of the use of her leg to trigger Sun Life&#146;s obligation to pay 
  under the policy. Subsection (b) is self-explanatory and required Ms. Irish 
  to inform the insurer of her age. At first glance, subsection (c) would appear 
  to refer to the merits of the claim advanced, however, this court has interpreted 
  subsection (c) as referring only to the identity of the claimant as a person 
  entitled under the policy to make the claim: Kissoondial, supra, at 800. The 
  facts referred to in subsection (d) have no application to a claim for a dismemberment 
  benefit.</p>
<p>[17] The question of when an insurer has been furnished with sufficient evidence 
  of the facts referred to in s. 203 is a question of fact: Kerry v. Blue Cross 
  Life Insurance Company of Canada, [1996] I.L.R. para. I-3365 at 4180-81 (P.E.I.S.C.); 
  Campbell et al. v. Crown Life Insurance Co. (1981), 25 B.C.L.R. 12 (S.C.). The 
  phrase &#147;sufficient evidence&#148; in s. 203 must be interpreted with an 
  eye to the overall purpose of that section. Section 203 is intended to secure 
  timely payment of benefits once the insurer has received the information needed 
  to determine whether the benefit is properly payable under the policy. The evidence 
  referred to in s. 203 is directed to establishing entitlement to payment under 
  the policy. It is &#147;sufficient evidence&#148; when the insurer is able to 
  make that assessment. I agree with Ferrier J. in Pluzak v. Gerling Global Life 
  Insurance Company (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 49 at 55 (Gen. Div.)<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  where he said:</p>
<p class="indent">When the insurance company receives enough evidence to make the unequivocal 
  determination of liability, it has received &#147;sufficient evidence&#148;. 
</p>
<p>[18] Although it is the insurer who must determine the sufficiency of the evidence 
  in order to decide whether to make payment on the policy, that does not mean 
  that it is the insurer&#146;s assessment that governs if the sufficiency of 
  the evidence furnished to the insurer becomes an issue in litigation. If it 
  becomes an issue, it will be for the court to decide, on an objective basis, 
  after an examination of the information provided to the insurer when the insurer 
  was furnished with sufficient evidence of the facts referred to in s. 203: see 
  Insurance Act, s. 208, s. 210.</p>
<p>[19] Even where the court determines that the insurer had &#147;sufficient 
  evidence&#148; to make the necessary assessment by a given date, the conduct 
  of the insurer after that date may estop it from asserting that it had sufficient 
  evidence on the earlier date. I think Ingram, supra, is best understood as a 
  case where the insurer, by its conduct, was estopped from claiming that it had 
  sufficient evidence of the relevant facts at a point in time when it was still 
  requesting additional information concerning those facts from the insured: see 
  also Thomas v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co., [2001] A.J. No. 1753 (Q.B.).</p>
<p>[20] There is no suggestion that Sun Life misled Ms. Irish or that it should 
  be estopped by its conduct from claiming that it had sufficient evidence as 
  of July 26, 1998, a year and a day before the statement of claim was issued. 
</p>
<p>[21] As indicated above, Sun Life argues that it had &#147;sufficient evidence&#148; 
  when it received the proof of claim on July 3, 1998. This contention is arguably 
  inconsistent with Sun Life&#146;s obtaining of additional medical evidence some 
  time before it referred the file to its consultant on July 22, 1998. I need 
  not decide whether Sun Life had sufficient evidence as of July 3. On the evidence 
  adduced on the motion, there is no doubt that it had all of the material needed 
  to assess the claim by July 22, 1998 at the latest. Section 206(1) speaks of 
  the &#147;furnishing of the evidence&#148; required by s. 203 and not the insurer&#146;s 
  decision to accept or reject the claim based on that evidence. While an inordinate 
  delay in assessing a claim after the furnishing of the requisite evidence may 
  estop an insurer from relying on s. 206(1), especially if the claimant has relied 
  on that delay, there is no delay here. It is also noteworthy that in paragraphs 
  6 and 10 of her amended statement of claim, Ms. Irish pleads that she established 
  her entitlement to the benefits under the policy in the proof of claim submitted 
  by her in late June 1998. The affidavit filed on Ms. Irish&#146;s behalf on 
  the summary judgment motion does not suggest otherwise, but instead asserts 
  that the claim was brought within the limitation period because it was issued 
  &#147;within one year of the denial of the claim&#148;. As indicated above, 
  that is not the event which triggers the running of the one year limitation 
  in s. 206(1).</p>
<p>[22] Counsel for Ms. Irish next submitted that even if Sun Life had been furnished 
  with sufficient evidence of the facts referred to in s. 203 as of July 22, the 
  discoverability principle served to delay the operation of the limitation period 
  in s. 206(1) until Sun Life had notified Ms. Irish of its assessment of the 
  merits of her claim. Counsel contends that Ms. Irish could not sue on the policy 
  until she had furnished sufficient evidence of the facts referred to in s. 203 
  so as to permit the insurer to determine whether it was liable to pay under 
  the policy. Counsel argues that the cause of action did not arise until Ms. 
  Irish knew or ought reasonably to have known that sufficient evidence had been 
  furnished to the insurer. He contends that she could only be fixed with this 
  knowledge when she was notified by Sun Life that her claim had been assessed 
  and rejected.</p>
<p>[23] The discovery principle is an aid in the interpretation of statutory language 
  creating a limitation period. The discovery principle aims at avoiding the injustice 
  caused by foreclosing a cause of action before the putative plaintiff could 
  reasonably know of the facts essential to the advancement of the claim: Peixeiro 
  v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549 at paras. 36-38. Not every limitation period 
  is, however, tied to the existence of facts which are essential to the cause 
  of action. Some statutory limitation periods run from the occurrence of a specific 
  event which is not germane to the existence of a cause of action. The discovery 
  principle does not assist in interpreting those statutory provisions: Fehr v. 
  Jacob (1993), 14 C.C.L.T. (2d) 200 (Man. C.A.); Grenier v. Canadian General 
  Insurance Co. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 715 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[24] I cannot agree with the submission that a claimant who alleges a breach 
  of contract by the failure to pay a benefit under a policy must prove that he 
  or she had furnished sufficient evidence of the facts referred to in s. 203 
  to succeed on that claim on the policy. Section 203 obliges the insurer to pay 
  the benefit within thirty days of receipt of sufficient evidence of the facts 
  described in s. 203. It does not make compliance with s. 203 a condition precedent 
  to a claim for breach of the insurance contract if the benefit is not paid. 
  Section 206(1) recognizes that the claimant may bring an action where there 
  has not been compliance with s. 203 by providing for an alternative limitation 
  period of six years from the happening of the event giving rise to the obligation 
  to pay the benefit. As Grange J.A. observed in Kissoondial, supra, at 799:</p>
<p class="indent">Under s. 183 [now s. 206], a claimant who had not submitted a claim (perhaps 
  because he was not aware of having a claim) is given six years to commence action. 
  &#133;</p>
<p>[25] The one year limitation period described in s. 206(1) commences upon the 
  occurrence of an event, that is the furnishing of sufficient evidence of the 
  facts referred to in s. 203, which is not a constituent element of a claim based 
  on a breach of the contract of insurance. Consequently, the discoverability 
  principle is of no assistance in interpreting the limitation period set out 
  in s. 206(1).</p>
<p>[26] I would reject this submission even if the discovery principle applied 
  to the one year limitation period in s. 206(1). Ms. Irish knew what information 
  she had furnished to Sun Life. She is deemed to know the contents of s. 203 
  and she knew or ought to have known of the terms of her policy. Absent any request 
  for further information by Sun Life, I do not think it can be said that Ms. 
  Irish did not know or ought not to have known that Sun Life had been furnished 
  by her with sufficient evidence to assess the claim. The rejection of the claim 
  confirmed that she had provided sufficient evidence to Sun Life to assess the 
  claim. Indeed, as noted earlier in these reasons, it has always been Ms. Irish&#146;s 
  contention that she supplied sufficient evidence to Sun Life in her proof of 
  claim to establish her entitlement to the dismemberment benefit and that Sun 
  Life breached the policy by not paying the benefit.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>[27] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order dismissing the motion for 
  summary judgment and grant judgment dismissing the claim on the basis that it 
  is beyond the applicable one year limitation period in s. 206(1).</p>
<p>[28] Sun Life is entitled to its costs on the motion and on the appeal. The 
  motion judge fixed costs in the amount of $1,500 in favour of Ms. Irish on the 
  motion. Sun Life should have costs of the motion in the same amount ($1,500). 
  I would fix Sun Life&#146;s costs of appeal at $8,000.</p>
