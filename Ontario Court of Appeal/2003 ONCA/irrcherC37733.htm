<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally October 8, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge found that the 1990 written contract did not apply to the 
  respondent at the time of his termination because the substratum of the written 
  contract had disappeared. There had been a fundamental change in the nature 
  of his job.</p>
<p>
  [2] This is a finding of fact and can be interfered with here only if constitutes 
  palpable and overriding error. In our view there was ample evidence to support 
  the finding. The appellant's responsibilities were dramatically greater. His 
  remuneration was much greater. His method of remuneration had changed. Even 
  his title was different. It was simply not the same job.</p>
<p>
  [3] We are also of the view that the trial judge was correct in awarding damages 
  for vacation contractually owing, which the appellant had denied to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [4] We would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [5] On the cross-appeal the respondent challenges three findings of fact made 
  at trial. In our view, all three challenges fail to meet the high threshold 
  required for us to interfere. It was open to the trial judge to find that the 
  respondent had failed to establish that an obligatory bonus was part of his 
  compensation package. Moreover, the trial judge did not conclude that if the 
  $25,000 bonus was discretionary it would have been paid and we cannot do so 
  in this court.</p>
<p>
  [6] Secondly, the trial judge had ample basis for concluding that there was 
  a complete lack of precision of understanding and intention concerning a 5% 
  of saving bonus. The evidence yielded no clear and shared understanding of how 
  it could be calculated and hence there was no enforceable agreement to this 
  effect.</p>
<p>
  [7] Finally, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the respondent 
  had not proven his claim for 1996 vacation pay, given the amount paid to him 
  some years ago to replace lost vacation time.</p>
<p>
  [8] We would therefore also dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  [9] Given the result, we would order that there be no costs of the appeal or 
  the cross-appeal.</p>
