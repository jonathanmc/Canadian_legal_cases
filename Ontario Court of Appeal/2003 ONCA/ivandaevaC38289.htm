<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 24, 2002.</p> <p>
  BORINS J.A.:</p> <p>
  [1] Walter and Audrey Hlembizky (&quot;the Hlembizkys&quot;) moved under rule 
  37.14(1)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure to set aside an order of Caswell 
  J. issued under s. 137(2) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 
  sealing the &quot;court file&quot; in Ivandaev v. Ivandaeva, which is a family 
  law proceeding in the Family Law Division of the Superior Court of Justice. 
  In response to the Hlembizkys' motion, Denis Ivandaev moved for an order, inter 
  alia, that the Hlembizkys and their solicitor, Mark Arnold, comply with the 
  order of Caswell J. The motion judge dismissed the Hlembizkys' motion and granted 
  the Mr. Ivandaev's motion. The Hlembizkys appeal both of these orders. For the 
  reasons that follow, I would dismiss both appeals.</p> <p>
  Background</p> <p>
  [2] There is no serious dispute surrounding the events that led up to the motions 
  under appeal. However, they are quite complicated. For the purpose of my reasons, 
  I will limit my review of the background events to those that are required to 
  decide the appeal.</p> 
<p> [3] Denis Ivandaev and Elena Ivandaeva (&quot;the Ivandaevs&quot;) entered 
  into three commercial agreements with the Hlembizkys. One agreement was for 
  the purchase of the Hlembizkys' spa and beauty salon business. Another, required 
  Mr. Hlembizky to provide consulting services to Mr. Ivandaev . The third, required 
  Mrs. Hlembizky to train the Ivandaevs in conducting the businesses. Before the 
  closing of the agreements, the Ivandaevs' marriage failed. As a result, on September 
  26, 1999 Mr. Ivandaev and his company commenced three separate proceedings against 
  the Hlembizkys (the &quot;commercial litigation&quot;) claiming that they were 
  entitled to terminate the agreements and asking for the return of all deposits 
  paid under the agreements.</p>
<p>
  [4] In addition, sometime in September 1999, a petition for divorce was commenced 
  by Mr. Ivandaev which, as well as claiming a divorce, raised issues of support 
  and child custody. In the course of that proceeding, Mr. Ivandaev moved for 
  certain interim relief including an order sealing the court file on the ground 
  that it contained &quot;sensitive information&quot; concerning the child, and 
  financial information about himself and his company. On the consent of all the 
  parties to the petition, on December 16, 1999 Caswell J. granted an order that 
  contained the following paragraph that is relevant to this appeal:</p> <p>
  1. This court orders on consent of the parties, that:</p> <p>
  . . . . .</p> <p>
  (d) without prejudice to either party, this court file shall be sealed, and 
  the previous divorce action 39403/99 at Brampton shall also be sealed, until 
  further order of the court;</p> <p>
  [5] The commercial litigation, which appears to have spawned a multitude of 
  motions, has been case managed by Master Albert. On November 28, 2000, in the 
  course of arguing a motion before Master Albert, Mr. Ivandaev's lawyer, Mr. 
  Title, disclosed the existence of Caswell J.'s sealing order. The Hlembizkys' 
  lawyer, Mr. Arnold, was present at this time.</p> <p>
  [6] In November 2001 Mr. Arnold attended the Family Law Division registry. He 
  obtained access to the court file in Ivandaev v. Ivandaeva that was the subject 
  of the sealing order. As a result of an administrative oversight, the file had 
  not been sealed. However, a copy of Caswell J.'s order was in the file. Even 
  though Mr. Arnold had been made aware of the sealing order during the argument 
  of the motion before Master Albert, and notwithstanding that a copy of the order 
  was in the file, Mr. Arnold searched the contents of the file and made copies 
  of 15 documents. On November 22, 2001, the Hlembizkys filed a supplementary 
  affidavit of documents in the commercial litigation stating that they had come 
  into possession of the documents which Mr. Arnold had copied, which they listed 
  in their affidavit.</p> <p>
  [7] On December 5, 2001, Master Albert ordered that by December 10, 2001 Mr. 
  Arnold was to &quot;provide&quot; Mr. Ivandaev's lawyers with the copies of 
  the documents he had removed from the file. In her endorsement, she noted that 
  Mr. Arnold intended to use these documents &quot;only for purposes of impeaching 
  a witness if inconsistent answers were given at [the commercial] trial&quot;. 
  As she did not have jurisdiction to enforce compliance with Caswell J.'s sealing 
  order, she stated that any motion seeking a compliance order was to be made 
  before a Superior Court judge.</p> <p>
  [8] In an effort to avoid the necessity of a compliance motion, Mr. Ivandaev's 
  lawyer wrote to Mr. Arnold seeking his voluntary compliance with the sealing 
  order. In his reply, Mr. Arnold returned the documents referred to in the supplementary 
  affidavit of documents. However, he took the position that the sealing order 
  was not &quot;directed at either [himself] or [his] clients&quot;. Consequently, 
  he wrote that neither he, nor his clients, were required to comply with it in 
  the absence of an order of a Superior Court judge.</p> <p>
  The motions and the reasons of the motion court judge</p> <p>
  [9] As a result of Mr. Arnold's position, Mr. Ivandaev moved for an order, inter 
  alia: (1) compelling compliance with the sealing order; (2) that the information 
  contained in the supplementary affidavit of documents &quot;not be communicated 
  in any way or referred to in any way by&quot; Mr. Arnold; (3) that Mr. Arnold 
  deliver up all copies of documents referred to in the supplementary affidavit 
  of documents and all copies of any additional documents obtained from the court 
  file; (4) removing Mr. Arnold as solicitor of record for the Hlembizkys.</p> <p>
  [10] The motion judge's endorsement in respect to this motion reads as follows:</p> <p>
  The documents obtained by Mr. Arnold solicitor for the defendants from court 
  files 99 FP252918 FIS and 39403/99 after these files were sealed by the Order 
  of Caswell J. dated December 16, 1999 shall be destroyed. The Supplementary 
  Affidavit of Documents containing these documents shall be struck. No use of 
  any of the information contained in those documents shall be made by either 
  the defendants or their counsel. There is no basis to remove Mr. Arnold as counsel 
  for the defendants.</p> <p>
  [11] In response to the Ivandaev's motion, the Hlembizkys brought a cross motion 
  for an order to strike out paragraph 1(d) of Caswell J.'s order &quot;to the 
  extent that the Order covers those documents listed in the Supplementary Affidavit 
  of Documents&quot;. The cross motion was brought pursuant to rule 37.14(1)(a) 
  which reads, in part, as follows:</p> <p>
  37.14(1) A person who,</p> <p>
  (a) is affected by an order obtained on motion without notice; </p> <p>
  . . . .</p> <p>
  may move to set aside or vary the order . . . </p> <p>
  [12] The motion judge dismissed the cross motion for the following reasons:</p> <p>
  Motion dismissed. Mr. Arnold has not been able to satisfy me that there has 
  been any change in circumstances since Caswell J. made her Order which would 
  justify setting aside her order. I do not accept that the defendants had any 
  right to notice of the motion to seal the matrimonial files. Costs of this motion 
  and the plaintiffs' motion heard today to the plaintiffs fixed in the amount 
  of $2,500.00 payable forthwith.</p> <p>
  Positions of the parties</p> <p>
  [13] The appellants' position is that the motion judge erred in failing to set 
  aside Caswell J.'s sealing order and in ordering compliance with that order. 
  They offer a number of grounds in support of their position.</p> <p>
  [14] As for the dismissal of their motion to set aside the sealing order, they 
  submit that the motion judge erred:</p> <p>
  (a) by applying an incorrect test in holding that there was an onus on the Hlembizkys 
  to demonstrate a change in circumstances since the making of the order, whereas 
  the onus rested on the Ivandaevs to demonstrate the necessity of a sealing order.</p> <p>
  (b) in holding that the Hlembizkys were not entitled to receive notice of Mr. 
  Ivandaev's motion to seal the matrimonial file.</p> <p>
  [15] In addition, the appellants offer a number of reasons why they are persons 
  &quot;affected by&quot; the sealing order within the meaning of rule 37.14(1)(a). 
  For example, they point to a number of examples of information that they extracted 
  from financial data contained in documents found in the matrimonial file that 
  they say contradicts allegations in the Ivandaevs pleadings in the commercial 
  litigation and in the testimony of Mr. Ivandaev on his examination for discovery. 
  They assert, therefore, that the information obtained from the matrimonial file 
  is relevant to their defence in the commercial litigation. What I understand 
  from these submissions is that the appellants say that they are affected by 
  the sealing order because without the information contained in the sealed file, 
  their defence in the commercial litigation would, or could, somehow be compromised.</p> <p>
  [16] The appellants attack the motion judge's compliance order by asserting 
  that because the court administration had neglected to seal the file as required 
  by the sealing order, the &quot;court file remained accessible to the public&quot;. 
  They add that there was no reason that required the Hlembizkys to comply with 
  the order because it was &quot;a direction to the court's administration&quot;, 
  and, as such, was not binding on them, &quot;particularly where they had no 
  notice of the order prior to obtaining the documents&quot; that they listed 
  in their supplementary affidavit of documents.</p> <p>
  [17] The respondents' position can be stated briefly. They submit that there 
  is no basis on which this court can interfere with either order made by the 
  motion judge. As the Hlembizkys are strangers to the matrimonial proceeding, 
  they were not persons who were required to be served with Mr. Ivandaev's notice 
  of motion to seal the court file in that proceeding and, therefore, lack locus 
  standi, or standing, to move to have the sealing order set aside. Moreover, 
  as this order applied to any person who sought access to the court file, neither 
  the Hlembizkys, nor their solicitor, are exempt from it.</p> <p>
  Analysis</p> <p>
  [18] My analysis is focused on the appeal from the motion judge's order dismissing 
  the appellants' appeal from her refusal to set aside or vary the sealing order. 
  This is because the result of this appeal will determine the result of the appeal 
  from the motion judge's compliance order. The resolution of the first appeal 
  depends on the interpretation of rule 37.07(1), which stipulates the persons 
  who must be served with a notice of motion, and rule 37.14(1), which governs 
  the conditions that must prevail before a person has standing to bring a motion 
  under that rule to set aside or vary an order. Therefore, to be successful in 
  their appeal, the appellants must establish that:</p> <p>
  (1) They are persons affected by Caswell J.'s sealing order.</p> <p>
  (2) The order was obtained on a motion without notice.</p> <p>
  (3) The motion judge erred in declining to set aside or vary the order.</p> <p>
  [19] As I will explain, it is my opinion that the Hlembizkys have failed to 
  establish that they were persons &quot;affected by&quot; the sealing order within 
  the meaning of rules 37.07(1) and 37.14(1), with the result that the motion 
  judge correctly dismissed their motion to set aside or vary the sealing order. 
  It follows that she was also correct in granting the Ivandaevs' cross motion 
  requiring compliance with that order.</p> <p>
  [20] Before commencing my analysis, it will be helpful to reproduce the former 
  Rules of Civil Practice and the current Rules of Civil Procedure relevant to 
  this appeal.</p> <p>
  Rules of Practice</p> <p>
  215. An application in an action shall be made by motion, and, unless the nature 
  of the application or the circumstances of the case render it impracticable, 
  notice of the motion shall be given to all parties affected by the order sought 
  [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  219. A party affected by an ex parte order, or any party who has failed to appear 
  on an application through accident or mistake, or insufficient notice of the 
  application, may move to rescind or vary the order by notice within seven days 
  and returnable before the judge or officer who made the order, or any judge 
  or officer having jurisdiction, within ten days after the order came to his 
  notice [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  Rules of Civil Procedure</p> <p>
  37.07(1) The notice of motion shall be served on any person or party who will 
  be affected by the order sought, unless these rules provide otherwise [emphasis 
  added].</p> <p>
  37.14(1) A person who,</p> <p>
  (a) is affected by an order obtained on motion without notice;</p> <p>
  (b) fails to appear on a motion through accident, mistake or insufficient notice; 
  or</p> <p>
  (c) is affected by an order of a registrar,</p> <p>
  may move to set aside or vary the order, by a notice of motion that is served 
  forthwith after the order comes to the person's attention and names the first 
  available hearing date that is at least three days after service of the notice 
  of motion [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  38.11 (1) A person who is affected by a judgment on an application made without 
  notice or who fails to appear at the hearing of an application through accident, 
  mistake or insufficient notice may move to set aside or vary the judgment, by 
  a notice of motion that is served forthwith after the judgment comes to the 
  person's attention and names the first available hearing date that is at least 
  three days after service of the notice of motion [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  The nature and purpose of rule 37.14(1)</p> <p>
  [21] Virtually every common law system contains a code of procedural law that 
  regulates the procedure that governs civil proceedings from inception to appeal. 
  Among the many functions of a procedural code, the notice giving function introduces 
  an essential ingredient of due process as a proceeding moves from commencement 
  to appeal. In the context of the Rules of Civil Procedure, for example, Rule 
  16 requires personal service of every originating process, while providing for 
  an alternative to personal service in appropriate circumstances. Similarly, 
  the requirement of rule 37.07(1) that &quot;any person or party who will be 
  affected by the order&quot; be given notice of the motion seeking the order, 
  introduces an essential ingredient of due process. In this manner, rule 37.07(1) 
  both informs, and defines, the due process purpose of rule 37.14(1) that provides 
  the mechanism for any person, able to satisfy the conditions stipulated by the 
  rule, to obtain an order to set aside or vary an order.</p> <p>
  [22] Rule 37.14(1) has a long history. Its predecessor was part of Ontario's 
  procedural rules long before the major revision of 1913. In 1881, rules of court 
  were annexed to the Judicature Act, 37 Vict., c. 7 (Ont.), that made sweeping 
  changes to the administration of justice. Thus, the original precursor to rule 
  37.14(1) read:</p> <p>
  536. Any party affected by an ex parte order, except the party issuing the same, 
  may move to rescind or vary the same before the Judge or officer who made the 
  order, or any Judge or officer having jurisdiction, within four days from the 
  time of its coming to his notice, or within such further time as the Court or 
  Judge may allow, and whether it has been acted upon by the party issuing the 
  order or not [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  [23] Rule 536 was considered by this court in Howland v. Dominion Bank (1892), 
  15 P.R. 56 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd. (1893), 22 S.C.R. 130. In the context of a motion 
  under Rule 536 to set aside an ex parte order extending the time for service 
  of a writ of summons, at pp. 63-64 Macllennan J.A. considered both the nature 
  of a Rule 536 motion and the standard of review on appeal from the decision 
  of the court on the motion:</p> <p>
  It was not contended that the orders had been made inadvertently, or that the 
  learned Master had been induced to make them by the use of any improper means, 
  and, but for the recent Rule No. 536, I should have been of the opinion that 
  there was no jurisdiction to do what was done. That Rule, however, enables any 
  party affected by an ex parte order to move against it before the same Judge 
  or officer who made it, within four days after it comes to his notice, or such 
  further time as the Court or Judge may allow. It is confined to ex parte orders, 
  and is silent as to the grounds of the motion. It follows, I think, that the 
  party moving may support his motion by matter which was not before the Judge 
  or officer when the order was made, and that it must be determined, not as a 
  mere appeal from the former order, but as an original substantive application. 
  I think, however, that the question on such a motion is not alone whether the 
  order ought or ought not to have been made, but also whether, having been made, 
  it should be rescinded or varied. Taking that to be so, any change in the state 
  of affairs or the position of the parties between the making of the order and 
  the motion against it, is proper to be taken into consideration; and I think 
  I would hardly have rescinded the orders in question, seeing that it was then 
  too late to commence another action.</p> <p>
  It is a different question, however, whether we should reverse the action of 
  the learned Master, after it has been, twice affirmed before coming here. After 
  the most careful consideration, I cannot see that the learned Master was so 
  clearly wrong that his order cannot stand, and I therefore agree that the appeal 
  should be dismissed [emphasis added].</p> <p>
  [24] A similar view of the nature of a motion to rescind or vary an ex parte 
  order was stated by this court in Re Avery, [1952] O.R. 192 at 201 (C.A.):</p> <p>
  However, it has been decided that the question open for consideration upon a 
  motion under the provisions of Rule 217 [subsequently, Rule 219] is not alone 
  whether the order ought or ought not to have been made, but also whether, having 
  been made, it should be rescinded or varied.</p> <p>
  [25] More recently, former Rule 219 was considered in Strazisar v. Canadian 
  Universal Insurance Co. Ltd. (1981), 21 C.P.C. 51 at 58 (Ont. Co. Ct.), where 
  the court said:</p> <p>
  The nature of an application pursuant to R. 219 is stated in Holmested's Judicature 
  Act, 4th ed., at p. 681, and is quoted with approval by Masten J.A. in Fretz 
  v. Lafay, [1939] O.R. 273 at 275 (C.A.):</p> <p>
  &quot;The motion to rescind or vary may be supported, or opposed, by matter 
  not before the Judge or officer when the order was made. The motion is not an 
  appeal, but is a substantive motion, and the question is not alone whether the 
  order should have been made, but whether, having been made, it should, in view 
  of any change in the state of affairs, or positions of the parties, be rescinded: 
  Howland v. Dominion Bank (1892), 15 P.R. 56, at p. 63; Cairns v. Airth (1894), 
  16 P.R. 100, and Cousins v. Cronk (1897), 17 P.R. 348; Allison v. Breen (1900), 
  19 P.R. 119, 143.&quot;</p> <p>
  See, also, W. B. Williston &amp; R. J. Rolls, The Law of Civil Procedure, Vol. 
  1 (Toronto: Butterworths, 1970), at 470 71.</p> <p>
  A person affected by an order</p> <p>
  [26] Since the inception of the rule in 1881, access to it has been available 
  to one &quot;affected by&quot; the order which it is sought to rescind, set 
  aside or vary. From 1881 to the introduction of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  in 1985, the rule provided that it was available to a &quot;party affected by 
  an ex parte order&quot;. However, in 1985 &quot;person&quot; replaced &quot;party&quot; 
  in rule 37.14(1). In this regard, I note that in the complementary rule, rule 
  37.07(1), a notice of motion must be served &quot;on any person or party who 
  will be affected by the order sought&quot; [emphasis added]. This raises the 
  question of whether a party may bring a motion under rule 37.14(1), or whether 
  it is available only to a &quot;person&quot;, or whether a person includes a 
  party.</p> <p>
  [27] Other than Stanley Canada Inc. v. 683481 Ontario Ltd. (1990), 74 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 528 (Ont. Gen. Div.), the cases that have considered the rule in its different 
  forms do not discuss the meaning of &quot;affected by&quot;. However, a review 
  of the cases in which a successful motion has been brought under rule 37.14(1) 
  and rule 38.11(1), which applies to applications, or their predecessors, to 
  set aside or vary an order suggest that the order must be one that directly 
  affects the rights of the moving party in respect to the proprietary or economic 
  interests of the party. In addition, there is another broad group of cases, 
  usually arising from the sealing of a court file, in which the media has complained 
  that its right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms has been compromised and in which the principle 
  of open and accessible court proceedings has been invoked. See, e.g., Sierra 
  Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance) (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 193 
  (S.C.C.).</p> <p>
  [28] In Stanley, the issue was whether a union and its members had standing 
  under rule 37.14(1)(a) as persons &quot;affected by an order obtained on motion 
  made without notice&quot;, to move for an order setting aside an order obtained 
  under rule 44.01(1) by the employer of the union members, Stanley, directing 
  the sheriff to enter the defendant company's premises and to recover a quantity 
  of steel owned by Stanley. At the time of the order, the union was on a legal 
  strike against Stelco Inc., which had manufactured the steel for Stanley, that 
  was stored for Stanley by the corporate defendant.</p> <p>
  [29] The union contended that it had standing because the economic impact on 
  Stelco of its picketing had been, and would be, diminished as a result of the 
  rule 44.01(1) order. The union's picketing of the company precluded Stanley 
  from removing its steel from the company's warehouse. The union contended that 
  this represented an economic advantage to it in its strike against Stelco Inc.</p> <p>
  [30] McKeown J., at p. 537, held &quot;that the substantial economic advantage 
  to the union members in keeping the steel in the warehouse makes them persons 
  'affected by an order' under rule 37.14&quot;. He also found at p. 539, that 
  the &quot;potential infringement&quot; of its freedom of expression guaranteed 
  by s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms &quot;qualifies the 
  union members as 'affected by' . . . the master's order&quot;.</p> <p>
  [31] Stanley was applied in Weinstein v. Weinstein (Litigation Guardian of) 
  (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 229 (Gen. Div.). In that case a wife had settled a trust 
  and provided that on her death the trust assets were to go to her estate, the 
  residue of which had been bequeathed to her grandchildren under her will. Subsequently, 
  her husband applied without notice to the grandchildren for a judgment equalizing 
  the net family assets of himself and his wife. The application was granted and 
  a judgment was given transferring $2.5 million from the wife's trust to the 
  husband. The grandchildren moved under rule 38.11(1) to set aside the judgment 
  on the ground that they were persons &quot;affected by a judgment on an application 
  made without notice&quot;. In setting aside the judgment, Sheard J. held that 
  the grandchildren were &quot;manifestly&quot; persons affected by the judgment 
  and that they should have received notice of the application. Citing Stanley, 
  he rejected the argument that an economic interest in the outcome of a proceeding 
  does not confer standing under rule 38.11(1).</p> <p>
  [32] The following cases which have considered whether a stranger to a proceeding 
  was a person affected by an ex parte order, or an order made without notice 
  to him or her, within the meaning of rule 37.14(1) or rule 38.11(1), all determine 
  standing on the ground that the order sought to be set aside or varied affected 
  the moving party's propriety or economic interests:</p> <p>
  (1) The administrator of an estate of a deceased person had standing to move 
  to set aside an order appointing an administrator ad litem to represent the 
  estate of the deceased in an action against him commenced before his death: 
  McLean v. Allen (1898), 18 P.R. 255 (Ont. Sup. Ct.).</p> <p>
  (2) A person claiming to be entitled to moneys attached pursuant to a garnishee 
  order obtained with notice to her, was a person affected by the order: Canada 
  Lumber Co. Limited v. Whatmough (1923), 23 O.W.N. 584 (Ex.).</p> <p>
  (3) The defendant's motor vehicle insurer was affected by an order renewing 
  a writ of summons because it could be liable to indemnify the plaintiff for 
  any damages recovered from the defendant: Palmateer v. Bach (1976), 9 O.R. (2d) 
  693 (High Ct.).</p> <p>
  (4) A mortgagee's interests as a secured creditor were affected by an order 
  expediting the sale of condominium units and requiring it to discharge its mortgage: 
  Unical Properties v. 784688 Ontario Ltd., [1993] O.J. No. 2039 (Gen. Div.).</p> <p>
  (5) The Government of Canada was affected by an order in a garnishee proceeding 
  that contemplated that it would exceed its statutory authority and pay out money 
  in a manner other than as authorized by statute: Beattie v. Ladouceur (1995), 
  23 O.R. (3d) 225.</p> <p>
  Order obtained on a motion without notice</p> <p>
  [33] As I have explained, I have decided this appeal on the ground that the 
  appellants were not &quot;persons&quot; affected by the sealing order. Strictly 
  speaking, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider the other elements of rule 
  37.14(1). However, to complete my analysis I find it helpful to consider a further 
  element of the rule, even though it does not enter into my decision.</p> <p>
  [34] As I have observed, prior to the introduction of the present Rules of Civil 
  Procedure in 1985 the relevant rules contained the term &quot;ex parte order&quot;. 
  That term was replaced by &quot;motion without notice&quot; upon the introduction 
  of the present rules. This raises the question of whether the two terms have 
  the same meaning.</p> <p>
  [35] The meaning of an ex parte motion was considered in Broom v. Pepall (1911), 
  23 O.L.R. 630 at 634 (Div. Ct.) in the oft quoted passage from the reasons of 
  Riddell J.:</p> <p>
  The order made in the first instance was not an ex parte order. That term is 
  applied only to such orders as the party obtains without the attendance of the 
  other, without his consent, and solely on his (the applicant's) own shewing. 
  Interim orders for injunction, orders of ne exeat, for production, and the like, 
  may be mentioned - and many different kinds are well known to the practitioner: 
  some of them are to be found referred to in Muir Mackenzie (1911), pp. 754-755. 
  But an order obtained by one party upon the written consent of another is not 
  an ex parte order, in the true sense or in the sense of the Rule.</p> <p>
  [36] One of the changes to the rules made by the Rules of Civil Procedure was 
  that of style. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Morden, the Chairman of the Special 
  Sub Committee that prepared the Rules of Civil Procedure, in his seminal article 
  &quot;An Overview of the Rules of Civil Procedure of Ontario&quot; (1984) 5 
  Advocates' Q. 257 at 261:</p> <p>
  Style. The general approach is to use the clearest and most direct words and 
  expressions in carrying out the intended policy. One example of this approach 
  is the replacement of Latin terms, such as ad litem, lis pendens, and fieri 
  facias, with plain English. This feature of the rules may be of greater benefit 
  to the neophyte than a member of the cognoscenti.</p> <p>
  [37] Thus, in the same way that the term &quot;certificate of pending litigation&quot; 
  (Rule 42) replaced &quot;lis pendens&quot; and the term &quot;litigation guardian&quot; 
  (Rule 7) replaced &quot;guardian ad litem&quot;, it would follow that &quot;motion 
  without notice&quot; replaced &quot;ex parte motion&quot;. If this is so, it 
  appears that rule 37.14(1)(a) and rule 38.11(1) may not serve their intended 
  due process function. I say this because both rules would not accord standing 
  to a stranger to a proceeding who is affected by an order obtained by motion 
  or application brought without notice to the stranger, but would grant standing 
  only to a party where an order was obtained without notice to the party, on 
  the reasoning that &quot;motion without notice&quot; has the same meaning as 
  &quot;ex parte motion&quot;.</p> <p>
  [38] This problem is highlighted when the former rules are compared to the present 
  rules. Both former rules 536 and 219 confer standing on a party affected by 
  an ex parte order. Similarly, former rule 215 requires service of a notice of 
  motion on &quot;all parties affected by the order sought&quot;. On the other 
  hand, both rules 37.14(1) and 38.11(1) confer standing on a person affected 
  by an order or judgment obtained without notice, while rule 37.07(1) requires 
  service of a motion on &quot;any person or party who will be affected by the 
  order sought&quot; [emphasis added]. In my view, in regard to rules 37.14(1) 
  and 38.11(1) this gives rise to the question: Without notice to whom? To a stranger, 
  being a &quot;person&quot;? To the other party, or parties, in the proceeding 
  in which the order was obtained, which would be the result if an order without 
  notice has the same meaning as ex parte order? Or, to both? From my reading 
  of the cases, courts have not been troubled by this concern as they appear to 
  have read rules 37.14(1) and 38.11(1) as if they read &quot;an order or judgment 
  obtained without notice to the non party&quot; seeking to set aside or vary 
  the order or judgment impugned. For example, it is apparent from the media cases 
  that the courts have read &quot;an order obtained without notice&quot; to mean 
  without notice to the newspaper, or other media non party, seeking to set aside 
  a sealing order. See, e.g., National Bank of Canada v. Melnitzer (1991), 5 O.R. 
  (3d) 234 (Gen. Div.).</p> <p>
  [39] Because of the view that I hold with respect to the outcome of this appeal, 
  it is unnecessary to resolve these questions. The better approach may be to 
  refer the relevant rules to the Civil Rules Committee for its review. However, 
  for the assistance of the Committee I would add the following observations.</p> <p>
  [40] When the Civil Rules Committee introduced rule 37.14(1) in 1985 and substituted 
  &quot;person&quot; for &quot;party&quot; in former Rule 219, it is reasonable 
  to infer that the Committee intended to broaden the scope of Rule 219 to enable 
  non parties, as well as parties, to move to set aside or vary an order affecting 
  them. The same may be said about rule 38.11(1). In addition, it is likely that 
  the Committee intended &quot;person&quot; in rule 37.14(1) to include &quot;party&quot;, 
  to maintain parity with rule 37.07(1) where the expression &quot;any person 
  or party&quot; is used. If these inferences are correct, the meaning of rule 
  37.14(1)(a) would confer standing upon any person or party affected by an order 
  obtained on motion without notice to him or to her. In my view, to read the 
  rule differently would result in an absurdity.</p> <p>
  [41] The absurdity can be illustrated in this way. If &quot;person&quot; is 
  read as meaning only a non party, then a party to proceeding who is affected 
  by an order obtained without notice to him or to her, or who fails to appear 
  on a motion through accident, mistake or insufficient notice, has no standing 
  under rule 37.14(1). If &quot;motion without notice&quot; is read as &quot;ex 
  parte motion&quot;, then a non party's standing under rule 37.14(1) would be 
  limited to a motion brought without notice to one of the parties to a proceeding.</p> <p>
  [42] I doubt that these were the intended results when rule 37.14(1) was introduced 
  in 1985. In this regard, it is helpful to note that in G. D. Watson &amp; C. 
  Perkins, Holmested &amp; Watson, Ontario Civil Procedure, looseleaf (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2002) at pp. 37-55, in their discussion of rule 37.14(1)(a), the authors 
  consider that its purpose is to permit &quot;a person affected by an order obtained 
  without notice to him or her&quot; to seek to set aside or vary the order. As 
  I observed earlier, the giving of notice to those whose rights may be affected 
  by the result of the motion and affording them the opportunity to participate 
  in the motion, is an essential ingredient of due process. As I have illustrated, 
  as worded the rule does not clearly fulfill its purpose. Of course, it is for 
  the Civil Rules Committee, and not for the court, to rewrite the rule if necessary.</p> <p>
  [43] A similar analysis applies to rule 38.11(1), which the Civil Rules Committee 
  may also wish to review.</p> <p>
  Conclusion</p> <p>
  [44] In summary, rule 37.14(1)(a), under which the appellants moved to set aside 
  Caswell J.'s sealing order is designed to enable an order to be set aside or 
  varied by those who have, or can acquire, standing under the rule. It does not 
  give standing to non parties to the proceeding in which the order was obtained, 
  such as the appellants, or possibly to parties to the proceeding, who are unable 
  to satisfy the two conditions contained in the rule. Thus, a non party who desires 
  to set aside or vary an order must show that he or she has a direct interest 
  in doing so, in the sense of establishing that he or she is affected by the 
  order, and that the order was obtained without notice to him or her. As I have 
  indicated, in the view that I hold of the merits of this appeal, it is sufficient 
  to consider only whether the appellants are affected by the sealing order.</p> <p>
  [45] In my view, the starting point in determining whether the appellants are 
  affected by the sealing order is rule 37.07(1), which provides that a notice 
  of motion &quot;shall be served on any person or party who will be affected 
  by the order sought&quot;. I say this because the term &quot;affected by&quot; 
  in rule 37.07(1) necessarily includes the same meaning of the term in rule 37.14(1). 
  If the appellants should have received notice of the sealing order motion as 
  persons who would be affected by it, it would follow that they have standing 
  under rule 37.14(1)(a) to set it aside.</p> 
<p> [46] I am satisfied that the possibility that financial information about 
  Mr. Ivandaev, or his companies, contained in the matrimonial court file might 
  have assisted the appellants in their defence of the commercial litigation, 
  thus requiring service of the notice of motion on the appellants is far removed 
  from the direct effects on the proprietary or economic interests of a non?party 
  considered in the cases that I have reviewed that have been found sufficient 
  to constitute the non?party a person affected by an order or judgment within 
  the meaning of rules 37.07(1), 37.14(1) and 38.11(1). Although I acknowledge 
  that &quot;affected&quot; is capable of a very large meaning, and it may be 
  said that the information which the appellants' counsel obtained from the sealed 
  file may be of assistance to the appellants in their defence of the commercial 
  litigation, that is not the effect contemplated by the rule. Moreover, it is 
  to be remembered that the broad discovery and production mechanism of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure is available to the appellants to enable them to obtain from 
  Mr. Ivandaeva information relevant to the commercial litigation.</p>
<p>
  [47] Nor can it be said that any Charter right of the appellants has been infringed 
  by the sealing order, similar to the Charter rights affected by the sealing 
  orders considered in the media cases.</p> <p>
  [48] It follows, therefore, that as the appellants are not affected by the sealing 
  order they did not have standing under rule 37.14(1) to move to set aside or 
  vary the order. Consequently, the motion judge was correct in her finding that 
  the appellants were not persons upon whom it was necessary to serve the notice 
  of motion requesting an order to seal the court file in Ivandaev v. Ivandaeva.</p> <p>
  [49] Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the 
  motion judge applied the correct standard of review of Caswell J.'s sealing 
  order under rule 37.14(1)(2), nor is it necessary to interpret &quot;an order 
  obtained on motion without notice&quot;.</p> <p>
  [50] In addition, I would add that there is a very different category of interest 
  that does not fall within the category of proprietary or economic interest that 
  would constitute a non party a person affected by an order, thereby requiring 
  that a notice of motion be served upon him or her. I refer, for example, to 
  essentially procedural motions to add a person as a party to a proceeding, to 
  obtain discovery or production from a non party or to obtain leave to commence 
  a third party claim out of time. Clearly, the appellants do not fall into this 
  category.</p> <p>
  [51] From the foregoing discussion, it also follows that the motion judge was 
  correct in ordering compliance with the sealing order.</p> <p>
  Result</p> <p>
  [52] For all the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeals with costs. The 
  parties are invited to make written submissions about the scale and amount of 
  costs. The respondents are to file their submissions no later than 15 days after 
  the release of these reasons, and the appellants submissions are to be filed 
  no later than 10 days thereafter.</p> <p>
