<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Izzard accepts that his counsel did not seek an adjournment before 
  O'Connell J. for the purpose of cross-examining on Mr. Waldron's affidavit. 
  Accordingly, the submission he advanced to this effect should not have been 
  made.</p>
<p>[2] Although it is clear that the appellant's counsel did object to the admissibility 
  of some parts of Mr. Waldron's affidavit in its factum, it is not clear that 
  he made this assertion orally. The best view of this issue is that counsel was 
  prepared to argue the case on the basis of the material filed and did not seek 
  the trial of an issue.</p>
<p>[3] Having regard to the foregoing, we shall review the judgment under appeal 
  to determine whether or not it is reasonably supportable by admissible evidence. 
  The chief basis for concluding that some of the evidence is not admissible is 
  non-compliance with rule 39.01(5).</p>
<p>[4] Generally, we take into account, in considering the evidence, the reasonableness 
  of interpreting it in the light of the fact that Mr. Izzard's activities, whatever 
  they were, were all in aid of advancing the interests of Skyline Executive Properties 
  Inc.</p>
<p>[5] We turn now to the paragraphs in the formal order under appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Paragraph 1. In our view, this paragraph is reasonably supported 
  by the evidence that showed that Mr. Izzard carried on his law practice in his 
  rented unit.</p>
<p class="indent"> Paragraph 2. This paragraph is reasonably supported by the 
  personal knowledge set forth in paragraphs 10, 13, 14 and 16 in the Waldron 
  affidavit.</p>
<p class="indent"> Paragraph 3. This paragraph is reasonably supported by the 
  personal knowledge set forth in paragraphs 13, 14, 20 and 21 in the Waldron 
  affidavit.</p>
<p class="indent">Paragraph 4. This paragraph is reasonably supported by the personal 
  knowledge set forth in paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 in the Waldron affidavit.</p>
<p class="indent">Paragraph 5. In the view of the majority of the court, this 
  paragraph is reasonably supported by the personal knowledge set forth in paragraphs 
  10 and 15 in the Waldron affidavit.</p>
<p>Paragraph 6. This paragraph is reasonably supported by the personal knowledge 
  set forth in paragraphs 12, 13, 14, 22, 24, 25 and 26 in the Waldron affidavit.</p>
<p>[6] We do not think that the appellant's affidavit shows any serious contradiction 
  of the evidence upon which we rely in support of the orders made.</p>
<p>[7] Armstrong J.A. does not agree with the conclusion of the majority respecting 
  paragraph 5 of the formal order under appeal. In his view, there is insufficient 
  evidence to support a finding of distribution of written material.</p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. [Costs submissions] The respondent 
  is entitled to its costs of this appeal which we fix in the amount of $7,500 
  including disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
