<p>On appeal from the Order of Justice Wailan Low of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated January 16, 2003, reported at [2003] O.J. No. 198.</p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal from the Order of Low J. concerns the application of the Hague 
  Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Can.T.S. 1983, 
  No. 35, and in particular whether the uncertain immigration status of the custodial 
  parent and the child in the child's country of habitual residence is grounds 
  to refuse to apply the Convention. The motion judge found that the immigration 
  status was a basis for refusing to order the return of the six-year old child 
  to his mother in the United States. In my view, in the circumstances of this 
  case, there were no grounds to refuse to apply the Convention. Accordingly, 
  I would allow the appeal and order that the child be returned to his mother.</p>
<p>
  [2] At the opening of the appeal, the appellant applied to file fresh evidence, 
  which I will outline later in these reasons. I would not admit the fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant, Suheila Mouammar, lived with the respondent, Gustavo Jabbaz, 
  in Toronto, for three years from 1995 to October 1998. They have one son, Mateos, 
  who is six years of age. In these reasons, I will refer to the appellant and 
  respondent as the mother and father respectively. The parents and Mateos are 
  Canadian citizens.</p>
<p>
  [4] The couple separated in October 1998 and in February 1999 they signed a 
  separation agreement. Both parties were represented by counsel. Under the agreement, 
  the couple shares joint custody of Mateos, but his primary residence is with 
  the mother. The father agreed that the mother could relocate with Mateos outside 
  of Ontario and the agreement expressly acknowledged that the mother intended 
  to relocate with the child to Los Angeles. At the time the agreement was being 
  negotiated, the mother had begun a relationship with Robert de Vico, a permanent 
  resident of the United States. Mr. de Vico sometimes worked for long periods 
  outside of California and so the agreement also provides that the mother may 
  change Mateos' residence to a place other than California by giving the father 
  written notice. The agreement gives the mother ultimate decision-making authority 
  if she and Mateos reside outside Ontario. The father is to have &quot;such generous 
  access as is reasonable in the circumstances if the child is residing outside 
  of Ontario&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [5] The mother and Mateos did in fact relocate to Los Angeles. She anticipated 
  that she would marry Mr. de Vico and that she and Mateos would acquire permanent 
  residence through her partner. Mateos lived with his mother for 3&frac12; years 
  in Los Angeles. The mother and Mr. de Vico had a child, Luca. They did not marry 
  as expected, and the relationship ended acrimoniously in the summer of 2002, 
  while Mateos was on an access visit with his father in Toronto. The mother was 
  required to leave the home and she stayed temporarily with friends. Litigation 
  in California ensued over custody and support for Luca.</p>
<p>
  [6] Because of the mother's unsettled state in the summer of 2002, the parties 
  agreed that the father would prolong his summer access. Later, at the end of 
  July, when the father was to return Mateos to the mother, she agreed that it 
  would be better for Mateos to stay with the father for a further time. In late 
  August 2002, the mother came to Toronto and had discussions with the father 
  about who should take care of Mateos. There was conflicting evidence before 
  the motion judge on the outcome of these discussions. She found that the parties 
  agreed that Mateos would only live temporarily with the father until the mother 
  re-established herself. In the meantime, with the mother's consent, the father 
  enrolled Mateos in a Toronto school.</p>
<p>
  [7] In October 2002, the mother and a friend moved into the large home of a 
  mutual friend, Andrew Beath, a retired businessman. Mr. Beath is Canadian but 
  is a permanent resident of the United States. Mr. Beath figures in the fresh 
  evidence dealt with below. The mother then told the father that her situation 
  had stabilized and she wished to have Mateos returned to her. The father refused.</p>
<p>
  [8] On December 10, 2002, a California court ordered that Luca spend equal time 
  with the mother and Mr. de Vico. Mr. de Vico also pays the mother child support 
  for Luca. A court-appointed social worker inspected the mother's living arrangements 
  and had no concerns. An assessor will make recommendations to the California 
  court as to the most appropriate long-term arrangement for Luca. The mother 
  expected that report would be available in April 2003.</p>
<p>
  The mother's immigration status</p>
<p>
  [9] As indicated, the mother is a Canadian citizen. She has worked in California 
  as a part-time translator and consultant for Dream Works SKG and worked for 
  the World Music Festival in Los Angeles. She also performs as a sacred dancer 
  at weddings and other functions. Her contract with Dream Works has now been 
  renewed for a third year. Her immigration status in the United States is, at 
  best, uncertain. The motion judge described the mother and Mateos as being &quot;illegal 
  aliens&quot;. The mother does not have a &quot;green card&quot;. When she moved 
  to the United States, she expected that she and Mr. de Vico would marry and 
  this would lead to the regularizing of her immigration status.</p>
<p>
  [10] In an affidavit filed before the motion judge, the mother describes her 
  status and that of Mateos as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> 64. Because I am a Canadian citizen, I may remain in the United 
  States as a visitor for six months from the most recent day on which I entered 
  the country. I can renew my visitors status at any time by leaving the United 
  States and re-entering. This is what many Canadians do who live in the United 
  States for extended periods, but who do not have permanent residence.</p>
<p class="indent">65. Accordingly, if Mateos returns to California with me, he 
  will have the same visitors status there as I do. This is the same status under 
  which he has lived in California up to now and, contrary to what Gustavo says, 
  it has never before been of concern to him. It should certainly not be accepted 
  now as a reason for Mateos to remain in Toronto.</p>
<p>
  [11] On the motion, the mother, without objection, filed a letter from Glenn 
  Kawahara, a Californian attorney specializing in United States Immigration and 
  Naturalization law. In the letter he states that a Canadian citizen can enter 
  the United States, without a visa, for temporary purposes for a period of six 
  months. If the temporary purpose is not accomplished within the six months, 
  it is possible to obtain extensions of stay in increments of six months. A legitimate, 
  temporary purpose would be to participate in court proceedings in the United 
  States. It will be recalled that the mother is in litigation with Mr. de Vico 
  over the custody and support of Luca.</p>
<p>
  [12] Apparently without objection, the father was permitted to file a printout 
  from a United States Immigration Services web-site. The motion judge interpreted 
  the information on the web-site as providing that Canadians can only gain lawful 
  entry as visitors:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) If the purpose of their trip to the United States is for 
  business, pleasure or medical treatment,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) If they plan to stay for a specific limited period, and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) They have a residence outside the United States as well 
  as other binding ties that will ensure their departure from the United States 
  at the end of the visit.</p>
<p>
  The father's difficulties in travelling with Mateos</p>
<p>
  [13] In his affidavit, the father set out the difficulties he has had in travelling 
  with Mateos in the United States. He attributes these difficulties to the uncertain/illegal 
  immigration status of the mother and Mateos. While the mother disputed some 
  of these claims, the motion judge accepted the father's evidence that he has 
  had difficulties in getting the child back into the United States following 
  an access visit in Canada. The motion judge also accepted that in 2000, the 
  mother insisted that the father exercise his summer access in California because 
  there was a real possibility that the child would not be permitted to re-enter 
  the United States after leaving. In direct communication and through his lawyer, 
  the father has urged the mother to regularize her immigration status.</p>
<p>
  The litigation</p>
<p>
  [14] On December 2, 2002, the father moved, without notice, in the Ontario courts 
  for an order for interim custody of Mateos. Ferrier J. ordered that on an interim 
  interim basis Mateos reside with the father and that the mother not remove Mateos 
  more than 25 kilometres from the City of Toronto. </p>
<p>
  [15] The father's motion for interim custody was made returnable on December 
  19, 2002. At the same time the mother brought a cross-motion under the Hague 
  Convention. In accordance with Article 16 of the Convention the motion judge 
  determined the mother's cross-motion first.</p>
<p>
  THE LEGISLATION</p>
<p>
  [16] Section 46 of the Children's Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, incorporates 
  the provisions of the Hague Convention into Ontario law. This appeal principally 
  concerns Article 13 of the Convention, which sets out the limited circumstances 
  in which the court is not required to return a child to his or her country of 
  habitual residence. Article 13 and the other relevant parts of the Convention 
  are the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> Article 1</p>
<p class="indent">The objects of the present Convention are:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed 
  to or retained in any Contracting State; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the 
  law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting 
  States.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 3</p>
<p class="indent">The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered 
  wrongful where:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, 
  an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of 
  the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the 
  removal or retention; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually 
  exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for 
  the removal or retention.</p>
<p class="indent">The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) above, 
  may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative 
  decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of 
  that State.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 4</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident 
  in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights. 
  The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 12</p>
<p class="indent">Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms 
  of Article 3 and, at the date of commencement of the proceedings before the 
  judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child 
  is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful 
  removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the 
  child forthwith.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Article 13</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial 
  or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the 
  return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its 
  return establishes that:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the person, institution or other body having the care of 
  the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the 
  time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced 
  in the removal or retention; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose 
  the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in 
  an intolerable situation.</p>
<p class="indent">The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to 
  order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned 
  and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to 
  take account of its views.</p>
<p class="indent">In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, 
  the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information 
  relating to the social background of the child provided by the Central Authority 
  or other competent authority of the child's habitual residence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  THE REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [17] The motion judge held that there were two issues to be decided on the mother's 
  cross-motion: first, whether the mother acquiesced in the retention of the child 
  in Ontario and second, whether the child would be in an intolerable situation 
  if returned to California. It is implicit in her reasons that the motion judge 
  found that Mateos was habitually resident in California within the meaning of 
  Article 4 and had been wrongfully retained within the meaning of Article 3. 
  The motion judge found that the mother did not acquiesce in the retention of 
  the child in Ontario within the meaning of Article 13(a) of the Convention. 
  The father does not contest that finding on this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [18] The motion judge concluded that an order should not be made returning the 
  child to the United States. She found that this would put the child in an intolerable 
  position within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Convention, and that such 
  an order would be contrary to public policy. The important parts of her reasons 
  are the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> In the absence of the child's immigration status being regularized 
  such that he may lawfully enter the United States as a person intending to reside 
  there, he could only lawfully enter as a visitor. At present, a representation 
  to the U.S. government that the child enters the United States as a visitor 
  would be untrue. If he were to enter into the United States on that misrepresentation, 
  the entry would be unlawful. The child would be an illegal alien. If a true 
  declaration were made at frontier that the intention was that the child would 
  reside in the United States, he would not at present qualify as a visitor and 
  would not be permitted entry. Therefore a court order requiring the return of 
  the child to the United States would be incapable of being effected in a lawful 
  manner.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I am of the view that the making of an order requiring the return 
  of the child to the United States would, in the circumstances before me, be 
  both contrary to public policy and would put the child into an intolerable position. 
  Accordingly, an order will not be made at this time.</p>
<p>
  THE FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [19] At the opening of the appeal, the mother applied to have the court admit 
  fresh evidence. The evidence consists of an affidavit of Mr. Beath, the man 
  with whom the mother has been living since her break-up with Mr. de Vico, and 
  an affidavit of a California attorney. Mr. Beath states that on April 3, 2003 
  (a week before the hearing of the appeal) he married the mother. He also states 
  that he is a permanent resident of the United States and is eligible to become 
  a United States citizen. He has begun that process and believes that he will 
  become a citizen by August 2003. Once he becomes a United States citizen, the 
  mother may apply to become a permanent resident. </p>
<p>
  [20] The California attorney, Mr. Kawahara, confirms Mr. Beath's eligibility 
  for U.S. citizenship and that once he becomes a citizen he will be able to petition 
  for his now wife to become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. At the same 
  time he will be able to petition for Mateos as his stepson. That process should 
  take a further seven months. Mr. Beath could also petition for his wife to become 
  a permanent resident while he is a permanent resident but the waiting period 
  would be considerably longer, perhaps five years. The affidavit concludes with 
  a statement that while the permanent residence applications are being processed, 
  &quot;with proper admission documents issued by the BCIS [Bureau of Citizenship 
  and Immigration Services]&quot; it will be possible for the mother and her son 
  to travel between the United States and Canada. The affidavit is silent about 
  what that documentation might be or whether the mother and child could legally 
  remain in the United States for an extended period.</p>
<p>
  [21] The father opposes the admission of the fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Intolerable situation</p>
<p>
  [22] Since his birth, except for the access visits by the father following the 
  separation, Mateos has lived with his mother. There is absolutely no evidence 
  that this situation has been harmful to the child or that the mother's living 
  situation would in any way affect the child's physical or psychological well-being. 
  The fact that a California court has ordered that the mother's other child live 
  with her half of the time is a compelling indication that the child would not 
  be in any danger. The only issue then is whether the mother's uncertain, even 
  precarious, immigration status in the United States was justification for the 
  refusal of the motion judge to enforce the Hague Convention. For convenience, 
  I repeat the relevant parts of Article 13.</p>
<p class="indent"> Article 13</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial 
  or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the 
  return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its 
  return establishes that:</p>
<p class="indent">(b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose 
  the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in 
  an intolerable situation [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[23] The circumstances in which a court may refuse to order the return of a 
  child under Article 13 are exceptional. The risk of physical or psychological 
  harm or, as alleged in this case, an intolerable situation must be, as set out 
  in Article 13, &quot;grave&quot;. The use of the term &quot;intolerable&quot; 
  speaks to an extreme situation, a situation that is unbearable; a situation 
  too severe to be endured. </p>
<p>
  [24] Unlike virtually all other child welfare statutes, the test under the Hague 
  Convention and Article 13 in particular is not framed in terms of the best interests 
  of the child. The court to which the application is made under the Hague Convention 
  is not concerned with determining which parent should have custody of the child 
  using the best interests of the child test. Canada as a signatory to the Convention 
  and Ontario having implemented the Convention into domestic legislation have 
  made the policy choice that the best interest determination is to be made in 
  the courts of the child's habitual residence. In this case, at this time, that 
  is California. See Thomson v. Thomson (1994), 6 R.F.L. (4th) 290 (S.C.C.) at 
  paras. 42-45; Pollastro v. Pollastro (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 485 (C.A.) at paras. 
  18-28; Finizio v. Scoppio-Finizio (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 226 (C.A.) at paras. 
  27-29; and J.E.A. v. C.L.M. (2002) 220 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (N.S.C.A.) at paras. 
  23 30. As Cromwell J.A. said at para. 30 of the J.E.A. case:</p>
<p class="indent"> It follows that the Court which is asked to order return is 
  not to address the child's best interests in anything other than limited and 
  exceptional respects. Instead, the Court's primary obligation is to ensure the 
  return of the child to the place where those best interests ought to be determined: 
  see Thomson at para. 42. Consistent with this purpose, a judge considering an 
  application for return under the Convention is not to approach the task as he 
  or she would an application for interim or permanent custody. That would involve 
  determining what is in the best interests of the child, something which is to 
  be determined by the courts in the place of habitual residence. </p>
<p>
  [25] The uncertain immigration status of the mother and the child in the United 
  States do not create a grave risk that return of the child to the custody of 
  his mother in the United States, in accordance with the separation agreement, 
  would place the child in an intolerable situation. The bare fact itself of living 
  without regularized immigration status does not approach the very high threshold 
  required to fall under Article 13(b). In this case, the evidence shows that 
  while living in California, the child's development was &quot;very normal&quot;. 
  There is no reason to suspect that this would not continue to be the case upon 
  the child's return to California.</p>
<p>
  [26] In stating this, I do not suggest that uncertain immigration status can 
  never be a concern under Article 13. For example, if because of their immigration 
  status, the mother and child were deportable to another country in which the 
  child would face a grave risk of harm, then the Article 13 exception might be 
  made out. Thus, if upon their return to the United States, there was a grave 
  risk that the mother and child would be deported to some country in the midst 
  of serious sustained armed conflict, this might well be an intolerable situation. 
  But, that is hardly the case here. At worst, this mother and child, who are 
  both Canadian citizens, would be deported back to Canada. Obviously, deportation 
  is not a desirable situation but I cannot see how deportation to Canada could 
  create an intolerable situation for the child. </p>
<p>
  [27] It may well be that the father now regrets having made the agreement he 
  did with the mother when the couple separated. However, his remedy is not the 
  self-help remedy of retaining the child in breach of the agreement and the Hague 
  Convention, but in applying to the California courts for variation of the custody 
  and access terms, if so advised. Counsel for the father conceded that if Mateos 
  were returned to California, its courts would have jurisdiction over the child 
  and could entertain such an application, as would an Ontario court in comparable 
  circumstances under s. 22 of the Children's Law Reform Act. As Jennings J. said 
  in Medhurst v. Markle (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 178 (Gen. Div.) at 182, &quot;It 
  is to be presumed that the courts of another contracting state are equipped 
  to make, and will make, suitable arrangements for the child's welfare.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [28] There is absolutely no evidence that the California courts would be unable 
  to act to ensure the child's best interests. Any concerns about the effects 
  the child's uncertain immigration status might have on the child's welfare can 
  be fully aired before the California courts. It also seems to me that California 
  courts would be in a far better position to determine the relevancy of that 
  status. I think it highly undesirable that a Canadian court should be asked 
  to make such an assessment, much less to do so on the very scant &quot;evidence&quot; 
  proffered in this case in the form of a printout from the United States Immigration 
  Service web-site.</p>
<p>
  [29] The father fairly makes the point that the mother has had over three years 
  to clarify and legalize her immigration status in the United States. I agree 
  that it is unfortunate that the mother has not acted more expeditiously and 
  perhaps in a more straightforward fashion. However, it must be remembered that 
  she was expecting to marry Mr. de Vico and that this would apparently have provided 
  a simple route to permanent residency status in the United States. The relationship 
  collapsed in 2002 and the mother then found herself embroiled in custody and 
  support litigation with Mr. de Vico. The uncertain immigration situation that 
  resulted does not, however, indicate that Mateos would be placed in an intolerable 
  situation. For example, there is no evidence that Mateos would be denied schooling 
  or health care while in California. He attended pre-school while in California. 
  He apparently has a suitable residence with the mother who has raised him since 
  birth. Finally, although the father has had some difficulties in the past in 
  travelling with Mateos while exercising his access rights, the evidence shows 
  that in the end he has always been able to take Mateos back and forth across 
  the Canada/U.S. border. Any concerns over access should in any event be raised 
  in California courts.</p>
<p>
  [30] In her reasons, the trial judge relied upon Chan v. Chow (2001), 199 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 478 (B.C.C.A.), describing that case as raising a similar issue. The facts 
  of Chan are complex. Suffice it to say that the father, who had wrongfully removed 
  the daughter from Hong Kong, proved that within a few months of the motion the 
  mother and child would be forced to leave Hong Kong. Proudfoot J.A. said the 
  following at para. 62:</p>
<p class="indent"> An underlying purpose of the Convention is the achievement 
  of continuity in the residences of children. If Emily is returned to Hong Kong, 
  she will be forced to move once more in the next few months, an intolerable 
  situation for her in my mind [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [31] Proudfoot J.A. went on to catalogue a number of other reasons for finding 
  that the intolerable situation exception had been met. She found at para. 63 
  that a &quot;second and equally important reason is that [the mother] has had 
  a very unstable living pattern&quot; including abducting the child herself at 
  one point. As well, on a prior occasion the mother had left the child with a 
  relative in Mainland China without the father's knowledge. There was also &quot;the 
  added concern and grave risk that Emily will be 'hidden' from [the father] once 
  more&quot; (para. 65).</p>
<p>
  [32] In my view, Chan does not stand for the proposition that in every case, 
  movement of a child to another country within a few months of the child's return 
  in accordance with the Convention constitutes an intolerable situation. That 
  would set the intolerable situation test too low. Families, including children, 
  often have to move from town to town and even from country to country. Such 
  moves can be disruptive because they can interfere with schooling and making 
  friends. However, I would not describe every such situation as intolerable.</p>
<p>
  [33] In F. (R.) v. G. (M.), [2002] J.Q. No. 3568 (Que. C.A.) at para 30, Chamberland 
  J.A. said, &quot;The Hague Convention is a very efficient tool conceived by 
  the international community to dissuade parents from illegally removing their 
  children from one country to another. However, it is also, in my view, a fragile 
  tool and any interpretation short of a rigorous one of the few exceptions inserted 
  in the Convention would rapidly compromise its efficacy.&quot; I agree with 
  that observation. Refusing to enforce the Convention because the child might 
  have to move a short time later is not consistent with the rigorous interpretation 
  required and is inconsistent with the stated objects of the Convention to secure 
  the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained from the Contracting 
  State and to ensure that custody rights are respected. Such an interpretation 
  is, in my view, inconsistent with the thrust of the cases in this province such 
  as this court's decisions in Pollastro and Finizio. Continuity in residence 
  is desirable but some instability is not intolerable.</p>
<p>
  [34] That said, it seems to me that the result in Chan may also be explained 
  by the several other concerns noted by the Court of Appeal including the grave 
  risk that the mother would once again hide the child from the father, possibly 
  in Mainland China.</p>
<p>
  [35] Finally, unlike in Chan, the evidence in this case does not show that the 
  child would be forced to move once more in the next few months. However uncertain 
  the mother and child's immigration status in the U.S., they have been able to 
  live there for three and a half years and the mother has been able to access 
  the California courts to obtain custody and support for the other child.</p>
<p>
  [36] The motion judge's decision is &quot;entitled to deference and should not 
  be set aside unless she applied the wrong legal principles or made unreasonable 
  findings of fact&quot;: Katsigiannis v. Kottick-Katsigiannis (2001), 55 O.R. 
  (3d) 456 (C.A.) at para. 31. In my view, the motion judge did apply wrong legal 
  principles and in finding that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation 
  she drew unreasonable inferences from the facts.</p>
<p>
  Public policy</p>
<p>
  [37] As I read her reasons, the motion judge gave as an independent reason, 
  apart from intolerable situation, that enforcing the Convention in this case 
  would be contrary to public policy. She was concerned that the mother would 
  lie about her intentions to gain entry to the United States with the child. 
  At different points in her reasons, the motion judge referred to the mother 
  and child as being illegal aliens and that if they entered the United States 
  as visitors &quot;such representation is not truthful and both the mother and 
  child enter the United States fraudulently&quot;. As she put it, &quot;Therefore 
  a court order requiring the return of the child to the United States would be 
  incapable of being effected in a lawful manner.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [38] I do not agree with the motion judge's characterization of the public policy 
  issue. First, a Canadian court is in no position to determine whether or not 
  the mother and child are illegal aliens or whether any representations they 
  would make at the border would be fraudulent. That is a matter for the United 
  States authorities and, possibly, the California courts.</p>
<p>
  [39] Second, the motion judge's reasons give no weight to the competing policy 
  consideration as represented by Ontario's incorporation of the Hague Convention 
  into its domestic law. I repeat the observations of Chamberland J.A. in F. (R.) 
  v. G. (M.) at para. 30 that the Hague Convention is &quot;a fragile tool and 
  any interpretation short of a rigorous one of the few exceptions inserted in 
  the Convention would rapidly compromise its efficacy.&quot; That means that 
  courts should be very wary of grafting new public policy exceptions on to the 
  Convention in the face of the very clear public policy represented in the Convention 
  itself.</p>
<p>
  [40] Third, the motion judge's conclusion gives no weight to the father's own 
  position. He has retained the child in breach of the separation agreement that 
  he entered into with the mother. Given that the test for Article 13(b) is not 
  met, he is thus in contravention of s. 46 of the CLRA and of the Hague Convention, 
  wrongfully retaining a child in Canada.</p>
<p>
  [41] Finally, I am concerned about using a parent's uncertain or precarious 
  immigration status, short of an intolerable situation, as a basis for refusing 
  to enforce the Hague Convention. This gives to one parent a potentially potent 
  weapon to use against the other parent in custody disputes. Parents with uncertain 
  immigration status are already in a vulnerable position and I would regret sending 
  a message that would further marginalize them and deny them access to the protections 
  intended by the Convention.</p>
<p>
  [42] In her reasons, the motion judge relied upon the decision of the Newfoundland 
  Court of Appeal in Bursey v. Bursey (1999), 47 R.F.L. (4th) 1. In that case, 
  the court refused to enforce an indemnity clause in a domestic contract because 
  the purpose of the clause was to discourage the wife from reporting her husband's 
  failure to pay tax to the relevant authorities. The court held at para. 25 that 
  &quot;it is well settled that a contractual provision whose ultimate design 
  is to perpetrate a fraud on a public taxing authority is contrary to public 
  policy and unenforceable&quot;. In my view, that principle and the more general 
  principle that courts will not lend their assistance to a party seeking to enforce 
  rights by relying on an illegal agreement are of limited application to Hague 
  Convention proceedings. I have already indicated my view that this province's 
  public policy is reflected in the incorporation of the Convention into the CLRA. 
  Moreover, the motion judge was not being asked to enforce a separation agreement 
  tainted by illegality. </p>
<p>
  [43] Finally, I do not see why this court should prejudge how the United States 
  immigration authorities will deal with the question of the legality of the child's 
  entry. In that respect, I note that it is not at all a foregone conclusion that 
  Mateos would be refused entry even if he were judged an &quot;illegal alien&quot;. 
  For example, see Roszkowski v. Roszkowska, 644 A. 2d 1150 (Ch. Div. 1993) at 
  para. 21, where the court held that since under United States law treaties are 
  &quot;the supreme law of the land&quot;, the Hague Convention &quot;should take 
  precedence over any conflicting immigration law&quot;.</p>
<p>
  THE FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [44] I have not found it necessary to rely upon the fresh evidence in finding 
  that the motion judge erred in holding that returning Mateos to the United States 
  would place him in an intolerable situation and be contrary to public policy. 
  I would therefore not admit the fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  THE REMEDY</p>
<p>
  [45] The question of the appropriate order to make in this case is not a simple 
  one. While, as I have said, the question of entry into the United States is 
  for the U. S. officials, equally, Ontario courts have no right to pre-empt that 
  decision by simply ordering that the child be returned to the United States. 
  Accordingly, I would make the order that the child be returned to the United 
  States, contingent on the child being permitted entry into the United States. 
  At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the mother agreed that this was an 
  appropriate condition.</p>
<p>
  [46] I have considered whether the contingency should be that the child be &quot;lawfully&quot; 
  permitted entry, or that the mother must &quot;truthfully&quot; represent her 
  status and that of her child. Because of the heavy weight I place on the public 
  policy as reflected in the Hague Convention, I do not think such terms are appropriate 
  or even enforceable.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [47] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Orders of Low J. and 
  Ferrier J., and order that, pursuant to the Hague Convention, Mateos Andres 
  Jabbaz Mouammar, born April 22, 1997, be returned forthwith to his mother, Suheila 
  Rolim Mouammar, in Los Angeles, provided that Mateos is permitted to enter the 
  United States by United States authorities.</p>
<p>
  [48] If the mother is seeking costs of the motion before Low J. and of the appeal 
  she may serve and file brief written submissions together with a bill of costs 
  within ten days of receipt of these reasons. The father shall serve and file 
  his submissions with respect to costs within ten days of receipt of the submissions 
  of the mother.</p>
