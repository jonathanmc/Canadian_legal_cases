<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Crown counsel acknowledges that this is an exceptional case in which, having 
  regard to the manner in which the appellant has turned her life around since 
  the commission of the offence, the interests of justice would not be served 
  by her incarceration. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the custodial sentence 
  of five months is set aside and, in its place, we substitute a conditional sentence 
  of five months on the terms agreed to by counsel and filed with the court. We 
  leave in place the 3-year period of probation and the provision for restitution 
  that was included in the probation order made by the sentencing judge. </p>
