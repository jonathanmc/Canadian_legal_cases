<p>On appeal from conviction for counselling murder and counselling unlawful bodily 
  harm by Justice John Jennings of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with 
  a jury, dated October 6, 1999.</p>
<p><br>
  MOLDAVER J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] On October 6, 1999, after trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted 
  under s. 464(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, of one count of 
  counselling the indictable offence of murder and two counts of counselling the 
  indictable offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm. On December 12, 1999, 
  the appellant was sentenced to an eighteen-month conditional sentence. He appeals 
  only from his convictions. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] At issue in this appeal is the requisite mental state for the crime of 
  counselling an indictable offence that is not committed. The trial judge instructed 
  the jury that the requisite mental state would be made out if the jury was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant &quot;spoke the words with the 
  intent that his advice or counselling [that the proposed victim be maimed or 
  killed] be accepted&quot; by the recipients of the advice.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appellant takes issue with that instruction. He submits that it defines 
  the mental state required for the crime of counselling too narrowly. In his 
  view, the jury should have been told that to convict, they also had to be satisfied 
  that the appellant intended the commission of the offences counselled (in this 
  case murder and/or unlawfully causing bodily harm). The appellant further submits 
  that if he has accurately identified the requisite mental state, he should be 
  acquitted because the Crown has never taken the position that he intended the 
  commission of the substantive offences.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] For reasons that follow, I am of the view that the appellant is correct 
  and that the jury should have been instructed as he contends. In view of this 
  and the Crown's concession that on this record, there is no basis for concluding 
  that the appellant intended that the substantive offences be committed, I am 
  satisfied that the convictions cannot stand and verdicts of acquittal must be 
  substituted.<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW OF FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[5] As the outcome of this appeal hinges on a legal determination, it is unnecessary 
  to dwell on the facts. The appellant is a general contractor. In October 1995, 
  he met Julia Bazos (&quot;Julia&quot;) and her mother Bessie Goldie (&quot;Bessie&quot;) 
  when he submitted a bid to renovate a duplex owned by Bessie and her husband. 
  In the course of his communications with Julia and Bessie, he learned that Julia 
  was having serious marital difficulties with her husband, Dr. Michael Bazos, 
  and that these difficulties had resulted in criminal charges being laid against 
  Dr. Bazos for assaulting Julia and sexually molesting their two children.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] According to the appellant, over the next several months, he began to fear 
  for Dr. Bazos's safety as a result of conversations with Julia and Bessie in 
  which they made it known that they wanted to have the doctor harmed or even 
  killed. By February 1996, his concern for the doctor's well-being had reached 
  a point where he felt the doctor should be warned. Before doing so, however, 
  he wanted to obtain some hard evidence to take to Dr. Bazos. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] To that end, on February 26, 1996, the appellant spoke to Julia and Bessie 
  on the telephone and he tape-recorded the conversations. While the tapes speak 
  for themselves, based on the conversations, it would have been open to the jury 
  to find that:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Julia and Bessie had given some thought to having Dr. Bazos maimed or killed.</li>
  <li>Julia had spoken to some furniture movers about her marital problems and 
    they had indicated a willingness to harm Dr. Bazos.</li>
  <li>The appellant was actively encouraging Julia and Bessie to have Dr. Bazos 
    harmed or killed and he was willing to make the necessary arrangements as 
    they wished.</ul>
   
<p> [8] Armed with these tapes, the appellant met with Dr. Bazos on February 26 
  and over the next few months, the doctor paid him $35,000 in cash. According 
  to the appellant, the payments were initially made out of a sense of gratitude 
  and latterly, to ensure the appellant's cooperation as a witness in the doctor's 
  upcoming criminal trial. 
<p>[9] With respect to the tape-recorded conversations, the appellant maintained 
  that it was not his intention to encourage Julia or Bessie to have Dr. Bazos 
  maimed or killed; rather, he simply wanted them to repeat on tape that which 
  the appellant believed they had already decided to do. He further testified, 
  without challenge by the Crown, that it was never his intention that any harm 
  come to Dr. Bazos. </p>
<p>[10] Julia and Bessie provided a different version. Apart from what might be 
  described as &quot;wishful thinking&quot; on their part, they denied telling 
  the appellant that they wanted to have Dr. Bazos harmed or killed. Julia admitted 
  that in the beginning, she confided in the appellant about her personal situation 
  because he was easy to talk to and she thought he cared about her. As time went 
  on however, she became alarmed by his efforts to convince her that she should 
  have her husband maimed or killed and she began to view him as a &quot;nutcase&quot;. 
  According to Julia, although she had no intention of going along with the appellant's 
  proposals, she became particularly concerned for her husband's safety after 
  the February 26 phone call. As a result of that call and a further conversation 
  with the appellant at her home later that day, she reported the appellant's 
  activities to the police on February 29, 1996.</p>
<p>[11] On the evening of February 29, the appellant received a message from the 
  police on his answering machine requesting that he be in touch with them. According 
  to the appellant, he returned the call but did not hear back from the police. 
  In May 1996, the appellant decided on his own to contact the police and he played 
  the tape-recorded conversations to them. The appellant met again with the police 
  in June 1996. For reasons that are not clear, it was not until October or November 
  of that year that he was arrested and charged with counselling.
<p>Trial judge's ruling on the requisite mental state for the offence of counselling 
  under s. 464(a) of the Code.</p>
<p>[12] After the evidence was completed, the trial judge heard submissions from 
  counsel on the mental state required for the crime of counselling an uncommitted 
  indictable offence. In his ruling, the trial judge accurately summarized the 
  position of the parties as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel disagree upon what mental element or mens rea 
  must be proved by the Crown if a conviction is to be obtained.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The position of the Crown is that considering the external 
  circumstances that existed to the knowledge of accused, the necessary mental 
  element is that the accused intended to speak the words [that] constituted counselling 
  of murder and that his words be taken seriously.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The position of the defence is that the Crown must prove 
  in addition to that, that the accused intended the act counselled to take place.</p>
<p>[13] The trial judge then reviewed a number of authorities and an article from 
  a leading text on criminal law. After noting that he had not been referred to 
  any binding authority &quot;directly on point&quot;, he continued as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, I will consider the purpose of Section 464. 
  It seems to me to be obvious that the evil it addresses is to prevent the incitement 
  to crime of those who might otherwise not so act. The fact that the crime is 
  not carried out is fortunate but irrelevant. The evil is that one would attempt 
  to persuade another to commit a crime. That is so because it does not matter 
  that the person being incited agrees or is persuaded to act criminally.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Can it be as counsel suggested in response to a question 
  from me, that the law refuses to punish under this section someone who counsels 
  another to commit murder knowing that his advice has been taken seriously, because 
  unbeknownst to the person being counselled, the counsellor is not serious or 
  has motives other than that the act counselled be carried out [emphasis in original].<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">By analogy of Section 264 of the Criminal Code, threatening. 
  That is another section where words spoken constitute the actus reus. Once the 
  threat is spoken, the external circumstances are complete. If it is proved that 
  the speaker intends that his words be taken seriously, the mental element is 
  made out. It is no defence for the speaker to say later that he never would 
  have carried out the threat conveyed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Section 22(2) of the Code makes the counsellor a party 
  to an offence committed in consequence of the counselling if the counsellor 
  knew or ought to have known the offence was likely to have been committed because 
  of the counselling.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is difficult for me to accept that parliament intended 
  a higher standard of actual intention for the lesser offence under Section 464.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, there is evidence upon which the jury 
  could find: One, the accused knew both women were emotionally fragile; two, 
  he knew they were very angry at the proposed victim and, according to the accused, 
  had prior thoughts of harming him; three, he intended that his suggestions to 
  them that the proposed victim be killed or maimed be taken seriously. Under 
  those external circumstances I propose to instruct the jury that the Crown must 
  prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused spoke the words with the intent 
  that his advice or counselling that Dr. Bazos be maimed or killed be accepted 
  by Mrs. Bazos and Mrs. Goldie [emphasis added].</p>
<p>The Charge<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The trial judge instructed the jury in accordance with his ruling. With 
  respect to the mental state required for the offence of counselling, he told 
  the jury that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; that [the appellant] spoke the words with the 
  intent that his advice or counselling that Dr. Bazos be maimed or killed be 
  accepted by Ms. Bazos and/or Mrs. Goldie.</p>
<p>[15] Later, after summarizing the position of the Crown, the trial judge turned 
  his attention to the defence and he outlined the essence of the appellant's 
  position as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; He [the appellant] said that his purpose in making 
  the phone call was not to persuade the two women to accept his advice that Dr. 
  Bazos should be maimed or killed, but to get them to confirm on tape what they 
  had told him earlier; that they had decided Dr. Bazos should be maimed or killed.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The trial judge then instructed the jury, in accordance with the principles 
  set out in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, that if they believed the appellant's 
  explanation regarding his intent or if that explanation left them in a state 
  of reasonable doubt, then the appellant was entitled to be acquitted. By its 
  verdict, it is apparent that the jury rejected the appellant's explanation.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] Against this backdrop, I turn to the legal issue at hand.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Relevant Criminal Code Provisions<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">22. (1) Where a person counsels another person to be 
  a party to an offence and that other person is afterwards a party to that offence, 
  the person who counselled is a party to that offence, notwithstanding that the 
  offence was committed in a way different from that which was counselled.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Every one who counsels another person to be a party 
  to an offence is a party to every offence that the other commits in consequence 
  of the counselling that the person who counselled knew or ought to have known 
  was likely to be committed in consequence of the counselling.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) For the purposes of this Act, &quot;counsel&quot; 
  includes procure, solicit or incite.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">s. 24. (1) Every one who, having an intent to commit 
  an offence, does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his 
  intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was 
  possible under the circumstances to commit the offence.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">s. 464. Except where otherwise expressly provided by 
  law, the following provisions apply in respect of persons who counsel other 
  persons to commit offences, namely,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) every one who counsels another person to commit 
  an indictable offence is, if the offence is not committed, guilty of an indictable 
  offence and liable to the same punishment to which a person who attempts to 
  commit that offence is liable; &#133;<br>
</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>[18] To the extent that there is any debate about the mental state required 
  for the offence of counselling, it tends to centre primarily, although not exclusively, 
  on whether the counsellor must intend the commission of the offence counselled 
  or whether recklessness in that regard will suffice. Apart from the present 
  case and one other (R. v. Balaban (1984), 13 W.C.B. 212 (Ont.Co.Ct.)), I know 
  of no other authority or writing that holds that the mental state of the counsellor 
  as to whether the offence counselled is or is not to be committed is irrelevant. 
  Other Canadian authorities<a href="#1">[1]</a>,<a name="r1"></a> scholarly writings<a href="#2">[2]</a>,<a name="r2"></a> 
  the U.S. Model Penal Code<a href="#3">[3]</a>,<a name="r3"></a> and studies 
  conducted by Law Reform Commissions in Canada and Great Britain<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  point not only in the opposite direction but indicate overwhelmingly that the 
  offence of counselling can only be made out upon proof that the counsellor intended 
  the commission of the offence(s) counselled.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] A good discussion of the issue is found in R. v. Hamilton, supra, where 
  the accused was charged under s. 464(a) of the Code with counselling various 
  indictable offences that were not committed. In rejecting the submission of 
  the Crown that &quot;the mens rea required for counselling is simply the intent 
  to counsel&quot;, Smith J. reviewed a number of Canadian authorities, including 
  R. v. Grossman, supra and R. v. Dionne (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 171 (N.B.C.A.), 
  leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, 38 C.C.C. (3d) vi, and at paras. 35 - 
  39, he concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the law is correctly set out in R. v. Grossman 
  (mens rea) and R. v. Dionne (actus reus). This conclusion is consistent with 
  the elements necessary for a finding of guilt in secondary liability. The actus 
  reus ought to be a substantial act in the furtherance of the offence, and the 
  mens rea an intent to further the offence. Put another way, no one should be 
  found guilty of furthering an offence without intending that the offence be 
  committed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Section 22 of the Criminal Code sets out the offence 
  of counselling an offence where an offence is subsequently committed. Under 
  s. 22(1), both the counsellor and the offender who commits the predicate offence 
  are parties to the offence. The essential elements of s. 22(1) are that the 
  offender committed the counselled offence (the element absent from s. 464), 
  the counsellor advised, recommended, instigated, or encouraged the offender 
  to commit the counselled offence (the actus reus), the offender committed the 
  counselled offence because the counsellor counselled him to commit that offence 
  (causation), and the counsellor knew or intended that his or her conduct would 
  cause the offender to actually commit the offence counselled (the mens rea of 
  intent that the actual offence would be committed). In other words, it is not 
  sufficient that the counsellor counsel the offence and intend his own actions. 
  The counsellor must also intend that his conduct will result in the offender 
  actually committing the offence counselled.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, counselling under s. 22(1) is a dual mens rea 
  offence. The first mens rea, the intent to counsel the offence, may be difficult 
  to distinguish from the actus reus. In many cases the actus reus will lead to 
  the making of an inference of mens rea. In my view, the McLeod [R. v. McLeod 
  (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 5 (B.C.C.A.)] case falls into this category.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The second mens rea requirement is the intention that 
  the offender actually carry out the offence.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I conclude that the mens rea requirement for counselling 
  a specific offence is the same whether or not the offence counselled is actually 
  committed. Where the offence is not committed, the counsellor must both intend 
  his own actions, i.e. to counsel the offence, and must also intend that the 
  offence be carried out [emphasis added].</p>
  
<p>[20] The view taken by Smith J. in R. v. Hamilton is shared by the learned 
  authors in Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law, supra. At p. 276 of that text, the 
  requisite mental state for the crime of incitement is explained as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Mens rea<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As in the case of counselling and abetting, it must 
  be proved that D knew of (or deliberately closed his eyes to) all the circumstances 
  of the act incited which are elements of the crime in question. As with attempts, 
  he must intend the consequences in the actus reus. If D incites E to inflict 
  grievous bodily harm upon P, D is not guilty of incitement to murder, though 
  both D and E will be guilty of murder if death should result from the infliction 
  of the intended harm. An intention to bring about the criminal result is of 
  the essence of incitement [footnote omitted] [emphasis added].</p>

<p>[21] Likewise, in LaFave and Scott, Substantive Criminal Law, supra, at Ch. 
  6, &sect;6.1, pp. 3 and 8-9, under the headings &quot;Solicitation&quot; and 
  &quot;Required Mental State and Act&quot;, the learned authors explain the offence 
  of soliciting and the required mental state:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Solicitation<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Assume that A wishes to have his enemy B killed, and 
  thus - perhaps because he lacks the nerve to do the deed himself - A asks C 
  to kill B. If C acts upon A's request and fatally shoots B, then both A and 
  C are guilty of murder. If, again, C proceeds with the plan to kill B, but he 
  is unsuccessful, then both A and C are guilty of attempted murder. If C agrees 
  to A's plan to kill B but the killing is not accomplished or even attempted, 
  A and C are nonetheless guilty of the crime of conspiracy. But what if C immediately 
  rejects A's homicidal scheme, so that there is never even any agreement between 
  A and C with respect to the intended crime. Quite obviously, C has committed 
  no crime at all. A, however, because of his bad state of mind in intending that 
  B be killed and his bad conduct in importuning C to do the killing, is guilty 
  of the crime of solicitation. For the crime of solicitation to be completed, 
  it is only necessary that the actor with intent that another person commit a 
  crime, have enticed, advised, incited, ordered or otherwise encouraged that 
  person to commit a crime. The crime solicited need not be committed. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Required Mental State and Act <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Although the crime of solicitation might be defined 
  quite simply as asking another person to commit an offense, this does not adequately 
  reflect either the mental element or act which must exist in order for the crime 
  to be completed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As to the required mental state, none is explicitly 
  stated in the usual common law definition of solicitation, and likewise none 
  is expressly set forth in several solicitation statutes. However, the acts of 
  commanding or requesting another to engage in conduct which is criminal would 
  seem of necessity to require an accompanying intent that such conduct occur, 
  and there is nothing in the decided cases suggesting otherwise. Virtually all 
  of the more recently enacted solicitation statutes avoid any doubt by setting 
  forth in specific terms the intent requirement. Some state the solicitor must 
  intend that an offense be committed, some that he must intend to promote or 
  facilitate its commission, and some others that he must intend that the person 
  solicited engage in criminal conduct.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, as to those crimes which are defined in terms 
  of certain prohibited results, it is necessary that the solicitor intend to 
  achieve that result through the participation of another. If he does not intend 
  such a result, then the crime has not been solicited, and this is true even 
  though the person solicited will have committed the crime if he proceeds with 
  the requested conduct and thereby causes the prohibited result [footnotes omitted] 
  [emphasis added].
</p>
<p>[22] In their discussion, LaFave and Scott refer to &sect; 5.02(I) of the U.S. 
  Model Penal Code. That provision reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person is guilty of solicitation to commit a crime 
  if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he commands, 
  encourages or requests another person to engage in specific conduct that would 
  constitute such crime or an attempt to commit such crime or would establish 
  his complicity in its commission or attempted commission [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>As the emphasized words make clear, to be guilty of the offence of solicitation, 
  the solicitor must intend that the crime solicited be carried out. Nothing less 
  will suffice.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] In Secondary Liability: Participation in Crime and Inchoate Offences, 
  supra, the Law Reform Commission of Canada undertook a thorough and comprehensive 
  review of the inchoate crimes of attempt, counselling and conspiracy. With respect 
  to the mental element required for such crimes, which the Commission broadly 
  described as &quot;furthering&quot; offences, the Commission rejected the notion 
  that recklessness as to the consequences should suffice. Rather, for reasons 
  explained in part below, the Commission concluded that criminal responsibility 
  should only attach to those who intend the consequences of their act:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">All this suggests that in a furthering offence mens 
  rea should be restricted to intent (direct or indirect). Criminal liability 
  should only apply to acts intended to further crimes or known as certain to 
  do so. It should not be incurred for acts which are merely very likely to do 
  so.<br>
  Would this be too restrictive? Suppose D lends X his gun knowing that X will 
  probably use it to murder Y. Should D not be liable for such recklessness? Surely, 
  the graver the probable offence, the more reprehensible the act of helping.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">To this there can be various answers. First, the graver 
  the probable offence, the smaller the likelihood that assistance will be given 
  without intent to see the crime committed - people do not usually lend guns 
  to known potential killers without intending them to use them. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Third, there is the ordinary meaning of words such as 
  &quot;attempting,&quot; &quot;counselling&quot; and &quot;inciting.&quot; Such 
  words imply an intent that the crime attempted and so forth be committed. One 
  who attempts to do something must aim at it, therefore to do it has to be his 
  purpose. One who incites another to do it must urge him on purpose, the purpose 
  being to get him to do it. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Law, of course, can use words in a special sense. For 
  reasons of convenience it may restrict the vague meaning of a word in popular 
  usage. &quot;Night,&quot; for example, has been defined by common law and subsequently 
  by Criminal Code section 2 as &quot;the period between nine o'clock in the afternoon 
  and six o'clock in the forenoon of the following day.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">With &quot;incitement&quot; and so forth, this has not 
  happened [the word &quot;incitement&quot; has not been given a special legal 
  meaning]. In law, as well as outside the law, incitement involves an intention 
  by the inciter to get the &quot;incitee&quot; to commit the offence incited. 
  Attempt involves intent by the attempter to complete the crime (pp. 30-31) [footnotes 
  omitted] [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
  <p>[24] In the end, the Commission identified five principles that it felt should 
  &quot;govern the mental element of secondary liability.&quot; The first of those 
  principles, found at p. 36 under the heading &quot;Conclusion&quot;, is directly 
  on point and reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) No one should be liable for furthering an offence 
  without intending that the offence be committed.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] The Law Reform Commission in Great Britain arrived at a similar conclusion 
  in its consultation paper Assisting and Encouraging Crime, supra. The Commission 
  made the following observation at p. 66 about the mental element required for 
  the offence of incitement:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The books are clear, however, that in addition to knowledge 
  of the circumstances and elements of the principal crime, the inciter must have 
  as his purpose the commission of the principal crime: &quot;An intention to 
  bring about the criminal result is of the essence of incitement&quot; [footnotes 
  omitted].<br>
</p>
<p>[26] Later, at p. 129, under the heading &quot;The mental element of the offence&quot;, 
  the Commission stated:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The general policy issue, much debated in connection 
  with assisting, as to whether the defendant must have the commission of the 
  principal crime as his purpose, should be much easier to resolve in the case 
  of encouraging crime. That is because the whole notion of encouraging, inciting 
  or exhorting the commission of a crime presupposes that the encourager wishes 
  that crime to be committed. As Ashworth puts it, in connection with the present 
  offence of incitement:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">&quot;The fault element in incitement is that D should 
  intend the substantive offence to be committed and should know the facts and 
  circumstances specified by that offence. This is unlikely to cause a problem 
  in most cases, since someone who either encourages or exerts pressure on another 
  person to commit an offence will usually, by definition, intend that offence 
  to be committed.&quot; [Andrew Ashworth, Principles of Criminal Law (Oxford: 
  Oxford University Press, 1991) at p. 417].<br>
</p>
<p>[27] Notably, in its provisional proposal urging the creation of a new crime 
  identified as the offence of &quot;encouraging crime&quot;, the Commission made 
  the following recommendations at p. 133:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We therefore suggest, for critical comment,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(1) A person commits the offence of encouraging crime 
  if he<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) solicits, commands or encourages another (&quot;the 
  principal&quot;) to do or cause to be done an act or acts which, if done, will 
  involve the commission of an offence by the principal; and <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) intends that that act or those acts should be done 
  by the principal; and <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) knows or believes that the principal, in so acting, 
  will do so with the fault required for the offence in question [footnotes omitted] 
  [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[28] As indicated, these and other authorities stand for the proposition that 
  the crime of counselling will only be made out upon proof that the counsellor 
  intended the commission of the crime counselled. Various reasons are cited for 
  rejecting recklessness as the standard. Chief among them is ensuring that criminal 
  liability does not attach to instances of counselling that may be casual or 
  accidental. The Great Britain Law Reform Commission expresses this concern as 
  follows &quot;&#133;there should be no danger of conduct that merely happens 
  to fortify P in his criminal inclinations, without that being D's intention 
  or purpose&#133;&quot; (p.129) A second rationale for rejecting mental element 
  of recklessness recognizes that this lowered standard may catch some legitimate 
  undercover crime investigation techniques that involve encouragement of crime, 
  with no intention that the crime counselled actually be carried out. (LaFave 
  and Scott, Substantive Criminal Law at Ch. 6 &sect;6.11, p.14; Glanville Williams, 
  Textbook of Criminal Law, 1st Ed. (London: Steven &amp; Sons, 1978 at p.386). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[29] Apart from those considerations, which I believe are sound, I can think 
  of no compelling reason why the requisite mental state for the inchoate crime 
  of counselling should be different from the mental state required for the inchoate 
  crimes of attempt and conspiracy. <br>
</p>
<p>[30] With respect to &quot;attempted&quot; crimes, under s. 24(1) of the Code, 
  the offender must intend to commit the desired offence (see R. v. Ancio (1984), 
  10 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 401 (S.C.C.)). As for the crime of conspiracy, it is settled 
  law that to be guilty, the offender must intend to commit the offence that forms 
  the subject of the agreement (see R. v. O'Brien, [1954] S.C.R. 666). Accordingly, 
  the question that must be asked is whether, as a matter of principle, there 
  is any basis for lowering the mental state required for the inchoate offence 
  of counselling. If such a basis exists, in my view, it can only be that the 
  rationale for criminalizing &quot;counselling&quot; differs from the rationale 
  for criminalizing &quot;attempts&quot; and &quot;conspiracies&quot;. And yet, 
  the Law Reform Commission of Canada draws no such distinction. On the contrary, 
  in its report at p. 6, the Commission explains the rationale for inchoate offences 
  in general as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The same arguments hold for inchoate crimes. Again, 
  if the primary act (for example, killing), is harmful, society will want people 
  not to do it. Equally, it would not want them even to try to do it, or to counsel 
  or incite others to do it. For while the act itself causes actual harm, attempting 
  to do it, or counselling, inciting or procuring someone else to do it, are sources 
  of potential harm - they increase the likelihood of that particular harm's occurrence. 
  Accordingly, society is justified in taking certain measures in respect of them: 
  outlawing them with sanctions, and authorizing intervention to prevent the harm 
  from materializing.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] There are some who maintain that the mental element for the crime of counselling 
  should be less onerous than that required for other inchoate crimes because 
  the crime of counselling is inherently more dangerous. The reasoning is that 
  in the case of counselling, even though the counsellor may not intend the commission 
  of a crime, the counsellor may nevertheless lose control of the situation once 
  the seed is planted in the recipient's mind. The point is made by Alexander 
  and Kessler at p. 1156 of their article &quot;Mens Rea and Inchoate Crimes&quot;, 
  (1997) 87 J. of Crim. L. and Criminology 1138, as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There is one further complication. In many cases, defendant 
  will not have complete control over whether he can withdraw his support from 
  the criminal enterprise. Therefore, he is not in an exactly parallel position 
  to the defendant who is planning to commit a crime himself but who can always 
  prevent the crime by changing his mind. Encouragement of another always creates 
  a risk that one will fail in an attempt to withdraw one's support, or that one 
  will be rendered incapable of withdrawing support. There is no analogue to this 
  problem when dealing with incomplete attempts or bare conspiracies. <br>
</p>
<p>[32] Alexander and Kessler rely heavily on this distinction in support of their 
  thesis that recklessness should suffice as the mental element for solicitation. 
  At pp. 1175-76 of their article, they write:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In solicitation and conspiracy, then, we have crimes 
  in which defendant's conduct is dangerous apart from his mental state. That 
  point in turn suggests that we rethink the mens rea requirements for these crimes. 
  Although the Model Penal Code requires a purpose that the crime be committed 
  as the mens rea for both solicitation and conspiracy, this requirement makes 
  no sense where the danger stems from the encouragement of others to commit the 
  crime. Recklessness should suffice as the mens rea for solicitation. Recklessness 
  with its notion of conscious disregard of unjustified (and substantial) risk, 
  takes into consideration all legitimate reasons one might have for conduct that 
  one realizes might be taken by someone else as encouragement to commit a crime 
  when the conduct's purpose is not such an encouragement.<br>
</p>
<p class="center">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Although an actor is not culpable for forming a criminal 
  intention or for taking an otherwise harmless step toward realizing that intention, 
  he is culpable for encouraging others to commit criminal acts, even if his purpose 
  is innocent, at least if he is reckless regarding the likelihood that they will 
  commit those acts [footnotes omitted] [emphasis in original].<br>
</p>
<p>[33] The trial judge appears to have been influenced by this distinction in 
  arriving at his conclusion that the requisite mental state for counselling will 
  be met if the counsellor's advice is &quot;accepted&quot; by the recipients. 
  For convenience, the relevant passage from his ruling is repeated below:<br>
  Can it be as counsel suggested in response to a question from me, that the law 
  refuses to punish under this section someone who counsels another to commit 
  murder knowing that his advice has been taken seriously, because unbeknownst 
  to the person being counselled, the counsellor is not serious or has motives 
  other than that the act counselled be carried out [emphasis in original].<br>
</p>
<p>[34] Manifestly, the trial judge was not prepared to accept that someone who 
  encourages the commission of a serious crime, knowing that his advice has been 
  taken seriously, should go free. Although he did not say so expressly, implicit 
  in his reasoning is the notion that such conduct is inherently dangerous and 
  should be punished. Indeed, as I understand his reasons, it is this concern 
  that led the trial judge to lower the bar on the mental state required for the 
  offence of counselling even below that contemplated by Alexander and Kessler. 
  As indicated earlier, the test fashioned by the trial judge - did the counsellor 
  speak the words with the intent that his advice be accepted by the recipients 
  - renders the mental state of the counsellor as to whether the offence counselled 
  is or is not committed irrelevant.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] The trial judge found support for his thinking in what he considered to 
  be a ready-made analogy in s. 264.1 (uttering threats) and in his interpretation 
  of s. 22(2) (offences committed in consequence of counselling) of the Code. 
  For convenience, I repeat those aspects of his ruling:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">By analogy of Section 264 of the Criminal Code, threatening. 
  That is another section where words spoken constitute the actus reus. Once the 
  threat is spoken, the external circumstances are complete. If it is proved that 
  the speaker intends that his words be taken seriously, the mental element is 
  made out. It is no defence for the speaker to say later that he never would 
  have carried out the threat conveyed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Section 22(2) of the Code makes the counsellor a party 
  to an offence committed in consequence of the counselling if the counsellor 
  knew or ought to have known the offence was likely to have been committed because 
  of the counselling.<br>
</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to accept that parliament intended a higher standard 
  of actual intention for the lesser offence under Section 464.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] With respect, I cannot agree with the trial judge's analysis for several 
  reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] First, the s. 264.1 analogy is inexact. Manifestly, s. 264.1 is not an 
  inchoate offence. As a matter of policy, Parliament has chosen to criminalize 
  conduct that is meant to instill fear in others. Given that that is the harm 
  which the provision seeks to prevent, it matters not whether the offender actually 
  intended to follow through with the threat.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] Second, as I read s. 22(2) of the Code, it is of no assistance in resolving 
  the issue at hand because it only comes into play if the counsellor is otherwise 
  guilty of counselling the original offence. That, in turn, depends on whether 
  the mental state for the crime of counselling requires that the counsellor intend 
  the commission of the original offence.<br>
</p>
<p>[39] Third, to the extent that the trial judge relied upon the &quot;degree 
  of dangerousness&quot; distinction identified by Alexander and Kessler to set 
  a lower bar for the mental state required for the offence of counselling, I 
  am of the view that the distinction breaks down when the inchoate offence of 
  counselling is compared with the inchoate offence of conspiracy. Specifically, 
  I do not accept that a person who counsels another to commit an offence (with 
  no intent that the offence be committed), is somehow more dangerous or engaged 
  in more dangerous activity than a person who conspires with another to commit 
  an offence (with no intent that the offence be committed). Neither wishes to 
  see an offence committed but both may embolden the second party to commit the 
  offence and both may lose control over the situation. In my view, this comparison 
  undermines the argument that the mental state for the inchoate crime of counselling 
  should be lowered because counselling is a more dangerous crime than conspiracy.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] Although the &quot;degree of dangerousness&quot; distinction may be somewhat 
  more persuasive in the case of attempts, even there, the issue is not free from 
  controversy. Thus, in contrast to the position taken by Alexander and Kessler 
  (see para. 33, above), LaFave and Scott make the following observations at Ch. 
  6, &sect;6.1, of their article:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, it is claimed that the solicitor does not 
  constitute a menace in view of the fact that he has manifested an unwillingness 
  to carry out the criminal scheme himself. There is not the dangerous proximity 
  to success which exists when the crime is actually attempted, for, &quot;despite 
  the earnestness of the solicitation, the actor is merely engaging in talk which 
  may never be taken seriously&quot; [footnotes omitted] [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[41] In sum, I am not persuaded that the &quot;degree of dangerousness&quot; 
  distinction warrants a reduction in the mental state required for the offence 
  of counselling.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] Fourth, even if I were satisfied that the mental state for the inchoate 
  crime of counselling should be lower than that required for other inchoate crimes, 
  I would not adopt a model that renders the mental state of the counsellor as 
  to whether the offence counselled is or is not to be committed irrelevant. On 
  the contrary, at a minimum, I would require that the offender act in reckless 
  disregard of the consequences. However, for reasons already stated, I find the 
  orthodox view (actual intent) more compelling and I see no reason to depart 
  from it.<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a><br>
</p>
<p>[43] In this regard, as Ashworth notes (see paragraph 27 above), it should 
  not be overlooked that in most cases, a person who counsels another to commit 
  an offence, intending that the advice be taken seriously, &quot;will usually, 
  by definition, intend that offence to be committed.&quot; The present case is 
  one of those rare instances where, despite the appellant's intention that his 
  words be taken seriously, the Crown does not maintain that he intended the commission 
  of the crimes counselled. While the appellant's actions were reprehensible, 
  I am not convinced that the reach of the criminal law should be extended, at 
  the expense of established principle, to ensnare the likes of the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>[44] Even if I am wrong and recklessness as to consequences is sufficient for 
  the offence of counselling unlawful bodily harm, if not murder, the convictions 
  cannot stand because the trial judge did not leave recklessness to the jury. 
  Rather, as I have pointed out, the case was left to the jury on the basis that 
  it need not consider the mental state of the appellant as to whether the crimes 
  counselled were or were not to be committed. <br>
  <br>
  [45] In the circumstances, had I concluded that recklessness as to consequences 
  was sufficient (at least with respect to the offence of counselling unlawful 
  bodily harm), I would nonetheless have quashed the convictions and substituted 
  verdicts of acquittal because on this record, it cannot be said that the appellant 
  was reckless as to whether the crimes counselled were or were not to be committed. 
  On the contrary, by warning Dr. Bazos immediately after the February 26 phone 
  calls, he demonstrated just the opposite.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br>
</p>
<p>[46] The requisite mental element for the offence of counselling requires, 
  among other things, that the counsellor intend the commission of the offence(s) 
  counselled. Crown counsel on appeal concedes that the trial judge's instruction 
  did not convey that information to the jury. He further concedes that on this 
  record, the evidence does not support such a finding. Accordingly, I would allow 
  the appeal, quash the convictions and in their place, substitute verdicts of 
  acquittal.<br>
