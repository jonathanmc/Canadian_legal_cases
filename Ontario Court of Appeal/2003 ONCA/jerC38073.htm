<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice T. D. Marshall of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 19, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p> OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants were defendants in two actions that were joined at trial 
  because the issues were identical in both actions. In his decision, the Honourable 
  Mr. Justice T. D. Marshall denied the appellants' claim for specific performance 
  and ordered that the Agreements of Purchase and Sale between the respondents 
  as vendors and the appellants as purchasers be declared null and void. The trial 
  judge also ordered that the deposits paid by the appellants be forfeited.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondents are two families owning adjoining farmlands fronting on 
  Highway 54 near Caledonia, Ontario fronting on the Grand River. The appellants' 
  numbered company entered into three separate Agreements of Purchase and Sale 
  with the respondents in August 1998 to purchase portions of their respective 
  properties. It was understood by all parties that the purchasers intended to 
  develop a golf course on the purchased lands.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Agreements of Purchase and Sale contemplated the severance of the lands 
  to be purchased with the respondents retaining the portions of their lands containing 
  their residences and several estate lots.</p>
<p>
  [4] The Agreements of Purchase and Sale were subject to conditions related to 
  the purchaser obtaining purchase agreements with all of the respondent vendors, 
  a draft approval for the development of an 18 hole golf course and severance 
  approvals for the abutting estate lots on the lands that were to be retained. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] The Agreements of Purchase and Sale also contained the following provision: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The conditions contained herein are for the benefit of the Purchaser and may 
  be waived by it in its sole discretion prior to the end of the Conditional Periods.</p>
<p>
  [6] The conditions were fulfilled within the conditional periods with the exception 
  of the condition relating to severance approvals for the estate lots on the 
  lands to be retained by the respondents. The estate lots condition was waived 
  by the appellants pursuant to the condition referred to in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondents refused to complete their respective transactions. The respondent 
  Lorne Hubber stated that he would not close until approvals for the estate lots 
  severances were obtained or a similar security was provided to ensure the estate 
  lots in the future. The respondent James Harrison refused to close on the ground 
  that it was not the vendors' responsibility to pay for the severance applications 
  for the estate lots.</p>
<p>
  [8] On May 31, 1999, the respondents through their solicitor advised the solicitor 
  for the appellant in writing that the obligation of the respondent Hubber to 
  close was conditional upon the creation of the estate lots prior to closing 
  and that no applications for severance had been made by the appellants. A further 
  letter from the Hubber family solicitor dated June 4, 1999 to the solicitor 
  for the appellants confirmed once again that the conditions regarding the estate 
  lots could not be waived and suggested that until the matter was resolved there 
  was no reason for the appellant to incur the expense of preparing &quot;reference 
  plans&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [9] It was also the responsibility of the appellants as purchasers to obtain 
  the written approval of the Grand River Conservation Authority for the severance 
  of the respondent Elizabeth Hubber's land. The appellant purchasers falsely 
  represented that a letter of approval had been obtained when it had not.</p>
<p>
  [10] Peter Bezemer was the principal of the appellant corporation. He had made 
  a similar offer for the purchase of the respondent lands through a numbered 
  company in 1997 but after &quot;researching&quot; Mr. Bezemer's background, 
  the respondent Harrison family told the real estate agent, Ron Hewitt, that 
  they did not want to deal with Mr. Bezemer. Mr. Hewitt was in practical terms 
  the real estate agent for both vendors and purchasers. Mr. Bezemer secured Mr. 
  Hewitt's agreement with respect to the 1998 agreement which is the subject matter 
  of this appeal that Hewitt not disclose that he, Bezemer, was involved in any 
  way in the transactions.</p>
<p>
  DECISION OF TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge found as a fact that the severance approvals for the estate 
  lots which were to be retained by the respondents were a fundamental condition 
  of the agreements between the respondents and the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge also found that the clause in the Agreements referred to 
  above that entitled the purchasers to waive the conditions on the basis that 
  the conditions were stated to be for the benefit of the purchasers in effect 
  made no commercial sense as the creation of the estate lots could only benefit 
  the respondent vendors and in his view the waiver condition did not represent 
  the true intention of the parties. He found the three Agreements of Purchase 
  and Sale &quot;patently ambiguous&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the view of the trial judge, the waiver right of the appellants would 
  render meaningless the fundamental condition that the appellants obtain severance 
  approval for the estate lots, on behalf of the respondent vendors, prior to 
  closing.</p>
<p>
  [14] The trial judge decided that in view of the &quot;ambiguity&quot;, the 
  agreement should be interpreted to give effect to the true intention of the 
  parties which was that the severance approvals were to be obtained prior to 
  closing. As this did not occur, the agreements were unenforceable by the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge also found on the evidence that there was an expectation 
  and an obligation on the appellants to pay the fees for all of the severances. 
  While the severances were delivered to the Land Division Committee, they were 
  not paid for and the severance applications were allowed to lapse.</p>
<p>
  [16] While the trial judge found that the agreements were null and void, he 
  ordered the forfeiture of the deposits as he held that the respondent vendors 
  were ready to complete the transactions in accordance with what he held to be 
  the terms of the agreement and that the defaults of the appellant purchasers 
  made the completion of the agreements not possible on those terms.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [17] It would appear from the evidence and the arguments advanced by counsel 
  on behalf of the appellants and respondents that the parties understood that 
  the severance applications were to be a &quot;two stage&quot; process. A &quot;two 
  stage&quot; process was adopted because the approvals for the severances of 
  the estate lots to be retained by the respondents would be more likely if the 
  severance for the golf club had been approved. In our view, a fundamental ambiguity 
  related also to the issue as to whether or not the &quot;two stage&quot; process 
  should take place before the closing of the transactions. </p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge by implication found that the &quot;two stage&quot; process 
  was to take place before the closing if the true intention of the parties was 
  to be respected. We can find no palpable or overriding error in the conclusion 
  that he reached and the appeal is therefore dismissed with respect to the appellants' 
  entitlement to specific performance of the agreements.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellants also submit that if the finding of the trial judge is to 
  be upheld with respect to his declarations that the agreements are null and 
  void, then the respondents should be required to return the deposits.</p>
<p>
  [20] It is our opinion that by failing to proceed with having the estate lots 
  severed, the purchaser appellants failed to keep their bargain. (Dynamic Transport 
  Ltd. v. O.K. Detailing Ltd. (1978) 2 S.C.R. 1072). While the agreement provides 
  for its termination and the return of the deposit, on notice, if the purchasers 
  are unable to obtain the approvals, they did not avail themselves of this provision. 
  Instead, they insisted that the agreements were binding, but refused to pursue 
  the severance of the estate lots. As a matter of law, where the purchaser fails 
  to perform the contract, and the contract does not otherwise provide for the 
  return of the deposit, the deposit is forfeit (DePalma v. Runnymede Iron &amp; 
  Steel Co., [1950] O.R. 1 (C.A.)).</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [21] The appeals are dismissed. The respondents may make written submissions 
  with respect to costs within ten days and the appellants shall reply to the 
  submissions within seven days of the receipt hereof.</p>
