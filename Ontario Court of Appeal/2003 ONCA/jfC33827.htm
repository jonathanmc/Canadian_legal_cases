<p>On appeal from convictions entered by Justice John C. Kennedy of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on October 25, 1999 and from sentence imposed on March 9, 2000.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was a karate teacher. He was charged with historical sexual 
  offences against eight young men who had been his students: B. H., S. M., C. 
  M., B. V., J. A., J. T., M. S. and G. S. There was a consent acquittal with 
  respect to J. T. as no evidence was led by the Crown. The appellant was acquitted 
  with respect to four of the seven remaining complainants, but convicted with 
  respect to three: B. H., S. M., and M. S. He received a sentence of four months 
  consecutive on each count. The appellant appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The three convictions each involved a single incident of touching the genitals 
  of the boys while demonstrating stretching techniques in connection with karate. 
  The appellant acknowledged that he did demonstrate stretching techniques to 
  the complainants, but denied that any incidental touching of the genitals had 
  any sexual purpose. The decision of the trial judge turned on the credibility 
  of the witnesses including the appellant and another former student, E. T., 
  who instigated the prosecutions and organized and met with the complainants 
  on several occasions. It was because of E.T.'s involvement that the evidence 
  on the other counts was considered tainted by possible collusion and formed 
  part of the trial judge's conclusion that he had a reasonable doubt on those 
  charges.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant raises three categories of alleged errors by the trial judge: 
  failing to appreciate the effect of collusion and tainting of evidence as a 
  result of the involvement of E. T., reversal of the burden of proof and errors 
  in perception of the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions 
  and order a new trial on each count.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p> [5] The appellant graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1982 
  with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education. He opened and operated 
  a series of martial arts and karate schools in the London area, which he eventually 
  franchised across Canada. From 1982 to his arrest in 1997, the appellant taught 
  karate and martial arts to thousands of students in the London area and beyond. 
  He was a recognized contributor to the London community, having been involved 
  in numerous fundraising charitable events and adult and children's sports events.</p>
<p>
  (1) The Incidents</p>
<p>(i) B. H. </p>
<p>
  [6] The first conviction was for a spring 1988 incident involving B. H. when 
  he was 12 years old. The charge against the appellant in respect of the incident 
  with this complainant was touching a person under 14 for a sexual purpose, contrary 
  to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. At the time of the trial in 1999, the complainant 
  was studying in the United States to be a chiropractor. He studied karate with 
  the appellant from 1982/3 to October 1988. The complainant's father was a chiropractor. 
  The appellant was his patient and friend.</p>
<p>
  [7] The complainant gave detailed testimony about the event. He testified that 
  he worked up a sweat in an afternoon karate practice. Two or three other students 
  were there at the time. After practice, the appellant suggested that he take 
  a shower. The complainant said that he was embarrassed about taking a shower 
  especially because it was dark in the men's shower as there had been a power 
  failure that day. He said that the appellant hinted that because he was nearing 
  puberty he might get acne if he did not shower, and that it would be too late 
  to shower once he had taken the bus home. The complainant went into the change 
  room trying to avoid taking a shower. He had no shampoo, soap or towel. The 
  complainant testified that the appellant &quot;presented with an attitude&quot; 
  suggesting the complainant was tough, getting older and should shower. The appellant 
  gently but sternly tugged on his arm and brought him into the dark change area 
  saying, in respect of the dark, that he did not have to see only to be able 
  to feel. The appellant then suggested that he shower in the girl's shower which 
  had light from windows.</p>
<p>
  [8] Both the appellant and the complainant had their uniforms on at the time. 
  The complainant was &quot;somewhat agreeing&quot; to shower although he did 
  not want to. He also made the excuse that he had a planter's wart on his foot, 
  but the appellant responded that no one used the girl's shower. The complainant 
  denied that he had previously showered at karate school and that there had ever 
  been talk about it. In the girl's shower, he took off his uniform and attempted 
  to turn on the shower but had problems with it. The appellant had left to get 
  shampoo. When he returned, the complainant was facing away from the appellant 
  so as not to expose his full frontal nudity, and attempting to adjust the shower. 
  He referred to his difficulties adjusting the shower in order to divert attention 
  from his nakedness.</p>

<p>
  The appellant adjusted the shower, then mentioned the complainant's tan line. 
  B. H. said: &quot;I was tanned from the waist up, enough that it was noticeable 
  and he could see my bum and he said, &quot;you've got quite a tan line here 
  [B.]&quot; - [B.] was my nickname.&quot; The complainant was then turned around 
  and the appellant was crouching about one foot in front of him. He could not 
  say how he was turned around or whether the appellant had touched him to turn 
  him or had just suggested he check something. The complainant said he did not 
  turn voluntarily, but with reluctance.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant said he wanted to check something having to do with the complainant's 
  flexibility or stretching. The appellant then palpated the muscles on the complainant's 
  inner thighs. In so doing, the back of the appellant's hand touched the complainant's 
  scrotum, testicles and penis. The complainant spread his legs to try to avoid 
  this touching and he also tried to pull his genitals away so that the appellant 
  could palpate the muscles. The appellant did not explain what he was doing. 
  He commented that &quot;you're getting a big dick, [B.].&quot; He checked other 
  muscle groups and went back and forth a couple of times. When he moved from 
  one leg to the other, he said, &quot;let's just move your dickie here.&quot; 
  He also made comments about how one side was tighter than the other. The incident 
  lasted from 30 to 60 seconds. Eventually the appellant got up and told the complainant 
  to get on with the shower and left the room.</p>
<p>
  [10] B. H. then took a shower and dressed as fast as he could so as not to have 
  any further contact with the appellant without his clothes on. When he was dressed, 
  the appellant came over to him in the dark men's change room and suggested that 
  he bring a towel and shampoo in order to shower more regularly at the club. 
  Although he did not want to do that, the complainant agreed that maybe that 
  was a good idea. They then had a further discussion about the value of palpating 
  the upper inner thigh for stretching purposes. Then B. H. took the bus home.</p>
<p>
  [11] B. H. then skipped the next three classes over a one-week period. He said 
  this was because of embarrassment and fear of a similar experience with the 
  appellant, however, he told his parents he was not feeling up to it. Eventually 
  he told his mother about the experience, following which he returned to karate 
  class. The complainant said that, once after that, the appellant pulled him 
  aside and told him to hit the shower, and he brushed it off. Nothing was ever 
  said again about the incident or about taking a shower. After that he went only 
  once or twice a week to classes until October 1988, when he quit. He testified 
  that there were many factors involved. He told people it was because he was 
  bored with karate, but he said consciously or unconsciously he had a level of 
  discomfort at the school.</p>
<p>
  [12] After quitting, he saw the appellant at his father's office on several 
  occasions and at karate events that he attended to see his friends. He also 
  telephoned the appellant a few times after quitting. Once, he called to get 
  advice about running for student council president. Another time he called about 
  a speech he was making. He knew the appellant had been president of his high 
  school, and had won public speaking contests.</p>
<p>
  [13] In cross-examination, B. H. confirmed that over the years of lessons he 
  had spent thousands of hours with the appellant, including in private lessons 
  with him, and that, in all that time, there was only the one incident of 30 
  to 60 seconds, and that it was something he never spoke to the appellant about 
  after it occurred in 1988. He also acknowledged that his father may have said 
  to him that taking a shower after karate may have been a good idea, after the 
  appellant suggested it to his father.</p>
<p>
  [14] B. H. also confirmed that karate emphasized flexibility, including in the 
  legs, thigh and groin area. Around the age of 12 he had a growth spurt and he 
  lost some of his flexibility in that area. B. H. agreed that when the back of 
  the appellant's hand touched his genitals that may have been an accident, but 
  said when the appellant moved his penis to the side, it was deliberate. B. H. 
  was also confronted with his preliminary inquiry testimony wherein he testified 
  that the appellant had made the &quot;big dick&quot; comment subsequent to the 
  shower incident when the appellant suggested that the complainant should wear 
  a jock strap. B. H. maintained at the trial that the appellant made the comment 
  twice.</p>
<p>
  [15] B. H.'s mother testified about what her son told her at the time. She said 
  that she confronted him because she felt something was bothering him. She said 
  that he told her he had taken a shower at the appellant's insistence after a 
  karate workout. While he was in the shower room the appellant came in, crouched 
  down in front of him and wanted to see some stretching muscles. He put his hand 
  on the boy's genitals to move them out of the way and touched his penis with 
  the back of his hand to move it aside and said &quot;let's get this dick out 
  of the way.&quot; The complainant's mother did not include the &quot;you're 
  getting a big dick&quot; comment as part of the story she had been told. She 
  was initially upset, but she and her husband decided not to call the police. 
  Her husband told her that the appellant had recently commented about the complainant 
  growing and felt his son's concern was an overreaction. They gave the complainant 
  the choice of continuing with karate and taking a shower only if he wanted to. 
  They did not say anything to the appellant about the incident. They sent the 
  complainant camping with the appellant in August 1988 and had pictures taken 
  in their home with him in 1989.</p>
<p>
  (ii) S. M. </p>
<p>
  [16] The charge relating to this incident with the appellant was sexual assault, 
  contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. S. M. was 25 years old when 
  he testified and 13 at the time he first became involved with the appellant's 
  karate school. About one year after he started at the school in 1987 or 1988, 
  when he was 13 or 14, S. M. was relaxing at the end of a class and was the last 
  one there, when the appellant approached him, asked how his stretching was, 
  and offered to show him a technique to improve his stretching. They were walking 
  half way between the entrance to the dojo, the room where the class took place, 
  and the back entrance of the school. The appellant told S. M. to go into a relaxed 
  horse stance, a common stance used in karate, then asked him to pull down his 
  pants and underwear. He was not in his uniform but had changed into beige casual 
  pants and a white t-shirt. S. M. was surprised, but because the appellant was 
  his &quot;sensei&quot;or teacher, he pulled his pants down to above his knees. 
  Then the appellant crouched down in front of him and pointed out the muscle 
  on the inside upper thigh and told him that was the muscle to massage while 
  stretching. He began to massage it and told him that was the technique. The 
  appellant then said &quot;we'll just move compadre out of the way here&quot;. 
  He then moved the complainant's testicles to the side by cupping his hand. He 
  then did the other side. The incident lasted for a minute or two, then S. M. 
  pulled his pants up. In cross-examination, S. M. acknowledged that his time 
  estimate of the incident lasting a minute or two included the time before and 
  after the massage and that the muscle massage itself took 20 to 30 seconds. 
  Although muscle massage had been shown in class, S. M. had not seen it demonstrated 
  on anyone with no clothes on.</p>
<p>
  [17] S. M. continued with karate classes for three or four years. Nothing was 
  said between them about the incident. When S. M. was 15, the appellant asked 
  him once about his stretching technique and he said it was fine.</p>
<p>
  [18] At some point S. M. was considering having his best friend join the club 
  when the incident came back to him and he decided he did not want to put his 
  friend at risk of the same thing happening to him. He then left the club and 
  told his friend, as a result of which the incident was eventually reported to 
  the police. S. M. gave the police a statement in 1990. Officer H spoke to the 
  appellant and no charges were laid. Crown counsel asked S. M. if he had consented 
  to what the appellant did and he said he did not.</p>
<p>
  [19] Officer H gave testimony as well. He did not give the details of what S. 
  M. told him except that S. M. said that the appellant touched his genitals when 
  he pushed them aside during a stretching exercise, but the complainant did not 
  mention anything sexual. The officer met with the appellant who admitted the 
  incident, but denied any sexual purpose or overtones. After investigating, Officer 
  H told S. M. that no charges would be laid because he could not prove the acts 
  were done for a sexual purpose.</p>
<p>
  (iii) M. S. </p>
<p>
  [20] M. S. was 27 years old at the time of trial and started karate when he 
  was 13 or 14. The charge relating to his incident with the appellant was also 
  sexual assault, contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The complainant 
  was 15 or 16 when, after class one day, the appellant called him into his office 
  to learn a new stretching technique. After he came into the office, the appellant 
  locked the door and asked him to undress in order to see his tendons more clearly. 
  The complainant, who was wearing his uniform, removed his uniform pants, underwear 
  and jock strap. He then did the splits and the appellant applied pressure on 
  the tendons about an inch or two from the testicles. Toward the end of the incident, 
  the appellant cupped his genitals for about 30 seconds. The appellant was discussing 
  the stretching while doing this. M. S. said that the appellant also asked him 
  if he could get an erection, to which he mumbled &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I don't 
  know&quot;. After a period of minutes, he got up and dressed. M. S. testified 
  that he did not consent to this touching.</p>
<p>
  [21] M. S. continued his karate classes after this incident for a further period 
  of under two years. Later he moved to Australia. When he returned, he rejoined 
  the karate school again for a couple of months because he was looking for some 
  roots back in London. The incident was not discussed, although the appellant 
  did ask him at some point during the two years how his stretching was.</p>
<p>
  [22] In cross-examination, M. S. confirmed that stretching had always been a 
  very important part of karate, particularly stretching in the groin area. He 
  also agreed that the appellant told him he had a new technique for stretching 
  and that in fact, the new technique was effective. Further, when the appellant 
  asked him into his office to show the technique, he first demonstrated with 
  a rubber band how it can be stretched to the limit, then by applying pressure 
  at 90 degrees, stretched further. M. S. also agreed that the appellant told 
  him that he would be applying pressure to his tendons. The appellant also told 
  him to practice this himself and asked him a couple of weeks later if he had 
  improved.</p>
<p>
  (2) E. T.'s Involvement and the Evidence of Collusion</p>
<p>
  [23] These matters were reported to the London police in January 1997, along 
  with complaints by five other men, after the complainants met together several 
  times with another former student of the appellant, E. T.</p>
<p>
  [24] E. T. was 26 years old at the time of the trial and was an MBA student 
  in Health Services at the University of Western Ontario. She had previously 
  completed a law degree at Osgoode Hall Law School and followed that with a Bachelor 
  of Science degree at Western. She grew up in London, Ontario where she took 
  karate lessons from the appellant beginning at age 14. She took lessons for 
  10 years and attained a first-degree black belt. She took lessons three times 
  per week and taught on the weekends. She explained that she continued with the 
  training club even while she attended Osgoode Hall in Toronto. She left the 
  club in December 1996, after the decision had been made that a number of people, 
  including herself, would be approaching the police about the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant wrote a number of reference and recommendation letters for 
  E. T. at her request over the years. The first was in 1990 when she was applying 
  for scholarships after high school. The second was in 1992, and was a reference 
  letter that she requested in order to be accepted into law school. The third 
  was in 1995, and was a reference letter that she requested for an application 
  to medical school.</p>
<p>
  [26] E. T. testified that she first became suspicious of the appellant's actions 
  with a number of the boys at the club while she was in law school. When she 
  returned from law school she decided to approach one of the former students 
  to discuss her suspicions. Her suspicions were based on rumours that she had 
  heard and the appellant's relationship with the boys at the club. The person 
  she approached was J. D., a former student who now operated a karate school 
  using the appellant's name and under his auspices. J. D. apparently told the 
  appellant about E. T.'s approach to him and, as a result, the appellant asked 
  E. T. to meet with him when she came in to teach on June 3, 1995. She testified 
  that he asked her not to continue to approach people because it would hurt his 
  reputation, his family, and others who were opening karate schools under his 
  name. He also admitted some impropriety with one student, unnamed, who he said 
  was receiving counselling. The appellant indicated that his problem related 
  to past steroid use. E. T. testified that she recorded this conversation; however, 
  the recording was not put into evidence at the trial.</p>
<p>
  [27] E. T. had lunch with B. H. that summer. The following summer she had a 
  discussion with another former student, T. A., as a result of which his brother, 
  J. A., called her. During this time, B. H. called her several times. Finally 
  on December 8, 1996, J. T. called her and she met with him on December 12, and 
  as a result, she met with S. M. as well. On December 20, 1996, there was a meeting 
  at B. H.'s home. Six people attended of whom E. T. named herself, B. H., S. 
  M. and J. T.. The meeting lasted under two hours, and it was determined that 
  E. T. would see if there were other people who wanted to go forward to the police.</p>
<p>
  [28] Following that meeting, E. T. contacted B. V. and met with him and J. T. 
  on December 27, 1996. There was a further group meeting on December 30, 1996 
  at G. S.'s apartment. E. T. had contacted people to attend that meeting, which 
  also lasted under two hours. A further meeting was held at G. S.'s apartment 
  on January 3, 1997. E. T. arranged for a police officer to attend that meeting 
  to answer questions. At the meeting they agreed that whoever wished to go forward 
  would give his name to E. T. to provide to the police, which she did. </p>
<p>
  [29] In cross-examination, E. T. disclosed that she had developed an animus 
  against the appellant for several reasons. One related to her training to qualify 
  as a second-degree black belt. In December 1996, she was supposed to try for 
  her second-degree black belt and agreed that she was not happy that the appellant 
  told her a few months before that she was not ready for it and could not try 
  out. Although she claimed that the second-degree belt meant nothing to her, 
  she agreed that she tried to arrange for the test to be moved to a day when 
  she did not have an exam in order to be able to try to qualify.</p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant had also intervened in 1991 in a relationship she had with 
  a young male student, by speaking to the boy's parents and suggesting that because 
  he was only 16 and she was 18, the relationship was inappropriate. She agreed 
  that she was not happy with the appellant's involvement. </p>
<p>
  [31] In the summer of 1994, E. T. was employed in the Crown's office, and worked 
  on a sexual abuse sentencing project. She was aware of the S. M. matter from 
  1990 and that the appellant was gaining in influence in the karate world and 
  expanding his operation. When she worked at the Crown's office her suspicions 
  increased regarding the possibility of the appellant's wrongdoing. When she 
  raised the issue first with J. D., he denied her concerns.</p>
<p>
  [32] E. T. elaborated on her involvement speaking to several of the complainants 
  before and after the three group meetings in December 1996 and January 1997, 
  and at the first meeting, encouraging the complainants to carry the process 
  forward. She claimed that following the first meeting, she only acted as a facilitator 
  for those who wanted to proceed, and gave the police a statement like the others. 
  Eventually she admitted that she stayed involved through the arrest, the court 
  proceedings and the trial itself including having lunch with the complainants 
  while they were testifying during the trial.</p>
<p>
  [33] During questioning regarding the details of her continued contact with 
  the complainants and with the police, E. T. asked to refer to notes which she 
  had with her in the witness box. Although she had been asked by the Crown attorney 
  to turn over all notes for the purpose of disclosure, she did not turn over 
  some notes that she had made of dates and times of the appellant's court appearances 
  for his bail and preliminary hearing, and of some conversations she had during 
  this period. E. T. also ordered the transcript of the preliminary hearing and 
  read portions of it relating to a potential witness in the case to that witness. 
  She acknowledged that after the appellant was arrested in April 1997, the police 
  told her to let them handle matters, but she still asked what more she could 
  do. The police told her to do nothing more, because of the need for fairness 
  in the process. She was upset by that and told the police that for three months 
  all the boys had been calling her. She denied that they discussed their stories 
  or that she discussed them. She said that the boys only wanted to know about 
  the progress of the case and why it was taking so long. Based on the dates she 
  was talking to the complainants - from January to April 1997 - it appeared that 
  she was talking to them at the time they were composing their statements to 
  the police. She further acknowledged that the investigating officer came out 
  of the preliminary hearing and told her and the others to stop talking about 
  what was being said in court.</p>
<p>
  [34] In their testimony, each of the eight complainants discussed their interaction 
  with E. T. and the meetings they held with her and the other complainants.</p>
<p>
  [35] B. H. had lunch with E. T. as a friend in the summer of 1995 or 1996, and 
  the conversation turned to the club. She suggested that the appellant committed 
  sexual improprieties with young boys and he responded by talking to her about 
  what happened with the appellant and saying that he thought the appellant was 
  a pervert. He acknowledged that he said this after having consulted with the 
  appellant about the student council and public speaking matters and seeking 
  his advice. He denied, however, that he was seeing things differently in 1999 
  than in 1988. </p>
<p>
  [36] He also talked to others about it, both on the phone and in person. In 
  May 1995 he met with E. T. He spoke with her again in May 1996, after which 
  he made the decision to see if there were others to whom he could lend support. 
  As a result, he called J. T. who was in Alberta. They had a fifteen-minute conversation 
  where they told each other about their incidents with the appellant, although 
  J. T. disclosed more details than B. H. did. B. H. also called S. M. and spoke 
  to him on the phone and in person, where S. M. explained briefly what had happened 
  to him with the appellant. B. H. told S. M. about the shower incident and that 
  he was worried about other children. He also spoke with B. V. at the suggestion 
  of someone else and with G. S. at the suggestion of S. M. G. S. told B. H. about 
  what he said happened to him with the appellant, as did B. V. B. H. also spoke 
  to J. A. and M. S. </p>
<p>
  [37] B. H. then held the first meeting at his house. He said there was no discussion 
  of details there, although there had been before that. E. T. was present and 
  said at the meeting that she saw trends in the appellant's behaviour and inappropriate 
  sexual nature, as she had said when they first met. B. H. was also at the next 
  two meetings where the complainants and others were present, one of whom gave 
  information about what happened to him. Also, B. H. heard details about incidents 
  that happened to other people not involved in the prosecution. He also received 
  further information from G. S. on the phone after the meetings. Following the 
  meetings, he prepared his statement for the police as well as a follow-up statement 
  answering questions. Finally, B. H. agreed that hearing the stories others told 
  him about what they claimed the appellant did to them, confirmed in his mind 
  that the appellant was a pervert.</p>
<p>
  [38] S. M. also testified that he was contacted by B. H. and they exchanged 
  information about what happened to them with the appellant. E. T. also called 
  S. M. at that time and he met with her and told her about the incident involving 
  him. She also told him about other incidents that she had heard about. He spoke 
  to M. S., J. T., G. S., B. H. and B. V. He could not remember if he spoke with 
  J. A. He attended the two group meetings at G. S.'s apartment and, contrary 
  to B. H.'s evidence, he said that people talked about what happened to them 
  at those meetings. He acknowledged that he agreed with the others that they 
  would help each other make this accusation against the appellant. According 
  to S.M., there was a great deal of exchange of information among the complainants.</p>
<p>
  [39] S. M. was asked about an incident in 1990 when he encountered the appellant 
  at the Western Fair Grounds and spoke to him about the police complaint. In 
  his cross-examination he would not agree that in that conversation he had referred 
  to the incident as a misunderstanding. However, at the preliminary hearing in 
  this case, he agreed he had said that, but added that the appellant had put 
  the words into his mouth. He also would not agree that he could have been mistaken 
  about the appellant's motives or that the number of people he had discussed 
  the matter with and heard about might have influenced his perception of events. 
  </p>
<p>
  [40] M. S. also gave evidence about his interaction with the other complainants. 
  He said that he first talked about his incident with his friend S. M. when S. 
  M. first disclosed his incident and the police became involved. At that time, 
  M. S. only said that something had happened to him but provided no details. 
  The next time he spoke about it was in 1995 or 1996 when S. M. called him after 
  he was contacted by a number of people who had had similar experiences with 
  the appellant. S. M. attended two of the three complainant meetings. He attended 
  the first meeting at B. H.'s home in December 1996 and the third meeting at 
  G. S.'s apartment in January 1997. He said details were not discussed with him, 
  but agreed that others could have discussed details. He agreed that at the meeting 
  some people may have used the word &quot;cupping&quot;, which he had used in 
  his examination in chief, to describe what the appellant did to them. He understood 
  that S. M.'s and J. T.'s experiences were similar to his with a stretching exercise 
  that involved fondling. He also said that, in spite of all these meetings, he 
  believed his memories were his own.</p>
<p>
  (3) Evidence of the Appellant</p>
<p>
  [41] After graduating from the University of Western Ontario, the appellant 
  began to teach martial arts in a private school in London. He moved the school 
  to various locations over the years as the school continued to grow. The appellant 
  taught Kenpo Karate. He eventually franchised eight locations across Canada. 
  After he was arrested, he sold the school but retained some involvement at head 
  office and teaching the black belt students.</p>
<p>
  [42] The appellant taught thousands of people at his schools over the years, 
  as well as many police officers and military personnel. He did coaching and 
  ran school martial arts programs. He represented London at athletic and leadership 
  conferences and raised funds for scholarships and numerous charities. He also 
  received several local awards for his work and contribution to the city.</p>
<p>
  [43] At first the appellant was teaching a form of Kenpo Karate called Tracy 
  Kenpo after the Tracy brothers who were teaching a Kenpo offshoot. However, 
  in 1984, the appellant joined the International Kenpo Karate organization operated 
  by the founder of American Kenpo, Ed Parker. He met Mr. Parker at that time 
  and began to train with him in a series of seminars around the United States 
  from 1984 until Mr. Parker's death in 1990. Mr. Parker also came to London, 
  Ontario to teach. Following Mr. Parker's death, his widow asked the appellant 
  to represent the Parker family teaching International Kenpo abroad. As a result, 
  the appellant taught extensively in Europe from 1991 to 1993 as well as in the 
  United States. At the time of the trial, he held a fifth-degree black belt in 
  American Kenpo, and a sixth-degree black belt in Kanzen Kenpo, a technique he 
  created in 1993 and began to teach in his schools. He also has training in other 
  martial arts.</p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant explained various aspects of karate and of martial arts. 
  One was that the groin is one of the most significant regions of the body for 
  target and self defence as well as for flexibility for demonstration purposes. 
  In the American Kenpo system, 102 out of 202 self defences involve a groin grab 
  or groin contact. Consequently, during classes there would be hand contact with 
  a student's groin, including testicles and penis. Many levels of stretching 
  exercises were practised in order to achieve flexibility. The appellant was 
  very involved in karate competitions and took students around Ontario and the 
  United States to competitions.</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant said that in 1988, in Baltimore, he had a discussion with 
  Ed Parker about stretching and Parker offered to show him a new technique to 
  get past the plateau beyond which some people could not go. At trial, the appellant 
  referred to this stretch as the &quot;Parker stretch&quot; for ease of reference, 
  although this was not a name used by him before the trial. Parker demonstrated 
  this stretch to the appellant in his hotel room. It involved removing his pants 
  and underwear and assuming the splits position. Mr. Parker then applied pressure-like 
  massage to the tendons near the testicles, down the leg, to the knee and back 
  up. As a result the appellant dropped down in the splits closer to the ground 
  by 11/2 to 2 inches. The appellant said that it was the best stretch he has 
  seen in his 25 years in martial arts. His explanation was that the effect is 
  to trick the muscles into stretching beyond what was their maximum.</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant said that he showed this stretch to students. He would use 
  an elastic band first to demonstrate how the stretch would work. He taught the 
  stretch with clothes removed in order to be clinical about it, because that 
  is the way he was shown and because he thought that was the best way to see 
  the tendons. He did this in private because of its personal nature. He said 
  that he would usually show the stretch between classes when the school was open. 
  He said that the genitals were never the focus of the exercise. They may have 
  been moved out of the way but never grabbed. There could be contact with the 
  person's genitals by the back of his hand especially if the person was in the 
  splits position and using his own hands for balance.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appellant was cross-examined extensively about the Parker stretch. 
  He explained why he believed it was necessary to demonstrate it with clothes 
  off to better see the involved tendons. He said he did not know if Parker had 
  put it in writing in instructional books or to whom he had taught it. He explained 
  that he only taught it to a number of the older students who were interested 
  in competition. The majority of the people he showed it to said that the stretch 
  worked terrifically. When asked what he did to downplay the contact with a sensitive 
  part of the body, the appellant answered that he would ask the student if he 
  felt uncomfortable and that he would stop if the student did. This was confirmed 
  by two of the defence witnesses, S. Mc. and P. M.</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellant gave his description of what occurred with each complainant. 
  The first was B. H. The appellant said that in the class they had worked hard 
  and B. H. was sweaty and smelly and had to take a long bus ride home, so he 
  suggested he take a shower. They also had a discussion about B. H.'s recent 
  loss of flexibility, as he had been a child star, but now that he was growing 
  he needed to focus on stretching. There had been a power outage and the male 
  change room was dark. The women's change room had windows so there was some 
  light there. The appellant went with B. H. to the male change room to help him 
  find his clothes and take them to the women's change room to change in the light. 
  On the way he suggested showering there, and B. H. did not react negatively 
  or give any reason not to. Because he did not have shampoo, the appellant went 
  to get some in the male change room. He had no recollection of adjusting the 
  shower. He recalled continuing the discussion about stretching. He did not show 
  the Parker stretch, but told the complainant he would have to work on his splits 
  and pointed to an area on the inside of his leg, without making contact with 
  his groin, and showed him a chopping motion there. He said that B. H. had his 
  own hand covering his groin. He also denied making a comment at that time about 
  &quot;getting a big dick&quot; or about B. H.'s tan. He also did not know if 
  the complainant had a towel as he was not there when he was showering. He said 
  there was nothing sexual about the incident.</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellant also said that he had discussed with B. H.'s father, who 
  was his chiropractor as well as a very involved parent, the idea that his son 
  should shower and the father agreed.</p>
<p>
  [50] B. H. continued to be actively involved in the club through the spring, 
  summer and fall of 1988, including participating in tournaments and charitable 
  fundraising demonstrations as well as in a weekend tenting trip.</p>
<p>
  [51] In October 1988, B. H. told the appellant that he was getting bored with 
  karate and wanted to get involved in other things. After that, the appellant 
  saw him at his father's office, at his home, and when the complainant came to 
  an event at the school as a spectator. B. H. also called the appellant for advice 
  about running for student council president. Furthermore, the appellant and 
  his wife had an ongoing social relationship with the complainant's parents. 
  The complainant's mother sought the appellant's advice about an acting school 
  she opened for children. Their relations were always positive and no one ever 
  suggested to him that they thought he was a pervert.</p>
<p>
  [52] The appellant was cross-examined briefly about the B. H. shower incident. 
  He said he did not show B. H. the Parker stretch because he felt he was too 
  young (12 years old). He did not remember the complainant saying he had a planter's 
  wart but said it was possible he had said that. The appellant also agreed that 
  he may have adjusted the shower even though he did not recall doing so. He also 
  said that he did comment at another time that the complainant was getting bigger, 
  that is, growing up and therefore he should protect himself by wearing a jock 
  strap. He did not make any comment about the size of his penis during the shower 
  incident.</p>
<p>
  [53] The appellant also described his recollection of the S. M. incident. He 
  recalled that it was in the summer of 1988 in the dojo at the end of the day, 
  when S. M. was expressing the desire to attain the skill level of his close 
  friend M. S. The appellant then told him about the new stretch and explained 
  what was involved, although not with an elastic. S. M. then removed his pants 
  and underwear and the appellant showed him how to do the stretch. Subsequently 
  he asked S. M. if the stretch was working for him. S. M. said that it was and 
  thanked him for it. The appellant agreed that he may have said something to 
  let the complainant know that he was moving his testicles out of the way but 
  could not recall if he used the term &quot;compadre&quot;. He testified that 
  he had no sexual intent.</p>
<p>
  [54] In 1990 he was called by Detective H. about the incident. The appellant 
  offered to show him the stretch, but the detective declined. No charges were 
  laid, but the detective suggested that he not demonstrate the stretch without 
  someone present. Detective H. agreed in his testimony that he did tell the appellant 
  to do that. </p>
<p>
  [55] In 1992, S. M. and M. S. came into the club. At that time the appellant 
  confronted S. M. and told him how shocked and angry he was that the police were 
  called and that S. M. had misinterpreted what happened. The appellant recalled 
  that S. M. said that, at first, he thought the appellant had done something 
  wrong, then later realized that the appellant was just trying to help him. They 
  apologized to each other.</p>
<p>
  [56] In relation to the M. S. incident, the appellant recalled it was in 1988 
  or 1989 when M. S. was 16 or 17, the school was open and classes were going 
  on. Because the complainant was a competitor, the appellant offered to show 
  him the new stretch he had learned that was very effective. They went into his 
  office and he demonstrated how the stretch worked on an elastic band by applying 
  pressure and making it stretch further. He explained that it would involve removing 
  his pants. He then closed the door, M. S. removed his pants and underwear, and 
  the appellant showed him the stretch. The complainant was in the splits and 
  there may have been inadvertent contact to his genitals with the back of the 
  hand. There was no cupping of the groin nor did he talk about getting an erection. 
  He said there may have been talk about increased blood flow to the area, but 
  not about genitalia. The only discussion he had with him afterward was the standard 
  follow-up about whether there was any improvement. Again, the appellant denied 
  any sexual purpose.</p>
<p>
  [57] The appellant also gave evidence about the incidents alleged against him 
  by the other complainants, some of which included allegations of masturbation 
  and fellatio, all of which he denied.</p>
<p> [58] With respect to E. T., she began at the karate school in 1987 and was 
  an active member there from 1988 to 1996. At some point she was accomplished 
  enough to become an assistant teacher in his classes. He confirmed the incident 
  which E. T. resented where, at the request of parents, he suggested to a 14 
  year old boy<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> in his class that he listen 
  to his parents and end his relationship with E. T., who was in university at 
  the time. She came to him after that and said he was ruining her life. She subsequently 
  applied to law school and he wrote a letter on her behalf. E. T. then developed 
  a relationship with the boy's younger brother, but the relationship deteriorated 
  over time. The younger brother came to the appellant about it, but the appellant 
  did not interfere again. In 1994 and 1995, E. T. became a disruptive force in 
  the classes because of her interaction with these two boys. In 1995, J. D. told 
  the appellant about E. T.'s approach to him and about her suggesting to people 
  that the appellant was acting inappropriately towards students in the school. 
  As a result, in May or June 1995, when E. T. came to the school, the appellant 
  asked to speak to her.</p>
<p>
  [59] During that meeting she brought up S. M. and that she knew about the police 
  investigation. The appellant felt that she was threatening him. During the conversation, 
  he admitted that, as a result of the incident with S. M., the appellant had 
  suffered physically and mentally. He also said there was a person in the school 
  whom he had wronged, but it was by not helping the student when he had come 
  to the appellant for help numerous times because of E. T. Following this conversation, 
  she continued to hold the S. M. incident over his head and to make his life 
  uncomfortable. He said that she took their conversation out of context, and 
  that he did not tell her he had committed any improper acts on anyone. He agreed 
  to write her a letter of reference for medical school, hoping she would get 
  in and not be involved at his school. He wrote a brief letter which she found 
  unacceptable. She dictated to him the longer letter which was sent.</p>
<p>
  [60] In November 1996, E. T. wanted to test for a second-degree black belt. 
  The appellant testified that it was important to her because she did not want 
  the two brothers to get ahead of her. He told her she was not ready to test 
  in December because she did not know the moves in the new Kanzen Kenpo. She 
  tried to say it was because of the date of the testing and to get the date changed. 
  She attended the testing to observe and was disruptive there.</p>
<p>
  [61] Crown counsel at trial asked only one question of the appellant in cross-examination 
  relating to E. T., that is, whether the appellant felt that he was run over 
  by her. Otherwise, his version of her behaviour and their interaction was unchallenged 
  by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  (4) The Other Defence Witnesses</p>
<p>
  [62] The defence also called four witnesses. S. Mc. is a second-degree black 
  belt student of the appellant who had been studying with him since 1988. He 
  testified that groin contact is often involved in karate, and that flexibility 
  in the groin area is very important. He also testified that the appellant showed 
  him the new stretching technique in the fall of 1989 when he was 16 or 17. He 
  took down his pants and underpants. He cupped himself with his hand. The appellant 
  put pressure on and kneaded the tendons from the inner pelvic girdle down the 
  inside of both legs to the knee. He said there was no sexual aspect to it. He 
  likened it to a check-up at the doctor. He was also asked in cross-examination 
  about using a chopping motion and he said he understood that the chopping motion 
  did the same as the kneading. He found the stretch very effective and said that 
  it was the only way he was able to do the full splits.</p>
<p>
  [63] S. W. had trained with the appellant since 1983 and at the time of the 
  trial was 39 years old and holds a first-degree black belt in karate. He testified 
  that when he was at the preliminary hearing in this case, he observed B. H., 
  S. M., C. M., B. V., J. A., M. S. and G. S. with E.T., who was going around 
  to the group telling them not to say her name in court. He also testified about 
  the configuration of the inside of a van which the appellant owned because allegations 
  were made by some of the complainants about sexually assaultive behaviour by 
  the appellant in the van. He further testified about the importance of flexibility 
  in karate and said he was aware of the stretch that involved stimulating the 
  inside of the groin to relax the tendons and achieve a greater stretch. He said 
  he heard the appellant and Mr. Parker discussing the stretch in the appellant's 
  club in London in the fall of 1987. He believed he had known about the stretching 
  technique for about a year at that time. The appellant would tell the students 
  in class to warm the inside muscles of the legs in order to stretch out doing 
  the splits. However, the appellant had never done it on him.</p>
<p>
  [64] P. M. was 23 years old at the time of the trial and has a third-degree 
  black belt in karate. He joined the appellant's karate club in 1986. He was 
  involved in tournaments and interested in increasing his flexibility and had 
  heard about a stretching technique from a friend. He asked the appellant to 
  show it to him in 1991 or 1992 when he was 16 or 17. The appellant was first 
  reluctant to show him but then agreed to. He went to the appellant's office 
  where he removed his pants and the appellant pushed on his inner groin moving 
  down his legs while he was in the splits. The appellant also pushed him down 
  from the hips to assist him to go down further in the splits. It took a couple 
  of minutes. He said it increased his flexibility dramatically. He said he was 
  not uncomfortable and that the appellant told him to let him know if he was. 
  The appellant asked him if it worked and he said it did. He then did the procedure 
  on himself and the appellant did it on him again as well, several times (about 
  15) because when doing the splits it is difficult to do it on oneself. The last 
  time was in 1994. He said there was nothing sexual about it nor was anything 
  sexual said by the appellant. There may have been very slight contact by the 
  appellant's hand on his genitals when he started working his way down the leg.</p>
<p>
  [65] L. J. was also a first-degree black belt student of the appellant. She 
  began lessons with the appellant in 1990. At the time of the trial she owned 
  one of the appellant's franchise schools in Tillsonburg, which she acquired 
  in 1996. She reported a conversation she had with E. T. in late spring 1996. 
  E. T. said that the appellant had ruined her life; she blamed him for her break-up 
  with her boyfriend, P. M. She also said that the appellant would get what was 
  coming to him. She also told L. J. in September 1996 that she planned to test 
  for the next level of black belt and was unhappy when the appellant would not 
  let her test for it.</p>
<p>
  GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellant's grounds of appeal can be grouped into three main categories: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Errors made by the trial judge in failing to appreciate 
  the effect of the involvement of E. T. with the complainants and of the collusion 
  of the complainants over an extended period of time on the perception and recollection 
  of their respective incidents by B. H., S. M. and M. S. <br>
  (2) Errors made by the trial judge in his approach to the evidence tendered 
  by the Crown and by the defence, which resulted in the trial judge reversing 
  the burden of proof.<br>
  (3) Errors made by the trial judge in his apprehension of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  (1) Collusion, Tainting of Evidence and the Role of E. T. </p>
<p>
  [67] The issue of the role of E. T. in the prosecution of this case, the effect 
  of her involvement on the witnesses, and the serious possibility of intentional 
  or unintentional collusion and tainting of the evidence, was a live issue throughout 
  the trial. At the close of the prosecution's case, the defence made a motion 
  for dismissal on the basis that all of the Crown's evidence was tainted and 
  unreliable because of E. T.'s involvement. In his submissions on the non-suit 
  motion, Crown counsel at trial acknowledged the serious impact that E. T.'s 
  involvement had on the prosecution's case. He took the position that the Crown 
  had presented &quot;some evidence&quot; for a case to meet then concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Having said that, it is instructive that when the first piece of paper comes 
  from her purse, [E. T.] is asked, are there others. Her response, I don't think 
  so. And your Honour's instruction, look. As a result of her looking, two more 
  pieces of paper come out which contain what, in my respectful submission, was 
  seriously damaging evidence with respect to the integrity of the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  [68] The trial judge dismissed the motion. In his ruling, he found that E. T. 
  was on a mission, but even so, there could be credible evidence upon which a 
  jury could reach a conclusion of guilt. He therefore rejected the non-suit motion.</p>
<p>
  [69] In his reasons for decision at the end of the trial, the trial judge made 
  serious findings in respect of E. T. and her role in the prosecution of this 
  case: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Prior to the involvement of [E. T.] in this case, the only complaint which had 
  been made to authorities about the accused's alleged conduct was by [M. S.] 
  in 1990 for what will be referred to as the Parker stretch for ease of description. 
  I will have more to say about the procedure later in these reasons.</p>
<p class="indent"> I am cognizant in this case that a driving force behind the 
  complaint is the energy of one [E. T.]. [E. T.] had worked in the Crown Attorney's 
  office and alleges that she had become aware of the accused's improper conduct 
  [with] his students initially from a discussion that she had with one [J. D.] 
  who was a student of the accused and also ran the Tillsonburg franchise under 
  the accused's direction. Her discussions with&#133;[J. D.] were in June of 1995.</p>
<p class="indent"> As a student in the Crown's office it is the defence position, 
  that armed with a little knowledge, [E. T.] became dangerous, and a crusader 
  looking for sexual assault victims&#133;which she pursued with a vengeance. 
  Her intention became focused upon the accused with respect [sic] from time to 
  time.</p>
<p class="indent"> From time to time I am aware that there was friction between 
  [E. T.] and [J. F.] over [E. T.]'s training and testing. Notably, in the fall 
  of 1995 [J. F.] had refused to permit [E. T.] to test after travelling to Edmonton 
  in training for her grading. I am of the belief that [E. T.] was revengeful 
  from time to time with respect to [J. F.]'s dictates with respect to the operation 
  of his school and grading of his students and her evidence must be reviewed 
  carefully with this factor very much in mind.</p>
<p class="indent"> After speaking to [J. D.], [E. T.] confronted [J. F.] about 
  his activities with him and apparently taped their conversation in which the 
  accused confessed to some impropriety insofar as [J. D.] was concerned. This 
  was in the spring of 1995.</p>
<p class="indent"> I accept the fact as well, that [E. T.] was repulsed by the 
  type of activity which had been described to her and which involved the accused's 
  male students.</p>
<p class="indent"> Prior to approaching authorities in late December, 1995 [E. 
  T.] had contacted and spoken to the complainants in this case about their interactions 
  with the accused and about alleged improprieties. She organized a meeting between 
  themselves.</p>
<p class="indent"> The concern that I have about [E. T.]'s involvement in this 
  case and the opportunity for collusion and fabrication is tempered somewhat 
  by the fact that she gave no direct evidence herself at trial about the alleged 
  inappropriate behaviour. She was not a party to the alleged inappropriate interactions.</p>
<p class="indent"> [E. T.] impressed me as an energetic, aggressive and determined 
  individual on a mission which was to destroy the accused once she became aware 
  of what she believed was his criminal sexual behaviour. Further, her actions 
  were contaminated by the following.</p>
<p class="indent"> She did not admit readily to have notes, albeit in the form 
  of a diary which she deliberately chose not to turn over to the police in the 
  course of the Crown disclosure. I believe that she knew well that her actions 
  in this respect were improper.</p>
<p class="indent"> Contrary to what she said in evidence at trial I find that 
  she did so encourage the complainants to bring their evidence forward, to complain 
  and to see their complaints through to trial. This is indeed what she said in 
  her preliminary and the evidence which she gave at trial was markedly different.</p>
<p class="indent"> After the accused was arrested, she continued to follow the 
  status of this case and the investigation and continued to take more than a 
  passing interest in events.</p>
<p class="indent"> She was indeed the driving force behind the investigation and 
  continued to be so even after the accused was arrested.</p>
<p class="indent"> She ordered, received and communicated the bail transcripts 
  to complainants.</p>
<p class="indent"> Her evidence about her involvement in the continuing investigation 
  and communication with the complainants after the accused was charged is unreliable.</p>
<p class="indent"> Even after she was told to let the police conduct the investigation, 
  by morality officer, Detective Kerkhof, she acted contrary to their [advice] 
  and remained active.</p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied that she knew well the full details of the alleged 
  complaints made by various complainants at an early stage and discussed these 
  complaints with other complainants in detail.</p>
<p class="indent"> The suggestion made by her that she had mild contact with only 
  a few of the boys is a falsehood which is misleading to the Court.</p>
<p class="indent"> The complainants' evidence in light of the above must be viewed 
  and analysed very carefully. That, however, is not the end of the matter.</p>
<p>
  [70] The trial judge then gave effect to his concerns by acquitting the appellant 
  on what he referred to as the &quot;serious allegations of abuse&quot; by the 
  complainants, J. A., B. V., G. S. and C. M. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The activities of [E. T.], raise a doubt, as to the serious allegations of abuse 
  which are denied by the accused. However, this concern does not apply to the 
  incidents of touching associated with the Parker stretch which are, in some 
  cases admitted, and which I find took place.</p>
<p>
  [71] The trial judge made findings with respect to each complainant. In rejecting 
  the evidence of C. M., the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I reiterate my concern that his evidence has been influenced or contaminated 
  by [E. T.] and the other complainants. [E. T.]'s activities, in my view, raise 
  a reasonable doubt as to the veracity of these reports.</p>
<p>
  [72] The trial judge made a similar finding respecting J. A.: </p>
<p class="indent"> The activities of [E. T.] raise a reasonable doubt with respect 
  to these complaints and as a result counts number six and seven will be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [73] Finally, in respect of G. S., the trial judge made the observation that 
  there were similarities in the description of the appellant's approach to him 
  with the descriptions provided by other complainants. His conclusion that: &quot;This 
  similarity could be explained by the activities of [E. T.]&quot;, contributed 
  to his finding that he had a reasonable doubt on the G. S. charge.</p>
<p>
  [74] The trial judge, however, did not reach a similar conclusion in connection 
  with the complaints by B.H., S. M. and M. S. Thus, he discounted the effect 
  of E. T.'s involvement on the evidence given by B. H., S. M. and M. S., while 
  treating her involvement as a poisoning influence on the other complainants.</p>
<p>
  [75] The central question on this appeal is whether the trial judge fully considered 
  and appreciated the possible effect that E. T.'s involvement and the numerous 
  meetings and interactions among the complainants and others could have had on 
  these three complainants and their recollections of the very brief events they 
  explained and described.</p>
<p>
  [76] The trial judge found B. H. to be &quot;a sincere and credible witness 
  who was doing his best to tell the truth and give specifics about a series of 
  events that took place 10-101/2 years ago.&quot; He accepted B. H.'s evidence 
  that &quot;his testimony had not been tainted by [E. T.] or his fellow complainants.&quot; 
  He concluded that: &quot;[B. H.] does not strike me as an individual who is 
  easily influenced and I believe that he is a 'straight shooter.'&quot; Finally, 
  the trial judge noted that B. H. had told his parents about what happened, his 
  mother had testified to it and that that report had taken place long before 
  E. T. 's involvement.</p>
<p>
  [77] The trial judge's finding that B. H. was sincere, a &quot;straight shooter&quot;, 
  and not influenced by E. T. and the others, fails to take into account that 
  collusion and discussion among witnesses can have the effect of tainting a witness's 
  evidence and perception of events innocently or accidentally and unknowingly, 
  as well as deliberately and intentionally. The reliability of a witness's account 
  can be undermined not only by deliberate collusion for the purpose of concocting 
  evidence, but also by the influence of hearing other people's stories, which 
  can tend to colour one's interpretation of personal events or reinforce a perception 
  about which one had doubts or concerns.</p>
<p>
  [78] B. H. had several meetings and telephone conversations with E. T. and numerous 
  conversations with individual complainants from 1995 to 1997 and apparently 
  right up to, and through, the trial. From E. T. he heard the details of stories 
  of what she said had happened to other boys, recounted on the basis that the 
  appellant was a sexual pervert and predator. From other boys he not only heard 
  details of some of their stories, but together they commiserated and supported 
  each other, first as victims of the appellant and eventually as protagonists 
  against him in these proceedings. Once he began to meet with E. T., B. H. concluded 
  and articulated that the appellant was a pervert.</p>
<p> [79] The trial judge's finding, based on B. H.'s demeanour and sincerity, 
  ignored the serious potential for inadvertent tainting from these numerous meetings 
  and conversations, particularly tainting about B. H.'s perception of the appellant's 
  intent, and about whether it was sexual or only to assist with stretching to 
  improve karate skills.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> As B. H. acknowledged 
  in cross-examination, hearing the other stories confirmed in his mind that the 
  appellant was a pervert.</p>
<p>
  [80] The other basis upon which the trial judge discounted the possible effect 
  of tainting on B. H. was because he told his parents at the time about the incident. 
  However, the appellant did not deny that the incident occurred. What he denied 
  is that it was sexual in nature and that he made the comment, which adds credence 
  to the sexual intent of the touching, that the complainant was &quot;getting 
  a big dick.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [81] On that issue, the trial judge made a specific finding that the appellant 
  did say to B. H.: &quot;You are getting a big dick there.&quot; [In the evidence, 
  the comment was described by B. H. as &quot;you are getting a big dick, [B.]&quot;. 
  It is unclear whether discrepancies such as this are merely typographical or 
  dictation errors, or errors in perception of the evidence.] In so finding, the 
  trial judge did not deal with the fact that the complainant's mother did not 
  include that comment in her narrative of what her son told her at the time. 
  He also did not deal with B. H.'s prior testimony at the preliminary hearing 
  where he said the appellant made that statement on another occasion when he 
  told him to wear a jock strap. By not addressing these apparent discrepancies 
  in the evidence, the trial judge failed to consider the possibility that the 
  appellant added that comment advertently or inadvertently as a result of his 
  conversations with others, including E. T. Furthermore, the fact that B. H.'s 
  mother did not include the &quot;big dick&quot; comment in her account of what 
  her son told her, removes the trial judge's only objective reason for discounting 
  the potential effect of tainting on B. H.'s evidence on that crucial point, 
  and therefore also on his perception that the touching was sexual in nature.</p>
<p>
  [82] The trial judge found that S. M. also impressed him as a &quot;genuine, 
  credible witness.&quot; The trial judge did not deal specifically with the potential 
  for tainting of this witness's evidence by his meetings and conversations with 
  E. T. and the other boys. In his general findings, the trial judge said that 
  his concern about her involvement did not extend to the Parker stretch incidents 
  because they were admitted in some cases. However, again, what was not admitted 
  by the appellant was the criminal aspect of the incidents, which was the sexual 
  aspect. As with B. H., S. M.'s perception of the event as sexual was certainly 
  reinforced by his involvement with the group of complainants who had all concluded 
  and firmly believed by the time they decided to go to the police in 1997, that 
  the appellant had assaulted them sexually. The trial judge did not address the 
  evidence that the appellant had confronted S. M. in 1990 about his complaint 
  to the police and that S. M. had agreed at that time that there had been a misunderstanding. 
  Although S. M. confirmed at trial his preliminary inquiry testimony that the 
  appellant had put those words into his mouth, that evidence followed the E. 
  T. involvement, while the 1990 meeting with the appellant was long before it. 
  S. M. was either not as honest or possibly not as perceptive as B. H. about 
  the possible tainting effect of the collusion on his perception of what occurred. 
  However, again, the trial judge did not advert to this very important evidence 
  and address it in the context of his acceptance of the reliability of S. M.'s 
  evidence and his rejection of the appellant's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [83] Although the trial judge did not specifically mention the prior police 
  report as a factor in accepting that S. M.'s evidence was not tainted, that 
  logic, which the trial judge applied to B. H.'s evidence, could apply to S. 
  M.'s evidence as well. Officer H did not provide much detail in his testimony 
  of what S. M. had said to him. Importantly, he did not suggest that S. M. told 
  him that the touching by the appellant was sexual in nature. The fact that in 
  his complaint S. M. did not mention anything sexual is consistent with the appellant's 
  version of events. The evidence of Officer H thus leaves open the suggestion 
  that the complainant changed his perception as a result of his involvement with 
  E. T. and the others. The trial judge failed to consider the ramifications of 
  this evidence and the serious possibility of at least inadvertent tainting.</p>
<p>
  [84] The trial judge also accepted M. S. as &quot;an honest witness doing his 
  best to recount an unpleasant experience.&quot; He accepted that the appellant 
  had cupped M. S.'s genitals and had asked him whether he could have an erection. 
  He rejected the appellant's denial of this part of the incident or that there 
  was any sexual aspect to demonstrating the stretch technique. The trial judge 
  did not discuss the possibility of advertent or inadvertent tainting of M. S.'s 
  evidence, or the similar use of the term &quot;cupping&quot; by others in their 
  discussions. Nor did he consider the impact on M. S. of the very serious sexual 
  accusations made by the other boys, which M. S. had heard about over the course 
  of many conversations and meetings. The trial judge's only reference to E. T.'s 
  involvement with M. S. was in the context of the Parker stretch incidents, partly 
  admitted by the appellant. Again, the sexual accusations were vehemently denied 
  by the appellant, and were the main subject of the discussions by E. T. and 
  the others.</p>
<p>
  [85] In addition, in his reasons, the trial judge made no reference to each 
  of the three complainant's continued karate lessons or association with the 
  appellant over several years. Again, this behaviour by the complainants could 
  suggest that their perceptions of the incidents at the time differed from their 
  perceptions of them at trial. By ignoring this evidence, the trial judge again 
  failed to advert to the possibility of tainting because of E. T.'s involvement.</p>
<p> [86] The Supreme Court has recently addressed the seriousness of the possibility 
  that evidence has been tainted by collusion in the context of the treatment 
  of similar fact evidence. In the cases of R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 
  481 and R. v. Shearing (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 225, the court held that before 
  admitting similar fact evidence, the trial judge must be satisfied of its reliability 
  and exclude it if not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the evidence 
  is not tainted by collusion. Once admitted, the jury must still be warned to 
  assess the evidence carefully and to consider whether it can be considered reliable 
  given the possibility of deliberate or accidental tainting by collusion among 
  the witnesses (Shearing at para.44).<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> </p>
<p>
  [87] In R. v. Burke (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 205, the Supreme Court discussed 
  concocted evidence outside the context of similar fact evidence. The court held 
  that a trial court must scrutinize crucial evidence with special care, and must 
  consider any circumstances which could affect its reliability, including the 
  possibility of collusion. In that case, the failure of the trial judge to consider 
  that possibility led the Supreme Court to declare the verdict unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [88] In this case, the trial judge was not only alive to the potential for E. 
  T.'s involvement to taint the evidence of the complainants, he dismissed several 
  of the charges in part because of the potential for tainting. However, the trial 
  judge discounted the same possible tainting effect on the evidence of three 
  of the complainants. Instead, he fully accepted their evidence without a critical 
  analysis either of the discrepancies and changes in their views and actions 
  over the years or of the possible intentional and unintentional effects of the 
  numerous meetings among the complainants led by E. T., who was motivated by 
  her personal animus against the appellant. This failure by the trial judge constitutes 
  a serious error of law, which affects his appreciation of all of the Crown evidence 
  he relied on, as well as his basis for rejecting the evidence of the appellant 
  and the appellant's witnesses. By itself this failure requires the court to 
  set aside the convictions.</p>
<p>
  (2) Reversal of the Burden of Proof</p>
<p>
  [89] In his reasons for decision, the trial judge did not refer specifically 
  to the decision in R. v. W.D., [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. However, in the latter part 
  of his lengthy reasons (headed &quot;Reasons for Decision&quot;), he first rejected 
  the evidence of the appellant and of the witnesses called by the defence, then 
  turned to the Crown evidence that he accepted and that which he rejected, resulting 
  in three convictions and four acquittals. Although the trial judge therefore 
  applied the methodology set out in W.D., in his rejection of the defence evidence, 
  it appears that he shifted the burden of proof in relation to crucial matters, 
  the most significant of which is the Parker stretch. He also treated the evidence 
  of the appellant and of his witnesses differently from the evidence of the Crown 
  witnesses, subjecting it to greater scrutiny and criticism. He made the further 
  error of determining the credibility of Crown witnesses based on demeanour, 
  accepting their evidence on that basis while rejecting the evidence of the defence 
  witnesses, again substantially on the basis of demeanour.</p>
<p> [90] In R. v. Gostick (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 53<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  this court warned against an approach to the evidence which bases credibility 
  decisions on demeanour, approaches the evidence with a harsher standard of scrutiny 
  for the defence than for the Crown witnesses and which accepts the complainants' 
  evidence as true, then proceeds to discredit the contrary evidence. In R. v. 
  J.C. (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 197, another decision of this court, a new trial 
  was ordered where the trial judge rejected the appellant's evidence without 
  properly assessing it in light of all the other evidence that supported his 
  version of events.</p>
<p>
  [91] The trial judge found the Parker stretch to be a figment of the appellant's 
  imagination, invented to justify his sexual aggression on his students. He made 
  this finding by rejecting the evidence of the appellant about the stretch and 
  by rejecting the evidence of S. Mc., S. W. and P. M. about the stretch. He did 
  this essentially by finding their evidence incredible and by rejecting as suspect 
  all the defence evidence, because the four defence witnesses all had close associations 
  with the appellant. The trial judge did not explain why this would give them 
  a motive to fabricate. In many cases witnesses who are called on behalf of a 
  party have an association with the party. That is why they are able to give 
  relevant evidence. In this case, there was no suggestion in the cross-examinations 
  by the Crown of the defence witnesses that they were lying because of their 
  relationship with the appellant or that they had concocted or met to contrive 
  their evidence.</p>
<p>
  [92] The Crown led no evidence that the Parker stretch did not or could not 
  exist or that its existence was not found in any written material. The Crown 
  called no witness in the Kenpo Karate field or who had been associated with 
  Parker or his movement. The appellant was asked whether there was anything in 
  written literature about the stretch and he answered that he did not know. However, 
  the trial judge made a finding that there was nothing in writing, then used 
  that finding to conclude that if the stretch was as valuable as the appellant 
  said it was, it would have been committed to print. He also reasoned that the 
  American Kenpo Karate Program owners would have protected the copyright in the 
  stretch and marketed it, again without any evidence on the point one way or 
  the other. He also concluded that the appellant would have promoted the stretch 
  more widely if it was real. In the result, after stating his reasons for rejecting 
  the existence of the stretch, the trial judge said: &quot;In this case, there 
  is no credible evidence which would legitimize the procedure or which would 
  dispel the conclusions that I have reached, that this contact was illegal.&quot; 
  The trial judge's reasoning amounts to placing the burden on the appellant to 
  prove, using entirely independent evidence, that the stretch existed as a legitimate 
  karate technique. </p>
<p>
  [93] The trial judge also categorically rejected the evidence of the defence 
  witnesses because they were not independent, and found that their evidence did 
  not raise a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [94] He rejected S. Mc.'s evidence as &quot;rehearsed and manufactured,&quot; 
  a reference to demeanour. He first rejected the witness's analogy of the stretch 
  demonstration to a medical check-up, on the basis that the appellant is not 
  a licensed professional. This constituted a misapprehension of the testimony 
  of the witness, who was not suggesting that the appellant was a doctor or was 
  licensed, but that the circumstances of the demonstration involving naked touching 
  by his teacher were similar to those of a medical check-up by a doctor. The 
  trial judge also rejected the dramatic results reported by S. Mc. as incredible, 
  without adverting to the evidence of others, including S. M. and M. S., that 
  their stretching ability had improved. The trial judge also found that the appellant 
  may have treated S. Mc. differently from the others in demonstrating the stretch, 
  as there was no contact with the genitalia. S. Mc. said he cupped himself with 
  his hand. However, this was consistent with the appellant's explanation that 
  genital contact was not part of the procedure and that, depending on the position 
  the student was in, his hands were or were not free to move his own genitalia. 
  Furthermore, the appellant said that B. H. was covering his own genitals with 
  his own hand. I conclude that the trial judge's reasons for rejecting S. Mc.'s 
  evidence as unreliable do not bear scrutiny. </p>
<p>
  [95] The trial judge also described the evidence of defence witness S. W. as 
  &quot;rehearsed and fabricated.&quot; This conclusion was based on his friendship 
  with the appellant as well as the fact that S. W. said he heard of the stretch, 
  that a lot of students were excelling at it and that he heard about it in 1986, 
  which was before 1988 when the appellant said he learned it in Baltimore. The 
  trial judge considered this error to be evidence of fabrication rather than 
  a two year mistake about a date that would not have been significant to S. W. 
  who was never shown the stretch, and about which he was not cross-examined. 
  Furthermore, the trial judge drew a serious adverse conclusion against one witness 
  where other witnesses also made errors or were unsure as to dates and years 
  but were not taken to task on the issue (e.g. S. M. and M. S.).</p>
<p>
  [96] The trial judge also rejected the corroborative evidence of P. M., saying 
  that he had &quot;grave reservations about credibility.&quot; He discounted 
  the evidence first because P. M. is a friend of the appellant and had a financial 
  relationship with him and, second, because he said he was shown the stretch 
  15 times, while the trial judge drew an inference from the appellant's evidence 
  that he did not show him the stretch that many times. In fact, the appellant 
  was never asked how many times he had shown the stretch to P. M.</p>
<p>
  [97] Thus, the trial judge appears to have rejected the defence witnesses by 
  effectively putting an onus on them to prove the truth and demonstrate the accuracy 
  of their recollections. From the trial judge's treatment of the evidence of 
  all of the defence witnesses, it appears that he effectively decided that the 
  appellant was guilty, and based on that conclusion, rejected outright all of 
  the evidence tendered by the defence. </p>
<p>
  [98] The trial judge also specifically applied a much more stringent level of 
  scrutiny to the evidence of the appellant than to that of the complainants. 
  He gave B. H. credit for doing his best to remember specifics of the events 
  that took place 10 to 101/2 years before. In fact, B. H. was very specific in 
  his description of the shower incident. Yet the trial judge criticized the appellant 
  for remembering the same incident with detail and attributed the memory to guilt 
  or to lying. In particular, he found it hard to accept that the appellant recalled 
  bringing shampoo to B. H. in the women's shower room, yet this was the same 
  evidence that B. H. gave. The trial judge did not advert to the appellant's 
  cross-examination where he said that he did not remember certain details, such 
  as commenting about B. H.'s tan in April, but agreed that he might have, as 
  B. H. recalled. In other words, it was B. H. who recalled many details, while 
  the appellant did not, but the trial judge perceived the opposite and found 
  it a reason to reject the appellant's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [99] In R. v. Norman (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 153 at 172-3, this court was faced 
  with a similar approach by the trial judge, who discounted defence evidence 
  or held the accused </p>
<p>
  to a different standard of recall than the Crown witnesses. The court held that 
  by so doing, the trial judge had effectively shifted the onus to the accused. 
  </p>
<p>
  [100] This shift of the onus is also apparent in this case in the way the trial 
  judge approached the evidence of the complainants and of the appellant in terms 
  of credibility. The trial judge appears to have treated the evidence as a credibility 
  contest, for example in the case of M. S., where he found that he &quot;accepted 
  and preferred&quot; the complainant's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [101] Finally, the trial judge relied heavily on demeanour in his assessment 
  of the evidence of the complainants, noting that they impressed him as honest 
  and doing his best in the case of M. S., sincere and credible and doing his 
  best in the case of B. H., and genuine and credible in the case of S. M. The 
  trial judge failed to address the inconsistencies in their evidence, the potential 
  effect of the meetings with the others and E. T. and their perceptions of that 
  potential effect, or the parts of their evidence which assisted the appellant, 
  such as M. S.'s and S. M.'s acknowledgement that the stretch was useful. This 
  court has stated on numerous occasions that it is an error for a trial judge 
  to base credibility decisions solely on the demeanour of witnesses: Norman, 
  supra, at p.173-4, and Gostick, supra, at p.61. </p>
<p>
  (3) Misapprehension of the Evidence</p>
<p>
  [102] The trial judge made numerous errors in his findings and misapprehended 
  important parts of the evidence. Although some of these errors can be understood 
  as slips, one cannot be certain at what point the errors must reflect a misapprehension 
  or at least confusion about the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [103] The trial judge found that the charges in this case stemmed from Project 
  Guardian. This was a notorious police investigation in London in 1990 and had 
  nothing to do with this investigation.</p>
<p>
  [104] The trial judge stated that prior to E. T.'s involvement, the only complaint 
  that had been made to the authorities about the appellant was by M. S. in 1990. 
  Of course the complaint in 1990 was by S. M. </p>
<p>
  [105] The trial judge stated that the Parker stretch incident with M. S. was 
  in 1998. This was an error. He went on to convict the appellant on count 10 
  regarding M. S. which relates to the period January 1988 to December 1989, and 
  to acquit on count 9, January 1985 to December 1987, saying that that count 
  related to events before January 1989.</p>
<p>
  [106] The trial judge misapprehended the evidence of E. T. regarding her taped 
  conversation with the appellant. The trial judge understood that in that conversation 
  the appellant admitted to some impropriety with J. D. There was never any suggestion 
  of impropriety with J. D. E. T. testified that the appellant admitted some impropriety 
  with an unnamed student. The appellant testified that what he admitted to was 
  acting wrongly by not intervening when asked to do so by a student who needed 
  protection from E. T. </p>
<p>
  [107] One very significant misapprehension, adverted to earlier in these reasons, 
  was with respect to the comment attributed to the appellant by B. H. that during 
  the shower incident he said &quot;you're getting a big dick, [B.].&quot; Not 
  only did the appellant deny making the comment, but the complainant's mother 
  did not include the remark in her narrative of what her son had told her at 
  the time, nor did it appear that B. H. said it at the preliminary inquiry. The 
  trial judge did not acknowledge these inconsistencies, nor did he attempt to 
  explain or reconcile them when he made the finding, in the face of them, that 
  the appellant did make the impugned comment. As I said above, this comment formed 
  a critical part of the evidence as to whether the touching was for a sexual 
  purpose. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [108] The trial judge made serious mistakes in his approach to the assessment 
  and apprehension of the evidence that require this court to set aside the convictions. 
  I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial. Given 
  the extensive collusion and likelihood of tainting of the evidence of the witnesses 
  in this case, the court must consider whether the appropriate remedy is to find 
  an unreasonable verdict and enter an acquittal. I have concluded that this is 
  not a case for that verdict. It could have been open to the trial judge, based 
  on the conduct admitted by the accused, to convict him of the offences of sexual 
  assault and sexual interference. To do so, the trial judge was required, based 
  on proper principles, to reject as raising no reasonable doubt, all of the defence 
  evidence that the touching was not sexual. In my view, although that would be 
  a difficult assessment for the trial judge to make, because it was open to him, 
  this is not a case of unreasonable verdict. Accordingly, the convictions will 
  be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>

  purpose (B. H.) is one of specific intent, while the offence of sexual assault 
  (S. M. and M. S.) is one of general intent. In the latter case, the test for 
  whether the assault is &quot;sexual&quot; is an objective one based on all the 
  factors including the part of the body touched, the nature of the contact, the 
  situation, the words and gestures accompanying it, the other conduct including 
  threats or force as well as the intent, motive or purpose of the perpetrator: 
  R. v. Chase, [1987] 2. S.C.R. 293 at para. 11. In both cases, the complainant's 
  perception of the nature of the touching is an important factor in the judge's 
  determination.</p>
<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> The issue of the trial judge&#146;s use 
  of the three incidents on which he convicted as similar fact evidence on the 
  issue of the appellant&#146;s sexual intent does not appear to have been raised 
  at the trial or on the appeal. However, to the extent that the trial judge may 
  have used the evidence in that way and for that purpose, a rigorous collusion 
  analysis was required in accordance with Handy and Shearing before the evidence 
  could be considered by the trial judge as similar fact evidence for any purpose. 
  Although the trial judge did not specifically say that his conclusion that the 
  appellant&#146;s purpose in touching the complainants in the course of his stretching 
  demonstration was not innocent but sexual was based on his consideration of 
  the three incidents in combination, it is clear from his reasons in rejecting 
  the veracity of the appellant generally and about the Parker stretch in particular, 
  that he was using all three incidents together as evidence of a modus operandi 
  on the part of the appellant. </p>
