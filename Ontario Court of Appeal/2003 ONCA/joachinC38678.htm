<p>On appeal from an order of Justice G. Gordon Sedgwick, of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated July 8, 2002, reported at 39 C.C.L.I. (3d) 267.</p>
<p> GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] Halifax Insurance Company, the third party, appeals from the order of the 
  motions judge that had the effect of holding Halifax responsible for the first 
  $200,000 of damages and costs payable to the plaintiffs in this action, pursuant 
  to ss. 258(1) and (4) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended 
  (&quot;the Act&quot;).</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] On August 19, 1998, Theron Abel intentionally operated his truck so as to 
  strike and injure the plaintiffs, Eric Joachin, Alex Lapointe and San-Hep Phou.</p>
<p>
  [3] Abel had automobile insurance with Halifax at the date of the accident. 
  The defendant, The Co-operators General Insurance Company, insured Joachin and 
  Lapointe at the date of the accident under policies that provided uninsured 
  motorists' coverage. All of the plaintiffs' claims arising from the accident 
  have been resolved but Halifax and Co-operators cannot agree on which of them 
  is responsible for the first $200,000 of the claims owed to the plaintiffs as 
  a result of the settlement. </p>
<p>
  [4] Halifax brought a motion to determine whether it is responsible for the 
  first $200,000 of damages and costs payable to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>
  [5] The parties to the motion agreed that the following statements of fact were 
  to be assumed for the purposes of the motion. The motor vehicle accident occurred 
  when Abel, operating a truck that he owned and with the intention to cause injury, 
  struck and injured the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs sued Abel for damages 
  caused by the collision, Halifax was not required to defend those actions on 
  Abel's behalf because Abel acted intentionally in causing the plaintiffs' injuries. 
  Settlement of the plaintiffs' claims constitutes judgments for the purposes 
  of the motion. Phou was uninsured at the date of the accident. Pursuant to the 
  terms of settlement, a consent judgment was obtained as against Abel. If Halifax 
  is not responsible for payment of Phou's settlement, the judgment will be payable 
  by the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund.</p>
<p>
  The Parties' Positions</p>
<p>
  [6] Halifax submits that there are two preconditions to recovery under s. 258(1) 
  of the Act. First, as the insurer, Halifax must be obliged to indemnify the 
  insured Abel. Second, insurance monies must be payable under the contract. As 
  a result of the operation of s. 118 of the Act, Halifax is not obliged to indemnify 
  Abel. Thus, Halifax argues, the first precondition is not met and the plaintiffs 
  cannot look to it, pursuant to s. 258(1), for the first $200,000 of the plaintiffs' 
  judgments. </p>
<p>
  [7] Co-operators and the Fund argue that, while an insured may forfeit its right 
  to indemnity in certain circumstances, an innocent third party's right of recovery 
  under s. 258(1) is a separate and distinct right that is not dependent on the 
  insured having a right to indemnity under his or her contract. Thus, they submit, 
  Halifax is responsible for such monies pursuant to the provisions of section 
  258 of the Act.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [8] On a plain reading of s. 118, an insured's right to indemnity under the 
  insuring agreement is rendered unenforceable where the insured commits a criminal 
  act with the intent of bringing about loss or damage.</p>
<p class="indent"> 118 - Unless the contract otherwise provides, a contravention 
  of any criminal or other law in force in Ontario or elsewhere does not, by that 
  fact alone, render unenforceable a claim for indemnity under a contract of insurance 
  except where the contravention is committed by the insured, or by another person 
  with the consent of the insured, with intent to bring about loss or damage, 
  but in the case of a contract of life insurance this section applies only to 
  disability insurance undertaken as part of the contract. [emphasis added] </p>
<p>
  [9] Subsection 258(1) gives injured third parties, such as the plaintiffs, a 
  right of action for direct compensation from the insurer of the driver who struck 
  them and caused their injuries.</p>
<p class="indent"> 258 (1) Any person who has a claim against an insured for which 
  indemnity is provided by a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy, 
  even if such person is not a party to the contract, may, upon recovering a judgment 
  therefor in any province or territory of Canada against the insured, have the 
  insurance money payable under the contract applied in or towards satisfaction 
  of the person's judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured 
  covered by the contract and may, on the person's own behalf and on behalf of 
  all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the 
  insurer to have the insurance money so applied. [emphasis added]</p>
<p> [10] Subsection 258(4) prevents an insurer from defending a s. 258(1) claim 
  on the basis of certain acts or defaults of the insured.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  Clause (c) of subsection 258(4) makes it clear that a criminal act of the owner 
  or driver of a vehicle does not provide the insurer with a defence to a claim 
  under s. 258(1). </p>
<p class="indent"> (4) The right of a person who is entitled under subsection 
  (1) to have insurance money applied upon the person's judgment or claim is not 
  prejudiced by,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) an assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation or discharge 
  of the contract, or of any interest therein or of the proceeds thereof, made 
  by the insured after the happening of the event giving rise to a claim under 
  the contract;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) any act or default of the insured before or after that 
  event in contravention of this Part or of the terms of the contract; or</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) any contravention of the Criminal Code (Canada) or a statute 
  of any province or territory of Canada or of any state or the District of Columbia 
  of the United States of America by the owner or driver of the automobile,</p>
<p class="indent"> and nothing mentioned in clause (a), (b) or (c) is available 
  to the insurer as a defence in an action brought under subsection (1). [emphasis 
  added]</p>
<p>
  [11] The intent of s. 258(1) is to enable innocent, injured third parties to 
  recover from the insurer of the driver who struck them and caused their injuries. 
  The rights between the tortfeasor and his or her insurer are dealt with in different 
  provisions, including s. 118. While an insurer can rely on s. 118 to deny an 
  insured's claim for indemnity, s. 258(4) makes it clear that an innocent third 
  party is not to be deprived of his or her remedy because of the criminal conduct 
  of the insured.</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view, the word &quot;indemnity&quot; in s. 258(1) is used not to 
  create a precondition but as part of a description. The provisions of s. 258(1) 
  do not extend to provide for persons with claims against all insureds. Rather, 
  it provides for persons with claims against a subgroup of the class of insureds, 
  namely, those insureds &quot;for which indemnity is provided by a contract evidenced 
  by a motor vehicle liability policy&quot;. The fact that Abel may not enforce 
  a claim for indemnity because of his actions does not make Abel an insured person 
  without a contract providing for indemnity. Abel remains a person with a contract 
  that provides for indemnity despite the fact that the right to indemnity is 
  unenforceable as a result of his actions.</p>
<p>
  [13] Thus, in my view, the combined effect of subsections 258(1) and (4) is 
  to create an absolute liability on the part of the insurer toward a person injured 
  by a person insured under a motor vehicle liability policy. A plaintiff's action 
  under s. 258(1) is independent of the insured's right of indemnification.</p>
<p>
  [14] Halifax's reliance on Walker. v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada (1989), 
  67 O.R. (2d) 733 (C.A.) is misplaced. In Walker, a person drove a vehicle without 
  the consent of the vehicle's owner and got into an accident. Because he did 
  not have the owner's consent, the driver was not covered under the terms of 
  his own motor vehicle policy. The court held that the plaintiffs, who had obtained 
  judgment against the driver, were not entitled to recover under his policy.</p>
<p>
  [15] As this court stated in Companaro v. Kim (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.) 
  at p. 560, consent is not an issue that is properly part of a s. 258 analysis. 
  The court went on to confirm that Walker stands for the proposition that where 
  a person is driving without the consent of the named insured, the insurer's 
  obligation to pay an injured third party is controlled by the insuring agreement 
  in the policy in question. </p>
<p>
  [16] Consent is not in issue in issue in the case at bar which falls to be decided 
  squarely under s. 258.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. Costs of the appeal, as per the 
  agreement of the parties, are fixed in the amount of $12,500 to Co-operators 
  and $7,500 to the Fund.</p>
<p> &quot;E.E. Gillese J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree D.H. Doherty J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree A.M. Austin J.A.&quot;<br>

<p><a name="1"></a> [1] Section 258(11) creates a limited exception to s. 258(4). 
  Under s. 258(11), the insured can avail itself of any defence it is entitled 
  to set up against the insured, despite (4), but only with respect to coverage 
  in excess of the statutory minimum of $200,000 set out in s. 251. </p>
