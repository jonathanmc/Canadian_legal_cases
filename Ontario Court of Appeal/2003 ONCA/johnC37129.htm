<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice Joan L. Lax of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated October 10, 2001.</p>
<p>WEILER J.A.:</p><p>
  Nature of Appeal </p><p>
  [1] The primary issue on this appeal is the interpretation of paragraph 14 in 
  the real estate brokers' standard agreement of purchase and sale. Paragraph 
  14 reads:</p>
<p class="indent"> Planning Act: This Agreement shall be effective to 
  create an interest in the property only if Vendor complies with the subdivision 
  control provisions of the Planning Act by completion and Vendor covenants to 
  proceed diligently at his expense to obtain any necessary consent by completion.</p>
<p> [2] Further issues are whether the trial judge erred in concluding that 805062 
  Ontario Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Magna) did not have the right to terminate 
  the Agreement of Purchase and Sale on the basis of the doctrine of frustration 
  and whether she erred in ordering specific performance of the Agreement. In 
  connection with these issues Magna challenges certain factual findings made 
  by the trial judge. There is also an appeal as to costs. </p>
<p>
  [3] The standard of review of a judge's factual findings and inferences drawn 
  from the facts is palpable and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaison (2002), 
  211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.). Questions of mixed fact and law involving the 
  application of a legal standard to a set of facts and are generally also subject 
  to a standard of palpable and overriding error. If, however, it is clear that 
  the trial judge made some extricable error in principle with respect to the 
  characterization of the standard or its application, the error may amount to 
  an error of law, and a standard of correctness will apply.</p><p>
  Facts</p><p>
  [4] The decision of Lax J. is reported at (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 341. As a result 
  it is only necessary to give a summary of the facts sufficient to understand 
  the issues in this appeal. </p><p>
  [5] In July, 1999, Magna agreed to sell 4.12 acres of serviced undeveloped land 
  in the City of Vaughan (the City) near Canada's Wonderland to the respondent, 
  John E. Dodge Holdings Ltd. (&quot;Dodge&quot;), a hotel builder and manager. 
  The Agreement, including paragraph 14 reproduced above, was contained on the 
  real estate bureau's standard commercial form of agreement of purchase and sale. 
  </p><p>
  [6] For the transaction to proceed in accordance with the Planning Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. P.13, severance approval was required from the City. Magna applied 
  for and obtained the severance subject to certain conditions, the principal 
  one being that Magna, &quot;extend Caldari Road at his expense to the north 
  limits of his property, if required, to the satisfaction of the Engineering 
  Department&quot; and dedicate this land to the City, if required. Neither Magna 
  nor Dodge had any need for the road extension and building it would have been 
  solely for the benefit of the property to the north. </p><p>
  [7] Magna attempted to get the Committee of Adjustment (the Committee) to remove 
  the condition relating to the building of the road extension but was unsuccessful 
  in this regard. Initially, Magna said it would appeal the decision of the Committee 
  to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB), but on the last day for appealing, May 
  11, 2000, it decided not to appeal. Instead, Magna took the position that it 
  was entitled to terminate the Agreement. A letter was sent to Dodge stating 
  in part, &quot;[a]s it is not now possible to complete the transaction contemplated 
  by the Agreement of Purchase and Sale in accordance with its terms and conditions, 
  we hereby terminate the Agreement of Purchase and Sale&#133;&quot;.</p><p>
  [8] Dodge commenced an action seeking an order for specific performance of the 
  Agreement and obtained a judgment in its favour from Lax J. on October 10, 2001. 
  Under the Planning Act, where an approval authority such as the Committee of 
  Adjustment has imposed conditions to a severance, the consent to sever is not 
  final until all conditions have been satisfied and, if the conditions are not 
  satisfied within one year, the application is deemed refused. As severance approval 
  for the property had expired, the judgment of Lax J. required Magna to reapply 
  to the Committee to seek severance approval, appeal to the OMB any unacceptable 
  conditions imposed by the Committee, and, subject to the OMB's decision, comply 
  with all severance conditions. </p><p>
  [9] Magna appealed the judgment of Lax J. and brought a motion for a stay before 
  Charron J.A. on October 22, 2001. Charron J.A. ordered Magna to prepare and 
  file an application for severance approval with the Committee and if unacceptable 
  conditions were once again imposed, to proceed with an appeal to the OMB. The 
  remainder of the judgment was stayed. </p><p>
  [10] Shortly thereafter, Magna submitted an application for severance to the 
  City of Vaughan. In the second application Magna requested severance of 3.7 
  acres as opposed to property described in the Agreement as &quot;having a frontage 
  of 400 feet more or less by a depth of 500 feet more or less and legally described 
  as totalling 4.12 acres, designated as Parts 2 and 3 on Plan 65R-11385&quot;. 
  Dodge was of the opinion this second application was not in accordance with 
  the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. On November 23, 2001 Lax J. ordered Magna 
  to amend its application to conform to the March 2000 consent application for 
  severance that had been filed. Magna also appealed the November 23 order and 
  brought a motion to stay the Order of Lax J. pending the outcome of that appeal. 
  A stay of the November 23, 2001 order was denied and Magna amended its application 
  as directed by Lax J. The appeals were consolidated. On the hearing of this 
  appeal Magna abandoned its appeal respecting the November 23 order.</p><p>
  [11] Fresh evidence was filed at the outset of this appeal. The fresh evidence 
  indicates that in response to the severance application, the Committee of Adjustment 
  imposed the same conditions, including that Magna build the road and dedicate 
  the land covered by the road to the City, if required. Magna appealed the conditions 
  to the OMB. The OMB deleted the conditions. Instead, the OMB required Magna 
  to grant a utility corridor easement over a narrower strip of land located in 
  part on Magna's land and in part on the land Dodge was purchasing. As a result, 
  Magna does not have to build the road and will retain title to the land subject 
  to an easement. </p><p>
  Analysis</p><p>
  1. The interpretation of clause 14 and whether Magna had the right to terminate 
  the Agreement having regard to the conditions of severance imposed by the City.</p><p>
  [12] The trial judge correctly noted that the starting point for interpreting 
  a contract must be the words of the agreement. The words should be given their 
  ordinary meaning, and the factual matrix in which the agreement was negotiated 
  should be taken into account. This was a commercial document and the meaning 
  to be accorded to it should be consistent with good business sense and avoid 
  commercial absurdity.</p>
<p>[13] Magna's first submission is that the evidence as to the state of mind 
  of the parties when the Agreement was signed does not support the finding of 
  Lax J. that the parties intended Magna to carry all the risk, burden and uncertainty 
  associated with obtaining a severance. To interpret the clause in this manner, 
  submits Magna, creates an obligation that was never contemplated by the vendors 
  and purchasers who used this standard form of agreement. Despite the clear wording 
  of paragraph 14, Magna submits the parties did not intend that Magna should 
  be required to comply with any condition of severance imposed by the Committee, 
  such as building a road and dedicating the land to the municipality. Magna states 
  that it only intended to access the property by means of a private drive and 
  that it was only intending to build services to the property line, River Rock 
  Gate and the Caldari Road stub. When more than this was required, it made best 
  efforts in good faith to get the extra requirements removed. Magna submits that 
  is all it was required to do. It was not required to go to unreasonable and 
  unintended lengths to meet its obligations under the Agreement.</p>
<p> <em>What was the intention of the parties at the time the Agreement was signed?</em></p>
<p>
  [14] Contrary to Magna's submission, however, the evidence supports the finding 
  of Lax J. that the parties did in fact intend paragraph 14 to apply as written. 
  As she noted, both parties to the transaction were sophisticated and experienced 
  in business transactions and real estate development in particular. Magna had 
  every opportunity to amend the standard Planning Act provision but did not do 
  so. Allen Eagleson Jr., an experienced lawyer who worked for Magna, reviewed 
  the Agreement. He suggested a number of changes from Dodge's first offer that 
  were accepted and incorporated into the offer to purchase that was eventually 
  accepted, but nothing was suggested in regard to paragraph 14. Mr. Czernohorsky, 
  a senior officer at Magna, and Mr. Colburn, the general counsel to Magna responsible 
  for its entire legal department, also reviewed the document and made a number 
  of amendments to the pre-printed form as well as to the Schedule attached to 
  it, all of which were accepted by Dodge. Again the Planning Act provision was 
  not changed. </p><p>
  [15] Justice Lax found that Magna intended to build an extension to Caldari 
  Road at the time the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was signed. Some of the 
  evidence to which Lax J. referred respecting Magna's intention at the time it 
  entered into the Agreement with Dodge includes the following: </p><p>
<ul>  
<li> Magna applied to the City to amend its zoning bylaw in 1998 to allow it to 
  build a speed stamp plant. At that time the plans filed by Magna proposed internal 
  road access to the plant by building an extension of Caldari Road. Its calculations 
  of land available for building purposes also contemplated the building of the 
  road.</li>

    <li> In May, Mr. Hossack, the general manager of another Magna subsidiary 
      who negotiated the terms of the Agreement with Dodge, sought corporate approval 
      to proceed with the negotiation and sale to Dodge. He wrote &quot;We are 
      selling this land serviced. To do this we must construct a cul-de-sac and 
      complete all other services on the site along the road.&quot;</li>
    <li>Magna obtained two quotes to build the road extension.</li>
    <li> Representatives of Dodge saw the location of the proposed cul-de-sac 
      at the northern boundary of the property as indicated by surveyors' stakes. </li>
    <li>In June 1999, the City's planning staff confirmed that if the road lands 
      were dedicated, Magna could sever its land without an application to the 
      Committee of Adjustment. Dodge was prepared to pay one-half the cost of 
      building the road if the City required the road to be built. </li>
    <li> Two weeks after the Agreement of Purchase and Sale the configuration 
      of the proposed speed stamp plant changed. By turning the direction of the 
      building around, Magna no longer required access to the plant internally 
      across its land via Caldari Road and could access the plant from an existing 
      road. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  [16] There is ample evidence to support the finding of Lax J. that when Magna 
  entered into the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, it was not commercially unreasonable 
  for it to assume the burden of building the extension because that is precisely 
  what it had intended to do at that time. It was not intending to build services 
  only to the Caldari Road stub. </p>
<p> <em>Did Dodge waive its right to compliance with paragraph 14?</em></p>
<p>
  [17] Paragraph 25 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale states that to the extent 
  there is conflict or ambiguity between the pre-printed portion of the Agreement 
  (which contains paragraph 14) and the added clauses in Schedule A attached to 
  the Agreement, the added clauses supercede the pre-printed sections. Clause 
  (e), which forms part of Schedule A and is attached to the Agreement of Purchase 
  and Sale reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> All servicing to the Property lot line, including the 
  roads serving the property shall have been completed.</p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant submits that there is an obvious conflict between paragraph 
  14 and the waiver of Schedule A, clause (e). As a condition of severance, the 
  Committee of Adjustment imposed on Magna the obligation to build a road &quot;if 
  required&quot;. Clause (e) required Magna to complete any roads serving the 
  property by closing. When Dodge insisted on performance of the Agreement, it 
  waived all conditions in the offer and paid the final portion of the deposit. 
  Magna's position is that the effect of the waiver was to release Magna from 
  the condition requiring the road serving the property to be built because clause 
  (e) was waived. Though paragraph 14 requires Magna to comply with the Committee's 
  subdivision control provisions, it claims the waiver of clause (3) takes precedence 
  under the wording of paragraph 25. </p><p>
  [19] The waiver of clause (e) by Dodge, however, affected only the conditions 
  in the Agreement as between Dodge and Magna. That waiver could not affect any 
  requirements imposed by the Committee on Magna, as the Committee was not a party 
  to the Agreement. Furthermore, in order for paragraph 25 to apply, there must 
  be a conflict between paragraph 14 and clause (e). This is not the case. The 
  Agreement of Purchase and Sale did not contain a closing date. Thus, once the 
  application for severance was made and any conditions within it are complied 
  with, any roads servicing the property would be completed by the date the parties 
  would agree to close. Paragraph 25 would not apply because there would be no 
  conflict. The waiver therefore affected only clause (e) and did not limit Magna's 
  obligations under paragraph 14. </p>
<p> <em>Is paragraph 14 ambiguous?</em></p>
<p>
  [20] Magna further submits that there is ambiguity as to the extent of Magna's 
  obligations under paragraph 14, and that in such a situation the doctrine of 
  contra proferentem applies. That is, if there is ambiguity in the Agreement 
  that cannot be resolved by other rules of construction, then the language of 
  the contract will be construed against the party that drafted the ambiguous 
  provision: P.M. Perell, &quot;The Ambiguity Exception to the Parol Evidence 
  Rule&quot; (2001) 36 Can. Bus. L. J. 21 at 29. </p><p>
  [21] Paragraph 14 clearly imposes on the vendor an obligation to obtain &quot;any 
  necessary consent&quot;. I have already indicated that there is no conflict 
  between paragraph 14 and Schedule A, clause (e). Consequently, paragraph 14 
  is not ambiguous. </p>
<p> <em>What is the extent of Magna's obligation under paragraph 14?</em></p>
<p>
  [22] Magna's next submission is that the extent of its obligation in law pursuant 
  to paragraph 14 is to act in good faith and to use best efforts to meet its 
  obligation to obtain a severance. It submits that it fulfilled this requirement. 
  </p><p>
  [23] In support of this submission that paragraph 14 only obliges a vendor to 
  make best efforts to obtain a severance, Magna relies on Dynamic Transport Ltd. 
  v. O.K. Detailing Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1072 at 1084. In that case both parties 
  were aware that subdivision approval pursuant to the Planning Act was required, 
  but the agreement was silent as to whether the vendor or the purchaser would 
  obtain this approval. The Supreme Court held that the parties could hardly have 
  promised to obtain planning permission for severance as planning permission 
  is out of the control of the parties and is a condition precedent to the fulfillment 
  of the agreement: see Turney v. Zhilka, [1959] S.C.R. 578. In appropriate circumstances, 
  however, the court would imply a promise by one of the parties to bring about 
  the event constituting the condition. In a purchase and sale situation, the 
  person proposing to carry out a subdivision of land is the vendor. The Supreme 
  Court therefore implied a promise on the part of the vendor &quot;to act in 
  good faith and to take all reasonable steps to complete the sale&quot;. </p><p>
  [24] This, of course, begs the question as to what is encompassed by &quot;all 
  reasonable steps&quot;. The Court did not specifically say what was to happen 
  in the event that, as a condition of obtaining severance, conditions were imposed 
  to which the vendor took exception. In discussing the ambit of reasonableness, 
  however, the Court referred to the decision of Megarry J. in Wroth v. Tyler, 
  [1974] Ch. 30 at 50 to the effect that a vendor will usually not be required 
  to embark upon difficult or uncertain litigation in order to secure the requisite 
  consent. Relying on this, Magna says that it should not have been obliged to 
  appeal the decision of the Committee to the OMB. </p><p>
  [25] What is or is not required of a vendor will depend on the wording of the 
  agreement and the circumstances under which it was entered into. In this case 
  paragraph 14 specifically imposes an obligation on the vendor to &quot;proceed 
  diligently at his expense to obtain any necessary consent&quot; [emphasis added]. 
  The dictionary definition of diligence as contained in Webster's Encyclopedic 
  Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language is &quot;constant and earnest 
  effort to accomplish what is undertaken.&quot; One of the synonyms given for 
  diligence is perseverance. </p><p>
  [26] In Orangeville Raceway (Ontario) Ltd. V. Frieberg (1988), 34 C.P.C. (2d) 
  75 at 88 , Henry J. considered a similar clause in an agreement of purchase 
  and sale that expressly placed on the defendant the obligation to obtain a consent 
  to severance. He held that in accordance with the guidance of the Supreme Court 
  in Dynamic Transport, there was an implied agreement that the vendor would bear 
  the cost of complying with a condition imposed for severance. In this case the 
  only way for Magna to obtain &quot;any necessary consent&quot; was to undertake 
  to bear the cost of building and dedicate the extension of the road, if required, 
  or to appeal the imposition of the conditions it if it wished to have the conditions 
  removed.</p><p>
  [27] The statutory scheme provided by the Planning Act does not end with the 
  decision by the Committee. If the vendor is of the opinion that the imposition 
  of a condition by the Committee is unreasonable, or otherwise not well-founded, 
  it has the right to appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board and a further right 
  to have this decision reviewed by the Divisional Court. There is no need to 
  read a requirement into paragraph 14 that any condition imposed by the Committee 
  must be &quot;reasonable&quot; because reasonableness is provided for through 
  the existing process under the Planning Act and related legislation that functions 
  as a complete code. Hence, it is appropriate that the process under the Planning 
  Act be the arbiter of the reasonable conditions for a severance, not the vendor. 
  The vendor cannot take advantage of its failure to invoke the remedies available 
  to it to terminate the agreement.</p><p>
  [28] In deciding the extent of the vendor's obligation under paragraph 14, the 
  sole consideration cannot be the fact that the particular circumstances under 
  which the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was entered into have changed so that 
  the imposition of the conditions of severance have become more onerous. Requiring 
  compliance with the law is not unreasonable. Paragraph 14 creates a clear obligation 
  on Magna's part to comply with the conditions of severance. Magna, however, 
  submits it is still entitled to terminate the Agreement on three distinct grounds.</p>
<p> <em>Does Magna have the right to terminate the Agreement based on unreasonableness, 
  frustration or commercial absurdity?</em></p>
<p>
  [29] The Caldari Road extension was not required by Magna to access the speed 
  stamp plant nor by Dodge to access the hotel it proposed to build. Magna submits 
  that the Committee of Adjustment's requirement that Magna build an extension 
  of Caldari Road &quot;if required&quot; was therefore &quot;unreasonable&quot; 
  and entitled it to terminate the Agreement. Magna also submits that the fresh 
  evidence filed on this appeal indicating that the condition was deleted by the 
  OMB supports its contention that imposition of the condition to build the extension 
  was unreasonable. </p><p>
  [30] The effect of Magna's submission is that what is reasonable will depend 
  on the circumstances, including circumstances that arise after the Agreement 
  of Purchase and Sale has been signed. Justice Lax, on the other hand, found 
  that the condition was not unreasonable in light of the factual matrix at the 
  time the Agreement was signed. She was implicitly using the time of the signing 
  of the Agreement as the reference point. Despite this, she went on to consider 
  the reasonableness of the condition in light of the changed circumstances. </p><p>
  [31] Justice Lax further found that making Magna build the road &quot;if required&quot; 
  meant that Magna did not have to build it until the owner of the lands to the 
  north, which contained a woodlot, developed his property and requested an extension 
  of Caldari Road. She also referred to evidence indicating that when the need 
  for access arose, it was the City's expectation that the costs of the road extension 
  would be shared or borne by the benefiting landowner. In the meantime, Magna 
  would be required to service the property and to post a letter of credit for 
  future paving, curbs and lighting. The costs involved were therefore significantly 
  less than the $600,000 the vendor projected it would cost to build the extension 
  of the road. Even assuming Magna had to bear the cost of building the extension, 
  it would still make a profit on the sale. Thus, Lax J. held the imposition of 
  the condition was not unreasonable. </p><p>
  [32] Again, there is evidence to support her conclusion, which should therefore 
  be left undisturbed. If Magna had not changed the configuration of the speed 
  stamp plant, it would have needed the extension to access its plant and would 
  have built the road sooner rather than later. While Magna submits it might have 
  built a private road so that it did not have to dedicate the land covered by 
  the road to the City, this fact alone did not make the conditions unreasonable. 
  The main driver behind Magna's position that the conditions were unreasonable 
  was the simple fact that Magna changed its plans and did not want to build any 
  road at all. In the circumstances, this unilateral change in plans, which made 
  it more onerous for Magna to comply with the conditions, ought not to affect 
  Magna's obligations. The fact that the OMB allowed Magna's appeal does not necessarily 
  mean that the conditions were unreasonable. It only means that a less restrictive 
  or onerous alternative would, in the circumstances, satisfy planning principles. 
  Magna has not shown any palpable and overriding error in relation to the findings 
  of Lax J. on the question of reasonableness. </p><p>
  [33] I now turn to the question of whether the doctrine of frustration was applicable. 
  In Naylor Group Inc. v. Ellis-Don Construction Ltd., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 943, Binnie 
  J. on behalf of the Court discussed the doctrine of frustration and its application. 
  The facts of the case are as follows. In response to a call for tenders by the 
  Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital (OTMH), Ellis-Don submitted a bid to become 
  prime contractor. In doing so it incorporated the bid of Naylor Group, a sub-contractor, 
  for the electrical work. When Ellis-Don approached Naylor to bid on the project, 
  Naylor volunteered the information that its workers were not affiliated with 
  the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). Ellis-Don had been 
  in a sporadic continuing argument as to whether IBEW workers had exclusive bargaining 
  rights for electrical workers on its projects. The dispute came before the Ontario 
  Labour Relations Board (OLRB) in 1990 and the ruling was still under reserve 
  in January 1991. Ellis-Don was aware, as Naylor was not, of the details of the 
  IBEW grievance and the effect any adverse ruling would have on it. The OLRB 
  released its decision in February, 1992, stating that Ellis-Don was obliged 
  to hire only IBEW affiliated workers on its projects. On May 6, 1992 Ellis-Don, 
  which had submitted the lowest tender because it &quot;carried&quot; Naylor's 
  bid for the electrical work, was awarded the prime contract for the hospital 
  extension. The prime contract contained a clause under which Ellis-Don undertook 
  to hire Naylor. Ellis-Don offered to hire Naylor if Naylor would use IBEW workers 
  but, since Naylor already had a union, it declined. A week later Ellis-Don wrote 
  to Naylor to say that, because of the OLRB decision, it was unable to enter 
  into a subcontract agreement with it. It subsequently awarded the electrical 
  subcontract to an IBEW subcontractor. When Naylor sued Ellis-Don, one of the 
  defences advanced by Ellis-Don was that its undertaking to use Naylor for the 
  electrical work had been frustrated by the OLRB decision. Binnie J. rejected 
  this argument. He stated at paras. 53-56 of his reasons:</p>
<p class="indent"> Frustration occurs when a situation has arisen for 
  which the parties made no provision in the contract and performance of the contract 
  becomes &quot;a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by 
  the contract&quot;: Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. v. Eakins Construction Ltd., [1960] 
  S.C.R. 361, per Judson J., at p. 368, quoting Davis Contractors Ltd. v. Fareham 
  Urban District Council, [1956] A.C. 696 (H.L.), at p. 729.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier cases of &quot;frustration&quot; proceeded on 
  an &quot;implied term&quot; theory. The court was to ask itself a hypothetical 
  question: if the contracting parties, as reasonable people, had contemplated 
  the supervening event at the time of contracting, would they have agreed that 
  it would put the contract to an end? The implied term theory is now largely 
  rejected because of its reliance on fiction and imputation.</p>
<p class="indent">More recent case law, including Peter Kiewit, adopts 
  a more candid approach. The court is asked to intervene, not to enforce some 
  fictional intention imputed to the parties, but to relieve the parties of their 
  bargain because a supervening event (the OLRB decision) has occurred without 
  the fault of either party. For instance, in the present case, the supervening 
  event would have had to alter the nature of the appellant's obligation to contract 
  with the respondent to such an extent that to compel performance despite the 
  new and changed circumstances would be to order the appellant to do something 
  radically different from what the parties agreed to under the tendering contract: 
  Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec v. Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp., [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1087; 
  McDermid v. Food-Vale Stores (1972) Ltd. (1980), 14 Alta. L.R. (2d) 300 (Q.B.); 
  O'Connell v. Harkema Express Lines Ltd. (1982), 141 D.L.R. (3d) 291 (Ont. Co. 
  Ct.), at p. 304; Petrogas Processing Ltd. v. Westcoast Transmission Co. (1988), 
  59 Alta. L.R. (2d) 118 (Q.B.); Victoria Wood Development Corp. v. Ondrey (1978), 
  92 D.L.R. (3d) 229 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 242; and G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of 
  Contract in Canada (4th ed. 1999), at pp. 677-78.</p>
<p class="indent">While the second approach (&quot;a radical change in 
  the obligation&quot;) is to be preferred and is now the established test, the 
  appellant's argument would fail under either view. There has been no &quot;supervening 
  event&quot; in the sense required by either approach to the doctrine of frustration 
  and in fact the OLRB ruling against the appellant was a foreseeable outcome.</p>
<p>
  [34] Here, the parties made provision in the contract for what was to happen. 
  Magna undertook to obtain a severance at its expense. The possibility that Magna 
  might be required to build an extension of Caldari Road was a foreseeable event 
  at the time that it entered into the Agreement with Dodge. Hence, the decision 
  of the Committee did not create a radical change in Magna's obligation. There 
  was no sufficient supervening event as required for the application of the doctrine 
  of frustration. </p><p>
  [35] In response to Magna's argument that the Committee of Adjustment's requirement 
  to extend Caldari Road resulted in a commercial absurdity, Lax J. held at paragraph 
  43 of her reasons:</p>
<p class="indent"> It seems to me that the commercial absurdity here is 
  not the purchaser's interpretation of the vendor's obligation under the Planning 
  Act provision. It is one thing to imply a good faith obligation on a vendor 
  to use best efforts when the agreement is silent [as in Dynamic Transport, supra]. 
  The vendor's covenant here is express and unqualified. [Magna] assumed the risks 
  of obtaining compliance with the Planning Act. These risks included the cost 
  of dedicating and constructing the road. There is nothing commercially absurd 
  about requiring the vendor to pay for this, as this is the agreement that the 
  parties made. This is particularly so where the vendor not only contemplated 
  for some time that it will be required to do this, but was prepared to do this 
  at the time the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was signed. That the vendor later 
  changed its mind can in no way affect its covenant.</p>
<p>
  [36] For the reasons given by Lax J. in the paragraph above, I agree that paragraph 
  14 did not result in commercial absurdity. It is therefore apparent that paragraph 
  14 clearly imposes an obligation on Magna to comply with the Committee's requirements. 
  Magna has no right to terminate the Agreement based on either unreasonableness, 
  the doctrine of frustration, or commercial absurdity.</p><p>
  2. The remedy of specific Performance and the requirement that the property 
  be unique.</p><p>
  [37] Given that Magna had no right to terminate the Agreement, Dodge submits 
  that the appropriate relief is specific performance of the Agreement as awarded 
  by Lax J. Magna, however, submits that specific performance of the Agreement 
  is not an appropriate remedy in light of its claim that there were a number 
  of comparable properties available to Dodge in the vicinity. </p><p>
  [38] In Semelhago v. Paramadevan (1996), 136 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 
  22, Sopinka J. observed that specific performance will only be granted if the 
  plaintiff can demonstrate that the subject property is unique in the sense that, 
  &quot;its substitute would not be readily available&quot;. Although Sopinka 
  J. did not elaborate further on this definition, in 1252668 Ontario Inc. v. 
  Wyndham Street Investments Inc., [1999] O.J. No. 3188 at para. 23, Justice Lamek 
  stated that he:</p><p>
  [does] not consider that the plaintiff has to demonstrate that the Premises 
  are unique in a strict dictionary sense that they are entirely different from 
  any other piece of property. It is enough, in my view, for the plaintiff to 
  demonstrate that the Premises have a quality that makes them especially suitable 
  for the proposed use and that they cannot be reasonably duplicated elsewhere. 
  </p><p>
  [39] I agree that in order to establish that a property is unique the person 
  seeking the remedy of specific performance must show that the property in question 
  has a quality that cannot be readily duplicated elsewhere. This quality should 
  relate to the proposed use of the property and be a quality that makes it particularly 
  suitable for the purpose for which it was intended. See also the comments of 
  Low J. in 904060 Ontario Ltd. v. 529566 Ontario Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 355 at 
  para. 14. </p><p>
  [40] The time when a determination is to be made as to whether a property is 
  unique is the date when an actionable act takes place and the wronged party 
  must decide whether to keep the agreement alive by seeking specific performance 
  or accept the breach and sue for damages: Greenforco Holding Corp. v. Yonge-Merton 
  Developments Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 3232. at para. 76. It may also be that in 
  certain cases the date chosen for determining the issue of whether specific 
  performance is appropriate is a later date but the date will not, in any event, 
  occur before the breach has taken place.</p><p>
  [41] In oral submissions Magna submits that this date is March 6, 2000. On that 
  date, Magna sent Dodge a fax which stated in part:</p>
<p class="indent"> To date, the attempts to eliminate the construction 
  and dedication of Caldari Road have been unsuccessful. In light of the foregoing, 
  this should cause no surprise However, it may cause a concern to the Purchaser 
  because if the City continues to insist on the construction and dedication of 
  the Additional Road as a condition of severance, Magna is not prepared to accept 
  such a condition. This is why we have formally advised you of our concern that 
  the transaction may be in jeopardy, as we are not prepared to accept such a 
  condition, &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">There are many comparable sites in the immediate vicinity 
  of the subject property available for sale at this time, and we invite you to 
  explore this as a means for avoiding any losses you may incur by reason of the 
  City's delay or a failure to grant the severance required under the Planning 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  [42] Magna submits that following receipt of this letter Dodge was obliged to 
  consider alternatives as part of its duty to mitigate its losses and that Dodge 
  refused to do so. Dodge was only obliged to consider alternatives if it was 
  not entitled to specific performance: see Asamera Oil Corp. v. Sea Oil &amp; 
  General Corp., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 633 at 668. Magna also submits that the date 
  of this letter is the date of the actionable wrong. However, on April 28, 2000 
  Magna faxed a letter to Dodge indicating that it was appealing the decision 
  of the Committee of Adjustment to the OMB. In light of this, the letter of March 
  6, 2000 cannot be taken as notice by Magna that the Agreement was terminated. 
  The date of the actionable wrong was May 11, 2000, when Magna notified Dodge 
  it would not appeal the decision of the Committee of Adjustment to the OMB but 
  was terminating the Agreement instead.</p><p>
  [43] The question then becomes whether the property was unique on the date of 
  the actionable wrong. Magna contends that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  the property was unique. It submits that other comparable commercial properties 
  were available and, in particular, a property owned by a group of persons including 
  Mr. Sorbara (the Sorbara property) and another at the Vaughan Mills Mall. At 
  the date of the actionable wrong, May 11, 2000, the Sorbara property had been 
  sold. The trial judge found that although the comparables from Magna's expert 
  permitted a hotel to be built, none of them were in as close proximity to Canada's 
  Wonderland or the Vaughan Mills Centre, a planned $250 million retail mall to 
  be located directly west of the site. At para. 69 of her reasons she found:</p>
<p class="indent"> The Magna site offers superior access, visibility, 
  traffic patterns and location to each of the other sites that were under consideration. 
  It also has a C7 commercial zoning designation that is more favourable for ancillary 
  uses such as banquet halls and eating establishments. This was significant for 
  Dodge as the hotel concept it was considering at the time of the contract and 
  later pursued was for a Hilton Garden Inn. This concept does not require full 
  restaurant facilities in the hotel. The ability to have an unrestricted, independent 
  dining facility on the land to accommodate hotel guests, but also to serve patrons 
  in the area, was another distinguishing feature of this site. None of the other 
  sites offered this combination of attractive features at a comparable price.</p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant has not shown that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  or committed any overriding and palpable error in her findings. The trial judge 
  did not err in her conclusion that this particular piece of commercial real 
  estate was unique. </p><p>
  [45] Finally, Magna also submits that a court cannot simply give Dodge the remedy 
  that it seeks, namely an order for specific performance of the Agreement, because 
  the court will have to go further than ordering a transfer of the property in 
  issue from Magna to Dodge. Clause (j) of Schedule A to the Agreement contains 
  a restrictive covenant. It states:</p>
<p class="indent"> The Purchaser consents to the Vendor including a restrictive 
  covenant in the transfer deed or separate document whereby the Purchaser on 
  its own behalf and on behalf of future occupiers and owners of the Property 
  will not object to the use of the Vendor's property adjacent to the Property 
  for the purposes of an industrial paint and plastics and/or manufacturing business.</p>
<p>
  [46] Magna submits that the parties will be unable to agree on the terms of 
  the restrictive covenant and the court will undoubtedly have to intervene again. 
  Such an intervention, it submits, is more akin to contract redrafting than judicial 
  supervision. I do not agree. Clause (j) does not say that the parties will negotiate 
  a restrictive covenant, but instead contains the language of the restrictive 
  covenant within it. The existence of clause (j) does not make the remedy of 
  specific performance impractical or unfair.</p><p>
  Disposition</p><p>
  [47] For the reasons I have given I would dismiss the appeal from the order 
  of Lax J.</p><p>
  Costs</p><p>
  [48] Magna appeals the costs orders of Lax J. No appeal lies from the costs 
  order respecting the November 23rd motion to enforce the judgment. That was 
  an interlocutory order and leave was not obtained to appeal the award of costs 
  in respect of that motion. The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to grant 
  such leave: Albert v. Speigel (1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 90 (C.A.). Consequently, 
  the appeal respecting the costs of the motion cannot be heard with the appeal 
  respecting costs of the action. Section 6(2) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43, which allows the Court of Appeal to determine an appeal that 
  lies to the Divisional Court if an appeal in the same proceeding is taken to 
  the Court of Appeal, has no application unless leave has been obtained.</p><p>
  [49] In determining the costs respecting the action before her, Lax J. ordered 
  deadlines for costs submissions to be filed. Magna made detailed submissions 
  that costs were to be referred for assessment on a party and party basis. It 
  submits that the trial judge erred in holding that her judgment was more favourable 
  to Dodge than Dodge's offer to settle, which was based on specific performance 
  of the Agreement. Magna submits that Lax J. erred in awarding costs as she did 
  because, as a result of the OMB decision, its offer of $250,000 in damages is 
  closer to the result. In addition, Magna submits that Dodge's offer did not 
  specifically say anything about incorporating the restrictive covenant.</p><p>
  [50] I would not disturb the trial judge's award of costs. In my opinion it 
  was open to her to conclude that her judgment awarded Dodge a more favourable 
  result than the offer. Although the offer does not specifically say that the 
  property was to be conveyed according to the terms of the Agreement, including 
  the restrictive covenant, the trial judge said that that was not in dispute 
  and I would defer to her on this point. The decision of the OMB does not change 
  the result respecting the costs awarded at trial. It was open to the trial judge 
  to make the finding she did respecting Magna's conduct as being reprehensible 
  and that of a bully. The award of costs also represents a sanction for this 
  conduct. I would therefore dismiss the appeal from the award of costs of the 
  action.</p><p>
  [51] With respect to the costs of this appeal including those before Charron 
  J..A. reserved to this Court, I would award costs on a partial indemnity scale 
  fixed at $20,000 to the respondent.</p>
