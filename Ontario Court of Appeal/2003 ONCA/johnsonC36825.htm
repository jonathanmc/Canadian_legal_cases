<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Faye E. McWatt of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 20, 2001, reported at [2001] O.J. No. 2970.</p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] When contact lenses are purchased in Ontario, the lenses are exempt from 
  retail sales tax. When the lenses are provided free, does the sales tax exemption 
  still apply? It is that question which lies at the heart of this appeal.</p>
<p>[2] The respondent Minister of Finance, who is responsible for the administration 
  of the Retail Sales Tax Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 31, is of the view that retail 
  sales tax is payable on free contact lenses. The Minister assessed Johnson &amp; 
  Johnson Inc. retail sales tax of $85,899 on contact lenses that it had distributed 
  free of charge between September 1, 1992 and April 30, 1995 (&#147;the relevant 
  period&#148;). Johnson &amp; Johnson objected to the assessment. A review led 
  to the dismissal of the objection. Johnson &amp; Johnson appealed. The matter 
  proceeded to trial by way of an action. The trial judge agreed with the Minister 
  in a judgment released on July 20, 2001. Johnson &amp; Johnson appeals from 
  that judgment.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[3] Johnson &amp; Johnson is a corporation that develops, manufactures and 
  sells a wide variety of personal care, medical and pharmaceutical products. 
  Through its Vistakon division, it imports and distributes disposable contact 
  lenses within Canada. It is one of approximately six suppliers of contact lenses 
  in Ontario. </p>
<p>[4] The Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, S.O. 1991 c.18, ss. 27(2)9 
  makes the prescribing and dispensing of contact lenses a &#147;controlled act&#148; 
  with the result that contact lenses can only be prescribed or dispensed by an 
  optometrist, a physician or an optician on the prescription of an optometrist 
  or physician (&#147;authorized practitioners&#148;).</p>
<p>[5] As Johnson &amp; Johnson is not permitted to distribute disposable contact 
  lenses directly to consumers, it distributes the lenses to authorized practitioners 
  who, in turn, dispense them to patients.</p>
<p>[6] Subsection 2(1) of the Retail Sales Tax Act, supra, (&#147;the Act&#148;) 
  places the obligation to pay retail sales tax upon purchasers of tangible personal 
  property.</p>
<p>[7] When an authorized practitioner dispenses disposable contact lenses for 
  monetary consideration, the Minister does not collect provincial sales tax because 
  such transactions are exempt pursuant to ss. 7(1)37 of the Act. Subsection 7(1)37 
  reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">7.(1) The purchaser of the following classes of tangible 
  personal property and taxable services is exempt from the tax imposed by section 
  2: &#133;</p>
<p class="indent15">37. Optical appliances when sold on the prescription 
  of a physician or an optometrist, and repair parts for such appliances.</p>
<p>[8] It was agreed, for the purposes of this proceeding, that Vistakon disposable 
  contact lenses are &#147;optical appliances&#148; within the meaning of the 
  Act.</p>
<p>[9] Johnson &amp; Johnson promotes its brand of contact lenses to end users 
  in a variety of ways, including through its &#147;Diagnostic Lens Program&#148; 
  (&#147;the program&#148;). Under the program, Johnson &amp; Johnson supplies 
  a limited number of disposable contact lenses to authorized practitioners free 
  of charge. One free multi-pack is made available to an authorized practitioner 
  for every eight multi-packs purchased by the authorized practitioner.</p>
<p>[10] The contact lenses provided free by Johnson &amp; Johnson are identical 
  in all respects to the disposable contact lenses sold for monetary consideration, 
  except for the packaging. The words &#147;Free Sample. Not for Sale&#148; appears 
  on each no-charge lens package.</p>
<p>[11] When an authorized practitioner&#146;s patient considers using contact 
  lenses, an assessment is undertaken to ensure that the patient is an appropriate 
  candidate to wear contact lenses. The assessment involves a consideration of 
  the health of the eye, measurement of the cornea and a fitting procedure.</p>
<p>[12] Based on the assessment, the patient is fitted with lenses from the lens 
  inventory that has been provided free by Johnson &amp; Johnson. If there is 
  no initial discomfort or irritation, the patient leaves the office with the 
  lenses in his or her eyes and schedules a return appointment for reassessment. 
  The patient is not charged for the lenses.</p>
<p>[13] The program is designed to aid in the fitting of new patients with disposable 
  contact lenses and to encourage people who wear glasses to convert to using 
  Johnson &amp; Johnson contact lenses. </p>
<p>[14] The parties are agreed that contact lenses distributed through the program 
  were dispensed upon presentation of a prescription by a patient.</p>
<p>[15] From Johnson &amp; Johnson&#146;s perspective, the main objective of providing 
  the free disposable contact lenses is to facilitate growth in the number of 
  contact lens wearers and build brand loyalty. The advantage to patients lies 
  in their ability to experience the use of disposable contact lenses at no cost. 
</p>
<p>[16] During the relevant period, Johnson &amp; Johnson distributed over $1,000,000 
  worth of disposable contact lenses free to practitioners. As mentioned above, 
  the Minister assessed retail sales tax of $85,899 in respect of those contact 
  lenses. </p>
<p>[17] Johnson &amp; Johnson argues that, based on the wording of ss. 7(1)37, 
  free contact lenses are exempt from retail sales tax. In support of its position, 
  it points to ss. 7(1)31 of the Act, which has very similar wording to that in 
  ss. 7(1)37 and pursuant to which the Minister treats drugs and medicines provided 
  free by pharmaceutical companies to physicians for distribution to patients 
  as tax exempt. </p>
<p>[18] Paragraph 7(1)31 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">7.(1) The purchaser of the following classes of tangible 
  personal property and taxable services is exempt from the tax imposed by section 
  2:</p>
<p class="indent15">31. Drugs and medicines when sold on the prescription 
  of a physician, dentist or veterinarian</p>
<p>[19] &#147;Purchaser&#148; is defined in s. 1 of the Act to include a &#147;promotional 
  distributor&#148;. Johnson &amp; Johnson concedes that it is a promotional distributor 
  and therefore falls within the definition of &#147;purchaser&#148;.</p>
<p>[20] The Minister argued as follows. All purchasers are required to pay retail 
  sales tax except those that fall within the exemptions set out in s. 7(1) of 
  the Act. Johnson &amp; Johnson is a purchaser but it is not a purchaser pursuant 
  to &#147;the prescription of a physician or an optometrist&#148;. Therefore, 
  the exemption in ss. 7(1)37 does not apply to it. Absent the exemption, Johnson 
  &amp; Johnson is liable to pay retail sales tax on the lenses it provides free 
  to authorized practitioners.</p>
<p>[21] The Minister does not charge retail sales tax on drugs and medicines provided 
  free by pharmaceutical companies to physicians. He relies upon the wording of 
  ss. 7(1)31, which is identical in all material ways to ss. 7(1)37, and s. 1 
  of R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1013 (&#147;the regulations&#148;) to justify exempting 
  drugs provided free by pharmaceutical companies to doctors for provision to 
  patients while refusing to exempt lenses provided free by Johnson &amp; Johnson 
  to authorized practitioners for provision to patients. Section 1 of the regulations 
  defines &#147;drugs and medicines when sold on the prescription of a physician, 
  dentist or veterinarian&#148; to include drugs and medicines administered by 
  a physician, dentist or veterinarian. It does not differentiate between drugs 
  and medicine provided free and those provided for consideration. There is no 
  comparable definition for &#147;optical appliances when sold on the prescription 
  of a physician or an optometrist&#148; in the regulations. </p>
<p>The Decision Below</p>
<p>[22] The trial judge began her analysis of the legislation by stating that:</p>
<p class="indent">The sole issue in this case is whether J&amp;J fits 
  within the exemption from tax provision of the Act at s. 7(1)37.</p>
<p>[23] She found that the program consists of two transactions: the first transaction 
  occurs when Johnson &amp; Johnson provides free contact lenses to the authorized 
  practitioner and the second takes place when the authorized practitioner provides 
  the lenses free to the patient. She focussed on the first transaction and, relying 
  upon the &#147;time of sale&#148; as defined in s. 2(6) of the Act, held:</p>
<p class="indent">Although J&amp;J&#146;s ultimate target may be the consuming public, this transaction 
  is between J&amp;J and the practitioner. These practitioners are, in effect, 
  the customers; and there is no prescription, which is a prerequisite for the 
  exemption of tax to apply. The no-charge lenses are being used by J&amp;J for 
  promotional distribution at its own expense.</p>
<p>[24] Having concluded that the first transaction constituted a &#147;sale&#148;, 
  the trial judge held that it gave rise to an obligation to pay tax because provision 
  of the free lenses was not made pursuant to a prescription.</p>
<p>[25] Earlier in her reasons she noted,</p>
<p class="indent">The Minister has acknowledged that the legislation may create an inequity between 
  the taxation of contact lenses, on one hand, and drugs and medicines on the 
  other.</p>
<p>and stated, &#147;I agree.&#148; Nonetheless, she upheld the decision of the 
  Minister on the basis that Johnson &amp; Johnson had not brought itself within 
  paragraph 7(1)37.</p>
<p>[26] The trial judge accepted the Minister&#146;s submission that the meaning 
  of paragraph 7(1)31 had been qualified by s. 1 of the regulations.</p>
<p>ISSUE</p>
<p>[27] In order to decide this appeal, it must be determined whether the trial 
  judge erred in law in her analysis of the legislation and her determination 
  that the exemption in ss. 7(1)37 does not apply to Johnson &amp; Johnson&#146;s 
  provision of free contact lenses.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>[28] Liability for retail sales tax arises from s. 2(1) of the Act which provides 
  that:</p>
<p class="indent">2.(1) Every purchaser of tangible personal property, &#133; , shall pay to 
  her Majesty in right of Ontario a tax in respect of the consumption or use thereof, 
  computed at the rate of 8 percent of the fair value thereof.</p>
<p>[29] Pursuant to s. 2(6) of the Act, the obligation to pay tax arises at the 
  point of sale.</p>
<p class="indent">2.(6) A purchaser shall pay the tax imposed by this Act at the time of the 
  sale or the promotional distribution of an admission.</p>
<p>[30] &#147;Sale&#148; is defined in s. 1(1) of the Act to include:</p>
<p class="indent">(h) the provision by way of promotional distribution of any tangible personal 
  property or taxable service,</p>
<p>[31] As conceded by Johnson &amp; Johnson, the program is a &#147;promotional 
  distribution&#148; and it is a &#147;promotional distributor&#148; within the 
  meaning of the Act.</p>
<p class="indent">1.(1) In this Act,</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;promotional distribution&#148; means the provision 
  by any person to others of any tangible personal property, taxable service or 
  admission to a place of amusement (other than any provision thereof that is 
  prescribed by the Minister to be excluded from the application of this paragraph) 
  that is, in the opinion of the Minister, provided for any one or more of the 
  following purposes:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to describe, or to promote or encourage the purchase, 
  consumption or use of, any goods, wares, services or property of any kind,</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;promotional distributor&#148; means any person 
  who is a resident of, or carries on business in, Ontario and who, by way of 
  promotional distribution, provides or causes to be provided to any person in 
  Ontario any tangible personal property, taxable service or admission to a place 
  of amusement the full fair value or full price of admission of which is not 
  specifically charged to, and required to be paid by, the person to whom such 
  tangible personal property, taxable service or admission to a place of amusement 
  is provided;</p>
<p class="indent">[emphasis added]</p>
<p>[32] Johnson &amp; Johnson also concedes that it is a &#147;purchaser&#148; 
  within the meaning of the Act. This definition has been revised over the years 
  in ways that are not material to this action<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. I refer to 
  the definition as it read in 1994.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;purchaser&#148; means a consumer or person who 
  acquires tangible personal property anywhere, or who acquires or receives a 
  taxable service at a sale in Ontario, for his, her or its own consumption or 
  use, or for the consumption or use in Ontario of other persons at his, her or 
  its expense, or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire 
  such property or service for consumption or use in Ontario by such principal 
  or other persons at his or its expense, and includes a person who, at his, her 
  or its expense, purchases admission to a place of amusement for himself, herself 
  or itself or for another person and includes also a promotional distributor 
  to the extent that the full fair value or full price of admission of any tangible 
  personal property, taxable service or admission to a place of amusement provided 
  by way of promotional distribution exceeds any payment specifically made therefore 
  by the person to whom such property, service or distribution is so provided 
  and includes a person who, for the purpose of repairing, replacing, servicing 
  or maintaining tangible personal property pursuant to a warranty or guarantee 
  or to a contract for the service, maintenance or warranty of tangible personal 
  property, acquires tangible property anywhere or acquires or receives a taxable 
  service at a sale in Ontario;</p>
<p class="indent">[emphasis added]</p>
<p>[33] It is an error, however, to assume that because Johnson &amp; Johnson 
  is a purchaser within the meaning of the definition section, it is the purchaser 
  for the purposes of ss. 7(1)37. Who, then, is the purchaser within the meaning 
  of ss. 7(1)37? The answer to that question depends upon when the free lenses 
  were &#147;sold&#148;. Did the &#147;sale&#148; of the free contact lenses occur 
  when Johnson &amp; Johnson provided them to the authorized practitioners or 
  when the lenses were dispensed to patients? </p>
<p>[34] As can be seen from the extracted part of the definition of &#147;sale&#148;, 
  set out above, a promotional distribution is a sale even though there is no 
  consideration given for the item.</p>
<p>[35] The whole goal of the program is to provide patients with free contact 
  lenses. The authorized practitioners are only a conduit, albeit a necessary 
  one, given the provisions of the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, set 
  out above. As a result, in my view, the &#147;sale&#148; of the free lenses 
  occurs when a patient receives the free lenses that Johnson &amp; Johnson provides. 
  Thus, the purchaser for purposes of ss. 7(1)37 is the patient. As there is no 
  dispute that the free contact lenses were dispensed to patients on the prescription 
  of an authorized practitioner, the exemption in ss. 7(1)37 applies and the provision 
  of free contact lenses is tax exempt. </p>
<p>[36] This interpretation of ss. 7(1)37 is based on a plain reading of the words. 
  It is consonant with the express intent of the legislation to make contact lenses 
  tax exempt and with the substance of the program. </p>
<p>[37] The trial judge erred in her interpretation of the legislation. The error 
  arose as a result of incorrectly viewing the provision of free lenses as consisting 
  of two transactions and then looking at the first transaction in isolation. 
  Subsection 2(6) is clear in stipulating that a purchaser shall pay tax at the 
  time of sale. The promotional distribution did not occur until the merchandise 
  found its way into the hands of the intended consumer. Indeed, the Act contemplates 
  the use of an intermediary by defining a promotional distributor to include 
  situations where the supplier &#147;causes to be provided&#148; a product. Viewing 
  the provision of free lenses from Johnson &amp; Johnson to authorized practitioners 
  in isolation led the trial judge to conclude that Johnson &amp; Johnson was 
  simultaneously supplier and purchaser. Such an interpretation of the legislation 
  is both artificial and at odds with the clear legislative intent that the provision 
  of contact lenses is to be tax exempt. </p>
<p>[38] Having resolved the appeal on the basis of the plain meaning of ss. 7(1)37, 
  there is no need for recourse to the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers. 
  Had the court been compelled, however, to choose between two equally valid interpretations, 
  recourse to the presumption would have resulted in the matter being resolved 
  in favour of the taxpayer. See Quebec v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours, [1994] 
  3 S.C.R.3. </p>
<p>[39] In light of my conclusions, there is no need to consider the arguments 
  arising from the Minister&#146;s apparent inequity in treatment of ss. 7(1)31 
  and 7(1)37, except to observe that I have some difficulty in accepting the proposition 
  put forward by the Crown that because the phrase &#147;drugs and medicines when 
  sold on the prescription of a physician, dentist or veterinarian&#148; is defined 
  in s.1 of the Regulations but the phrase &#147;optical appliances when sold 
  on the prescription of a physician or an optometrist&#148; is not, that it is 
  entitled to interpret identically worded provisions in the legislation differently. 
  That appears to me to be an attempt at the impermissible, namely, using a regulation 
  to alter the terms of its governing legislation. See Belanger v. Canada (1916), 
  54 S.C.R. 265.</p>
<p>[40] I am further troubled by the Minister&#146;s reliance upon the definition 
  as justification for applying the tax exemptions in ss. 7(1)31 and 37 in an 
  inequitable and inconsistent manner as among taxpayers. In my view, it would 
  take clear and express language to alter the Minister&#146;s obligation to treat 
  taxpayers fairly, equitably and consistently. </p>
<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[41] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below 
  and order the Minister to refund to Johnson &amp; Johnson $85,899.00 plus interest.</p>
<p>[42] The appellant shall have its trial costs, as assessed, and costs of the 
  appeal fixed in the amount of $10,000.</p>
