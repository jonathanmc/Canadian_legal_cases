<p>On appeal from a conviction entered on November 29, 1999 by Justice N.M. Karam 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
<p>
  ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from his conviction for first-degree murder on November 
  29, 1999. The appellant was tried before Justice N.M. Karam of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury in North Bay.</p>
<p>
  THE BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] On November 1, 1996, the appellant travelled by train from Toronto with 
  his girlfriend, Robin Graves, to Timmins, Ontario. Graves had recently moved 
  from Timmins to Brampton. The appellant lived in Brampton with his common law 
  wife. The purpose of the trip to Timmins was to move some furniture and other 
  property of Graves from storage in Timmins to her residence in Brampton. </p>
<p>
  [3] Soon after they arrived in Timmins in the late evening, the appellant and 
  Graves went to the Windsor Tavern in downtown Timmins. The victim of the murder, 
  Raymond Collin, was sitting at a nearby table. </p>
<p>
  [4] Collin had just recently arrived at the Windsor Tavern with an acquaintance, 
  Pierre Castonguay. Earlier on November 1, 1996, Collin had cashed his pay cheque 
  for $600.00. Collin was in search of a prostitute. He had been drinking since 
  the afternoon of November 1st and was buying drinks for other people in the 
  bar and made no secret that he was carrying a large &quot;wad&quot; of cash. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] Collin and Castonguay were joined at the table by Castonguay's girlfriend 
  and Donald Lachapelle who was an acquaintance of Castonguay. Castonguay had 
  earlier told Lachapelle that Collin was looking for sex and asked for his help 
  in finding a prostitute. Both Castonguay and Lachapelle noticed Graves sitting 
  at the nearby table. </p>
<p>
  [6] As a result of eye contact between Lachapelle and Graves, Lachapelle got 
  up from the table and went to an alcove which was close by and was joined by 
  the appellant and Graves. Graves introduced the appellant as &quot;a buddy of 
  mine&quot;. It was Lachapelle's evidence that Graves asked him if Collin was 
  looking for a woman and how much money Collin had with him. Lachapelle said 
  he did not know how much money Collin had but agreed to try and find out and 
  they then returned to their respective tables.</p>
<p>
  [7] A few minutes later, Graves and Lachapelle spoke again in the alcove in 
  the presence of the appellant. Graves wanted to know if Collin was armed and 
  whether he had any money. According to Lachapelle, Graves said, &quot;well, 
  we're going to kick him out of the bar and we're going to do him.&quot; The 
  appellant then said, &quot;yes, we're gonna take him outta the bar and we're 
  gonna fucking do him.&quot; Lachapelle testified that the appellant then opened 
  his jacket and exhibited a dark coloured gun in a holster.</p>
<p>
  [8] Lachapelle testified that Graves told the appellant to leave which he did 
  and went outside. Graves then asked Lachapelle if he wanted to be involved. 
  Lachapelle declined and told Graves that she was in good hands with &quot;Buddy&quot;. 
  Apparently, Graves responded, &quot;yes, you know, you're right &#133; Buddy's 
  .22 is pretty fuckin' reliable.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [9] Lachapelle testified that Graves then became involved in a conversation 
  with Collin for 5 or 10 minutes and then they left the bar together. </p>
<p>
  [10] Three days later on November 5, 1996, Collin was found dead in his pickup 
  truck, which was parked in the lot of a laundry building in downtown Timmins 
  in close proximity to the police station. The deceased was positioned in the 
  passenger seat. There were five bullet holes in the left side of his head and 
  face. The forensic evidence established that he had been shot with a .22 calibre 
  revolver from either the driver's side open window or the driver's seat of the 
  car. </p>
<p>
  [11] On the morning following the events in the Windsor Tavern, November 2, 
  1996, the appellant and Graves rented a Ryder truck for which they paid $669.30 
  in cash in addition to a $100 deposit. On the way to pick up the truck, they 
  told a cab driver they were going to Sudbury. </p>
<p>
  [12] Lourdes de Guzman, the common law wife of the appellant, was called as 
  a Crown witness. She was declared an adverse witness and was cross-examined 
  by the Crown. She told the court that she received a telephone call from the 
  appellant on the evening of November 2, 1996. During the telephone call, she 
  asked the appellant if he was with Graves to which he responded by saying inter 
  alia that she was a fucking bitch and that she had &quot;just popped a guy&quot; 
  for $350. According to de Guzman, the appellant offered the following details: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The deceased was a bushman or mountain man who owned a 
  pickup truck;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Graves had offered the deceased sex for $100; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) The appellant was not present but Graves told him that 
  she had parked the truck at an apartment complex and shot the victim in the 
  head five times.</p>
<p>
  [13] De Guzman had testified to the same conversation with the appellant at 
  the preliminary inquiry with one important difference. At the preliminary inquiry, 
  she said that the appellant told her that he had shot the victim. The evidence 
  of de Guzman at the preliminary inquiry was admitted at the trial for the truth 
  of its contents. Her explanation for naming the appellant as the killer, in 
  her original statement to the police, was that she did it out of jealousy and 
  anger at the appellant's affair with Graves. Also when she originally told the 
  police that the appellant had informed her that he was the killer, she was in 
  police custody on criminal charges and her lawyer made a deal for her release 
  from custody in return for her statement. It was her view that, by naming the 
  appellant, she would be released. She was released on bail two days after she 
  gave her statement.</p>
<p>
  [14] About six weeks after the killing, on December 13, 1996, with the assistance 
  of a tracking and listening device installed in Graves' car, the police observed 
  the appellant and Graves disposing of a plastic bag in a corn field north of 
  Brampton. When the plastic bag was retrieved by the police, its contents included 
  a gun, a &quot;Saturday night special&quot;, which could fire five rounds in 
  quick succession. The plastic bag also contained .22 calibre Winchester bullets 
  and rubber latex gloves. The firearms expert, who testified at trial, was unable 
  to say that the gun was the gun that had killed Raymond Collin. The bullets 
  that killed Collin were manufactured by Winchester. </p>
<p>
  [15] Three days after the appellant and Graves were observed disposing of the 
  plastic bag in the cornfield, they were arrested in an apartment in Brampton. 
  When he was arrested, the appellant was wearing a pair of size 8 women's jeans. 
  The jeans contained a bloodstain which was tested for DNA. The DNA in the bloodstain 
  matched the DNA of the deceased. The jeans also fit Graves. There were other 
  women's size 8 jeans in the apartment as well as men's jeans. </p>
<p>
  [16] The Crown led evidence concerning the appellant's connection with hand 
  guns: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) In the summer of 1996, Graves told an associate at her 
  exotic dancing club that the appellant could supply Graves with a gun for the 
  purpose of becoming a professional hit woman. Both women determined that such 
  an idea was crazy;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) In August 1996, the appellant purchased a .22 calibre handgun 
  in Brampton; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) In October 1996, the appellant showed a gun to an acquaintance, 
  Cameron Booth, in a parking lot. It was nighttime and the lighting was poor. 
  However, Booth testified that the gun was black with a brown handle. The appellant 
  told Booth that the gun was for protection and that he also had two other guns 
  which were fitted with silencers.</p>
<p>
  THE THEORY OF THE CROWN </p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown alleged that the appellant, assisted by Robin Graves, robbed 
  Raymond Collin and shot and killed him. The Crown's case was based upon the 
  following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the appellant's connection with guns and in particular 
  the evidence that he had a gun which fit the forensic description of the murder 
  weapon;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the evidence of the appellant's common-law wife that he 
  told her that either he or Graves shot the deceased;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the evidence of the blood stain on the jeans that the 
  appellant was wearing at the time of his arrest which provided a DNA match for 
  the blood of the deceased; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the evidence of Lachapelle of his discussions with the 
  appellant and Graves in the Windsor Tavern before the murder.</p>
<p>THE THEORY OF THE DEFENCE</p>
<p>
  [18] The theory of the defence was that Lachapelle and Graves were responsible 
  for and participated in the robbery and killing of the deceased. </p>
<p>
  GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [19] Counsel for the appellant made the following submissions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the trial judge erred in putting the theory of the defence 
  to the jury;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the trial judge erred in admitting the &quot;Booth&quot; 
  gun evidence and in his instructions to the jury concerning the use it could 
  make of the Booth evidence and the Graves' statements relating the appellant 
  to guns;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the trial judge erred in failing to tell the jury that 
  the evidence of after the fact conduct was incapable of assisting it in distinguishing 
  the possible verdicts of manslaughter, second-degree murder and first-degree 
  murder;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the trial judge erred in failing to permit counsel for 
  the appellant to cross-examine Castonguay and Lachapelle concerning polygraph 
  testing;</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on first-degree 
  murder by failing to properly distinguish the evidence of planning and deliberation 
  to commit murder and the evidence of planning and deliberation to commit robbery; 
  and </p>
<p class="indent">(vi) the verdict of first-degree murder was unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  I will deal with each of these submissions in the order in which they were made 
  by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  (i) The trial judge erred in putting the theory of the defence to the jury</p>
<p>
  [20] Counsel for the appellant submitted that there was evidence before the 
  court upon which the jury could conclude that Lachapelle and Graves robbed and 
  killed Collin. Counsel for the appellant relied upon the following evidence 
  in support of this submission: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) Lachapelle was in the Windsor Tavern with the deceased 
  on the night of November 1, 1996 and was one of the last people to see him alive;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Lachapelle was aware that the deceased was carrying a lot 
  of money that night, and apparently discussed with Graves that the deceased 
  was looking for a prostitute;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) despite Lachapelle's denial at trial, there was evidence 
  that he and Graves knew each other from before the evening of November 1, 1996;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) despite Lachapelle's denial, there was evidence that he 
  knew that the deceased was killed by five bullets to the head very soon after 
  the killing and before this information was available to the public; </p>
<p class="indent">(v) Lachapelle at first avoided the police and then lied to 
  them, denying any involvement; and</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) Lachapelle was working at the time as a drug trafficker, 
  fencer of stolen property, and debt enforcer out of the Windsor Tavern.</p>
<p>
  [21] Central to the appellant's argument was that Lachapelle was an unsavoury 
  witness with a violent disposition and a lengthy criminal record, who had lied 
  to the police, and ought not to be believed. </p>
<p>
  [22] Counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judge's summary of the 
  defence position was not only inadequate but that it diminished a viable defence 
  that Lachapelle participated in the robbery and murder of the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [23] In particular, the appellant was critical of the following summation by 
  the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Derstine's position is that almost all of the Crown evidence is equally 
  consistent with the innocence of Wayne Jones or just as incriminating against 
  others such as Ms. Graves and Mr. Lachapelle as it is against Mr. Jones. Other 
  people in the bar, such as Donald Lachapelle and Pierre Castonguay, had the 
  same opportunity to commit the murder after Mr. Collin left the bar &#133; He 
  asks you to reject the evidence of Donald Lachapelle. His criminal past and 
  history of lying make his testimony completely unreliable &#133; He points to 
  the fact that, as a matter of law, it is unnecessary that you reject the evidence 
  of those Crown witnesses as long as you have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt 
  of the accused in which case you must find Wayne Jones not guilty.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant submitted that the above extract from the jury charge &quot;reduced 
  the defence to a negative one of asserting that Lachapelle was unreliable, and 
  the Crown had failed to meet their [sic] burden.&quot; The appellant argued 
  that the trial judge had an obligation to tell the jury that if they believed 
  that Lachapelle was responsible, or had a reasonable doubt about it, they must 
  acquit.</p>
<p>
  [25] Counsel for the appellant also asserted that the defence position was diminished 
  by a weak Vetrovec warning. See R. v. Vetrovec, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811. After telling 
  the jury to proceed with the &quot;utmost care and caution&quot; in respect 
  to Lachapelle's evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  He has an extensive criminal record which I have reviewed with you. His criminal 
  record contains crimes of dishonesty. You have heard details of dishonest conduct 
  involving his mother. He acknowledges that he has committed many other criminal 
  offences such as drug trafficking and extortion which are not reflected on his 
  record. You are entitled to take these matters into consideration when assessing 
  his truthfulness. </p>
<p>
  [26] Counsel for the appellant complained that the trial judge failed to emphasize 
  that Lachapelle had lied to the police and was an early suspect with a motive 
  to divert attention from himself in respect to the murder.</p>
<p>
  [27] In my view, the trial judge's charge adequately presented the defence theory 
  that Lachapelle participated in the robbery and killing with Graves. The following 
  extracts make the point: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Derstine's position is that the testimony of Mr. Lachapelle should not be 
  believed, that Mr. Lachapelle is a violent criminal who has, over the course 
  of this investigation, made many false statements that are admitted lies. He 
  was short of money that night and, on re-entering the bar, made no effort to 
  warn Mr. Collin because he was a participant with Ms. Graves, and that in fact 
  both Mr. Lachapelle and Ms. Graves had the motive and the opportunity to kill 
  Mr. Collin.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Derstine's position is that almost all of the Crown's evidence 
  is equally consistent with the innocence of Wayne Jones or just as incriminating 
  against others such as Ms. Graves and Mr. Lachapelle as it is against Mr. Jones. 
  Other people in the bar such as Donald Lachapelle and Pierre Castonguay had 
  the same opportunity to commit the murder after Mr. Collin left the bar.</p>
<p>
  [28] In regard to Lachapelle as a witness, the trial judge referred to a number 
  of factors which called into question his credibility, including: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) his extensive criminal record which involved crimes of 
  dishonesty;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) a description of Lachapelle as a &quot;disreputable or 
  unsavoury&quot; individual; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) his lies to the police and prior inconsistent statements. 
</p>
<p>
  [29] The trial judge clearly instructed the jury that there was &quot;good reason&quot; 
  to consider Lachapelle's testimony with &quot;the utmost care and caution&quot;. 
  In my view, the Vetrovec warning was more than sufficient in the circumstances 
  of this case. The jury was left in no doubt as to how they should proceed in 
  the assessment of Lachapelle's evidence.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The trial judge erred in admitting the &quot;Booth&quot; gun evidence and 
  in his instructions to the jury concerning the use it could make of the Booth 
  evidence and the Graves' statements relating the appellant to guns</p>
<p>
  [30] At the trial, counsel for the appellant objected to the admissibility of 
  the evidence of Cameron Booth that the appellant had showed him a handgun and 
  told him that he had two others with silencers. The appellant submitted that 
  the Booth evidence should have been edited by the trial judge by deleting the 
  reference to the two other guns with silencers. The basis of his objection was 
  that the evidence did no more than demonstrate that the appellant had a propensity 
  for the illegal use of guns. The trial judge concluded that the probative value 
  of the evidence outweighed its potential prejudice. I agree with the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [31] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Booth evidence should have 
  been subject to a limiting instruction to the jury. The appellant argued that 
  the following partial limiting instruction given by the trial judge was inadequate: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is evidence from Cameron Booth that he was shown a handgun &#133; and 
  reference was made at that time by Mr. Jones to two other hand guns with silencers 
  that he owned. Unless you are satisfied that the gun seen by Mr. Booth was the 
  gun used to kill Mr. Collin, that evidence is of no relevance to your considerations. 
  The mere possession of a hand gun, or three hand guns for that matter, does 
  not establish that the person in possession is a person who might use it as 
  a weapon. You are not to conclude, if you accept Mr. Booth's evidence of what 
  Mr. Jones is said to have said to him, that merely because Mr. Jones was in 
  possession of a hand gun that he is the type of person who might commit a crime 
  with it. </p>
<p>
  In my opinion, the above instruction was adequate.</p>
<p>
  [32] The appellant took issue to a later reference in the charge to the evidence 
  that the appellant could get Graves a gun so that she could become a hit woman. 
  The trial judge told the jury that it &quot;is some of the evidence that you 
  may wish to consider in determining whether you are satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the accused Wayne Jones was the person who shot Raymond Collin&quot;. 
  Counsel on the appeal submitted that the trial judge's instruction &quot;encouraged 
  the jury to use the evidence as propensity evidence against the appellant.&quot; 
  Counsel also submitted that the hit woman evidence was double hearsay against 
  the appellant and that the jury should have been told that it had a limited 
  use.</p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, the limiting instruction given by the trial judge (referred 
  to in paragraph 31 above) was sufficient. It clearly told the jury that they 
  were not to use the gun evidence as propensity evidence. While it may have been 
  better if the trial judge had specifically reiterated the limiting instruction, 
  given in respect of the Booth evidence, when referring to the &quot;hit woman&quot; 
  evidence, it is worth noting that there was no defence objection at trial on 
  his failure to do so. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [34] Counsel for the appellant also took issue with the trial judge's failure 
  to limit the use they could make of Graves' statement to Lachapelle that &quot;Buddy's 
  .22 is pretty fuckin' reliable.&quot; Counsel argued that this statement was 
  simply part of the narrative and Graves was doing no more than expressing her 
  own thoughts and the judge should have so instructed the jury. The jury should 
  also have been told it was ambiguous hearsay evidence in respect to the appellant. 
  The effect of a failure to provide such a limiting instruction was that the 
  jury was left with prejudicial propensity evidence. Again, given the general 
  limiting instruction regarding propensity which the trial judge gave in connection 
  with the Booth evidence concerning guns, I am not persuaded that the trial judge 
  erred in this regard.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The jury charge on after the fact conduct</p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge told the jury that the evidence of the disposal of the 
  gun, ammunition and latex gloves in the cornfield was introduced to show that 
  the appellant was disposing of the articles for the purpose of evading detection 
  and prosecution. The trial judge explained further that &quot;[t]he Crown relies 
  upon his post-offence conduct to support an inference that Wayne Jones knew 
  that he was criminally responsible for the murder of Raymond Collin.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [36] Counsel for the appellant at trial objected to the charge because the trial 
  judge failed to instruct the jury that the after the fact conduct could not 
  assist in their determination of whether the appellant was guilty of manslaughter, 
  second-degree murder or first-degree murder. The trial judge declined to re-charge 
  on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [37] A review of the trial judge's charge indicates that at no time did he suggest 
  that the after the fact conduct would assist in determining the level of criminal 
  liability of the appellant. The Crown made no such suggestion in his closing 
  address to the jury. Although the trial judge did make reference to the &quot;murder&quot; 
  of the deceased and to the &quot;murder&quot; weapon in this part of his charge, 
  I accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that the use of the word 
  &quot;murder&quot; was simply a synonym for &quot;killing&quot;. I do not believe 
  that the jury would have been misled. </p>
<p>
  (iv) The failure to permit cross-examination in respect to the polygraph</p>
<p>
  [38] Pierre Gastonguay gave two statements to the police. He initially agreed, 
  after each statement, to take a polygraph test. However, after taking advice 
  from his lawyer, he refused to do so. According to the police, he asked, &quot;why 
  he should hook himself up to a machine and incriminate himself.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [39] At trial, counsel for the appellant sought to cross-examine Castonguay 
  on his refusal to take the polygraph test in order to establish that he was 
  a suspect in the case and to ask him why he was afraid of incriminating himself. 
  The trial judge refused to permit this line of cross-examination on the basis 
  inter alia that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the cross-examination would undermine his right to refuse 
  a polygraph test and would have little probative value; and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) there was no evidentiary basis to suggest that Castonguay 
  was a suspect. </p>
<p>
  I agree with the conclusion of the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [40] Lachapelle also gave two statements. After his first statement, in which 
  he had failed to mention his conversations with Graves and the appellant at 
  the Windsor Tavern, he took a polygraph test and was advised by the police that 
  he had failed. Lachapelle protested angrily that he had told the truth. His 
  second statement, given three months later, was consistent with the evidence 
  he gave at trial. After his second statement, he took a second polygraph test 
  which he was said to have passed. </p>
<p>
  [41] The appellant's counsel at trial sought to cross-examine Lachapelle on 
  his video-taped statement in which he aggressively asserted he was telling the 
  truth in his first statement. While defence counsel did not seek to establish 
  that Lachapelle failed the first polygraph test, he submitted that the many 
  references to the polygraph test could not be edited out. He opposed any reference 
  to Lachapelle's having passed the second polygraph test. </p>
<p>
  [42] The trial judge ruled that counsel could cross-examine Lachapelle on an 
  edited version of his video-taped statement which had excised from it all references 
  to the polygraph. The trial judge based his reasoning for editing out the polygraph 
  references on the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the jury would likely attach undue weight to the failed 
  polygraph test;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the jury would probably speculate as to why there were 
  no polygraph results with respect to the second statement of Lachapelle; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the probative value of the cross-examination of Lachapelle 
  would not be seriously affected by removing the polygraph references from the 
  video statement.</p>
<p>
  [43] In my view, the trial judge took a pragmatic and reasonable approach to 
  this evidence which is reflected in his ruling.</p>
<p>
  (v) The charge on first-degree murder</p>
<p>
  [44] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in the charge 
  to the jury on first-degree murder because he failed to distinguish evidence 
  of planning and deliberation to commit murder from evidence of planning and 
  deliberation to commit robbery. Counsel argued that the following instructions 
  were deficient: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt both that the murder was planned 
  and that it was deliberate before you can return a verdict of first-degree murder. 
  Accordingly, as well as the intentional killing of the deceased, in order to 
  prove first-degree murder, the Crown must satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that the murder was planned and deliberate. </p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> You must keep in mind that what is planned must be murder. 
  The important factor, as far as time is concerned, is the time involved in developing 
  the plan, not the time between the developing of the plan and the doing of the 
  act. </p>
<p>
  [45] A review of the trial judge's charge on first-degree murder makes it clear 
  that planning and deliberation must relate to the killing of Raymond Collin. 
  I do not believe that the jury would have been confused that the elements of 
  planning and deliberation related to the robbery would suffice to establish 
  the basis for a conviction on first-degree murder. I would not give effect to 
  this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  (vi) The verdict of first-degree murder was unreasonable</p>
<p>
  [46] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the verdict of first-degree murder 
  was unreasonable in that it was based on the evidence of two unsavoury witnesses, 
  Lachapelle and de Guzman, the common-law wife of the appellant. Counsel for 
  the appellant focused his submission on the evidence relating to planning and 
  deliberation. In particular, he isolated the following evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) Lachapelle testified that the appellant reiterated the 
  comment originally made by Robin Graves that they were going to take the deceased 
  outside and &quot;do him&quot;. After saying this the appellant showed Lachapelle 
  a gun in a holster inside his jacket. </p>
<p class="indent">(ii) After Graves asked Lachapelle if he would like to be part 
  of &quot;it&quot; and Lachapelle suggested that she had adequate support from 
  the appellant, Graves said &quot;yes, you know, you're right &#133; Buddy's 
  .22 is pretty fuckin' reliable.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) De Guzman's evidence that the shooting was &quot;for a 
  lousy $350&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [47] Counsel for the appellant argued that, if the jury accepted this evidence, 
  at best it was consistent with a planned robbery which happened to end with 
  the killing of the deceased. </p>
<p>
  [48] In considering whether to set aside a jury verdict as unreasonable under 
  s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, the test that must 
  be applied is whether the verdict is one which &quot;a properly instructed jury, 
  acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.&quot; See Corbett v. The 
  Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275 at 282 and R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at paragraph 
  23. </p>
<p>
  [49] Counsel for the respondent submitted that the appellant had a motive to 
  rob the deceased. The appellant had no money or assets and was in debt. The 
  deceased, with a wad of cash of nearly $600 on his person and who was in a state 
  of intoxication, was clearly a vulnerable target. Counsel for the respondent 
  contended that it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had decided 
  to rob the deceased and kill him and thereby eliminate any witness to the robbery. 
  In my view such a conclusion was available to the jury based on the evidence 
  of the discussion that took place between the appellant, Graves and Lachapelle 
  in the alcove of the Windsor Tavern and the evidence of the telephone discussion 
  between the appellant and his common-law wife on November 2nd.</p>
<p>
  [50] I have no difficulty concluding that a properly instructed jury, acting 
  judicially, could reasonably have rendered a verdict of first-degree murder. 
  </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [51] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
