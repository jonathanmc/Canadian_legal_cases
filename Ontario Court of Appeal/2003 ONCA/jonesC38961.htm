<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Terrence A. Platana of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 5, 2002 and reported at 32 C.B.R. (4th) 51.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The question raised on this appeal is whether income tax payments made by 
  a debtor, after the date of his proposal to creditors under bankruptcy legislation, 
  can be applied to reduce his pre-proposal tax liability for that year. In my 
  view, this question turns on the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions 
  and the terms of the proposal, and the answer is no. I would therefore allow 
  Alan Jones' appeal from the dismissal of his motion for an order directing the 
  Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (&quot;CCRA&quot;) to pay him the refund he 
  claimed in respect of his post-proposal payments to his tax account for the 
  year 1999.</p>
<p>
  [2] Jones, a self-employed lawyer, became insolvent and filed a proposal to 
  creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (&quot;BIA&quot;) 
  on April 13, 1999. The proposal was subsequently accepted by the creditors and 
  approved by the court. The CCRA (then known as Revenue Canada) was one of the 
  ordinary unsecured creditors governed by the proposal. The CCRA's unsecured 
  claim against Jones for unpaid income tax was in the amount of $203,000, out 
  of the total indebtedness under the proposal of $288,376.41. </p>
<p>
  [3] Under the terms of the proposal, Jones was required to make, as full payment 
  of his unsecured creditors' accounts, an initial lump sum payment of $40,000 
  followed by 48 monthly payments of $2,854, for a total of $176,992. These payments 
  were to be made to the trustee, BDO Dunwoody Limited (&quot;BDO&quot;). Out 
  of these funds (less BDO's administration fees and expenses), dividends would 
  be paid firstly to any preferred creditors. Thereafter, the remaining funds 
  would be distributed on a pro rata basis to the ordinary creditors. Jones was 
  also obligated during the course of the proposal to adhere to a number of additional 
  provisions, including making installment payments under the Income Tax Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (&quot;ITA&quot;) and filing all tax returns on 
  time. Jones' failure to adhere to any of these provisions would be a deemed 
  default under the proposal. </p>
<p>
  [4] Prior to the date of proposal, Jones had not made any payments into his 
  tax installment account for the year 1999. Beginning in June 1999, he made a 
  series of payments of varying amounts to the CCRA, through BDO, in fulfilment 
  of his continuing obligation to make instalment payments as provided under the 
  ITA. In each case, BDO indicated that the payment was to be applied to Jones' 
  1999 post-proposal installment account. By the end of the year, a total of $79,065.96 
  had been remitted into Jones' installment account for 1999.</p>
<p>
  [5] The following April, Jones filed his income tax return for 1999, claiming 
  a refund of $15,674.85. Accompanying the return was a letter to the CCRA from 
  BDO explaining that this claim for a refund had been calculated in accordance 
  with the CCRA's policy in respect of proposals. The policy in question is set 
  out in a letter dated March 2, 1999 sent by Revenue Canada to the Canadian Insolvency 
  Practitioners Association. In that letter, the CCRA recognized that with the 
  advent of bankruptcy reform in 1992, a proposal providing for a payment of less 
  than 100 cents on the dollar, once approved by the court, is binding on the 
  Crown. The letter described the CCRA's approach to handling proposals by installment 
  payers under this regime as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he Department relies on the instalment requirements of the 
  Act to approximate the current-year debt... If, then, a taxpayer has not remitted 
  any current-year payments, and has filed a proposal, those unremitted payments 
  would comprise the current-year debt which will be added to that person's assessed 
  arrears. Assuming that the taxpayer has filed all required returns, the current-year 
  debt and the assessed arrears would be the taxpayer's debt at the date of the 
  proposal.</p>
<p class="indent">The Department computes the actual debt for the proposal, after 
  the assessment of the current-year return in the following year. We prorate 
  the assessed amount between the pre-proposal period and the post?proposal period. 
  The amount for the former is payable in accordance with the terms set out in 
  the proposal, while the amount in respect of the latter is payable at 100 cents 
  on the dollar. </p>
<p>
  [6] In accordance with that policy, BDO first calculated the amount of Jones' 
  1999 income that fell in each of the pre- and post-proposal periods on a pro 
  rata basis, according to the number of days in each period, regardless of when 
  the income was actually earned. No issue is raised in this case with respect 
  to this pro rata allocation of Jones' 1999 income as between the pre- and post-proposal 
  parts of the taxation year. </p>
<p>
  [7] On the basis of this allocation, BDO determined that Jones' 1999 tax liability 
  was $24,920.93 in respect of the pre-proposal period (payable at a rate less 
  than 100 cents on the dollar as per the terms of the proposal), and $63,391.12 
  for the post-proposal period (payable at 100 cents on the dollar). BDO then 
  applied the $79,065.96 credit in the installment account, all of which was accumulated 
  during the post-proposal period, to the post-proposal tax liability only, resulting 
  in a surplus, or refund, of $15,674.85. It is this allocation of the credit 
  in the installment account, to the post-proposal tax liability only, that is 
  in issue in this case. </p>
<p>
  [8] The CCRA took a different approach in assessing Jones for the 1999 taxation 
  year. In the CCRA's view, it was appropriate in the circumstances not only to 
  pro-rate Jones' 1999 tax liability as BDO had done, but also to pro-rate the 
  1999 installment payments over the whole year notwithstanding the fact that 
  the payments had all been made in the post-proposal period. By this method, 
  of the $79,065.96 in the installment account, $23,432.07 was applied to the 
  pre-proposal tax liability, leaving a shortfall of only $1,488.86 for the pre-proposal 
  period to be paid in accordance with the terms of the proposal. The remaining 
  $59,603.89 was applied towards the post-proposal tax liability of $63,391.12, 
  resulting in a shortfall of $3,787.23 for the post-proposal period rather than 
  a refund. </p>
<p>
  [9] Jones moved before the motions judge in Bankruptcy Court for an order directing 
  the CCRA to pay him the refund he claimed. The CCRA responded that Jones was 
  not entitled to any refund. It submitted that its approach was an appropriate 
  way to deal with a proposal by an installment payer. The CCRA illustrated the 
  logic behind its approach by comparing the situation of an installment payer 
  to that of a person whose tax is paid by way of deductions from his or her income 
  at the source. In the latter case, any tax liability arising in a proposal year 
  before the date of the proposal would be satisfied in whole or in part through 
  those payments, which would be made at the same time that the tax liability 
  arises. The CCRA's argument was effectively that, in the case of an installment 
  payer, the installments take the place of source deductions. Therefore, just 
  as the tax liability is pro-rated over the course of year, regardless of when 
  the income is earned, so should the installment payments, regardless of when 
  they are made. By this logic, it argued that the pro-rated portion of the installment 
  funds corresponding to the pre-proposal period should be applied towards the 
  satisfaction of the pre-proposal debt. </p>
<p>
  [10] The motions judge agreed with the approach taken by the CCRA. He concluded 
  that if the liability for taxes is determined on a pro rata basis as between 
  the pre- and post-proposal periods, there is no reason why the requirement to 
  pay should not be determined in the same way. He held that otherwise, there 
  would be an unfair difference between the effect on taxpayers who remit payments 
  by installment and the effect on those whose taxes are deducted at the source.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [11] It is common ground between the parties that the liability for income tax 
  comes into existence at the moment income is earned, and not at the time the 
  assessment is made: see Simard-Beaudry Inc. v. M.N.R. (1971), 71 D.T.C. 5511 
  (F.C.(T.D.)), approved in M.N.R. v. Wesbrook Management (1996), 96 D.T.C. 6590 
  (F.C.A.). The parties agree, however, that it is reasonable and convenient to 
  pro-rate the taxpayer's income, and consequent tax liability, for the proposal 
  year throughout the year, regardless of when the income is actually earned. 
  Indeed, when a person has been working throughout the year, this approach is 
  administratively efficient and makes eminent good sense. As indicated earlier, 
  the dispute between the parties in this case centres rather on whether it is 
  also appropriate to pro-rate installment payments made during that year, regardless 
  of whether such payments are made before or after the date of proposal.</p>
<p>
  [12] I would pause to note parenthetically that in the case of a bankruptcy, 
  a new taxation year is deemed to begin on the day the taxpayer becomes a bankrupt 
  (see ss. 128(1)(d) and (2)(d) of the ITA). That option is not available, however, 
  where the taxpayer is not a bankrupt: Agard v. M.N.R. (1994), 94 D.T.C. 1232 
  (T.C.C.). As there is no specific legislative provision deeming that a new taxation 
  year begins at the date of the proposal by an insolvent person, the question 
  raised on this appeal falls to be determined on the basis of the general provisions 
  of the BIA relating to proposals and the terms of the proposal. </p>
<p>
  [13] Section 62(1.1) of the BIA provides that where a proposal is made in respect 
  of an insolvent person, the time with respect to which the claims of creditors 
  shall be determined is the time of the filing of the notice of intention, or, 
  if no notice of intention was filed, the proposal. In this case, a notice of 
  intention was filed on March 19, 1999 and the proposal was filed on April 13, 
  1999. The proposal itself defines the date of proposal as being April 12, 1999. 
  The parties appear to be using April 13, 1999 as the relevant date in their 
  respective facta and no issue was raised on this point. Regardless of the correct 
  date, the parties do not dispute that the creditors' claims, for the purposes 
  of the proposal, must be determined as of the time of the relevant filing, not 
  after. </p>
<p>
  [14] Sections 69 and 69.1 provide for a stay of proceedings by any creditor 
  against the insolvent person on the filing of either a notice of intention or 
  a proposal, respectively. In Vachon v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 
  [1985] 2 S.C.R. 417, the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted the equivalent 
  provision found in a predecessor statute very broadly and held that its effect 
  was to prevent a creditor's right of set off for debts owing by an insolvent 
  person in the pre-bankruptcy or pre-proposal period against an amount owing 
  the debtor by the creditor in the post-bankruptcy or post-proposal period. Conversely, 
  the right to set-off may be exercised in respect of mutual debts existing at 
  the date of bankruptcy: see Re 728835 Ontario Ltd. (1988), 3 C.B.R. (4th) 214 
  (Ont. C.A.). The facts in Vachon are apposite to the situation in this case. 
  A bankrupt owed the Employment and Immigration Commission the sum of $922 at 
  the time of his assignment in bankruptcy. The claim was provable in bankruptcy 
  and the Commission filed its proof of claim. After the day of bankruptcy and 
  before his discharge, unemployment insurance benefits became payable to the 
  bankrupt. The Commission withheld the sum of $922 from those benefits. The Supreme 
  Court of Canada examined s. 49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-3 
  [predecessor to s. 69(1)(a) of the BIA] of the legislation and held that the 
  stay provision applied to this recovery by retention from subsequent benefits. 
  The Court therefore held that the Commission was not entitled to withhold the 
  payment of $922. </p>
<p>
  [15] Section 62(2) provides that a proposal accepted by the creditors and approved 
  by the court is binding on, among others, all unsecured creditors. Section 4.1 
  provides that the BIA is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada. There is 
  no dispute in this case about the binding effect of the proposal. The proposal 
  is, in effect, a contract between the debtor and his creditors. When it is made 
  in accordance with the provisions of the BIA, it binds all the creditors, even 
  any dissenting minority: Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Ideal Petroleum 
  (1959) Ltd. (1976), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 230 at 239. </p>
<p>
  [16] It is clear under the terms of the proposal that the ordinary creditors' 
  claims are to be satisfied by the pro rata distribution of the proposal amount 
  of $176,992 payable by Jones during the 48-month term of the proposal (less 
  administrative expenses and preferred claims). It is also clear that the CCRA's 
  claim for income tax owing as of the date of the proposal falls in the category 
  of claims covered by those terms. Jones' additional duty to meet his current 
  tax obligations during the term of the proposal by making installment payments 
  and filing returns does not add to or detract from this distribution scheme. 
  The approach taken by the CCRA in assessing Jones is, in my view, contrary to 
  this scheme of distribution because it would permit the CCRA to satisfy part 
  of his pre-proposal debt at the post-proposal rate of 100 cents on the dollar. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] It would have been possible to include a term in the proposal expressly 
  allowing the CCRA to satisfy its claim for unpaid taxes as of the date of the 
  proposal out of the funds paid into the installment account after the date of 
  the proposal. If accepted by the creditors and approved by the court under the 
  BIA, such a term would be binding on all parties. Because there is no such provision 
  in this proposal, however, the CCRA has no basis for having its claim for pre-proposal 
  debt satisfied in a different manner than the debt of any other ordinary unsecured 
  creditor. It is noteworthy that the CCRA does not contend that it could apply 
  the payments made by Jones after the date of the proposal to the pre-proposal 
  debt arising prior to the year of the proposal. In my view, there is no principled 
  basis to treat the pre-proposal debt arising in the year of the proposal differently. 
  To do otherwise, as noted above, would permit the CCRA to receive more than 
  anticipated by the terms of the proposal. This result could undermine Jones' 
  ability to meet his obligations under the proposal and result in prejudice to 
  the other creditors.</p>
<p>
  [18] The British Columbia Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in Sabey 
  (Re), [1996] B.C.J. No. 2820 (S.C.). In that case, the debtor filed a notice 
  of intention to file a proposal on March 20, 1995. His proposal was later accepted 
  by the creditors, including Revenue Canada, and approved by the court. In March 
  1995, Sabey commenced employment and his employer deducted and remitted from 
  his wages amounts for income tax. The reported decision does not specify on 
  what precise date the employment commenced, but it would appear that the source 
  deductions were made in respect to the period of time after the notice of intention 
  was filed. The deductions exceeded Sabey's tax liability for 1995 and, consequently, 
  he was entitled to a refund. Revenue Canada withheld the refund and applied 
  it to the pre-proposal debt. The motion judge held that there was no legislative 
  or other legal basis for Revenue Canada to do so. </p>
<p>
  [19] The motions judge in this case distinguished the decision in Sabey on the 
  basis that Jones, unlike Sabey, still owed taxes and was not entitled to a refund 
  at the end of the year in question. With respect, it is my view that this distinction 
  begs the question and, further, is irrelevant. The pertinent similarity between 
  Sabey and this case lies in the fact that, in both cases, Revenue Canada purported 
  to apply a surplus resulting from post-proposal payments to the pre-proposal 
  debt. The Court in Sabey held that it had no legal basis do to do so. As noted 
  earlier, I agree with that conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [20] I also disagree with the motions judge's conclusion that the CCRA was justified 
  in adopting its position because otherwise there would be &quot;a significant 
  element of unfairness between tax payers who remit quarterly, and those whose 
  taxes are deducted at source.&quot; Whatever the logical force of the CCRA's 
  analogy of the situation of an instalment payer to the situation of the taxpayer 
  whose tax is paid by way of deductions at source, it does not have a statutory 
  foundation. Section 60(1.1) of the BIA expressly provides that, unless the Crown 
  consents, no proposal shall be approved by the court if it does not provide 
  for the payment in full of amounts that could be subject to a demand for garnishment, 
  for example by way of payroll deductions, under s. 224(1.2) of the ITA or similar 
  provisions. In my view, absent any similar express provision regarding payment 
  in full of the pre-proposal tax debt of an installment payer, the CCRA is not 
  automatically entitled to such payment in full, and cannot justify the approach 
  used in this case on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [21] For these reasons, I conclude that there is no legal basis for the CCRA's 
  refusal to pay Jones the refund he claimed. I would allow the appeal, set aside 
  the order of the motions judge and order the CCRA to pay Jones the amount of 
  $15,674.85, together with costs on the motion and on the appeal fixed at $10,000 
  all inclusive. </p>
