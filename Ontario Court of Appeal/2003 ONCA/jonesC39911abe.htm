<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the Board&#146;s disposition was reasonable and ought not 
  to be interfered with. The Board made a finding in April of 2002 that Ms. Jones 
  posed a significant threat to public safety. The evidence is clear that thereafter 
  her conduct, both while in hospital and in the community, deteriorated such 
  that the threat to public safety was, if anything, greater.</p>
<p>[2] There is nothing in the evidence on the record to support the contention 
  that the proceedings that led to the hearing in January 2003 were undertaken 
  for purposes of administrative convenience. </p>
<p>[3] As a consequence, we are satisfied that there is ample evidence to support 
  the Board&#146;s conclusion in January 2003 that the appellant posed a significant 
  threat to the public safety and that a detention order pursuant to s. 672.54.(c) 
  is the least onerous and least restrictive disposition.</p>
<p>[4] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>&#147;E.E. Gillese J.A.&#148;</p>
