<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Steven Rogin of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, dated May 16, 2003, reported at (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 566, dismissing 
  an appeal by the Crown from the order of Justice Douglas W. Phillips of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice, dated January 2, 2003, reported at (2003), 8 C.R. 
  (6th) 170, dismissing certain charges against the respondent.</p>
<p><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong> </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent was charged with possession of marihuana on April 12, 2002, 
  breach of probation arising out of that possession, and a third charge which 
  is irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal. He brought a motion before the 
  trial judge seeking a dismissal of the charges, claiming that as of April 12, 
  2002, there was no offence of possession of marihuana in force. The trial judge 
  accepted that submission and dismissed the two marihuana-related charges. The 
  Crown appealed unsuccessfully to the Superior Court. The Crown now seeks leave 
  to appeal and if leave is granted appeals from the order of the Superior Court 
  judge on a question of law alone. </p>
<p>
  [2] We would grant leave to appeal and would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> [3] Section 4 of the <em>Controlled Drug and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, 
  c. 19 (<em>&quot;<em>CDSA</em>&quot;</em>) states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Except as authorized under the regulations, no person shall possess a substance 
  included in Schedule I, II or III.</p>
<p>
  [4] Marihuana is a Schedule II drug. </p>
<p> [5] On July 31, 2000, in <em>R. v. Parker</em> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 
  this court held that the prohibition against possession of marihuana in s. 4 
  of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em> was unconstitutional, absent a constitutionally acceptable 
  medical exemption to that prohibition. The court's order read in part: </p>
<p class="indent"> This court orders that the remedy granted by the trial judge 
  is varied by declaring the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>Controlled 
  Drug and Substances Act</em> to be invalid. The declaration of invalidity is 
  suspended for a period of twelve months.</p>
<p> [6] By virtue of the order in <em>Parker</em>, the criminal prohibition against 
  the possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> remained in effect until July 
  31, 2001. </p>
<p> [7] On July 30, 2001, the government brought into force the <em>Marihuana 
  Medical Access Regulations </em>S.O.R./2001-227 (&quot;<em><em>MMAR</em></em>&quot;). 
  These regulations purported to alter the criminal prohibition against the possession 
  of marihuana set out in s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em> </em>by adding provisions that 
  permitted possession and cultivation of marihuana for medical purposes by those 
  who had received the requisite authorizations under the <em>MMAR</em>. </p>
<p> [8] In <em>Hitzig v. Her Majesty the Queen</em> (C39532; C39738; C39740), 
  released concurrently with these reasons, the court determined that the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> 
  as enacted did not provide a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption to 
  the criminal prohibition against possession of marihuana. The court deleted 
  the constitutionally offensive provisions of the <em><em>MMAR</em></em>, leaving a constitutionally 
  valid medical exemption and a constitutional prohibition against possession 
  of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em>. </p>
<p> [9] The respondent's alleged possession of marihuana has nothing to do with 
  medical need. He did not argue that the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> did not provide 
  a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption to the criminal prohibition 
  against possession. He submitted that even if the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> provided 
  a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption, they did not have any effect 
  on the declaration of the invalidity of s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em> made 
  in <em>Parker, supra</em>. He submitted that by its terms, the <em>Parker</em> 
  order took effect on July 31, 2001, rendering s. 4 of no force and effect as 
  it applied to marihuana, and absent a re-enactment of that section, there was 
  no crime of possession of marihuana in Ontario from July 31, 2001 forward.</p>
<p> [10] For different reasons, the trial court and the Superior Court held that 
  regardless of the constitutional validity of the medical exemption created by 
  the<em> <em>MMAR</em></em>, those regulations could not have any effect on the declaration 
  of invalidity made with respect to s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em> in <em>Parker, 
  supra</em>. Both courts held that consequent upon that declaration, there was 
  no crime of possession of marihuana in existence on the day the respondent was 
  charged.</p>
<p> [11] This court enjoys an advantage over the trial court and the Superior 
  Court. Having held in <em>Hitzig, supra</em>, that the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> 
  did not create a constitutionally valid medical exemption, we can determine 
  the merits of the respondent's claim that there was no charge of possession 
  of marihuana in existence on April 12, 2002 on that basis. Viewed in light of 
  our holding in <em>Hitzig</em>, the analysis of the respondent's claim becomes 
  straightforward. As of April 12, 2002 when the respondent was charged, the prohibition 
  against possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em> was subject 
  to the exemption created by the <em><em>MMAR</em></em>. As we have held, the 
  <em><em>MMAR</em></em> did not create a constitutionally acceptable medical 
  exemption. In <em>Parker</em>, this court made it clear that the criminal prohibition 
  against possession of marihuana, absent a constitutionally acceptable medical 
  exemption, was of no force and effect. As of April 12, 2002, there was no constitutionally 
  acceptable medical exemption. It follows that as of that date the offence of 
  possession of marihuana in s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em> </em>was of no force 
  and effect. The respondent could not be prosecuted.</p>
<p> [12] The Crown attempts to counter this straightforward analysis with a novel 
  argument. It submits that as long as the Government moved to cure the constitutional 
  defect identified by the court in the criminal prohibition against possession 
  of marihuana, during the time when the court's order in <em>Parker, supra</em>, 
  was suspended, the possession offence in s. 4 of the <em><em>CDSA</em></em> remained 
  in full force and effect, even if it was eventually determined that the Government's 
  attempts to create a valid medical exemption were inadequate. As we understand 
  this argument, the offence of possession of marihuana would only become of no 
  force and effect if the court so declared it and either did not suspend its 
  declaration or the Government did not alter the prohibition during the suspension 
  period to bring it into compliance with the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
<p> [13] Applying this argument to the facts of the case, the Government submits 
  that as the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> came into force before the one-year suspension had 
  expired, the possession offence remained in effect unless and until the <em><em>MMAR</em></em> 
  was found to be constitutionally inadequate. Lederman J. made that finding in 
  <em>Hitzig v. Canada</em> (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (S.C.J.) in January 2003, 
  but suspended his declaration that the <em>MMAR</em> was unconstitutional for six months. 
  The Government argues that this means that the possession prohibition continued 
  during the suspension period. The Government completes the argument by pointing 
  to the interim policy brought into effect during the six-month suspension provided 
  for by Lederman J. According to the Government, that policy, which further alters 
  the nature of the possession prohibition, keeps the possession offence in place 
  unless and until the courts declare that the interim policy does not provide 
  an adequate medical exemption. Furthermore, according to the Crown's argument, 
  if the court were to suspend that declaration, the possession prohibition would 
  remain in effect during that suspension. </p>
<p> [14] The Crown's contention that the suspension of court declarations somehow 
  cascade one through the other to preserve the validity of these charges is based 
  on a misunderstanding of the nature of the order in <em>Parker, supra</em>, 
  and the order made by Lederman J. in <em>Hitzig</em>. The <em>Parker</em> order 
  by its terms took effect one year after its pronouncement. That order was never 
  varied. After the <em>MMAR</em> came into effect, the question was not whether 
  the enactment of the <em>MMAR</em> had any effect on the <em>Parker</em> order, 
  but rather whether the prohibition against possession of marihuana in s. 4 of 
  the <em>CDSA</em>, as modified by the <em>MMAR</em>, was constitutional. If 
  it was, the offence of possession was in force. Paired with the suspension of 
  the declaration in <em>Parker</em>, this would have the effect of keeping the 
  possession prohibition in force continually. If the <em>MMAR</em> did not create 
  a constitutionally valid exception, as we have held, then according to the ratio 
  in <em>Parker</em>, the possession prohibition in s. 4 was unconstitutional 
  and of no force and effect. The determination of whether there was an offence 
  of possession of marihuana in force as of April 2002 depended not on the terms 
  of the <em>Parker</em> order but on whether the Government had cured the constitutional 
  defect identified in <em>Parker</em>. It had not. </p>
<p> [15] The order made by Lederman J. in <em>Hitzig</em> in January 2003 did 
  not address the prohibition against possession in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. 
  While, according to the ratio in <em>Parker, supra</em>, Lederman J.'s determination 
  that the <em>MMAR</em> did not provide an adequate medical exemption meant that 
  there was no constitutional prohibition against possession of marihuana in s. 
  4 of the <em>CDSA</em>, Lederman J. did not make that declaration. Nothing in 
  his order was relevant to whether the offence of possession of marihuana existed 
  in April 2002, when the respondent was charged. The suspension of that order 
  could have no effect on the status of the offence of possession of marihuana. 
</p>
<p>
  [16] The policy put in place in July 2003, fourteen months after these charges 
  were laid, was irrelevant to whether the offence of possession of marihuana 
  existed in April 2002. An accused must be able to know on the day that he is 
  charged whether the offence with which he is charged exists. The accused cannot 
  be told that the validity of the charge will depend on what the Government may 
  choose to do at some future date. The determination of whether there was a crime 
  of possession of marihuana in force on the day the respondent was charged turned 
  on whether s. 4 combined with the <em>MMAR</em> created a constitutional prohibition 
  against the possession of marihuana.</p>
<p>
  [17] Although we agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge and the 
  Superior Court judge, we do not agree with their analyses. As the analyses may 
  have application in future cases, we will set out our reasons for disagreeing 
  with their approaches.</p>
<p>
  [18] The essence of the trial judge's reasoning is found in para. 46 of his 
  reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> While regulations were enacted, but the legislation was not 
  amended, the &quot;gap in the regulatory scheme&quot; (to use the language of 
  Rosenberg J.A. in<em> Parker</em>) was not addressed. In my view, the establishment 
  by Parliament of suitable guidelines in <em>legislation</em> fettering administrative 
  discretion was requisite but lacking. This is simply not the sort of matter 
  that Parliament can legitimately delegate to the federal cabinet, a Crown minister 
  or administrative agency. Regulations, crafted to provide the solution (even 
  were these fashioned to create sufficient standards governing exemptions) cannot 
  be found to remedy the defects determined by the <em>Parker </em>dicta. Therefore, 
  since a statutory framework with guiding principles was not enacted within the 
  period of the suspension of the declaration of invalidity, it follows in my 
  view that the declaration is now effectively in place. [Emphasis in original].</p>
<p> [19] Our holding in <em>Hitzig</em> makes it clear that we do not agree with 
  the trial judge's conclusion that the defect identified in <em>Parker</em> could 
  not be remedied by regulation. Section 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> prohibits possession 
  of marihuana &quot;except as authorized under the regulations &#133;&quot;. 
  These words clearly indicate Parliament's intention that the scope of the possession 
  prohibition should be subject to change by regulation. By s. 55 of the <em>CDSA</em>, 
  Parliament delegated broad legislative powers to the Governor-in-Council. Section 
  55(1)(a) specifically addresses regulations relating to possession: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Governor in Council may make regulations for carrying out 
  the purposes and provisions of this Act including &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(a) governing, controlling, limiting, authorizing the importation 
  into Canada exportation from Canada, production, packaging, sending, transportation, 
  delivery, sale, provision, administration, possession or obtaining of or other 
  dealing in any controlled substances &#133; .</p>
<p> [20] Parliament's power to delegate its lawmaking authority to a subordinate 
  entity such as the Governor-in-Council, while not absolute, is very broad: P.W. 
  Hogg, <em>Constitutional Law of Canada</em>, loose-leaf edition (Toronto: Carswell) 
  at pp. 14-1-14-4. The breadth of the power to delegate the law of Parliament's 
  lawmaking function is demonstrated in <em>Re Gray</em> (1918), 57 S.C.R. 150, 
  a case involving a provision of the <em>War Measures Act</em>, 1914, S.C. 1914 
  (2d Sess.), c. 2, which delegated very broad lawmaking powers to the Governor-in-Council. 
  The majority of the Supreme Court upheld the delegation of those sweeping powers 
  to the Governor-in-Council. Chief Justice Fitzpatrick said, at 157: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Parliament cannot, indeed, abdicate its functions, but within reasonable limits 
  at any rate it can delegate its powers to the executive government. Such powers 
  must necessarily be subject to determination at any time by Parliament, and 
  needless to say the acts of the executive, under its delegated authority, must 
  fall within the ambit of the legislative pronouncement by which its authority 
  is measured.</p>
<p>
  [21] Anglin J. described the scope of Parliament's power to delegate in these 
  terms, at 176: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A complete abdication by Parliament of its legislative functions is something 
  so inconceivable that the constitutionality of an attempt to do anything of 
  the kind need not be considered. Short of such an abdication, any limited delegation 
  would seem to be within the ambit of a legislative jurisdiction &#133; .</p>
<p>
  [22] Anglin J. went on to observe that any attempt by the court to limit Parliament's 
  power to delegate its lawmaking function was in fact a court imposed restriction 
  on the legislative powers of Parliament.</p>
<p>
  [23] Duff J. provided an excellent explanation of subordinate legislation, at 
  170: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no attempt to substitute the executive for Parliament in the sense 
  of disturbing the existing balance of constitutional authority by aggrandizing 
  the prerogative at the expense of the legislature. The powers granted could 
  at any time be revoked and anything done under them nullified by parliament, 
  which parliament did not, and for that matter could not, abandon any of its 
  own legislative jurisdiction. The true view of the effect of this type of legislation 
  is that the subordinate body in which the law-making authority is vested by 
  it is intended to act as the agent or organ of the legislature and that the 
  acts of the agent take effect by virtue of the antecedent legislative declaration 
  (express or implied) that they shall have the force of law. &#133;</p>
<p> [24] Stripped to their essentials, the <em>MMAR</em> are regulations governing 
  &quot;the possession or obtaining of or other dealing in&quot; marihuana. As 
  such, they are clearly within the regulation making power entrusted to the Governor-in-Council 
  by s. 55(1)(a) of the <em>CDSA</em>. Like any other Government action, those 
  regulations were subject to <em>Charter</em> challenge. The outcome of that 
  challenge, however, depended on whether the substance of the regulations were 
  consistent with <em>Charter</em> demands and not on the fact that the substance 
  appears in regulations rather than in the statute. </p>
<p> [25] In his reasons, at para. 41, the trial judge equated Parliament's delegation 
  of the regulation making power to the Governor-in-Council with s. 56 of the 
  <em>CDSA</em>, which gave the Minister absolute discretion to decide who should 
  receive a medical exemption. The two are fundamentally different. Using the 
  regulation-making power, the Governor-in-Council set out a legislative scheme 
  for determining entitlement to the medical exemption. That scheme is subject 
  to <em>Charter</em> challenge. Under s. 56 of the <em>CDSA</em>, there was no 
  scheme. Instead, the Minister was given a total discretion. That law, like the 
  regulations, was subject to <em>Charter</em> challenge. Both withstood or failed 
  that challenge based on their content. Section 56 failed the test because it 
  gave the Minister untrammelled discretion. The <em>MMAR</em> do not suffer from 
  that defect. If the Governor-in-Council had purported to regulate by way of 
  a provision that gave the Minister absolute discretion to decide who should 
  receive a medical exemption, then the regulation, like the discretion granted 
  by s. 56, would be constitutionally invalid. </p>
<p> [26] The trial judge read the references by Rosenberg J.A. in <em>Parker, 
  supra</em>, to Parliament's responsibility to legislate as indicating that any 
  constitutionally acceptable medical exemption had to be in the statute itself. 
  We do not read his reasons that way. As explained by Duff J., in <em>Re Gray, 
  supra</em>, subordinate legislation in the form of regulations is as much an 
  expression of Parliament's will as is a provision in a statute. When Rosenberg 
  J.A. in <em>Parker</em>, at para. 204, referred to issues being &quot;addressed 
  by Parliament&quot;, he in no way excluded the exercise of lawmaking authority 
  properly delegated to the Governor-in-Council by Parliament. Regulations are 
  also legislation, albeit subordinate legislation. When Rosenberg J.A. referred 
  to a &quot;legislative scheme&quot; at para. 205, he did not exclude the possibility 
  of a scheme brought forward by way of regulation.</p>
<p> [27] Nothing in the order of this court in <em>Parker, supra</em>, or in the 
  provisions of the <em>CDSA</em> precluded resort to the regulation making power 
  to remedy the constitutional defect identified in <em>Parker</em>.</p>
<p> [28] The Superior Court judge did not adopt the reasoning of the trial judge. 
  He held that since Parliament had not re-enacted s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> after 
  it was declared to be of no force and effect in <em>Parker</em>, there was no 
  prohibition against the possession of marihuana in existence as of July 31, 
  2001, when the suspension of the order made in <em>Parker</em> expired. As we 
  understand his reasons, the Superior Court judge held that had Parliament simply 
  re-enacted s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> unaltered when it brought in the <em>MMAR</em>, 
  then there would have been an offence of possession of marihuana in existence 
  after the one-year suspension granted in <em>Parker</em> expired.</p>
<p> [29] The Superior Court judge treated this court's order in <em>Parker</em> 
  as the equivalent of a Parliamentary repeal of s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> as 
  it applied to marihuana. We do not share that interpretation. For convenience, 
  we repeat the salient words of the order: </p>
<p class="indent"> The remedy granted by the trial judge is varied by declaring 
  the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>Control Drug and Substances Act</em> 
  to be invalid.</p>
<p> [30] The order was directed at the marihuana prohibition in s. 4 as it existed 
  when <em>Parker</em> was decided. The authority to make the declaration emanates 
  from s. 52 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, which provides that: </p>
<p class="indent"> [A]ny law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the <em>Constitution</em> 
  is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.</p>
<p> [31] The court in <em>Parker, supra</em>, declared that the marihuana prohibition 
  in s. 4 was inconsistent with the <em>Charter </em>and consequently of no force 
  or effect absent an adequate medical exemption. In making the declaration, the 
  court did not and could not repeal or otherwise alter the terms of the statute. 
  The court could only declare the constitutionally offensive part of the legislation 
  to be of no force or effect.</p>
<p>
  [32] By bringing forward the <em>MMAR</em>, the Government altered the scope of the possession 
  prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. After the <em>MMAR</em> came into force, the question 
  therefore became whether the prohibition against possession of marihuana as 
  modified by the <em>MMAR</em> was constitutional. If it was, then the possession prohibition 
  was in force. If the <em>MMAR</em> did not solve the constitutional problem, then the 
  possession prohibition, even as modified by the <em>MMAR</em>, was of no force or effect. 
  </p>
<p> [33] There was no need to amend or re-enact s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> to address 
  the constitutional problem in <em>Parker</em>. That problem arose from the absence 
  of a constitutionally adequate medical exemption. As our order in <em>Hitzig</em> 
  demonstrates, the prohibition against possession of marihuana in s. 4 is in 
  force when there is a constitutionally acceptable medical exemption in force. 
</p>
<p>
  [34] We would dismiss the appeal</p>
