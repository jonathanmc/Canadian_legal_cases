<p>CHARRON J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The applicant Crown seeks a stay pending the outcome of the appeal to this 
  court of the effect of a summary conviction appeal judgment that interprets 
  the marihuana possession prohibition of the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act, S.C. 1996, c.19 (&quot;CDSA&quot;) to be of no force and effect across 
  Ontario. The relevant facts can be briefly stated as follows.</p>
<p>
  [2] In R. v. Parker (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (C.A.), this court held that 
  the marihuana prohibition in s. 4(1) of the CDSA was unconstitutional as it 
  failed to permit individuals to possess marihuana for valid medical purposes. 
  It declared the prohibition invalid, but suspended the declaration of invalidity 
  for 12 months so that Parliament could remedy the constitutional deficiency 
  by creating a medical use exemption. Parliament responded within this one-year 
  period by enacting the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations, SOR/2001-227 (&quot;MMAR&quot;). 
  The MMAR define the circumstances and the manner in which access to marihuana 
  for medical purposes is permitted.</p>
<p>
  [3] At his trial on marihuana related charges, the respondent sought to be acquitted 
  of the offences on the basis that they were offences unknown to law. He argued 
  that there was no enforceable prohibition against marihuana possession because 
  Parliament failed to &quot;re-enact s.4 of the CDSA&quot; after it was declared 
  to be of no force and effect in Parker, supra.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge granted the respondent's application and acquitted him on 
  the basis that the charges did not reveal offences known to law. On appeal by 
  the Crown to the summary conviction appeal court, the trial judge's decision 
  was affirmed and the appeal was dismissed. An application for leave to appeal 
  and notice of appeal were filed by the applicant with this court on May 26, 
  2003. The appeal was perfected on June 3, 2003. </p>
<p>
  [5] The applicant seeks, amongst other things, an order expediting the hearing 
  of this appeal and an order staying the judgment of the summary conviction appeal 
  court, which concludes that possession of marihuana is not an offence known 
  to law, pending this court's resolution of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] The applicant concedes that there is no authority under the Criminal Code 
  to grant the order as requested. The applicant submits, however, that rule 63.02(1) 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to criminal appeals by rule 
  2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Rules, gives a judge of this court the discretionary 
  authority to grant a stay of the order being appealed. The Crown further submits 
  that s. 1 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, defines &quot;order&quot; 
  to include a judgment. Section 134(2) of the Courts of Justice Act similarly 
  gives the court jurisdiction to grant such relief. The Crown relies more specifically 
  on the case of Horsefield v. Ontario (Registrar of Motor Vehicles) (1997), 35 
  O.R. (3d) 304 (C.A.) where this court ordered a stay of a licence suspension 
  under the authority of those provisions.</p>
<p>
  [7] In my view, the provisions relied upon by the applicant can have no application 
  in this case. It is important to note that no declaratory relief was sought 
  or given in the case under appeal. The original order appealed to the summary 
  conviction appeal court is simply a dismissal of the two counts on the Information 
  setting out the marihuana-related charges. Similarly, the only order of the 
  summary conviction appeal court is a dismissal of the appeal from the trial 
  judge's dismissal of the charges. There is no declaration before the court to 
  the effect that possession of marihuana is not an offence known to law. There 
  is no authority to grant a stay of the reasons of the court underlying a dismissal 
  of a charge. What the Crown, in effect, is seeking is an order suspending the 
  application of the doctrine of stare decisis pending the hearing of this appeal. 
  In my view, such an order would be not only unprecedented, but made without 
  authority.</p>
<p>
  [8] I am persuaded, however, that this appeal should be expedited. The appeal 
  will therefore be scheduled to be heard on an expedited basis on a date to be 
  set by the Registrar of the court. The application is otherwise dismissed.</p>
<p> Released: JUN 16 2003<br>
