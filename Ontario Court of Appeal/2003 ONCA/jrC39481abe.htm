<p>[1] In our view, the total sentence imposed (2 &frac12; years) was in all of 
  the circumstances demonstrably unfit. The offences were very serious and considered 
  together required the imposition of a lengthy penitentiary term. While the respondent's 
  conduct in the twenty years between the offences and his arrest demonstrates 
  that he poses little risk of re-offending, the passage of time does not diminish 
  the need for a denunciatory sentence given the seriousness of these crimes.</p>
<p>[2] In our view, a total sentence of 4 &frac12; years would have the required 
  denunciatory effect and also recognize the respondent's positive lifestyle since 
  he committed these crimes. We would make the sentences imposed at trial consecutive 
  for a total sentence of 4 &frac12; years.</p>
