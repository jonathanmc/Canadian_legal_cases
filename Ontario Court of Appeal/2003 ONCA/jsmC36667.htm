<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice B. Duncan of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice, Youth Court dated April 12, 2001 and the disposition imposed by 
  Justice B. Duncan on May 14, 2001, and from the order of Justice M. Rosenberg 
  of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dated September 13, 2002.</p>
<p><br>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, a young offender, was found guilty on April 12, 2001 of 
  one count of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. 
  On May 14, 2001, he received a disposition of thirty days open custody, followed 
  by probation for eighteen months. He was also prohibited from driving a motor 
  vehicle anywhere in Canada for a period of one year. He was acquitted of the 
  additional charge of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle 
  causing bodily harm. He appeals both his dangerous driving conviction and his 
  disposition on that conviction.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] In August 2002, the appellant requested this court to appoint counsel to 
  represent him on this appeal. By order dated September 13, 2002, Rosenberg J.A. 
  dismissed that application. The appellant seeks to have that order set aside 
  and counsel appointed on his appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>(1) The Appellant's Request for Counsel<br>
</p>
<p>[3] In our view, there is no basis upon which to interfere with Rosenberg J.A.'s 
  decision to dismiss the appellant's application for counsel on his appeal. We 
  reach that conclusion for the following reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Rosenberg J.A. correctly indicated that the test for when this court should 
  exercise its jurisdiction to appoint counsel is set out in R. v. Bernardo (1997), 
  121 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.) at 133. In applying that test in this case, 
  Rosenberg J.A. concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am satisfied that the appellant can effectively advance 
  his grounds of appeal without the assistance of counsel. The appellant is a 
  young person but he has prepared material that sets out the grounds of appeal 
  and the arguments in favour of allowing the appeal. This is not a complex case 
  and the grounds of appeal are not complex. His written material demonstrates 
  that he understands the applicable legal principles and how they relate to the 
  facts of his case.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] This appeal was initiated in May 2001. Thereafter, in communications with 
  this court, the appellant raised numerous issues concerning the appeal, including 
  matters related to the transcripts which he asserted were required for determination 
  of the appeal, the contents of the appeal book, the terms of the appellant's 
  sentence, the grounds of the appellant's appeal, and the position advanced by 
  the respondent in response to the issues raised by the appellant. In many instances, 
  the appellant's submissions were supplemented by submissions and other communications 
  to this court by one or both of his parents. Those communications clearly set 
  out the appellant's grounds of appeal and his arguments on each issue. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] In particular, the appellant filed submissions with this court concerning 
  the grounds of his appeal, and his arguments in support of those grounds, on 
  several occasions including, but not limited to, materials filed in May, October 
  and November, 2001, and July and August, 2002. The appellant's mother, or both 
  of his parents, also provided this court with written materials with the intention 
  that they be considered on the appeal. In late August 2002, further detailed 
  materials were received from the appellant, consisting of a lengthy report prepared 
  by his mother, in support of his appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] We have considered all of the materials received from the appellant, and 
  from either or both of his parents, in evaluating whether the appellant requires 
  counsel on this appeal. We agree with Rosenberg J.A.'s conclusion that the appellant 
  can effectively advance his grounds of appeal, and the arguments in favour of 
  allowing the appeal, without the assistance of counsel. The materials received 
  from the appellant, and from either or both of his parents on his behalf, overwhelmingly 
  support that conclusion and evidence a clear understanding of the legal issues 
  and principles engaged on this appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss the appellant's 
  application to set aside the September 13, 2002 order of Rosenberg J.A.<br>
</p>
<p>(2) The Events Giving Rise to the Appellant's Conviction for Dangerous Driving<br>
</p>
<p>[8] The charge of dangerous driving against the appellant arose from events 
  in the City of Burlington on January 29, 2000 when the appellant was driving 
  his car while making food deliveries for his employer. There was one passenger, 
  Cameron Patterson, in the appellant's vehicle. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] Constable C.J. Bowen of the Halton Regional Police Service testified at 
  trial that he saw the appellant driving his motor vehicle on January 29, 2000 
  at a quick rate of speed, and then observed him making a rapid lane change without 
  first signalling his intention to change lanes. Thereafter, Constable Bowen 
  observed the appellant's vehicle accelerate and proceed through an intersection 
  on a red light, travelling at a rate of speed which Constable Bowen believed 
  to be in excess of the speed limit. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] Constable Bowen was dressed in full uniform but was driving an unmarked 
  police vehicle. He testified that, in an effort to cause the appellant to stop 
  his vehicle, he flashed his car's high beam lights at the appellant's car, honked 
  his horn, activated red flashing lights on the passenger side of his vehicle, 
  and made eye contact with the appellant in the side view mirror of the appellant's 
  car. The appellant signalled with his hand for Constable Bowen's car to pass 
  him. Constable Bowen initially stayed behind the appellant's car but, shortly 
  thereafter, positioned his car beside the appellant's vehicle and pointed for 
  the appellant to pull over to the curb.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] According to Constable Bowen, the appellant stopped his vehicle in the 
  curb lane, approximately four to six feet away from the curb. When Constable 
  Bowen approached the appellant's vehicle on foot, a conversation took place 
  with the appellant. Conflicting evidence was adduced at trial concerning the 
  nature of that conversation and ensuing events. The appellant claimed, in summary, 
  that he told Constable Bowen that he was going to drive his car around a nearby 
  corner to avoid obstructing traffic and that, thereafter, he told Constable 
  Bowen he was going to drive home. He maintained that until Constable Bowen approached 
  his car on foot, he did not realize that Constable Bowen was a police officer. 
  He also said that Constable Bowen physically assaulted him while reaching into 
  his car, and that the police officer was verbally abusive and swore at him. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[12] Constable Bowen testified that he told the appellant to drive his car 
  closer to the curb and, when the appellant failed to do so, he reached inside 
  the appellant's car for the keys in the ignition. The appellant then allegedly 
  accelerated his vehicle, while Constable Bowen's arm was still inside the window 
  of the car, with the result that Constable Bowen's arm was hooked on top of 
  the driver's window of the appellant's car for some time while the vehicle was 
  moving. Constable Bowen testified that he tumbled free of the appellant's car 
  when it slowed down shortly thereafter, whereupon the appellant proceeded to 
  drive around the corner. Constable Bowen radioed to other police officers and 
  then followed the appellant in his own unmarked police car.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The next events were not seriously challenged by the appellant at trial. 
  The youth court judge's description of those events was as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">A police road block of sorts was put up by two squad cars that positioned themselves 
  across the road, and [the appellant] swerved to avoid it.<br>
  At that he continued on, going here and there, followed by a number of police 
  cars, all with their emergency equipment going. He made movements to either 
  hit one of the police cars, or at least to intimidate the officer who was driving 
  that vehicle. He went through a number of red lights.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] The evidence at trial established that, while followed by numerous police 
  cars, the appellant went through several red lights and stop signs without stopping, 
  made several lane changes without signalling, manoeuvred through other traffic 
  while the police were following him, and ultimately stopped his vehicle at his 
  home where he was arrested. <br>
</p>
<p>(3) The Conviction Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The appellant raises several grounds in support of his conviction appeal. 
  In our view, it is necessary to address only the appellant's assertions that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(i) his representation at trial was inadequate;<br>
  (ii) he was prevented at trial from making full answer and defence;<br>
  (iii) the trial judge erred by accepting the evidence of Constable Bowen and 
  Janice Copley; and<br>
  (iv) the verdict is unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.<br>
<p class="indent">&nbsp; 
<p>We consider each of these assertions in turn.</p>
<p>(i) Inadequate representation<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The appellant was not represented by counsel at trial. The youth court 
  judge was informed that the appellant's application to legal aid for funded 
  counsel was denied. He was also informed that the appellant had applied under 
  s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 (the &quot;YOA&quot;) 
  for a direction that the appellant be represented by counsel, but that the appellant 
  had withdrawn that application.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The appellant's mother informed the youth court judge that repeated efforts 
  on behalf of the appellant to meet with defence counsel had been unsuccessful, 
  although the appellant's family was prepared to pay for legal representation 
  for the appellant. The following exchange occurred on December 8, 2000 between 
  the youth court judge and the appellant's mother:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Well, but you have tried and you have failed 
  in that respect, and there is no indication you are going to be successful if 
  I adjourn this. You say you have made all these efforts for the past 10 months 
  or so,&#133;<br>
  Mrs. M.: I agree, Your Honour.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: And you have been unsuccessful, so there 
  is no suggestion that you are going to be successful if I give you an adjournment 
  of a month, is there? What is going to change?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. M.: The only thing that I would see would change 
  if you ordered a lawyer to represent [the appellant].<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Well, we can't order lawyers to do things. 
  What we can order is essentially the order that your son be granted legal aid 
  is what it comes down to, but it sounds to me what you are saying is nobody 
  would take the brief whether it is legal aid or otherwise. Besides, you were 
  prepared to pay for a lawyer, you said.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. M.: We were. We asked - - we said&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Well, I do not know why it is then that no 
  lawyer is prepared to take the case. That sounds very odd, but the fact is that 
  if that is the case nothing is going to change in the next month or so if the 
  matter if adjourned.<br>
</p>
<p>Following that exchange, the youth court judge permitted the appellant's mother 
  to assist the appellant at trial, pursuant to s. 11(7) of the YOA. She actively 
  participated in the conduct of the trial, together with the appellant, by cross-examining 
  witnesses and making submissions to the youth court.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The appellant now argues that his representation at trial was inadequate 
  because he was self-represented and was assisted only by his mother under s. 
  11(7) of the YOA. He asserts that, because neither he nor his mother are legally 
  trained, he was prejudiced in his defence because they did not fully appreciate 
  the applicable procedural rules and legal principles at trial, were unable or 
  failed to adequately introduce or otherwise elicit evidence favourable to the 
  appellant, and generally were unable to persuade the youth court judge to accept 
  their defence theories and submissions. The appellant maintains that, with adequate 
  legal representation at trial, he would have been successful in demonstrating 
  his innocence on the evidence, in shortening the trial, and in securing an early 
  withdrawal of certain of the charges against him. We reject the appellant's 
  argument, for several reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] First, while the special role of counsel for young persons is given prominence 
  in the YOA and that statute contains provisions designed to ensure that young 
  persons and their parents are informed of a young person's right to retain and 
  instruct counsel (see R. v. H. (J.) (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 392 (Ont. C.A.)), 
  the YOA does not require that counsel be appointed for a young person in circumstances 
  where the young person is aware of his or her right to counsel and voluntarily 
  withdraws a request for legal counsel. <br>
</p>
<p>[20] In this case, the appellant acknowledges that he voluntarily withdrew 
  his application under s. 11(4) of the YOA for the appointment of counsel. He 
  claims that he did so because of the adverse impact of the proceedings on his 
  parents' health, in particular, that of his mother. The record indicates that 
  when the appellant's application under s. 11(4) of the YOA commenced on March 
  3, 2000 before Forsyth J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, counsel acted as 
  amicus curiae. During the proceeding, the appellant indicated that he wished 
  to withdraw his application. Forsyth J. did not immediately accept that withdrawal; 
  instead, he adjourned the proceedings for several days to permit the appellant 
  to consult with his parents and to reflect upon his withdrawal request. When 
  the hearing resumed, the amicus curiae continued to be involved and the appellant 
  did not rescind his withdrawal request. Further, in a letter to Crown counsel 
  at trial (not counsel on this appeal), dated March 29, 2000, the appellant indicated 
  that, as his application had been withdrawn, &quot;no more discussion was or 
  is required on this subject&quot;. In those circumstances, there was no requirement 
  on the youth court judge to appoint counsel for the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] Having elected to withdraw his application for court-appointed counsel, 
  and legal aid having been denied, it was open to the appellant to privately 
  retain and instruct legal counsel if he wished to do so. The appellant was informed 
  on July 7, 2000 that his trial would proceed on December 8, 2000 with or without 
  counsel. He received a similar warning on August 4, 2000. The trial commenced 
  on December 8, 2000. By that time, although his application for a court-appointed 
  counsel had been withdrawn for many months and legal aid had been denied, the 
  appellant had neither met with nor retained counsel. We agree with the youth 
  court judge's observation that if, as the appellant's mother represented to 
  the youth court judge, the appellant's family was prepared to retain and pay 
  counsel for the appellant, it is difficult to understand why at least a consultation 
  meeting had not been arranged prior to the scheduled commencement date for the 
  trial.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] In our view, in all of those circumstances, the appellant must bear the 
  consequences of his decision to withdraw his application under s. 11(4) of the 
  YOA and his failure to meet with, or to privately retain, counsel.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] There is a second compelling reason to reject the appellant's argument 
  that inadequate representation of him at trial warrants the setting aside of 
  his conviction. Stated simply, we are not satisfied that the advocacy by, or 
  on behalf of, the appellant at trial was inadequate to fairly and fully present 
  his defence, or that trial fairness was undermined. <br>
</p>
<p>[24] As argued by the respondent on this appeal, the trial judge endeavoured 
  to assist the appellant in many ways at trial by advising the appellant of his 
  substantive and procedural rights, by explaining various legal terms and procedures, 
  and by affording both the appellant and his mother the opportunity to cross-examine 
  Crown witnesses, among other measures. The appellant and his mother participated 
  extensively at the trial and in final legal argument, and outlined in detail 
  the appellant's defence and position on the Crown's case. The trial judge considered, 
  and rejected, the appellant's explanation for his driving behaviour and accepted 
  the evidence of the Crown's witnesses. It was open to the trial judge to do 
  so. The appellant, in essence, is now seeking to retry his case to achieve a 
  different outcome. <br>
</p>
<p>[25] Finally, the appellant's assertion that the outcome at trial would have 
  been different had he been represented by counsel is entirely speculative. As 
  we discuss later in these reasons, the Crown's case against the appellant was 
  overwhelming. The evidence of the appellant's driving while avoiding the police 
  roadblock, and attempting to escape the police chase after his encounter with 
  Constable Bowen, was sufficient to support a conviction for dangerous driving 
  even if Constable Bowen's evidence had been rejected in its entirety. Accordingly, 
  we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>(ii) Full answer and defence<br>
</p>
<p>[26] In support of his claim that he was prevented at trial from making full 
  answer and defence, the appellant alleges that the &quot;Attorney General&quot; 
  failed to deliver transcripts of the appellant's trial proceedings as &quot;contracted 
  for on May 16, 2001&quot;. That claim has no merit.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] On May 16, 2001, the appellant's mother ordered copies of the transcripts 
  from the appellant's trial and undertook to pay for them. Thereafter, on numerous 
  occasions, the appellant or his mother, or both, asserted that outstanding transcripts 
  from all or part of the proceedings involving the appellant were necessary for 
  this appeal and that the &quot;Attorney General&quot; had failed to provide 
  them. That assertion was repeated in the appellant's August 28, 2002 written 
  submissions concerning the appeal, received by this court on August 30, 2002. 
  The appellant continues to assert that claim notwithstanding that the issue 
  of the transcripts required for the appeal was twice dealt with by Rosenberg 
  J.A. of this court in orders dated October 1 and November 15, 2001. Those orders 
  made it clear that the obtaining of additional transcripts was the responsibility 
  of the appellant. Indeed, the order dated November 15, 2001 expressly stated: 
  &quot;If the appellant wishes to order additional transcripts for use on the 
  appeal, he must do so himself.&quot; Any assertion to the contrary by the appellant 
  flies in the face of those facts. Moreover, the issue of any failure to provide 
  outstanding transcripts relates only to this appeal. It has no bearing on whether 
  the appellant was impeded at trial from making full answer and defence.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The appellant further maintains that his right to make full answer and 
  defence was undermined by the failure to obtain complete disclosure from the 
  Crown and by the failure of Crown counsel to &quot;make submissions which could 
  be responded to by the appellant&quot;. <br>
</p>
<p>[29] There are no materials in the record before this court evidencing any 
  disclosure deficiency, nor have any particulars regarding this claim been provided 
  by the appellant. The transcript of the proceedings before Forsyth J. on March 
  30, 2000 indicates that all of the disclosure materials then in the possession 
  of the Crown had been given to the amicus curiae on behalf of the appellant. 
  The transcript of the proceedings before the youth court judge on December 8, 
  2000 indicates that, at the outset of trial, the youth court judge reviewed 
  with the appellant's mother all outstanding disclosure issues, and held that 
  all relevant material had been provided by the Crown. <br>
</p>
<p>[30] In connection with the appellant's assertion that the Crown did not &quot;make 
  submissions which could be responded to by the appellant&quot;, the Crown is 
  free to make those relevant submissions it considers appropriate at trial and 
  on this appeal. Full opportunity was provided to the appellant at trial and 
  before this court to make those submissions he considered necessary or appropriate.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The appellant also submits that he was prevented from, or prejudiced in, 
  making full answer and defence because the trial judge declined to permit him 
  to play at trial the video-taped statements to the police of Cameron Patterson 
  and Janice Copley. The appellant has not provided the transcripts of the evidence 
  of either of those witnesses to this court, although he was informed on more 
  than one occasion that it was his responsibility to do so if he required those 
  transcripts for his appeal. No explanation for this failure has been provided, 
  save for the bald allegation that the &quot;Attorney General&quot; or, presumably, 
  the court reporter, failed to produce required transcripts. <br>
</p>
<p>[32] In addition, the Crown indicated at trial that it would not be calling 
  any civilian witnesses. Crown counsel on this appeal indicates in her factum 
  that the trial court reporter has confirmed that Ms. Copley was a civilian witness 
  called by the appellant. The appellant was not entitled to cross-examine any 
  of his witnesses at trial save as the youth court judge permitted in the exercise 
  of his discretion. Moreover, no arguable right to cross-examine on a prior inconsistent 
  statement arises unless an inconsistency is demonstrated between the witness' 
  trial testimony and his or her prior statement. On the record before this court, 
  no demonstration of a material inconsistency in the evidence of either witness 
  has been made, and no transcripts of their evidence have been offered in support 
  of the appellant's claim. Accordingly, the appellant's argument of prejudice 
  on this ground must fail.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Finally, the appellant argues that he was prevented from making full answer 
  and defence due to the &quot;repeated interruptions by the trial judge during 
  submissions&quot;. The transcripts available to this court, which include the 
  transcript of the final submissions made on behalf of the appellant, do not 
  support that contention. Indeed, they suggest that the youth court judge's interventions 
  were made to assist the appellant, to encourage him, or his mother when she 
  addressed the court on his behalf, to focus on relevant issues, and to clarify 
  the defence position on the issues. <br>
</p>
<p>[34] Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant's submission that he was prevented 
  from making full answer and defence lacks foundation. We would not give effect 
  to this ground of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>(iii) Reliance by the youth court judge on the evidence of Constable Bowen 
  and Janice Copley<br>
</p>
<p>[35] The appellant submits that the youth court judge failed to recognize discrepancies 
  in the evidence of Constable Bowen and contradictions between his testimony 
  and that of Janice Copley. He argues, therefore, that the youth court judge 
  erred in relying upon the testimony of both witnesses in convicting the appellant 
  on the charge of dangerous driving.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] There are several difficulties with that submission. First, as we earlier 
  mentioned, it appears that Ms. Copley was called as a witness at trial by the 
  appellant. She is a member of the public who observed part of the incident between 
  the appellant and Constable Bowen. Having elected to call Ms. Copley as a witness, 
  it is difficult to understand the basis on which the appellant can now seek 
  to describe Ms. Copley as a &quot;Crown witness&quot; or to deny that she was 
  a &quot;neutral&quot; witness, as the appellant asserts in his submissions to 
  this court.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] Second, the youth court judge was free to accept all, part or none of 
  the evidence of each witness at trial. It was for him to determine, after hearing 
  and observing the witnesses at trial, what weight, if any, should be assigned 
  to their testimony.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] Finally, contrary to the appellant's submissions, the reasons of the youth 
  court judge demonstrate that he recognized, and addressed, the discrepancies 
  between the evidence of Constable Bowen and Ms. Copley. He stated in his reasons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Officer Bowen as to the dragging 
  incident that occurred on Walkers Line. It is substantially corroborated and 
  confirmed by the evidence of Janice Copley, a neutral civilian witness. Any 
  discrepancies between their accounts, as to distances, as to particulars, are 
  as might be expected from two people witnessing, and in one case, experiencing, 
  a brief and dramatic event - - those discrepancies in my view, are of either 
  no or little significance [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[39] The youth court judge was in the best position to observe and assess the 
  credibility of the witnesses called at trial, and the materiality, if any, of 
  the discrepancies in their testimony. His credibility findings are entitled 
  to considerable deference by this court: R. v. Biniaris (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 
  1 (S.C.C.). In our view, there is no basis on which to interfere with those 
  findings.<br>
</p>
<p>(iv) Unreasonable verdict<br>
</p>
<p>[40] We have earlier stated our view that the Crown's case against the appellant 
  was overwhelming. As observed by the youth court judge, although there were 
  conflicts between the defence evidence and that of Constable Bowen concerning 
  the interactions between Constable Bowen and the appellant, the driving by the 
  appellant after the incident with Constable Bowen, for the most part, was not 
  disputed at trial. The youth court judge found as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I accept the police evidence that the [appellant], on 
  North Service Road, drove his vehicle toward Constable Labanich's vehicle on 
  more than one occasion. I don't think he necessarily did so to hit her, but 
  to do so in a manner to intimidate her, or to get her to back off her attempts 
  to pull him over.
<p class="indent">I also accept that the [appellant] went through red 
  lights at Brant Street, at Plains Road, and at Fairview, he went over into the 
  passing lane and then swung around and went through a red light at Fairview 
  as well. <br>
<p class="indent">&nbsp; 
<p>[41] The youth court judge also considered the defence position:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now the [appellant's] defence is that he was fearful 
  of the police and he wanted witnesses to his arrest, or his confrontation with 
  them. In particular, he wanted his parents to see it.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, this alleged fear from the [appellant] is 
  completely fabricated. &#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I think it may very well be that [the appellant] wanted 
  to get home for his parents to be witnesses, but it wasn't because he was fearful 
  of being beaten. I think he wanted to involve his parents and enlist in particular, 
  his mother's considerable energy to rally around him and to champion his cause 
  with persecution fantasies and to paint him as a victim. He knew that no matter 
  how wrong he had been, how atrocious his conduct was, he would always be coddled 
  and treated like he was a person who had been grievously wronged, and not the 
  one who was in the wrong, and that's why he wanted to get home.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The accused in my view, is unbelievably cocky and is 
  breathtakingly oblivious to the wrongfulness of his conduct. His position appears 
  to be that he, [J.M.], is entitled to drive any way he chooses and endanger 
  anyone he pleases, so that his arrest can take place on his chosen terms. For 
  example, he has repeatedly said that on Harvester, he had no choice but to either 
  ram the police or to go around. Well how about applying the brakes and stopping?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Your claim of being hit by Bowen and fearful of the 
  police, in my view, is absolute bologna and I don't buy a bit of it.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] In this case, the question to be determined by the youth court judge was 
  whether the appellant's driving was dangerous. His findings of fact concerning 
  the nature of the appellant's driving were supported by the evidence. His rejection 
  of the defence position was based on his assessment of the appellant's credibility. 
  There is nothing in the youth court judge's reasons to suggest that he misapprehended 
  the evidence or that he otherwise went astray in his assessment of it. The youth 
  court judge concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[The appellant's] driving was clearly dangerous, it was a marked departure 
  from the driving that could be expected by a prudent driver, and there was a 
  clear and substantial danger to the public created.</p>
<p> We agree. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal from his dangerous driving conviction 
  is dismissed.</p>
<p>(4) The Appeal Against Disposition<br>
</p>
<p>[43] The appellant received a disposition of thirty days open custody, followed 
  by probation for eighteen months. He was also prohibited from driving a motor 
  vehicle anywhere in Canada for a period of one year. The terms of his probation 
  order required that he perform seventy-five hours of community service, at a 
  rate and on a schedule to be determined by the appellant's youth worker. <br>
</p>
<p>[44] By order of Rosenberg J.A. of this court dated November 15, 2001, the 
  community service term of the probation order was stayed, on request of the 
  appellant, until March 4, 2002 or disposition of this appeal, whichever occurred 
  first. All other terms of the appellant's probation order remained in effect.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] The appellant makes three arguments in support of his appeal against disposition: 
  i) the disposition was excessive and inappropriate given his personal circumstances 
  and the impact of the disposition on the appellant and his family; ii) the youth 
  court judge erred by declining to permit the appellant to cross-examine the 
  author of the pre-sentence report concerning the appellant; and iii) the youth 
  court judge erred by denying the appellant's request for an adjournment of the 
  disposition proceedings in order to permit the appellant to consult with counsel.<br>
</p>
<p>[46] The last two arguments of the appellant may be dealt with summarily. In 
  connection with the denial of the appellant's right to cross-examine the author 
  of the pre-sentence report, we are not persuaded that any prejudice was occasioned 
  to the appellant by that denial in the particular circumstances of this case. 
  While the appellant challenges many of the factual statements set out in the 
  report, the disposition reasons of the youth court judge indicate that he was 
  alive to the fact that much of the report's contents were challenged by the 
  appellant, and he referenced the report only for the purposes of observing that 
  the appellant was behind in his educational training and in the development 
  of employment related skills, and that he lacked insight into his offending 
  conduct and had exhibited no remorse. The youth court judge's observations concerning 
  the appellant's lack of insight and remorse were also expressly based on his 
  own observations of the appellant during the trial and at his disposition hearing. 
  Finally, those parts of the predisposition report disputed by the appellant, 
  as detailed in correspondence from his mother, do not appear to concern the 
  facts referenced by the youth court judge. <br>
</p>
<p>[47] We are also of the view that the denial of the appellant's adjournment 
  request at his May 14, 2001 disposition hearing occasioned no material prejudice. 
  As a preliminary matter, we note that the submissions of Crown counsel on this 
  appeal concerning the issue of an adjournment denial focus on the denial of 
  an adjournment at trial. However, in his submissions to this court dated October 
  18 and November 8, 2001, the appellant indicates that the adjournment denial 
  in issue took place at his disposition hearing on May 14, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] The appellant claims that he sought an adjournment of the May 14, 2001 
  proceeding in order to consult with counsel concerning the pre-disposition report. 
  His submissions indicate that the adjournment was requested for that single 
  purpose and that counsel had not been retained. The appellant has not provided 
  this court with a copy of the transcript of that part of the disposition hearing 
  relating to his alleged adjournment request. However, as the pre-disposition 
  report was only minimally referenced by the youth court judge in his consideration 
  of a proper disposition in this case, and as the appellant's complaints regarding 
  the pre-disposition report appear to be unrelated to that part of the report 
  referenced by the youth court judge, we are unable to conclude that the denial 
  of an adjournment for the purpose of obtaining advice concerning the pre-disposition 
  report affected the fairness of the disposition hearing or the fitness of the 
  disposition imposed.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] Finally, the appellant maintains that his disposition was excessive and 
  inappropriate. Save with respect to the community service requirement of the 
  appellant's probation order, which we discuss below, we reject that submission.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] At the time of trial, the appellant was approximately eighteen years of 
  age. He lived with his parents, an older brother, and his eighty-one year old 
  grandmother. He has a grade eight education. By May 2001, he was making efforts 
  to upgrade his education.<br>
</p>
<p>[51] The appellant's family members apparently suffer from a number of health 
  related impediments. His mother walks with the assistance of a cane and suffers 
  from panic or anxiety attacks. His older brother is unable to drive a car due 
  to a medical condition. His father's health is poor. His grandmother has special 
  needs and requires assistance from family members for her daily living. Prior 
  to his arrest, the appellant was an active participant in her care giving.<br>
</p>
<p>[52] The appellant himself, according to his submissions, suffers from anxiety 
  attacks. As detailed by his mother, he experienced several difficulties, or 
  traumatic events, with persons in authority in the past, including the police. 
  However, prior to this offence, the appellant had no criminal or other young 
  offender record. He did have a record for a variety of motor vehicle offences, 
  including for driving offences, some of which characterized his driving in this 
  instance, that is, speeding, failing to stop at an intersection, and disobeying 
  a red light. <br>
</p>
<p>[53] The appellant asserts that his disposition, together with the terms of 
  his bail, had the practical effect of confining him to house arrest for twelve 
  months, and preventing him from driving a car for almost eighteen months prior 
  to his disposition hearing and for one year thereafter. His inability to drive, 
  he claims, resulted in particular hardship for him and for his family because 
  it interfered with his ability to work, to assist in the care of his grandmother, 
  and to perform the community service required by the terms of his probation 
  order. By order dated October 11, 2001, Rosenberg J.A. of this court dismissed 
  an application by the appellant for a stay of his driving prohibition. In his 
  reasons, Rosenberg J.A. stated:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Over a very short time [the appellant] accumulated a relatively serious driving 
  record before being prevented from driving by his bail conditions. The facts 
  of the offence as found by the trial judge demonstrate a troubling lack of judgment 
  and lack of respect for the law. According to the trial judge, who had the opportunity 
  to observe the appellant during the trial, the appellant had &quot;absolutely 
  no insight&quot; into what he had done.<br>
</p>
<p>[54] Due to the passage of time since the disposition hearing, the appellant 
  has served the custodial part of his disposition. It appears that he has also 
  now served his one-year driving prohibition, and his probation order has expired, 
  save for the community service requirement which was stayed by Rosenberg J.A.'s 
  order of November 15, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>[55] The disposition by the youth court judge is entitled to considerable deference 
  from this court. Appellate intervention with such a disposition is warranted 
  in only limited circumstances, none of which applies here. See R. v. Proulx, 
  [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, and R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500. <br>
</p>
<p>[56] In any event, in our view, the custodial part of the appellant's disposition 
  and the one-year driving prohibition were entirely appropriate given the seriousness 
  of the appellant's conduct. His driving on the day of the incident endangered 
  the safety of police officers, passing motorists, and pedestrians. On the findings 
  of the trial judge, the appellant dragged a police officer some distance, causing 
  him minor injuries. He evaded a police roadblock and attempted, through the 
  use of his car, to intimidate a police officer. He went through a number of 
  red lights, failed to stop at several stop signs, and failed to signal any of 
  his numerous lane changes. <br>
</p>
<p>[57] This was a very serious case of dangerous driving. A driving prohibition 
  was clearly required in the public interest particularly as the appellant, on 
  the record before this court, failed to appreciate the gravity of his conduct 
  and the significant risks posed thereby to public safety. We also think that 
  the custodial part of the appellant's disposition was mandated to maintain public 
  confidence in the effective administration and enforcement of the law, and to 
  address principles of deterrence and denunciation. The youth court judge committed 
  no error in principle by imposing either the custodial part of the appellant's 
  disposition or his driving prohibition.<br>
</p>
<p>[58] We are concerned, however, with the remaining requirement of the probation 
  order concerning community service, having regard to the passage of time since 
  the appellant's disposition hearing and the hardship that the overall disposition 
  appears to have inflicted on his family members.<br>
</p>
<p>[59] In October 2001, the appellant applied to the youth court judge to vary 
  the terms of his probation order to eliminate the requirement for community 
  service and to substitute a fine or a mandatory donation to charity. The youth 
  court judge declined to vary the probation order on the basis that he lacked 
  jurisdiction to do so. However, but for the jurisdictional issue, the youth 
  court judge was prepared to reduce the community service requirement to twenty-five 
  hours and to substitute, in place of the remaining community service hours, 
  a requirement that the appellant make a charitable donation.<br>
</p>
<p>[60] At the time of his application to vary his probation order, the appellant 
  was working approximately ninety hours bi-weekly. He was required, due to his 
  driving prohibition, to travel to and from work with his parents, who were the 
  only family members then authorized to drive. Often the appellant was required 
  to wait for his father to finish work in order to obtain a ride home. As a result, 
  the appellant was often absent from his home for twelve to fourteen hours on 
  a daily basis. Those practical impacts of his disposition, coupled with his 
  grandmother's continuing care needs, were described by his probation officer 
  as having the effect of exacerbating existing tensions for the appellant and 
  his family.<br>
</p>
<p>[61] The Crown is prepared to consent to a variance of the appellant's disposition 
  to give effect to the youth court judge's intention, expressed in October 2001, 
  to reduce the community service requirement. In our view, that variance is justified. 
  We do not consider it necessary or appropriate, however, to now impose a requirement 
  for a charitable donation.<br>
</p>
<p>(5) Disposition of this Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[62] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appellant's conviction appeal 
  is dismissed and his appeal against disposition is allowed, in part, by deleting 
  the term of his probation order requiring seventy-five hours of community service 
  and substituting in its place a term requiring the performance of twenty-five 
  hours of community service on the conditions set out in the probation order. 
  The appellant is to be given credit for any community service hours performed 
  to date. In all other respects, the appellant's appeal against disposition is 
  dismissed.</p>
