<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises two grounds of appeal:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Whether the transaction created a security interest; and</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Whether the applications judge ought to have directed the 
  trial of an issue.</p>
<p> [2] Browne J. rejected the Bank's position that the real nature of the 
  transaction created a security interest and that it was a loan respecting the 
  400 cows and a conditional sale of 159 cows. He held, instead, that the substance 
  of the transaction was an option to purchase. An option does not create a security 
  interest. A security interest as defined in the relevant portion of s. 1(1) 
  of the Personal Property and Security Act R.S.O. 1990, c.8.c.10 as "... 
  an interest in the personal property that secured payment or performance of 
  an obligation..." An option is a right; it is not a payment or an obligation. 
</p>
<p> [3] With respect to the second ground of appeal, the trial judge followed 
  the procedure that the parties agreed he should follow and we are not prepared 
  to review that procedural issue. </p>
<p> [4] The appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent fixed in the amount of 
  $7,000 all inclusive. </p>
