<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess stolen motor 
  vehicles and four counts of possession of specific stolen motor vehicles. The 
  Crown contended that the appellant was part of a group that provided stolen 
  motor vehicles to buyers on request. On the Crown's theory, the appellant had 
  arranged to provide certain stolen vehicles to a police agent. He was arrested 
  in the course of making a delivery to the police agent, but, again on the Crown's 
  theory, continued to operate the scheme from his jail cell and arranged for 
  the sale of two more stolen motor vehicles. The Crown's case rested primarily 
  on the evidence of a paid police agent, McKane, the appellant's former girlfriend 
  and an alleged co-conspirator, Hala, and an undercover police officer, Valvasori. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant testified and denied that he was a party to any conspiracy. 
  He also denied that he was in possession of any of the vehicles that were the 
  subject matter of the substantive charges. The appellant acknowledged that he 
  was a passenger in one of those vehicles (count 2) when he was arrested. He 
  testified that the driver of the vehicle was taking him to a car rental agency 
  located near the airport when the arrest took place. The appellant also admitted 
  that he arranged to have one of the vehicles referred to in the indictment (count 
  6) stored at Mr. McKane's request. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] It was agreed that the vehicles that were the subject of the substantive 
  charges had been stolen shortly before they were recovered by the police. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] It was the position of the appellant that the Crown's case on all of the 
  charges rested almost entirely on the evidence of McKane and Hala. The appellant 
  argued that both were involved in the stolen car operation and were strongly 
  motivated to falsely implicate him to save themselves. The agent, McKane, was 
  paid some $3,000 for his co-operation. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] Counsel for the appellant advanced various grounds of appeal. We need address 
  only his submission that the charge to the jury on the inference available from 
  recent possession of stolen property constituted reversible error. It was the 
  appellant's position that he was not in possession of any of the vehicles and 
  that he did not know that the vehicles were stolen. The inference of guilty 
  knowledge available from a finding of recent possession can arise only if in 
  fact the Crown proves that the accused was in possession of the stolen property. 
  Unfortunately, the trial judge conflated the issues of possession and of guilty 
  knowledge and invited the jury to use the recent possession inference at large 
  in their consideration of the case. His failure to distinguish between proof 
  of possession and the inference of guilty knowledge available from that possession 
  is evident in the following extract from his instructions. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the possession charges, you must consider all 
  the evidence, the arguments of counsel and hopefully what light my charge will 
  throw upon these things and determine if the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the stolen property was in possession of an accused within the meaning 
  of the Criminal Code. You may, however, although not must, in the absence of 
  an explanation which might reasonably be true, find the accused guilty of the 
  offence for which he is charged.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] This instruction suggested to the jury that it could consider the reasonableness 
  of the appellant's explanation in determining whether the appellant was in fact 
  in possession of the vehicle. Possession did not turn on the reasonableness 
  of his explanation for his connection to the vehicle.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Immediately following this instruction, the trial judge mischaracterized 
  the defence by telling the jury, &quot;The accused has given an explanation 
  of how the stolen property came into his possession.&quot; As indicated above, 
  it was not the position of the appellant that he was in possession of any of 
  this property, and he did not offer any explanation for his possession. This 
  mischaracterization of the defence position focused the jury's attention on 
  the reasonableness of the appellant's evidence concerning his connection to 
  two of the vehicles referred to in the indictment. That evidence was, to say 
  the least, suspect. The jury's attention should have been focused first on whether 
  the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession 
  of any, some or all of the vehicles. It was only if and when the Crown proved 
  possession beyond a reasonable doubt that the reasonableness of the appellant's 
  explanation for the possession became relevant.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] We also agree with counsel's submission that the trial judge did not relate 
  the evidence to the constituent elements of the legal definition of possession. 
  It was important that he do so in this case, given that the Crown's evidence 
  potentially putting the appellant in possession of the vehicles differed from 
  vehicle to vehicle referred to in the indictment.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The charge on the inference available from recent possession of stolen 
  property constituted reversible error and necessitates a quashing of the substantive 
  possession counts. As the jury may well have used findings of guilt on those 
  counts as evidence on the conspiracy count, we are satisfied that the conviction 
  on conspiracy must also be set aside: R. v. Kocsis (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 564 
  (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>[10] The appeal is allowed, the convictions on counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are 
  quashed and a new trial is ordered. The convictions on counts 4 and 5 (breach 
  of recognizance) were not in issue on this appeal and those convictions stand.</p>
