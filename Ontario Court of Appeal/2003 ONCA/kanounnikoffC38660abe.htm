<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The evidence adduced after the guilty pleas was sufficient to warrant a 
  finding of guilt on the charge of endangering the safety of the airplane: R. 
  v. Bottomley, [2000] E.W.J. No. 873 (C.A.).<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The parties have made a joint fresh evidence application. The evidence 
  and, principally the evidence of Dr. Bourgit, establishes that the appellant 
  was not criminally responsible. We would set aside the conviction and substitute 
  findings of not criminally responsible on all three counts.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] We are satisfied that the determination of the appropriate disposition 
  should be made by the Review Board as soon as possible. We are also satisfied 
  that the appellant should be placed in the Forensic Programme at the Royal Ottawa 
  Hospital pending the disposition hearing. He should be taken forthwith from 
  his present place of incarceration to the Royal Ottawa Hospital.</p>
