<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Wailan Low of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 4, 1999.</p>    <P>
  BY THE COURT:</p>    <P>
  [1] The appellants appeal the trial judge's finding of conversion and the award 
  of damages of $50,000, of which $10,000 is to be paid jointly and severally 
  by Minicorp and Sugarman. We called on the respondents on one point: whether 
  the trial judge erred in holding Sugarman personally liable. In our view, she 
  did err. </p>    <P>
  [2] The trial judge's finding of personal liability was based on her conclusion 
  that Sugarman was a party to the conveyance of the appliances to the Baks. The 
  bill of sale, however, shows that Minicorp alone conveyed these chattels. Although 
  Mr. Sugarman acted in several capacities on these transactions, we cannot find 
  any evidence that he personally was a party to the sale to the Baks. </p>    
<P> [3] On the other arguments advanced by Mr. Chelin, we think that the trial 
  judge's finding of conversion and her damages award are reasonably supported 
  by the evidence. We note, in particular, the following pieces of evidence on 
  which the trial judge was justified in relying: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The unexplained discrepancies in the storage invoices; </li>
  <li>The improper inclusion in those invoices of costs associated with the mortgagee 
    being in possession; </li>
  <li>The failure of the appellants to provide a detailed accounting of the chattels 
    when requested to do so by the respondents; </li>
  <li>The agreement of purchase and sale with the Baks; and </li>
  <li>The failure of the appellants either to offer any explanation about what 
    happened to the chattels or to rebut the amount of damages claimed by the 
    respondents. </li>
</ul>
<P>
  [4] In the face of this evidence and the findings of the trial judge, we do 
  not think it was open to the appellants to rely on the respondents' failure 
  to retake possession of their goods in February 1990 as an answer to the award 
  of damages. </p>    <P>
  [5] Thus, on the appeal, the trial judge's finding of liability and damages 
  award against Sugarman is set aside but the judgment against Minicorp remains. 
  </p>    <P>
  [6] On the cross-appeal, the respondents make three main submissions:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in finding that only $250,000 of the 
  $300,000 Sugarman mortgage was to be advanced until construction was completed 
  and in finding that the mortgage funds were not intended to pay off the two 
  Minicorp mortgages; </p>
<P class="indent">2. The trial judge erred by not giving effect to s. 42 of the 
  Mortgages Act; and</p>
<P class="indent">3. The trial judge erred in holding that a new notice of sale 
  was not required after the sale of 297 Donlands Avenue to the numbered company.</p>
<P>
  [7] On the first submission, the evidence was conflicting on whether there was 
  to be a $50,000 holdback on the Sugarman mortgage. The trial judge considered 
  this conflicting evidence and concluded at paragraph 29 of her reasons:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The preponderance of the evidence, however, points to a final 
  agreement that of the $300,000 mortgage loan, there was to be a holdback of 
  $50,000 and that the Minicorp mortgages were to remain on title.</p>    
<P>
  [8] In our view, her conclusion is reasonably supported by the evidence, especially 
  the direction signed by the respondents and their solicitors on May 15, 1989. 
  That direction showed a pay out of only approximately $250,000 and, in respect 
  of Minicorp, a direction to pay up only the mortgages arrears. We, therefore, 
  decline to give effect to this submission.</p>    <P>
  [9] On the second submission, the trial judge considered s. 42 of the Mortgages 
  Act. Even accepting a breach of this provision, at best the respondents could 
  obtain damages. Yet, as the trial judge found, for the relevant time period 
  November 21 to December 28, 1989 the respondents proved no damages and offered 
  no evidence that they attempted to or could redeem the property. This submission, 
  too, must fail. </p>    <P>
  [10] Finally, on the facts of this case, we are satisfied that a new notice 
  of sale for 299 Donlands Avenue was not required. The Act does not require a 
  new notice. And, as the trial judge pointed out, the one case where it was required, 
  Botiuk v. Collison (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 580 (C.A.), is distinguishable on its 
  facts. Thus, we cannot give effect to this submission. </p>    <P>
  [11] For these brief reasons, the appeal is allowed by varying paragraphs 3 
  and 8 of the trial judgment so that Alan Sugarman is not liable, either for 
  damages or for costs. The appeal is otherwise dismissed. The cross appeal is 
  also dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [12] In the light of all the circumstances, the appellants are entitled to costs 
  on a partial indemnity basis, fixed at $3,500, inclusive of disbursements and 
  Goods and Services Tax. </p>
