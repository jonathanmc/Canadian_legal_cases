<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: March 14, 2003</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises four grounds in support of his conviction appeal. 
</p>
<p>(1) The Impartiality of Juror Number 4</p>
<p>[2] We do not think that the record supports the claim of a lack of impartiality 
  by juror number 4 in this case. Further, we note that defence counsel at trial 
  was satisfied with the inquiries of the juror made by the trial judge, with 
  the result that he did not seek her disqualification.</p>
<p>(2) Admissibility of the Discreditable Conduct Evidence</p>
<p>[3] The evidentiary record here, fairly read, does not demonstrate a reasonable 
  possibility of collusion between the complainant and L.P. regarding their testimony. 
  Further, we do not think that there is any substance in the argument that the 
  discreditable conduct evidence was inadmissible because of the appellant's prior 
  conviction concerning the incidents involving L.P.</p>
<p>(3) The Trial Judge's Instruction on the Discreditable Conduct Evidence</p>
<p>[4] In our view, the trial judge's use instruction relating to the discreditable 
  conduct evidence, read in the context of the charge as a whole, reflected any 
  error. The jury would have understood it as being applicable to its consideration 
  of the case for the Crown, and not to the defence case. That was indicated to 
  the jury in the trial judge's review of the case for the defence when he expressly 
  drew the jury's attention to the discrepancy between the evidence of the complainant 
  and L. P. relied upon by the defence. </p>
<p>(4) The Trial Judge's Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge's instruction on reasonable doubt was not deficient in 
  any material respect in this case. </p>
<p>[6] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</p>
