<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Gregory P. Rodgers of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice, dated December 4, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] K.B. and S.W., two young persons, were convicted of a number of offences, 
  including breaking and entering and theft, and sentenced to periods of secure 
  custody. Crown counsel at trial asked the disposition judge to make a discretionary 
  order authorizing the taking of DNA samples from each of the accused under s. 
  487.051(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, but the disposition judge declined, without 
  giving reasons, to do so.</p>
<p>
  [2] In failing to give reasons, the disposition judge committed an error in 
  principle, because s. 487.051(3) requires that reasons be given in respect of 
  decisions taken under s. 487.051(1)(b).</p>
<p>
  [3] Having found that such an error was made, this court is entitled to intervene: 
  R. v. Hendry (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 275, para. 8.</p>
<p>
  The Best Interests of the Administration of Justice</p>
<p>
  [4] Section 487.051(1)(b) of the Criminal Code provides that where, as here, 
  secondary designated offences have been committed, the court may make an order 
  authorizing the taking of DNA samples if it "is satisfied that it is in 
  the best interests of the administration of justice to do so".</p>
<p>
  [5] Section 487.051(3) provides that, in deciding whether to make such an order, 
  the court shall consider the criminal record of the person or young person, 
  the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, 
  and the impact such an order would have on the person's or young person's 
  privacy and security of the person.</p>
<p>
  [6] This court has recently considered the issue of making discretionary DNA 
  orders in the context of adult offenders: R. v. Hendry, above; R. v. Briggs 
  (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 38. The question raised by this appeal is how, if at 
  all, the analysis in those cases ought to be adjusted in cases involving young 
  offenders. </p>
<p>
  [7] Sections 9.1 and 10.1 of the DNA Identification Act, S.C. 1998, c. 37 make 
  a distinction between adult offenders and young offenders with respect to the 
  retention and destruction of DNA samples and profiles. In brief, when a young 
  person's youth record (recording findings of guilt) is required to be 
  destroyed, so are their DNA profile and sample, whereas DNA samples taken from 
  adult offenders are retained indefinitely. The Code, however, makes no distinction 
  between young and adult offenders respecting the three factors the court should 
  consider in determining whether to order a DNA sample.</p>
<p>
  [8] The application of these factors, however, will necessarily be different 
  between young and adult offenders. In Hendry, this court held [at para. 25] 
  that "in the vast majority of cases, it would be in the best interests 
  of the administration of justice to make the order". No such assumption 
  can be made in the case of a young offender. All legislation dealing with young 
  offenders and, in particular, the Young Offenders Act recognize that young offenders 
  are to be treated differently by the courts because of differences in vulnerability, 
  maturity, experience and other factors related to their youth. The Declaration 
  of Principle heading that precedes ss. 3(1) and 3(2) of the YOA and the principles 
  addressed in those sections support the proposition that young persons, in principle, 
  are to be treated differently from adults who are prosecuted under the Criminal 
  Code. We cannot assume, for example, as with an adult offender, that there will 
  be minimal impact on a young person's privacy and security of the person. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] In considering each of the three factors, the disposition judge must, in 
  accordance with the principles of disposition set out in the young offenders 
  legislation, look at each of them in terms of the goals sought to be achieved 
  by that legislation. </p>
<p>
  Application to this Case</p>
<p>
  [10] In the present case, both S.W. and K.B. have lengthy records, including 
  prior convictions for designated offences, both primary and secondary; both 
  have served dispositions in open and secure custody; the circumstances of the 
  offence are serious; there was a break and enter and extensive gratuitous damage 
  was done. There is, however, no evidence that addresses the impact such an order 
  would have on their privacy and security. </p>
<p>
  [11] For that reason, while we would allow the appeal and set aside the disposition 
  judge's decision refusing to make an order authorizing the taking of DNA 
  samples, we would decline the Crown's invitation to make the order requested. 
  Instead, we refer the matters back to the disposition judge for consideration 
  and determination in accordance with these reasons.</p>
