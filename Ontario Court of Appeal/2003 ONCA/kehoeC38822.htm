<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 11, 2003<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The governing rule is rule 26.01. The amendment must be allowed on such 
  terms as are just unless there is prejudice that could not be compensated for 
  by costs. There is a limitation period that may be in issue. The amendment could 
  nevertheless be allowed without prejudice to the right of the respondent to 
  plead and argue the limitation period as a defence. The court is advised that 
  there would be no further discovery of the respondents consequent upon the amendment.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The focus of the argument on the motion was whether the claim for equitable 
  subrogation is tenable in law. For the purposes of the amendment we take the 
  facts alleged to be true and on those facts we are of the opinion that the claim 
  is tenable in law. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is allowed and the order of the motions judge is set aside. 
  In its place an order will go allowing the proposed amendments without prejudice 
  to the right of the respondent to plead and to argue the limitation period as 
  a defence.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] There are no costs of either the motion or the appeal. </p>
<p>&quot;K. M. Weiler J.A.&quot;<br>
