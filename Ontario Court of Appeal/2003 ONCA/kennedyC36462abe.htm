<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] We are not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that it was improper 
  for Scott J. to preside over the uncontested trial. We note that there was no 
  appeal from the order striking his Answer in this matter, thereby leading to 
  the uncontested trial.</p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the 
  trial judge's imputation of $65,000 annual income to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [3] It was within the trial judge's discretion to conclude that a &quot;clean 
  break&quot; was desirable and to award a lump sum spousal support award.</p>
<p>
  [4] Scott J.'s approach to quantifying the value of the wife's pension and the 
  value assigned by her were reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [5] We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's exercise in discretion 
  in awarding costs against the appellant on the scale that she did, given the 
  history of this matter and her finding of bad faith.</p>
<p>
  [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the total amount 
  of $3,000.00.</p>
