<p>On appeal from the acquittal by Justice Clair B. Marchand of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 20, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would not give effect to this Crown appeal. The trial judge properly 
  directed himself with respect to the elements of dangerous driving and applied 
  that legal test. He referred to all of the relevant evidence and expressly stated 
  that he was considering the totality of the evidence. The reasons do not support 
  the Crown's submission that the trial judge isolated or eliminated the speed 
  from the other conduct. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] As to the charge of impaired ability causing bodily harm, we are satisfied 
  that the trial judge applied the proper legal test. He recognized that if the 
  appellant's judgment was impaired by alcohol, this would be sufficient to make 
  out the offence even if the manner of driving did not demonstrate impaired ability 
  to drive. In the impugned passage of the trial judge's reasons, the judge was 
  listing some of the constituent elements of driving, not purporting to set out 
  the elements of the offence. We see no basis for holding that the trial judge 
  did not recognize that even a slight impairment of ability was capable of constituting 
  an offence. The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and made findings 
  of fact that could be supported by that evidence. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly we see no error of law and the appeal must be dismissed.<br>
