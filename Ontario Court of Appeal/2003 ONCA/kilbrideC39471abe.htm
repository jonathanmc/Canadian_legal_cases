<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The serious nature of this offence was such that a period of substantial 
  incarceration would have been warranted even given the passage of time (20 years) 
  and the respondent's positive lifestyle during that time.</p>
<p> [2] However, given that the respondent has successfully completed 9 months 
  of the conditional sentence, we are not prepared to interfere with the sentence 
  imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p> [3] We encourage the respondent to complete the rest of his sentence in a 
  spirit of co-operation which the trial judge no doubt anticipated.</p>
<p> [4] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
