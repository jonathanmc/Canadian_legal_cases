<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raised a preliminary matter about whether Justice Borins 
  should sit on the appeal. He alleged an appearance of bias because Justice Borins 
  had been a member of two other panels dealing with other aspects of the appellant's 
  business affairs in which the appellant had not been successful. In our view, 
  the appellant's concerns are groundless and we see no merit in his application. 
  Accordingly, we ordered the appeal to proceed with the panel as presently constituted.</p>
<p>[2] We see no basis for interfering with the conclusion of the motions judge. 
  In particular, we are satisfied that she was correct in holding that the respondent 
  owed no duty of care to the appellants with respect to the claims of their former 
  customers. While there may be other reasons for concluding that there is no 
  basis for a trial in the matter, we need not canvass them. Standing alone, the 
  duty of care issue is fatal to the appellants' claim.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs fixed at $3,500.00 inclusive 
  of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
