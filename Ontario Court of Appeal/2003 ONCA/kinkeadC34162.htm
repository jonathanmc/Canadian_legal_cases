<p>On appeal from convictions entered by Justice Harry LaForme of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on June 30, 1999. </p>
<p>SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p> <strong>I. OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>
  [1] Nineteen-year-old Marsha Ottey planned to leave Toronto on August 18, 1995 
  and travel to Arkansas State University where she had earned a full track and 
  field scholarship. Tragically, on the morning of August 16, 1995, Marsha and 
  her sixteen-year-old sister, Tamara, were brutally stabbed to death in the basement 
  of their Scarborough home. </p>
<p>
  [2] Soon after the killings, police identified Marsha's former boyfriend, Rohan 
  Ranger, as a potential suspect. The appellant, Adrian Kinkead, and Ranger were 
  cousins and close friends. In early 1997, following the discovery of DNA evidence 
  potentially linking Kinkead to Marsha's slaying, Ranger and Kinkead were both 
  charged with two counts of first-degree murder. </p>
<p>
  [3] The two men were tried separately. Ranger's trial proceeded first, and the 
  Crown subpoenaed Kinkead to testify. In his evidence at Ranger's trial, Kinkead 
  exculpated himself and implicated Ranger. In June 1998, Ranger was convicted 
  of the first-degree murder of Marsha and the manslaughter of Tamara.</p>
<p>
  [4] Kinkead's trial began on April 12, 1999 before LaForme J., sitting with 
  a jury. Kinkead did not testify or call other defence evidence. On June 30, 
  1999, the jury convicted Kinkead of two counts of first-degree murder. He was 
  sentenced to life imprisonment without parole eligibility for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>
  [5] Both Ranger and Kinkead appealed their convictions. This court heard their 
  appeals sequentially. This judgment deals with Kinkead's appeal only. My colleague, 
  Charron J.A., has prepared a separate judgment dealing with the Ranger appeal.</p>
<p> [6] Kinkead claims that he was denied the right to a fair trial because of 
  four errors made by the trial judge:<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p class="indent">
  i) the trial judge failed to cure the prejudicial effect of mid-trial publicity 
  concerning Kinkead's prior unrelated murder conviction;</p>
<p class="indent"> ii) the trial judge erred by admitting evidence that Kinkead 
  had, in the past, carried a knife, and that, on one occasion, in Ranger's presence, 
  Kinkead had threatened an acquaintance with a knife; in addition, the trial 
  judge exacerbated this error by failing to give the jury proper instructions 
  concerning the use of this evidence;</p>
<p class="indent"> iii) the trial judge erred by ruling that the Crown could use 
  Kinkead's compelled testimony at Ranger's trial for purposes of cross-examination; 
  and </p>
<p class="indent"> iv) the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury concerning 
  certain evidence of post-offence conduct. </p>
<p>
  [7] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> <strong>II. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>[8] I will outline the background facts relating to the appeal generally and 
  then deal with the facts relating to the individual grounds of appeal when considering 
  them.</p>
<p> <strong>i) Marsha's Relationship with Ranger</strong></p>
<p>[9] Marsha and Ranger began dating in 1990 while Marsha was still in high school. 
  In the late summer or early fall of 1994, Marsha grew tired of Ranger's domineering 
  and obsessively jealous behaviour and ended their relationship. </p>
<p>
  [10] Ranger was unhappy with the break-up and continued to contact Marsha against 
  her wishes. Between November 1994 and July 1995, he telephoned the Ottey home 
  on 144 occasions. In addition, he sometimes followed Marsha and appeared unexpectedly 
  at places where Marsha happened to be. </p>
<p>
  [11] For a number of years before her death, Marsha was planning to attend university 
  in the United States. Ranger was displeased about Marsha's plan. On one occasion, 
  in the spring of 1994, Ranger threatened to kill Marsha if she ever left Canada 
  to study in the United States. </p>
<p>
  [12] Marsha's mother, Avis Ottey, testified that she saw Marsha and Ranger together 
  for the last time about two weeks before Marsha was scheduled to leave for Arkansas. 
  Marsha and Ranger went to the basement of her home to talk. Mrs. Ottey heard 
  Marsha say, &quot;I'm not changing my mind&quot;. Ranger then stormed out of 
  the house. </p>
<p>
  [13] On the Monday before she died, Marsha told one of her girlfriends that 
  Ranger had said that if he could not have her &quot;no one else can&quot;. Just 
  before her death, Marsha told her mother, &quot;[i]f anything happens to me, 
  it's Rohan&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>ii) Rohan Ranger and Adrian Kinkead</strong></p>
<p>
  [14] Ranger and Kinkead are first cousins once removed. A former girlfriend 
  of Kinkead testified that the two men were extremely close and that they were 
  together all of the time. The Crown relied on evidence that, between May and 
  July of 1995, Ranger telephoned Kinkead at his girlfriend's home on 109 occasions 
  as evidence of planning and deliberation. </p>
<p> <strong>iii) The Days Leading Up to the Murders</strong></p>
<p>
  [15] Witnesses saw a young black man crouching or loitering in a walkway directly 
  across from the Ottey home between 7:10 a.m. and 7:35 a.m. on August 14 and 
  15, 1995. Two of the witnesses saw a young black man on August 14, 1995; all 
  five of them saw a young black man on August 15, 1995, the day before the murders. 
</p>
<p>
  [16] One of the witnesses selected two pictures from a photographic line-up 
  and said that they resembled the man he saw on August 15. He said that he was 
  80-90% sure that one of the photographs depicted the man that he saw. That photograph 
  depicted Ranger. </p>
<p> <strong>iv) The Morning of the Murder</strong></p>
<p>
  [17] On the morning of August 16, 1995, Mrs. Ottey left for work at 7:01 a.m. 
  Marsha and Tamara were still at home, but Tamara was getting ready to catch 
  a bus to go to work. </p>
<p>
  [18] At around 7:15 or 7:20 a.m., two witnesses saw Tamara with a young black 
  man. They said that the man had his arm around Tamara and that he was pulling 
  her into his shoulder as they walked toward the Ottey home.</p>
<p>
  [19] The witness who identified Ranger's photograph said that, at around 7:30 
  a.m. on August 16, 1995, he saw the same man in the walkway dressed in black. 
</p>
<p> <strong>v) The Discovery of the Bodies</strong></p>
<p>
  [20] Avis Ottey returned home from work shortly after 5:20 p.m. on August 16, 
  1995. She found the door to her house unlocked and the house in disarray. She 
  discovered Marsha's body in the basement. She tried to call for help but the 
  telephone line was dead. She went to a neighbour's home and called 911. Emergency 
  personnel found the bodies of both young women in the basement. Full rigor mortis 
  had set in and the blood was brown and drying, indicating that some time had 
  passed since the murders.</p>
<p> <strong>vi) Evidence that the Crime Scene was Staged</strong></p>
<p> [21] Both Mrs. Ottey and the emergency personnel testified that the house 
  was ransacked. However, the only items that Mrs. Ottey ever determined were 
  missing were a gold necklace Marsha usually wore around her neck that Ranger 
  had given to her, Marsha's electronic organizer, and a video of Marsha playing 
  soccer<a href="#2">[2]</a>.<a name="r2"></a> </p>
<p>
  [22] At trial, the Crown called evidence indicating that the crime scene appeared 
  to have been staged to look like a burglary. The identification officer, Detective 
  Ian Mann, noted that many items that are often attractive to burglars remained 
  in the house. In addition, Detective Inspector Kathryn Lines was qualified to 
  give opinion evidence relating to &quot;criminal investigative analysis involving 
  staging behaviour&quot;. She gave evidence similar to Mann's and said that it 
  appeared as if a number of items in the house had been moved but that the perpetrator(s) 
  had no real interest in taking them.</p>
<p>
  [23] Lines also testified that staging is used for one of two reasons, &quot;to 
  redirect the investigation away from the most logical suspect or to protect 
  the victim&quot;. She said that, &quot;[when] a crime is staged &#133; it is 
  almost always someone who has had some kind of association or relationship with 
  the victim&quot;. In this instance, Lines said that the perpetrator appeared 
  to have a particular interest in Marsha's possessions.</p>
<p>
  [24] Ranger raised Lines' evidence at his trial as one of his primary grounds 
  of appeal. My colleague, Charron J.A., deals with Lines' evidence extensively 
  in her reasons relating to Ranger's appeal. </p>
<p>
  [25] However, it is unnecessary for me to address Lines' evidence in this judgment 
  for three reasons. First, because Ranger had a relationship with Marsha, the 
  staging evidence incriminated Ranger, rather than Kinkead. Second, at trial, 
  Kinkead admitted that Ranger was convicted of the first-degree murder of Marsha 
  and the manslaughter of Tamara. Accordingly, evidence implicating Ranger was 
  not inconsistent with the position Kinkead was taking. Third, Kinkead did not 
  object to Lines' evidence at trial nor rely on her evidence as a ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [26] In the circumstances, I will not deal with Lines' evidence when setting 
  out my analysis of Kinkead's grounds of appeal.</p>
<p> <strong>vii) Forensic Evidence Relating to the Number of Attackers</strong></p>
<p>
  [27] The examining pathologist was unable to exclude the possibility that there 
  was only one assailant and only one murder weapon. However, she described specific 
  defence hypotheses involving a single killer as &quot;unlikely&quot; and &quot;a 
  bit of a stretch.&quot;</p>
<p> <strong>viii) The Murder Weapon</strong></p>
<p>
  [28] Following the murders, two pieces of a knife hilt were found in the Ottey 
  home. An expert in the identification of knives testified that the knife hilt 
  pieces were very specific to a particular type of knife, namely, a medium-sized, 
  lock-back, folding knife with a single-edged straight blade. He agreed that 
  five to ten thousand knives of that type might have been sold in Toronto. </p>
<p>
  [29] The examining pathologist confirmed that a knife like the one described 
  by the knife expert could have caused the young women's injuries.</p>
<p> <strong>ix) The Investigation of Kinkead</strong></p>
<p>
  [30] Although he was known as an associate of Ranger early in the investigation, 
  Kinkead was not a serious suspect as the police were unable to place him at 
  the murder scene, or even in the city, at the time of the killings. Kinkead's 
  fingerprints were tested but came back negative.</p>
<p> <strong>x) DNA Evidence </strong></p>
<strong><p class="indent"> a) The discovery of evidence leading to Kinkead's arrest</p>
</strong><p>
  [31] Post-mortem examination of Marsha's body revealed DNA under her fingernails 
  from two other people, a man, and a woman. On December 21, 1995, DNA analysis 
  linked the person responsible for three recent crimes at the Victoria Park subway 
  station to the male DNA found under Marsha's fingernails.</p>
<p>
  [32] As a result of further investigation, police arrested Kinkead, obtained 
  a sample of his blood, and submitted the sample for testing. In July 1997, Kinkead 
  pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual assault in relation to two 
  separate incidents that occurred in early September 1995 at the Victoria Park 
  subway station, and to the October 23, 1995 slaying of TTC collector Dimitrija 
  Trajceski.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> b) DNA evidence at Kinkead's trial</p>
</strong><p>
  [33] Pamela Newall testified at Kinkead's trial as an expert in DNA analysis. 
  She confirmed that DNA from two other people was found under Marsha's fingernails 
  and said that Kinkead could not be excluded as the source of the male DNA. In 
  addition, although he could not be identified conclusively as the source of 
  that DNA, she opined that one would not expect to see another black male in 
  Canada who fit the observed characteristics. Finally, Newall testified that 
  the female DNA found under Marsha's fingernails was consistent with Tamara's 
  profile.</p>
<p>
  [34] During her evidence, the examining pathologist acknowledged that foreign 
  DNA under the fingernails of one of the victims would not necessarily be from 
  the killer.</p>
<p> <strong>xi) Kinkead's Position at his Trial</strong></p>
<p>
  [35] At his trial, counsel for Kinkead (not Mr. Burstein or Mr. Lafontaine) 
  admitted that Ranger had been convicted of murder and manslaughter in relation 
  to the killings. In addition, counsel admitted that Kinkead had testified at 
  Ranger's trial and that his testimony &quot;implied that &#133; Ranger was the 
  sole killer of both Marsha and Tamara&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [36] Kinkead did not testify or call other defence evidence. In their closing 
  to the jury, Kinkead's counsel attacked the forensic evidence and asserted that 
  the Crown had failed to prove the elements of the offences beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p> <strong>III. ANALYSIS </strong></p>
<p> <strong>i) Did The Trial Judge Err By Failing To Cure The Prejudicial Effect 
  Of Mid-Trial Publicity Concerning Kinkead's Previous Murder Conviction?</strong></p>
<strong><p class="indent">a) Background</p>
</strong><p>[37] On May 25, 1999, defence counsel requested a mistrial arising from the 
  following events. </p>
<p>
  [38] Commencing on Sunday May 23, 1999, after the completion of several days 
  of evidence, various media began reporting that a warrant had been issued for 
  the arrest of defence lawyer Kadir Baksh on child abduction charges. Some of 
  the stories mentioned that Baksh had acted for Kinkead, who was sentenced to 
  life imprisonment for the October 23, 1995 murder of TTC collector Dimitrija 
  Trajceski. At least one story indicated that Kinkead had pleaded guilty to that 
  charge and that he was still facing murder charges in relation to the Ottey 
  killings.</p>
<p>
  [39] Defence counsel submitted that it was likely that at least some of the 
  jurors may have learned inadvertently of Kinkead's murder conviction. Counsel 
  said that he could not think of an instruction that would deal with the situation 
  adequately because instructing the jury to disregard what they may have heard 
  would serve only to underline it. He claimed that, as a result, there was no 
  option but to declare a mistrial.</p>
<p>
  [40] After hearing submissions, the trial judge decided to ask the jurors individually 
  whether they had seen or heard anything about &quot;a lawyer by the name of 
  Mr. Baksh who is &#133; alleged to have taken a child from its mother's residence&quot;. 
  Six jurors responded that they had heard something about the story. Based on 
  their expressions and their responses, the trial judge concluded that at least 
  two or three of those six jurors were likely aware of the appellant's prior 
  murder conviction . </p>
<p> [41] After further submissions, the trial judge denied the request for a mistrial. 
  He concluded that the jury would be able to set aside anything they may have 
  heard about the murder conviction. In particular, he noted that the defence 
  had challenged prospective jurors for cause based on pre-trial publicity and 
  that all of the jurors had been accepted by the triers.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [42] Following his ruling, the trial judge gave the jury a three-part instruction. 
  He instructed the jury not to discuss anything that they may have seen or heard; 
  he reminded them of their oath to decide the case based solely on the evidence 
  adduced at trial and told them to disregard anything that they may have seen 
  or heard; and he instructed them to ignore any future stories that they might 
  see concerning Mr. Baksh or the missing child. </p>
<p>
  [43] In particular, the trial judge said the following in the second part of 
  his instruction: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The second thing I am going to ask you to do is what you have already sworn 
  to do, and I guess basically I just want to remind you that whatever it was 
  you heard or read, you are to disregard it. You are to banish it from your mind 
  and do what I know each and every one of you are going to do and honour your 
  oath, and that is, you are going to decide the guilt or innocence of Mr. Kinkead 
  based solely on the evidence you are going to hear at this trial, and I know 
  that you are going to do that.</p>
<p>[44] On June 2, 1999, after a further newspaper article referred to Kinkead's 
  murder conviction under the headline, &quot;Daughter pleads with father sought 
  in kidnapping&quot;, the defence renewed its request for a mistrial. Once again, 
  counsel submitted that it was possible that some of the jurors may have learned 
  inadvertently of Kinkead's prior murder conviction. Relying on his previous 
  reasons, the trial judge denied the renewed request for a mistrial.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> b) Kinkead's submissions</p>
</strong><p>
  [45] While acknowledging that the trial judge's decision to caution the jury 
  about the mid-trial publicity rather than declaring a mistrial involves the 
  exercise of discretion, Kinkead submits that the trial judge erred in the exercise 
  of his discretion in at least three respects. </p>
<p>
  [46] First, he says that the trial judge prejudged the issue of whether there 
  should be a mistrial. Kinkead relies on a question that the trial judge asked 
  defence counsel prior to questioning the jury, namely, &quot;[w]hat's the remedy 
  outside of a mistrial&quot;. In addition, he relies on comments the trial judge 
  made between questioning the second and third jurors: </p>
<p class="indent"> My sense is that I would like to be able to give them an instruction, 
  if we can agree on that at the end and if that's the best result and the way 
  to proceed, that applies to all of them and to avoid any kind of mention of&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Kinkead submits that the trial judge's question to counsel and 
  his subsequent comments demonstrate that the trial judge had made up his mind 
  about whether to declare a mistrial prior to hearing submissions.</p>
<p>
  [47] Second, Kinkead submits that the trial judge failed to focus on the real 
  issue when questioning the jurors and therefore failed to conduct a proper inquiry. 
  In particular, he submits that, having determined that at least two or three 
  jurors had learned of his previous murder conviction, at a minimum, the trial 
  judge was obliged to make further inquiries to determine whether those jurors 
  could decide the case based solely on the evidence adduced at trial. </p>
<p> [48] Kinkead relies on authorities such as <em>R. v. Budai</em>i<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  and this court's decisions in <em>R. v. Afghanzada</em><a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> 
  and <em>R. v. Hertrich</em><a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="r6"></a> in support
   of the dual proposition that the threshold for triggering an investigation
  is  low and that the trial judge's duty is to &quot;investigate &#133; by personally
   examining the juror&quot; to determine whether the juror's partiality has
   been  affected<a name="r7"></a><a href="#7">[7]</a>. In addition, he analogizes to the challenge
   for cause procedure. He submits that the trial judge's conclusion that at
   least two to three jurors had learned of the murder conviction amounted to
   a determination that there was a realistic potential for partiality, and that
   such a finding mandates further inquiries. </p>
<p>
  [49] Alternatively, Kinkead says that, absent specific confirmation that the
     jurors could set aside what they had heard, the nature of the prejudice
    arising  from the media reports required that the trial judge declare a mistrial.
    In  particular, he says that the trial judge's subsequent <em>Corbett</em><a href="#8">[8]</a><em><a name="r8"></a></em> ruling
    demonstrates  the incurable nature of the prejudice. In his ruling, the trial
    judge said, 
  &quot;I have no doubt that its [Kinkead's previous murder conviction] prejudice
   in this case would certainly outweigh any of the probative value which I have
   articulated&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [50] Third, Kinkead says that the instruction given by the trial judge was deficient 
  because it was not specific enough. Here, he submits that the trial judge failed 
  to specifically instruct the jury to disregard anything that they may have heard 
  about him.</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>c) Discussion concerning whether the trial judge failed 
  to cure the prejudicial effect of mid-trial publicity about Kinkead's previous 
  murder conviction</strong></p>
<p>[51] I reject Kinkead's contentions.</p>
<p>
  [52] First, I find no merit in the submission that the trial judge prejudged 
  the issue of whether to declare a mistrial. </p>
<p> [53] Not surprisingly, the trial judge decided on the steps to be taken during 
  the course of an ongoing colloquy with counsel. It is customary, during submissions, 
  that a trial judge will alert counsel to the options that he may be considering 
  and to the portions of counsel's argument that are causing him concern. In my 
  view, the trial judge's question about the availability of a remedy other than 
  a mistrial was nothing more than a part of the colloquy, which involved identifying 
  and assessing the available courses of action. Further, when the trial judge 
  remarked that he would like to be able to give the jury an instruction, he qualified 
  his comment by saying, <em>&quot;if we can agree on that and if that's the best 
  result and the way to proceed&quot;</em> (emphasis added). Particularly in light 
  of the qualification, I see no basis for finding that the trial judge prejudged 
  the issue of whether to declare a mistrial. Significantly, defence counsel at 
  trial did not raise an objection similar to that which has been raised on appeal. 
</p>
<p>
  [54] Second, I do not agree with the suggestion that the trial judge failed 
  to focus on the real issue or that the circumstances made either additional 
  inquiries or a mistrial mandatory. </p>
<p>
  [55] The trial judge's conclusion as set out in his ruling was that he was satisfied 
  that the jurors could set aside anything they may have heard. That is the precise 
  issue that he was required to determine.</p>
<p> [56] Further, the issue in this case is distinguishable from the issues that 
  arose in the authorities upon which Kinkead relies. Here, the circumstances 
  did not involve investigating the possibility or effects of juror tampering, 
  nor did they involve assessing whether <em>prospective</em> jurors could abide 
  by an oath. This jury had already been sworn. The circumstances were more akin 
  to the situation presented by the inadvertent admission of inadmissible evidence. 
</p>
<p>
  [57] Where inadmissible evidence is inadvertently admitted, the trial judge 
  does not question the jurors to assess whether they can disregard the inadmissible 
  evidence; rather, he makes that determination as a matter of common sense, taking 
  account of all of the events that have taken place and his observations of the 
  jury. In this case, the trial judge adopted the same approach. </p>
<p>
  [58] In my view, the trial judge directed his mind to the correct issue and 
  took appropriate steps to assess what the remedy should be. The trial judge 
  noted that some of the jurors may well have heard of the appellant's criminal 
  history before the trial, that they were challenged for cause on the ground 
  of pre-trial publicity, and that they had been accepted by the triers as being 
  capable of setting aside what they had heard. Moreover, he had been observing 
  the jury since they were selected and he had the opportunity to observe their 
  expressions and responses when he questioned them. </p>
<p>
  [59] The trial judge was in the best position to assess the impact of the publicity 
  in the context of the issues and evidence that had been presented at trial. 
  In the end, he concluded that this jury could continue to abide by their oaths, 
  set aside any information they had heard before or during the trial, and act 
  as impartial triers. Without excluding the possibility that the trial judge 
  could have made further inquiries in a manner that would not have contaminated 
  the jury, I see no basis for holding that the approach that he adopted amounts 
  to reversible error. </p>
<p>
  [60] Finally, I do not consider that the trial judge's ruling on the <em>Corbett</em> 
  application is inconsistent with his decision not to declare a mistrial nor 
  that there is any other basis for this court to conclude that the prejudice 
  arising from the mid-trial publicity was incurable. </p>
<p> [61] Contrary to Kinkead's submissions, the trial judge's <em>Corbett</em> 
  ruling does not reflect a finding that Kinkead's prior murder conviction was 
  incurably prejudicial. The decision on a <em>Corbett</em> application involves 
  determining whether the probative value of otherwise admissible evidence (i.e. 
  evidence of an accused person's criminal record) outweighs its potential prejudice 
  (i.e. the likelihood that the jury will use the evidence for an improper purpose). 
  Here, the trial judge ruled that the Crown was entitled to cross-examine Kinkead 
  concerning several other convictions involving serious criminal <a href="#9">[9]</a>.<a name="r9"></a> 
  In effect, he determined that Kinkead's credibility could be properly assessed 
  without the murder conviction. Rather than a finding that knowledge of the murder 
  conviction would create incurable prejudice to Kinkead, the trial judge's <em>Corbett</em> 
  ruling reflects the appropriate balancing of probative value versus potential 
  prejudice. </p>
<p> [62] Moreover, the trial judge was satisfied that, despite the mid-trial publicity, 
  the jury would decide this case based solely on the evidence adduced at trial. 
  It is implicit in his ruling that he determined that the mid-trial publicity 
  was not incurably prejudicial. The fact that he subsequently decided that it 
  was unnecessary to risk the possibility that the jury would misuse <em>admissible</em> 
  evidence of the murder conviction, does not undermine the correctness of his 
  original determination. I see no other basis for concluding that the trial judge 
  erred in his original assessment of the prejudicial effect of the mid-trial 
  publicity. </p>
<p>
  [63] Third, in my view, the trial judge gave the jury a clear sharp warning 
  that was appropriate in the circumstances. Because not all of the jurors had 
  learned of Kinkead's previous murder conviction, it was necessary that the trial 
  judge walk a fine line between cautioning those who had, to disregard it; and 
  not drawing unnecessary attention to the problem, for those who had not. I see 
  no basis for concluding that the trial judge's instruction was not specific 
  enough. It would have been obvious to any juror who had learned of Kinkead's 
  prior conviction that the trial judge's instruction was directed to that aspect 
  of the mid-trial publicity. My conclusion is reinforced by the fact that defence 
  counsel at trial did not object to the instructions that were given or request 
  that they be clarified.</p>
<p>
  [64] Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p> <strong>ii) Did The Trial Judge Err By Admitting The Discreditable Conduct 
  Evidence And By Failing To Give The Jury Proper Instructions Concerning The 
  Use Of Such Evidence?</strong></p>
<strong><p class="indent">a) The evidence of discreditable conduct</p>
</strong><p>
  [65] Mindy Daniel, a former girlfriend of Kinkead, testified about his habit, 
  in the past, of carrying a knife. She said that in 1993, Kinkead had a &quot;folding 
  knife&#133;silver blade, black handle. He was sharpening it all the time&quot;. 
  She testified that he had this knife during the first six months of their relationship 
  but that &quot;after about six months time he didn't have it anymore&quot;. 
  After that, he had one more knife that &quot;was like a kitchen knife. It was 
  kind of big.&quot; She said she threw that knife away and that she did not see 
  him with any knife after that. Their relationship ended around April 1995.</p>
<p>
  [66] Another witness, Melissa Burey, said that she had been a friend of Marsha 
  and Ranger, and an acquaintance of Kinkead. She acknowledged that, at one time, 
  there was an attraction between her and Kinkead and that they had kissed on 
  one occasion. At some point, she no longer wanted anything to do with either 
  Kinkead or Ranger. She described an incident around Christmas 1992, when Kinkead 
  and Ranger came to the school cafeteria. She said that Kinkead tried to talk 
  to her. She told him to leave her alone. While Ranger was present, Kinkead &quot;began 
  to get very upset, he began to start swearing&#133;he snapped and then all of 
  a sudden he pulled out a knife from his waist and started to come toward me&quot;. 
  She described the balance of the incident as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Kinkead] takes out the knife and he's running towards me saying, I could kill 
  you. I could kill-you're dead. You're dead. I said, &quot;[o]kay, fine&quot;&#133;I 
  wasn't planning to move, and my girlfriends, they were saying, &quot;[n]o Melissa. 
  He's going to kill you&quot;.</p>
<p>She described the knife as having a &quot;black handle&#133;about two to four 
  inches long&#133;[a]bout two inches wide&quot;. She did not know whether it 
  was a folding knife.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> b) The trial judge's ruling on the admissibility of the discreditable 
  conduct evidence</p>
</strong><p>[67] The trial judge articulated three bases for admitting the evidence of 
  Daniel and Burey concerning Kinkead's habit, in the past, of carrying a knife 
  and concerning the death threat incident: first, to demonstrate the likelihood 
  that Kinkead possessed the necessary &quot;tool&quot; for committing the crime, 
  second, to show Ranger's state of mind, namely that he knew the type of person 
  with whom he was associating, and third, to rebut the defence of innocent association. 
  The trial judge stated his conclusions as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The relevant issues this evidence is said to address in this trial are: </p>
<p class="indent"> One, that Mr. Kinkead possessed the tool necessary to commit 
  the crime that he is charged with. In this regard, it is said it will assist 
  in showing that he either provided the knife to Rohan Ranger or used it himself 
  in the killings;</p>
<p class="indent">Two, the relationship will go to show the state of mind of Ranger; 
  that he was aware of who he was involving himself with in these killings. Further, 
  it will rebut the defence of innocent association&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">[&#133;]</p>
<p class="indent">The strength of the evidence, in my view, is quite helpful to 
  supporting the facts in issue; namely, to rebut innocent association and who 
  wielded the knife which, in my view, are highly central issues. Overall, the 
  evidence is not highly discreditable and does not of itself infer guilt based 
  solely on this evidence. </p>
<p class="indent">And finally, the evidence will not confuse issues in my mind. 
  Rather, it will assist the jury in clarifying them. </p>
<p class="indent">Second, while the evidence may be in some way prejudicial, although 
  I find, if it is, it is minimal, it is far outweighed by its probative value. 
</p>
<p class="indent">And third, given the admissions that the jury has been made 
  aware of, especially that Mr. Kinkead's testimony at the Ranger trial that &quot;implies 
  that Ranger was the sole killer of both Marsha and Tammy&quot;, the Crown ought 
  to be and is granted leave to tender this evidence. </p>
<p class="indent">I rely on <em>R. v. Parsons</em>, specifically at page 238 for 
  that principle. Remoteness, I find, is not a relevant issue. I agree with the 
  Crown's submission; that is the evidence is more in the nature of habit or tendency 
  rather than one characterized as remote.</p>
<strong><p class="indent">c) Kinkead's submissions concerning the admissibility of the 
  discreditable conduct evidence</p>
</strong> 
<p>[68] While acknowledging that a ruling concerning the admissibility of discreditable 
  conduct evidence involves the exercise of discretion, Kinkead submits that the 
  trial judge erred in principle when weighing the probative value of the discreditable 
  conduct evidence against its potential prejudicial effect. In particular, he 
  claims that the trial judge overestimated the probative value of the impugned 
  evidence and failed entirely to appreciate its significant potential prejudice. 
  In addition, Kinkead submits that the trial judge erred by applying <em>R. v. 
  Parsons</em><a href="#10">[10]</a><a name="r10"></a> to the circumstances of 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  [69] As a starting point, Kinkead contends that the impugned evidence had little 
  probative value. He points out that there was evidence before the jury that 
  the murder weapon was a common type of knife. Accordingly, testimony that he 
  once possessed a similar knife, and that Ranger was aware of this, contributed 
  little to proving that he was carrying such a knife on the day of the murders. 
  Similarly, Kinkead contends that evidence that he experienced violent rage as 
  the result of a relatively minor incident added little to proving that he would 
  commit a planned and deliberate murder.</p>
<p>
  [70] More significantly, Kinkead submits that the trial judge failed to recognize 
  that the inferences that the Crown argued should be drawn from the discreditable 
  conduct evidence required impermissible propensity reasoning. Kinkead contends 
  that Daniel's evidence suggested that he was pathologically obsessed with knives, 
  and that the real purpose of her evidence was to suggest that he was a dangerous 
  man, and therefore the type of person who would bring a knife to the Ottey residence 
  to assist in a murder. Similarly, the suggestion that Ranger recruited him based 
  on his conduct towards Burey required reasoning that Ranger viewed him as a 
  dangerous man. Kinkead submits that the trial judge erred in principle by failing 
  to recognize the impermissible reasoning inherent in the proposed use of the 
  evidence and the significant prejudice arising from such use.</p>
<p> [71] As for the <em>Parsons</em> issue, Kinkead submits that that decision 
  does not apply to this case because he did not call evidence putting his character 
  in issue.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong> d) Discussion regarding the admissibility of the discreditable 
  conduct evidence</strong></p>
<p>[72] I do not accept Kinkead's submissions. </p>
<p>
  [73] In my view, they ignore the basic premise that discreditable conduct evidence 
  is, by its very nature, propensity evidence, and that prejudice arises, not 
  from its use as such, but from its lack of cogency in particular circumstances. 
</p>
<p> [74] In <em>R. v. Handy</em><a href="#11">[11]</a>,<a name="r11"></a> Binnie 
  J. explained the essential character of discreditable conduct evidence as follows: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> It is occasionally suggested that once the similar fact evidence 
  is related to an issue other than &quot;mere&quot; disposition, it somehow ceases 
  to be propensity evidence. I do not think this is true.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the virtues of <em>B. (C.R.)</em> is its candid acknowledgment 
  that &quot;evidence of propensity, while generally inadmissible, may exceptionally 
  be admitted&quot; to help establish that the accused did or did not do the act 
  in question (at pp. 731-32): </p>
<p class="indent10"> While the language of some of the assertions of the exclusionary 
  rule admittedly might be taken to suggest that mere disposition evidence can 
  <span class="underline">never</span> be admissible, the preponderant view prevailing 
  in Canada is the view taken by the majority in Boardman---evidence of propensity, 
  while generally inadmissible, may exceptionally be admitted where the probative 
  value of the evidence in relation to an issue in question is so high that it 
  displaces the heavy prejudice which will inevitably inure to the accused where 
  evidence of prior immoral or illegal acts is presented to the jury. [Emphasis 
  in original.]</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, while identification of the issue defines the 
  precise purpose for which the evidence is proffered, it does not (and cannot) 
  change the inherent nature of the propensity evidence, which must be recognized 
  for what it is. By affirming its true character, in my view, the Court keeps 
  front and centre its dangerous potential.</p>
<p class="indent">I refer again to <em>Arp,</em> supra, where Cory J., for the 
  Court, reaffirmed the proposition that in exceptional circumstances propensity 
  evidence is admissible, at para. 40 [emphasis in original]: </p>
<p class="indent10">Thus evidence of propensity or disposition may be relevant 
  to the crime charged, but it is <span class="underline">usually</span> inadmissible 
  because its slight probative value is ultimately outweighed by its highly prejudicial 
  effect. [Emphasis added in <em>Handy</em>.]</p>
<p class="indent">While Cory J. rested admissibility on the improbability of coincidence 
  (paras. 43 and 45), this does not in my view detract from his recognition that 
  the underlying reasoning was through propensity. When similar facts are attributed 
  to an accused acting &quot;in character&quot;, it is the inferred continuity 
  of character and nothing else that displaces what might otherwise be explained 
  innocently as mere &quot;coincidence&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent">I emphasize the reference in <em>Arp</em> to &quot;usually inadmissible&quot;. 
  Cory J. recognized, as did McLachlin J. in <em>B. (C.R.), supra,</em> that disposition 
  evidence could <span class="underline">unusually</span> and exceptionally be 
  admitted if it survives the rigours of balancing probative value against prejudice. 
  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
<p>[75] Binnie J. also explained that prejudice relating to the admission of discreditable 
  conduct evidence arises in two forms, namely, moral prejudice (&quot;the potential 
  stigma of bad personhood&quot;) and reasoning prejudice (&quot;including potential 
  confusion and distraction of the jury from the actual charge against the respondent&quot;)<a href="#12">[12]</a>.<a name="r12"></a></p>
<p>
  [76] In this case, in my view, the trial judge correctly identified possession 
  of the murder weapon and the possible motive for Kinkead's presence at the Ottey 
  home as the issues at the trial to which the impugned evidence was relevant 
  and he did not err in finding that the impugned evidence had some probative 
  value to these issues. In the event the jury were to find that Kinkead was present 
  in the Ottey home at the time of the murders, Daniel's evidence that Kinkead 
  had a habit of carrying a knife similar to the murder weapon(s) would have some 
  probative value on the issue of whether Kinkead possessed or supplied the murder 
  weapon. Further, the fact that Ranger was present when Kinkead used a knife 
  to threaten Burey (and was therefore aware of Kinkead's potential for violent 
  behaviour) added some credence to the likelihood that Ranger recruited Kinkead 
  to assist him in committing murder and therefore to the likelihood that, if 
  Kinkead was present at the murder scene, it was not for an innocent purpose 
  but rather because Ranger had recruited him. </p>
<p> [77] I specifically reject Kinkead's submissions that using the discreditable 
  conduct evidence to draw the inferences requested by the Crown required impermissible 
  reasoning. As was pointed out in<em> Handy</em>, where discreditable conduct 
  evidence is relevant to and probative of specific inferences relating to live 
  issues at the trial, the fact that the probative value of the evidence arises 
  from propensity reasoning does not, in itself, make the evidence inadmissible.</p>
<p>
  [78] In my view, there can be no real issue that Daniel's evidence was relevant 
  to a live issue at the trial, namely, whether Kinkead possessed or supplied 
  the murder weapon. </p>
<p>
  [79] As for Burey's evidence, the theory of the Crown was that Ranger had recruited 
  Kinkead to assist him with Marsha's murder. It was admitted that Ranger was 
  involved in the killings and that he (Kinkead) had testified at Ranger's trial 
  in a manner that implied that Ranger was the sole killer. At the point in the 
  trial when the impugned evidence was admitted, Kinkead had mounted a formidable 
  attack on the DNA evidence presented by the Crown potentially linking him to 
  the killings. He had also underlined, in cross-examination of Crown witnesses, 
  Ranger's abusive and threatening conduct towards Marsha. Those factors, combined 
  with Kinkead's admission implying that Ranger was the sole killer, made it likely 
  that Kinkead would assert either that he was not at the Ottey home at the time 
  of the killings, or, if he was at the Ottey home, that he was there for an innocent 
  purpose. The likelihood that Ranger recruited Kinkead to assist him in committing 
  murder was relevant to both issues and therefore, was very much a live issue 
  at the trial. </p>
<p> [80] Moreover, I reject Kinkead's suggestion that the impugned evidence carried 
  <em>significant</em> potential prejudice. The risk of reasoning prejudice was 
  minimal. The evidence was straightforward and unlikely to confuse the jury or 
  consume an inordinate amount of time. </p>
<p>
  [81] The risk of moral prejudice was also limited. As noted by the trial judge, 
  none of the impugned evidence was &quot;highly discreditable&quot;. In the context 
  of a murder trial, there was little risk that the jury would convict Kinkead 
  to punish him for his past conduct of carrying a knife, sharpening it regularly, 
  and, on one occasion, threatening Burey. Nor, in my view, is it likely that 
  the jury would have used the evidence that Kinkead carried a knife and sharpened 
  it regularly to conclude that he was the type of person who would commit a planned 
  and deliberate murder. </p>
<p>
  [82] Similarly, it is not likely that the jury would have used Burey's evidence 
  that, on one occasion, Kinkead &quot;snapped&quot;, threatened her with a knife, 
  and then subsequently apologized, standing on its own, to draw that inference. 
  Rather, the probative force of the discreditable conduct evidence arose from 
  Kinkead's connection to Ranger, from Ranger's presence during the incident that 
  Burey described, and from the likelihood that, if Kinkead was at the house, 
  it was because Ranger had recruited him. </p>
<p> [83] The trial judge made specific findings that the impugned evidence was 
  not highly discreditable and that it did not &quot;of itself infer guilt&quot;. 
  He concluded that Daniel's evidence that Kinkead had a habit, in the past, of 
  carrying a knife similar to the murder weapon(s) had sufficient probative value 
  on the issue of whether Kinkead possessed or supplied the murder weapon to justify 
  its admission. The trial judge also concluded that Burey's evidence that Ranger 
  was aware of Kinkead's threatening conduct was sufficiently probative of the 
  specific inference that Ranger recruited Kinkead to warrant its admission. None 
  of these findings is unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [84] In the circumstances, I see no basis for second guessing the trial judge's 
  assessment of probative value versus prejudicial effect.</p>
<p> [85] Finally, I am not persuaded that the trial judge's reference to <em>Parsons</em> 
  amounted to an error in principle. As I read his reasons, the trial judge did 
  not permit the Crown to lead evidence of discreditable conduct because he found 
  that Kinkead had placed his character in issue, and therefore had opened the 
  door to the Crown leading character evidence against him in response. Rather, 
  the reference reflected the trial judge's understanding that, in the event the 
  jury found that Kinkead was present at the Ottey home close to the time of the 
  murders, having asserted that Ranger was the killer, Kinkead's position would 
  be that he was there for an innocent purpose. The discreditable conduct evidence 
  bore on the reason for Kinkead's presence and not on his character generally. 
  The trial judge's reference to <em>Parsons</em> dovetailed into his analysis 
  of the relevance of the discreditable conduct evidence. Although perhaps somewhat 
  misplaced, I do not view the reference as being an error in principle. </p>
<p>
  [86] Absent an error in principle, the trial judge's decision concerning the 
  admissibility of evidence of other discreditable conduct is entitled to deference. 
  In this case, I see no basis for concluding that the trial judge erred in concluding 
  that the probative value of the impugned evidence outweighed its prejudicial 
  effect. I would not give effect to the objection that the discreditable conduct 
  evidence was not admissible.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> e) Kinkead's submissions on the jury instructions about the 
  discreditable conduct evidence </p>
</strong><p>[87] Kinkead submits that the trial judge erred by failing to explain clearly 
  the permissible use of the evidence of other discreditable conduct and thereby 
  exacerbating the risk that the jury would engage in impermissible propensity 
  reasoning.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> f) The jury instructions about the discreditable conduct evidence 
</p>
</strong><p>
  [88] The trial judge's jury instructions concerning the evidence of other discreditable 
  conduct included the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Now, you will recall that the Crown presented evidence about 
  other incidents allegedly involving Mr. Kinkead. This evidence was admitted 
  for the purpose of assisting the Crown in proving the issues of Rohan Ranger's 
  state of mind, innocent association between Mr. Kinkead and Ranger, and pattern 
  of conduct by Mr. Kinkead&#133;You can &#133;only use this evidence for the 
  purpose of deciding whether or not the Crown has proved those particular issues. 
</p>
<p class="indent"><em>When examining that evidence, you cannot conclude that Mr. 
  Kinkead is a criminal sort of person and that, therefore, he probably committed 
  the offences charged in the indictment</em>. It is up to you as the judges of 
  the facts to decide whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  Mr. Kinkead did the things described in the evidence. If you are satisfied that 
  the Crown has proven the facts, you will then go on and decide whether you should 
  make the inference that the Crown urges you to make; namely, that Mr. Kinkead 
  is the person who committed the acts in the manner stated in the evidence. This 
  evidence, if you find it to be the case may be used to show that Mr. Kinkead 
  did the things alleged; that he probably committed the offences he is presently 
  being charged for. </p>
<p class="indent">You may, however, infer from the evidence, if you believe it, 
  that the characteristics of the offences with which Mr. Kinkead is charged are 
  likely to have been committed by the same person. You may draw that inference 
  or you may not. It is like all other facts and inferences - it is for you and 
  you alone to decide.</p>
<p class="indent">This evidence was put in, as I said, in part, on the issue of 
  Ranger's state of mind prior to the killings. That is, the Crown submits that 
  Ranger knew that Mr. Kinkead was a person, based upon his past, prior conduct, 
  that would assist him in his crimes against Marsha and Tammy Ottey. As well, 
  the Crown asks you to take from this evidence that Mr. Kinkead was not merely 
  an innocent associate while with Ranger in the Ottey residence at the time of 
  the killings. The Crown submits that it assists in proving that Mr. Kinkead 
  was the person who committed the offences he is now standing trial for. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;as I said at the outset, <em>you must not, and I emphasize 
  must not, use this evidence to conclude that just because Mr. Kinkead may have 
  done other things that are wrong, he therefore committed the acts giving rise 
  to this trial</em> &#133; you cannot use the evidence of discreditable activities 
  alleged on the part of Mr. Kinkead, if you find that he engaged in them, at 
  arriving at your decision in the charges in the indictment. </p>
<p class="indent">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>g) Discussion regarding the jury instructions about 
  the discreditable conduct evidence</strong></p>
<p>[89] Although I agree that the trial judge's instructions could have been clearer, 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal for three reasons. </p>
<p>
  [90] First, the emphasized portions of the instructions demonstrate that the 
  trial judge instructed the jury clearly that they must not use the evidence 
  of discreditable conduct to conclude that Kinkead was guilty of murdering Marsha 
  and Tamara because of his past conduct. </p>
<p>
  [91] Second, I have already concluded that the discreditable conduct evidence 
  did not create a significant risk of prejudice. </p>
<p>
  [92] Third, the trial judge's instructions concerning how the jury could use 
  the evidence did not steer the jury in the direction of using the evidence for 
  an impermissible purpose. Accordingly, although the jury instructions concerning 
  the proper use of the evidence might have been clearer, I do not consider that 
  the lack of clarity operated in a manner that was prejudicial to Kinkead. </p>
<p> <strong>iii) Did The Trial Judge Err By Ruling That The Crown Could Use Kinkead's 
  Compelled Testimony At Ranger's Trial For Purposes Of Cross-Examination?</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>a) Background</strong></p>
<p>
  [93] Before deciding whether to testify, Kinkead asked for an advance ruling 
  precluding the Crown from using his compelled testimony at Ranger's trial to 
  test his credibility in cross-examination. </p>
<p>
  [94] The gist of Kinkead's evidence at Ranger's trial was that, after planning 
  a surprise outing for Marsha with Tamara (with whom Kinkead claimed he was romantically 
  linked), he went to the Ottey home on the morning of August 16, 1995 to await 
  Ranger's arrival. After Ranger arrived, he and Marsha went to the basement. 
  Shortly thereafter, Kinkead and Tamara heard loud noises coming from the basement. 
  They went downstairs to investigate and saw Ranger sitting on Marsha and holding 
  a knife. Tamara hyperventilated and collapsed. Kinkead tried to calm Ranger 
  down, but Marsha began thrashing and punching, hitting Kinkead as she did so. 
  Kinkead said that he fled after Ranger threatened him with the knife.</p>
<p>
  [95] The Crown obtained a ruling at Ranger's trial permitting it to treat Kinkead 
  as an adverse witness. Accordingly, in addition to asking questions in the manner 
  of examination-in-chief, the Crown cross-examined Kinkead on the statements 
  he made following his arrest, at least one of which was a confession. In his 
  evidence at Ranger's trial, Kinkead asserted that much of what he said in the 
  statements was untrue, explaining that the police had coerced him and that he 
  told the police what he thought they wanted to hear. </p>
<p> [96] In requesting a ruling precluding the Crown from cross-examining him 
  on this previous testimony, Kinkead relied on both ss. 7 and 13 of the <em>Charter</em><a href="#13">[13]</a>.<a name="r13"></a> 
  He submitted that where an accused person is compelled to testify at the trial 
  of a co-accused, the accused person's right to silence is violated and that 
  the protection afforded by s. 7 operates to exclude the use of what is effectively 
  derivative evidence at the accused person's subsequent trial.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> b) The trial judge's ruling regarding the use of Kinkead's 
  compelled testimony at Ranger's trial</p>
</strong>
<p>[97] The trial judge ruled that Kinkead could be cross-examined on his prior 
  testimony &quot;if it is appropriate &#133; and for the purposes set out in 
  <em>Kuldip</em>&quot;. The crux of his ruling is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Kinkead's rights arise on this issue exclusively out of 
  s. 13 of the Charter. &#133;<em>Kuldip</em> is the leading authority in that 
  regard and for those reasons and the reasons which I may expand upon later, 
  I am satisfied that the Crown can confront Mr. Kinkead with his previous testimony 
  if it is appropriate and if Mr. Kinkead chooses to give evidence in this trial 
  and for the purposes set out in <em>Kuldip</em>; namely, to impeach his credibility.</p>
<strong><p class="indent">c) Kinkead's submissions </p>
</strong> 
<p>[98] The trial judge's ruling preceded the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions 
  in <em>R. v. Noel</em><a href="#14">[14]</a><a name="r14"></a> and <em>R. v. 
  Allen</em> <a href="#15">[15]</a>.<a name="r15"></a> On appeal, Kinkead submits 
  that, although Noel confirms that <em>R. v. Kuldip</em><a href="#16">[16]</a><a name="r16"></a> 
  is still good law, it circumscribes the application of Kuldip by clarifying 
  that an accused person's previous testimony may only be used for impeachment 
  purposes at a subsequent trial where &quot;the trial judge is satisfied that 
  there is no realistic danger that his prior testimony could be used to incriminate 
  him&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [99] Kinkead submits that the trial judge erred in failing to recognize that 
  his prior testimony could not meet the Noel threshold because of its inherent 
  character as incriminating evidence. He contends that his prior testimony is 
  inherently incriminating because it places him at the murder scene in close 
  proximity to the time of the murders whereas, in his closing to the jury, his 
  counsel asserted that the Crown had not established that he was at the Ottey 
  residence when the murders occurred. As he puts it, the trial judge erred in 
  failing to recognize that the bulk of his prior testimony &quot;was off the 
  table&quot; from the outset.</p>
<p> [100] In addition, Kinkead submits that the trial judge contravened the principles 
  enunciated in <em>R. v. Underwood</em><a href="#17">[17]</a><a name="r17"></a> 
  when he ruled that the Crown could confront him with his prior testimony &quot;if 
  &#133; appropriate&quot;. In Underwood, the Supreme Court of Canada held that 
  an accused person is entitled to know if the Crown will be entitled to cross-examine 
  him on his criminal record before he decides whether to call a defence. Here, 
  Kinkead contends that the trial judge erred by forcing him to decide whether 
  to testify before the trial judge made a definitive ruling concerning whether 
  his prior testimony could be used for purposes of cross-examination.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> d) Discussion regarding the trial judge's ruling that the Crown 
  could use Kinkead's compelled testimony at Ranger's trial for purposes of cross-examination</p>
</strong><p>
  [101] I conclude that Kinkead has not demonstrated that the trial judge erred 
  in his ruling for three reasons. </p>
<p> [102] First, although I agree that Noel circumscribes <em>Kuldip</em> by clarifying 
  that an accused person's previous testimony may only be used for impeachment 
  purposes at a subsequent trial where &quot;the trial judge is satisfied that 
  there is no realistic danger that his prior testimony could be used to incriminate 
  him&quot;, I do not agree that <em>Noel</em> stands for the proposition that 
  a particular class of prior testimony will <em>always</em> be excluded from 
  use, or that Kinkead's prior testimony fits within the class of prior testimony 
  that will <em>likely</em> be excluded from use. </p>
<p> [103] In <em>Noel</em>, Arbour J. stated her overall conclusion concerning 
  the use of prior testimony for purposes of cross-examination as follows (at 
  para. 4): </p>
<p class="indent"> When an accused testifies at trial, he cannot be cross-examined 
  on the basis of a prior testimony unless the trial judge is satisfied that there 
  is no realistic danger that his prior testimony could be used to incriminate 
  him. <em>The danger of incrimination will vary with the nature of the prior 
  evidence and the circumstances of the case</em> including the efficacy of an 
  adequate instruction to the jury. [Emphasis added]</p>
<p>[104] However, Arbour J. went on to draw a distinction between prior testimony 
  that was incriminating at the time it was given and prior testimony that was 
  innocuous at the time it was given. In particular, she noted that because an 
  accused person's prior inconsistent statements can be used to prove the truth 
  of their content, there is a serious problem in giving a jury clear instructions 
  to ensure that they do not use prior incriminating testimony for the purpose 
  of incrimination. She said that, in many instances, it is simply not realistic 
  to expect a jury to restrict its use of prior incriminating testimony to evaluating 
  credibility. Accordingly, she concluded cross-examination on prior testimony 
  that was incriminating at the time it was given will likely be prohibited. </p>
<p> [105] On the other hand, prior testimony that was innocuous at the time it 
  was given does not begin with the same difficulty. Although it must meet the 
  same threshold for admissibility, clearly the evidence must be examined in context 
  to determine whether it falls within the parameters of <em>Kuldip</em>. </p>
<p>
  [106] In this case, in my view, Kinkead's prior testimony does not fall within 
  the category of testimony that was incriminating at the time it was given. In 
  his testimony at Ranger's trial, Kinkead acknowledged that he was at the Ottey 
  home around the time of the murders, but claimed that he was there for an innocent 
  purpose and that he was no longer there at the time the murders occurred. Viewed 
  in context, Kinkead's testimony at Ranger's trial placing him at the murder 
  scene close to the time of the killings was not incriminating at the time it 
  was given and therefore does not fall within the class of prior testimony with 
  respect to which cross-examination will likely be prohibited.</p>
<p> [107] Second, as a matter of logic, with respect to evidence that was not 
  incriminating at the time it was given, a decision concerning whether the <em>Noel</em> 
  test has been met should only be made based on an accused person's testimony, 
  or anticipated testimony, and not, on appeal, based on the closing submissions 
  of an accused person who did not testify. In this case, when Kinkead applied 
  for a ruling prohibiting the Crown from cross-examining him on his testimony 
  at Ranger's trial, he did not provide the trial judge with any indication of 
  the content of his anticipated evidence. In my view, this factor, standing alone, 
  precludes Kinkead from succeeding on this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> [108] The Crown concedes that if Kinkead had testified at trial that he was 
  not at the Ottey residence on the morning of August 16, 1995, using his testimony 
  from the Ranger trial to contradict him on that issue would have violated s. 
  13 of the <em>Charter<a href="#18"></a></em><a href="#18">[18]</a>.<a name="r18"></a> 
  However, the fact that Kinkead ultimately took the position, in closing submissions, 
  that the Crown had not established that he was at the Ottey home that morning 
  does not mean that he would have testified to that effect. </p>
<p>
  [109] An accused person who testifies may, in the course of giving exculpatory 
  evidence, provide evidence that establishes some of the facts that the Crown 
  would otherwise be required to prove. In such circumstances, the accused will 
  not be able to make closing submissions that the Crown has failed to prove those 
  facts. However, an accused person who chooses not to testify is not subject 
  to the same limitation; he is free to make closing submissions that the Crown 
  has failed to prove relevant facts, even if his evidence would have established 
  those facts had he testified. </p>
<p>
  [110] Viewed in this light, the fact that Kinkead ultimately took the position 
  that the Crown had not established that he was at the Ottey home on the morning 
  of August 16, 1995 is irrelevant to assessing whether the Crown should have 
  been permitted to cross-examine him at his trial with respect to his testimony 
  at Ranger's trial. What is relevant and necessary to the assessment, is the 
  actual testimony of the accused person, or, at the very least, his anticipated 
  testimony. </p>
<p> [111] Third, since Kinkead applied for an advance ruling that the Crown be 
  precluded from using his prior testimony for purposes of cross-examination, 
  but did not disclose the substance of his proposed testimony, either at trial 
  or by way of fresh evidence on appeal, I see no basis for finding that the trial 
  judge contravened the principles in <em>Underwood</em>. </p>
<p> [112]<em> Underwood</em> contemplates defence disclosure as a precursor to 
  an advance ruling on a <em>Corbett</em> application. Lamer C.J.C. explains (at 
  paras. 8-10) that a <em>voir dire</em> may be held at the conclusion of the 
  Crown's case so that the defence can reveal its proposed evidence. The purpose 
  of the <em>voir dire</em> is not to give the Crown advance notice of the defence 
  or to afford the Crown a right of advance cross-examination. Rather, it is &quot;to 
  provide the trial judge with the information he or she needs to make an informed 
  decision&quot;. Although Lamer C.J.C. also commented that there may be cases 
  in which the trial judge believes he or she has sufficient information to make 
  a decision without such disclosure, in my view, this is not one of those cases 
  for two reasons.</p>
<p> [113] First, as a general matter, the nature of the issues on a Noel application 
  may very well require more precise advance disclosure than the issues in play 
  on a <em>Corbett</em> application, which was the subject in <em>Underwood</em>. 
  As pointed out in <em>Underwood</em>, one of the purposes of advance disclosure 
  is to avoid the potential unfairness of having the accused take the stand in 
  reliance on a ruling, only to have the ruling reversed because of new information. 
  Because a Noel ruling is so closely related to the actual evidence, a decision 
  to give an advance ruling without defence disclosure should be made with considerable 
  caution. </p>
<p>
  [114] Second, in my view, the fact that Kinkead attacked the accuracy of the 
  DNA evidence at his trial does not make it self-evident that, had he testified, 
  he would have departed from his testimony at the Ranger trial. While his attack 
  on the DNA evidence no doubt opened the door to a departure from his prior testimony, 
  I see nothing inconsistent in Kinkead challenging the DNA evidence but giving 
  evidence in substantial conformity with his previous testimony.</p>
<p>
  [115] In my view, without knowing the substance of Kinkead's proposed testimony, 
  neither the trial judge nor this court is in a position to say whether the Crown 
  should have been entitled to use Kinkead's prior testimony for the purposes 
  of cross-examination. </p>
<p>
  [116] Finally, I note that this conclusion does not violate the right to silence. 
  As Kinkead was seeking an advance ruling, he bore the onus of demonstrating 
  that he was entitled to the relief that he sought, and therefore the tactical 
  burden of disclosing his proposed testimony to permit a proper decision to be 
  made. </p>
<p>
  [117] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p> <strong>iv) Did The Trial Judge Err In His Instructions To The Jury Concerning 
  Evidence Of Post-Offence Conduct? </strong></p>
<strong><p class="indent">a) Background</p>
</strong><p>
  [118] Police followed Ranger continuously for several days after the killings 
  and then intermittently. They saw no sign of Kinkead until the afternoon of 
  October 25, 1995, when they saw Ranger meet Kinkead at a Scarborough park. Kinkead's 
  girlfriend at the time of the murders, Nadecai Phillip, was also present. </p>
<p>
  [119] Police videotaped portions of the October 25 meeting. The Crown played 
  the videotape for the jury, and one of the surveillance officers testified about 
  the events. According to that officer's testimony, after arriving at the park 
  in separate vehicles, Kinkead and Ranger embraced and then walked to a hilly, 
  forested area. Approximately forty minutes later, the two men emerged from the 
  forested area and returned to their vehicles where Kinkead wrote something into 
  a daily planner. Kinkead then looked at a large road atlas with Ranger, the 
  two men embraced and then parted.</p>
<p>
  [120] Phillip also testified. She said that she stopped seeing Kinkead sometime 
  around October or November 1995. In late October 1995, she drove to Florida 
  with her son and rented a car for the trip. Phillip confirmed that, on October 
  25, 1995, she drove Kinkead to the Scarborough park where he met Ranger. She 
  said that before going to the park, she and Kinkead drove around a nearby neighbourhood 
  looking for Ranger's house. They passed the house but did not go in. </p>
<p>
  [121] Phillip left for Florida a day or two after the meeting in the park. She 
  returned to Ontario in early November, and then, about a month later, flew back 
  to Florida and began working at a club. Phillip linked up with Kinkead when 
  she returned to Florida and he lived with her there for some period. She said 
  that on one occasion, she and Kinkead drove to Ranger's parents' home in Fort 
  Lauderdale, where Kinkead met with Ranger.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> b) The defence position at trial</p>
</strong><p>
  [122] At trial, defence counsel's primary objection related to the admissibility 
  of the evidence that Kinkead went to Florida. He submitted that the evidence 
  had no probative value as evidence of post-offence flight in relation to the 
  Ottey murders because of the amount of time that had elapsed since those murders 
  and its proximity to the Trajceski murder. On the other hand, he contended that 
  the evidence had significant potential prejudice because of the risk that it, 
  and the date of the meeting in the Scarborough park, would trigger the jury's 
  memory concerning the Trajceski murder.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> c) The Crown position at trial</p>
</strong><p>[123] The Crown contended that the post-offence conduct evidence was admissible 
  because it dovetailed into other evidence showing the pattern of association 
  between Ranger and Kinkead and was therefore relevant to the issue of planning 
  and deliberation. Crown counsel confirmed that he was not asking, at that time, 
  that the trial judge charge the jury that the evidence demonstrated consciousness 
  of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [124] However, in his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel said the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;I have said to you earlier on in the general discussion 
  about planning and deliberation that it must precede forming the intent to commit 
  murder, or at least the murder itself. But you are entitled to use what's called 
  post-offence conduct. That is to say, if you are satisfied that Mr. Kinkead 
  participated in these killings, you are entitled to use the evidence &#133; 
  of what took place later than that to again circumstantially infer what the 
  state of mind was ahead of time.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, if there is what looks to be a whole plan afoot 
  of what to do after these killings, you are perfectly entitled to conclude that 
  that wasn't - did not just happen by accident.</p>
<p class="indent">[&#133;]</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;Well obviously they split up. Well, why would you split 
  up? Well, you would split up if you thought you had both been involved &#133; 
  and you did not want to be seen with each other. </p>
<p class="indent">Why do you think it is that those phone records and the evidence 
  &#133; all shows an association &#133; throughout the months June, July and 
  into August, and then &#133; there's no contact between them.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;you can, together with the other evidence, use that to 
  infer what their states of mind were before these murders and, if you are so 
  inclined, include that as part of planning and deliberation of these murders.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; </p>
<p class="indent">And indeed then, curiously enough, to go back to the surveillance 
  &#133; then they are suddenly not together &#133; for at least that period of 
  &#133; weeks for which Rohan Ranger is under 24 hour surveillance. Well why 
  would that be? <em>Well, one reason might be</em> the reason I articulated this 
  morning, <em>they don't want to be seen together</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;When you have, even as late as October, when you have 
  the meeting in the park, &#133; Miss Phillip says, we drove by but did not stop 
  at Mr. Ranger's house. Well, why would that be, do you suppose? Why would they 
  meet in a park? <em>What's this rendezvous if they're not afraid to be seen 
  together?</em> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">And then of course you've got them in the park in October and 
  the road map&#133; Miss Phillip said she did not drive them but that's for you 
  to figure out, but the point is she did say she meets him down there.</p>
<p class="indent">So however he got down there he got down there, and then they 
  meet up, she and Mr. Kinkead here, with Mr. Ranger&#133; So there's still further 
  evidence of their association during the months surrounding these homicides. 
  So it shows, as I say, continuous association between the person with the motive 
  to kill and the express threat to kill, the man I keep calling the man with 
  the plan, and this guy right here. The man who we know has a knife on him from 
  time-to-time.</p>
<p class="indent">[Emphasis added]</p>
<strong><p class="indent">d) The trial judge's instructions to the jury regarding the 
  evidence of post-offence conduct</p>
</strong><p>[125] The trial judge did not instruct the jury on whether the post-offence 
  conduct could give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt. Rather, he 
  told the jury that they could use the impugned evidence in relation to the issue 
  of planning and deliberation: </p>
<p class="indent"> You should also consider conduct during and even after the 
  time of the murders when considering the issues of whether the murders were 
  planned and deliberate&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">[&#133;]</p>
<p class="indent">And again, there is the confirmatory evidence of Nadecai Phillip-Hughes 
  who testified that Mr. Kinkead met up with Ranger in the park on October 25th 
  and together they examined a road map. She stated that Ranger and Mr. Kinkead 
  met up again several weeks later at Ranger's home in Florida. The police arrested 
  Mr. Kinkead in Florida in 1997.</p>
<strong><p class="indent">e) Kinkead's submissions on appeal</p>
</strong><p>
  [126] Kinkead's primary submission on appeal is that the trial judge erred by 
  failing to instruct the jury that the evidence had no probative value as post-offence 
  conduct capable of giving rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt and 
  by failing to explain adequately to the jury how the evidence was relevant to 
  planning and deliberation.</p>
<strong><p class="indent"> f) Discussion regarding the trial judge's instructions to the 
  jury concerning after-the-fact conduct</p>
</strong><p>[127] I reject Kinkead's submissions for four reasons.</p>
<p>
  [128] First, I conclude that Kinkead was not entitled to a &quot;no probative 
  value&quot; instruction in respect of the evidence of post-offence conduct and 
  its potential to support an inference of consciousness of guilt. Accordingly, 
  rather than being prejudicial, the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury 
  on that issue was at least neutral, and may have inured to Kinkead's benefit. 
</p>
<p>
  [129] In my view, the Crown could properly have asked the trial judge to instruct 
  the jury that they could use at least some of the evidence of post-offence conduct 
  to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt, namely, the evidence of the 
  hiatus in contact between the two men after August 16, 1995, and Phillip's evidence 
  that she and Kinkead drove by Ranger's house before the two men met in a park 
  (suggesting that there was a clandestine element to the meeting). In contrast 
  to the issue of flight, there is no indication that either of those factors 
  was related to the Trajceski murder. </p>
<p>
  [130] Although I read the highlighted portions of the Crown's closing address 
  as inviting the jury to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt based on 
  the two factors I have identified, I still conclude that the trial judge's failure 
  to give a post-offence conduct instruction relating to consciousness of guilt 
  was at least neutral to Kinkead. If the trial judge had instructed the jury 
  on post-offence conduct relating to consciousness of guilt, he would have explained 
  to the jury that they could only use the post-offence conduct evidence to draw 
  an inference of consciousness of guilt if they were satisfied that that was 
  the underlying basis for the conduct. While that instruction may have benefited 
  Kinkead in theory, on a practical level, the only alternate explanation in the 
  record for the hiatus in contact between the two men is a possible inference 
  that Kinkead did not want to be seen with Ranger because he knew what Ranger 
  had done.</p>
<p>
  [131] On the whole, given that the Crown's reference to this use of the evidence 
  was brief, that an instruction by the trial judge would have highlighted this 
  potential use of the evidence for the jury, and that the defence did not request 
  that the trial judge give an instruction, I conclude that the trial judge's 
  failure to give a post-offence conduct instruction relating to consciousness 
  of guilt was at least neutral to Kinkead. </p>
<p>
  [132] Second, I consider it unlikely that the jury would have used the evidence 
  of Kinkead going to Florida, standing alone, to draw an inference of consciousness 
  of guilt based on post-offence flight. There was no evidence or suggestion that 
  Kinkead left the jurisdiction until at least two months after the Ottey killings. 
  Similarly, there was no evidence that the police were investigating Kinkead 
  for the Ottey murders at the time he left for Florida or that there was any 
  basis for him to be concerned about that possibility. Finally, neither the Crown 
  nor the trial judge said anything to suggest that the jury could rely on the 
  evidence that Kinkead went to Florida as evidence of flight. In my view, the 
  more likely use of that evidence was that suggested by the trial judge, namely, 
  that the hiatus in contact, the October 25 meeting in the park, and the subsequent 
  rendezvous in Florida were part of an original plan and constituted evidence 
  of planning and deliberation.</p>
<p> [133] Third, while it may have been preferable for the trial judge to have 
  instructed the jury explicitly that they could only use the impugned evidence 
  as evidence of planning and deliberation if they were satisfied that it was 
  part of a plan preceding the murders, in my view, that requirement is implicit 
  in the trial judge's instruction that the evidence was relevant to the issue 
  of planning and deliberation. In addition, Crown counsel alluded to the requirement 
  in his closing<a href="#19">[19]</a>.<a name="r19"></a></p>
<p>
  [134] Fourth, defence counsel at trial did not request the instructions that 
  are suggested on appeal. That, in itself, reinforces my conclusion that, at 
  trial, the basis for using the impugned evidence as evidence of planning and 
  deliberation was obvious.</p>
<p>
  [135] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> <strong>IV. DISPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>
  [136] For the reasons given, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
