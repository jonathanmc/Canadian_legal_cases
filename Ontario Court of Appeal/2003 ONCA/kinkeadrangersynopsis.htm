<p class="center"><em> <strong>Synopsis of R. v. Rohan Ranger and R. v. Adrian 
  Kinkead</strong></em></p>

<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>Two sisters, Marsha and Tamara Ottey, were stabbed to death in their home in 
  Scarborough in the morning of August 16, 1995. Marsha Ottey's former boyfriend, 
  Rohan Ranger (&quot;Ranger&quot;) and Adrian Kinkead (&quot;Kinkead&quot;), 
  who is Ranger's cousin, were charged with the murders of Marsha and Tamara Ottey. 
</p>
<p>Following a jury trial, Ranger was convicted of first-degree murder in relation 
  to Marsha Ottey and of manslaughter in relation to Tamara Ottey. Kinkead was 
  tried by a separate judge and jury and was convicted of the first-degree murders 
  of Marsha and Tamara Ottey. Both men appealed their convictions. </p>
<p>A panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, composed of Justices Charron, Feldman 
  and Simmons, heard these two appeals sequentially from March 31 to April 2, 
  2003. In a judgment released today, the panel unanimously allowed Ranger's appeal 
  on the basis that the cumulative effect of the errors committed during Ranger's 
  trial by the trial judge rendered the trial unfair and requires that Ranger 
  be retried. In a separate judgment released today, the panel unanimously dismissed 
  Kinkead's appeal. </p>

<p> <em><strong>R. v. Rohan Ranger</strong></em></p>
<p>Ranger was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was tried by 
  a jury, with Justice Ewaschuk presiding. In June 1998, the jury found Ranger 
  guilty of the first-degree murder of Marsha Ottey and of manslaughter of Tamara 
  Ottey. The trial judge sentenced Ranger to life imprisonment on the murder conviction 
  and 15 years concurrent imprisonment on the manslaughter conviction. </p>

<p>
  Ranger appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeal. In his grounds of appeal, 
  Ranger alleged that the trial against him was unfair as a result of various 
  errors committed by the trial judge regarding the admission of evidence as well 
  as in the trial judge's final charge to the jury. Justice Charron wrote the 
  Court's reasons for judgment. The grounds of appeal that form the basis for 
  ordering the new trial and the reasons for judgment are briefly summarized below. 
  The court concluded that the cumulative effect of the errors requires a new 
  trial.</p>

      <p>Ranger argued that the trial judge erred in permitting a Crown witness 
        to give expert opinion evidence that the crime scene appeared to have 
        been staged to look as if there had been a burglary, and to testify about 
        the type of person likely to have committed the crime (namely, that the 
        perpetrator had staged the crime scene to divert attention from himself 
        and had a particular interest in Marsha Ottey). </p>
      <p>The court found no reason to interfere with the trial judge's decision 
        to allow the expert opinion testimony that the crime scene was staged. 
        The court concluded, however, that the trial judge erred in allowing the 
        police expert to testify about the perpetrator's likely motivation for 
        staging the crime scene and his characteristics as a person associated 
        with the victims and having a particular interest in Marsha Ottey. The 
        court characterized this latter evidence as criminal profiling evidence. 
        Criminal profiling is a novel field of scientific evidence, the reliability 
        of which was not demonstrated at trial. To the contrary, it would appear 
        from the witness' limited testimony about the available verification of 
        opinions in her field of work that her expert opinion amounted to no more 
        than educated guesses. Further, the criminal profiling evidence approached 
        the ultimate issue that the jury had to decide, and, hence, was highly 
        prejudicial. This prejudice was further heightened by the limits placed 
        on defence counsel's cross-examination of the expert witness and by the 
        prominence that the trial judge gave to her evidence in his charge</p>

      <p>Ranger argued that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of his 
        trip to Jamaica in January 1996 and the circumstances of his return to 
        Canada. </p>
      <p>The trial judge permitted the Crown to introduce evidence about Ranger's 
        trip to Jamaica and his overstay as evidence of flight from which the 
        jury could infer consciousness of guilt. The trial judge also permitted 
        the Crown to introduce evidence about Ranger's lawyer's discussions with 
        the police and about the hostile climate of the populace in Jamaica to 
        Ranger. The trial judge later reversed his ruling and ultimately told 
        the jury to disregard the Jamaica evidence on the issue of consciousness 
        of guilt. </p>
      <p>The court concluded that the Jamaica evidence was of no probative value 
        and highly prejudicial to Ranger. Based on the trial record, and as the 
        trial judge later ruled, the evidence could not reasonably support an 
        inference that Ranger, months after the event, had fled the jurisdiction. 
        It therefore should not have been admitted for that purpose. The court 
        also concluded that the jury might have inferred guilt from the highly 
        speculative evidence of Ranger's lawyer's discussions with the police, 
        particularly the suggestion that Ranger's father had contacted the lawyer 
        immediately after Kinkead's arrest because, as the Crown put it, &quot;everybody 
        seems to know of a connection between [Ranger] and Adrian Kinkead in terms 
        of the murders of these two young women.&quot; The court also concluded 
        that the evidence of the public animosity towards Ranger in Jamaica was 
        highly inflammatory and suggested that anyone who knew anything about 
        Ranger knew that he was responsible for the deaths of the Ottey sisters.</p>
      <p>The trial judge erred by permitting the Jamaica evidence to be called 
        in the first place, and having admitted it in, he erred in his instructions 
        to the jury on what use they could make of it. Although he did instruct 
        the jury to disregard the Jamaica evidence in regard to consciousness 
        of guilt at one point, he left it for their consideration in other parts 
        of his instructions and he failed to instruct the jury that they should 
        not consider this evidence for any purpose.</p>

      <p>Ranger argued that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury regarding 
        the Crown's mischaracterization of the evidence that he was at the Scarborough 
        Town Centre very shortly after the killings as a &quot;false alibi&quot;. 
      </p>
      <p>Ranger and a friend were captured on a security video camera at the Scarborough 
        Town Centre at 8:08 a.m. on August 16, 1995. Taken at its highest, this 
        would have left Ranger with between 16 and 26 minutes to enter the Ottey 
        house, stab each sister numerous times, ransack the house, clean himself 
        up, drive to the Scarborough Town Centre, park, and go to the area where 
        the camera was located. Ranger relied on this evidence as the centrepiece 
        of his defence, taking the position at trial that it established an exceptionally 
        small, if not non-existent window of opportunity for him to have killed 
        or helped to kill Marsha and Tamara Ottey. In his closing address to the 
        jury, the Crown relied extensively on the Scarborough Town Centre evidence 
        as evidence of a false alibi from which the jury could infer Ranger's 
        guilt. </p>
      <p>The Crown on appeal did not contend that there was any evidence to support 
        the suggestion that Ranger had deliberately tried to get himself filmed 
        in order to create a false alibi. The trial judge told the jury to disregard 
        the Crown's reference to a false alibi because Ranger was not relying 
        on the defence of alibi. However, the trial judge did not tell the jury 
        that the reference should be disregarded because there was no evidence 
        to support it. Further, in reading the instructions as a whole, the court 
        concluded that the jury could well have understood that they were entitled 
        to consider the alleged fabrication of an alibi in their deliberations. 
        The court agreed with Ranger's submissions that the Scarborough Town Centre 
        evidence provided a basis on which the jury could conclude that Ranger 
        did not have a reasonable opportunity to kill the Ottey sisters. The court 
        therefore concluded that the exculpatory value of this evidence was significantly 
        undermined by the Crown's unfounded speculation of false alibi and that 
        the trial judge's instructions failed to remove the prejudice created 
        by the Crown's false alibi submission to the jury. </p>

      <p>Ranger argued that the trial judge erred by charging the jury that he 
        could be found guilty even he was not present at the scene when Marsha 
        and Tamara Ottey were killed. </p>
      <p>The Crown's theory at trial was that Ranger was present when Marsha and 
        Tamara Ottey were killed. The trial judge's instructions to the jury left 
        it open to them to find Ranger guilty, even if they did not accept that 
        he was present at the time of the killings, if they were satisfied that 
        he somehow aided or abetted Kinkead in killing Marsha and Tamara Ottey.</p>
      <p>The court concluded that, in the particular circumstances of this trial, 
        it was reasonable for defence counsel to have understood from the various 
        discussions that preceded his closing jury address that the trial judge 
        would not charge the jury on this basis. Independent of any conclusions 
        as to whether the trial judge's instructions were correct in law and whether 
        they were supported by the evidence, in the context of this case, these 
        instructions effectively undermined the essence of the defence's position, 
        that is, that Ranger should be acquitted because the Crown failed to prove 
        that he was at the Ottey home in the early morning of August 16, 1995. 
        In these circumstances, it could not be said that Ranger was not materially 
        prejudiced by the trial judge's failure to notify counsel of his intention 
        to charge the jury on this additional theory of liability before counsel's 
        final submissions to the jury. </p>

      <p>Ranger argued that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury regarding 
        the identification evidence. </p>
      <p>The Crown called five witnesses who testified about having seen a man 
        in a walkway across the street from the Ottey home around 7:30 a.m. on 
        the days immediately preceding and on the morning that Marsha and Tamara 
        Ottey were killed. Two of those witnesses gave evidence directly implicating 
        Ranger as the person seen in the walkway.</p>
      <p>The court observed that it would be a critical finding against Ranger 
        if the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was in the 
        walkway across from the Ottey home, particularly on the morning of August 
        16. In these circumstances, it was essential that the trial judge instruct 
        the jury properly in connection with the identification evidence, most 
        particularly in connection with the evidence of the two witnesses who 
        directly implicated Ranger. However, the trial judge's instructions, when 
        considered as a whole and in the light of the Crown's closing submissions, 
        did not effectively convey to the jury the dangers of relying on the evidence 
        of the walkway witnesses. Rather, these instructions may have left the 
        jury with the impression that they could place greater weight on this 
        evidence than it reasonably deserved. First, the evidence of the two witnesses 
        who purported to identify Ranger had little, or no, probative value. One 
        witness had not only been unable to pick Ranger from a photo line-up shortly 
        after the events, but had picked out another person as the person he had 
        seen in the walkway. The other witness' identification of Ranger in a 
        photo line-up was equivocal and at trial, non-existent. Second, the trial 
        judge failed to instruct the jury that a witness' failure to identify 
        Ranger at trial was entitled to be given some weight. Third, the trial 
        judge failed to correct a misstatement of the evidence by the Crown regarding 
        a critical part of a witness' description of the person in the walkway. 
        Rather, the trial judge repeated this error in his charge. </p>

<p><em><strong>R. v. Adrian Kinkead</strong></em></p>
<p>Kinkead was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was tried by 
  a jury, with Justice LaForme presiding. In June 1999, the jury found Kinkead 
  guilty of both counts of first-degree murder. Justice LaForme sentenced Kinkead 
  to life imprisonment, without parole eligibility for 25 years. </p>
<p>Kinkead appealed his murder convictions to the Court of Appeal, claiming that 
  he was denied the right to a fair trial because of the errors made by the trial 
  judge. Justice Simmons wrote the Court's reasons for judgment dismissing Kinkead's 
  appeal. Kinkead's grounds of appeal, and the reasons for dismissing these grounds 
  are briefly summarized below.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

    <td width="92%"> 
      <p>Kinkead argued that the trial judge failed to cure the prejudicial effect 
        of the mid-trial publicity relating to his previous murder conviction.</p>
      <p>A few days after the start of Kinkead's trial, there were media reports 
        about the issuance of an arrest warrant for Kinkead's former lawyer in 
        connection with an unrelated matter. Some of the reports mentioned that 
        the lawyer had acted for Kinkead in connection with his prior murder conviction 
        for the slaying of a TTC employee. As a result of these media reports, 
        Kinkead asked the trial judge to declare a mistrial. After hearing submissions 
        from counsel and questioning the jury, the trial judge concluded that 
        the jury would be able to set aside anything that they may have heard 
        and denied Kinkead's request for a mistrial.</p>
      <p>The courtconcluded that the trial judge properly dealt with the mid-trial 
        publicity. The court rejected Kinkead's submissions that the trial judge 
        had prejudged the mistrial application, had failed to address the proper 
        issue in assessing whether to grant a mistrial, and had failed to properly 
        instruct the jury in regard to the media reports. To the contrary, the 
        court found no basis for finding that the trial judge had prejudged the 
        issue. Further, the court noted that the trial judge's conclusion as set 
        out in his ruling on the mistrial application was that he was satisfied 
        that the jurors could set aside anything they may have heard, which was 
        the precise issue that he was required to determine. Last, the court held 
        that the instruction that the trial judge gave to the jury was appropriate 
        in the circumstances, where the trial judge had to walk a fine line between 
        cautioning those who had heard the reports, and not drawing unnecessary 
        attention to the problem, for those who had not. </p>

      <p>Kinkead argued that the trial judge erred by admitting evidence that 
        Kinkead had, in the past, carried a knife, and that, on one occasion, 
        in Ranger's presence, Kinkead had threatened an acquaintance with a knife. 
        He also alleged that the trial judge exacerbated this error by failing 
        to give the jury proper instructions concerning the use of this evidence.</p>
      <p>The court held that the trial judge properly admitted this evidence and 
        gave the jury appropriate instructions regarding the use that the jury 
        could make of this evidence. The court agreed with the trial judge that 
        this evidence was relevant to two live issues at trial: possession of 
        the murder weapon and possible motive for Kinkead's presence at the Ottey 
        home. In the event the jury found that Kinkead was present in the Ottey 
        home at the time of the murders, evidence that he had a habit of carrying 
        a knife similar to the murder weapon had some probative value on the issue 
        of whether he possessed or supplied the murder weapon. Similarly, the 
        fact that Ranger was present when Kinkead used a knife to threaten another 
        person adds some credence to the likelihood that Ranger recruited Kinkead 
        to assist in the killings and, therefore, to the likelihood that, if Kinkead 
        was present at the murder scene, he was not there for an innocent purpose. 
      </p>
      <p>The court rejected Kinkead's argument that this evidence carried significant 
        potential prejudice. The risk of &quot;reasoning prejudice&quot; was minimal: 
        the evidence was straightforward and unlikely to confuse the jury or consume 
        an inordinate amount of time. The risk of moral prejudice (&quot;the potential 
        stigma of bad personhood&quot;) was also limited. As noted by the trial 
        judge, none of the impugned evidence was &quot;highly discreditable&quot; 
        in the context of a murder trial. There was little risk that the jury 
        would convict Kinkead to punish him for having carried a knife or having 
        once threatened someone. Nor is it likely that the jury would have used 
        the evidence that Kinkead carried a knife or once threatened someone to 
        conclude that he was the type of person who would commit a planned and 
        deliberate murder. </p>

      <p>Kinkead argued that the trial judge erred by ruling that the Crown could 
        use Kinkead's compelled testimony at Ranger's trial for purposes of cross-examination. 
      </p>
      <p>The court dismissed this ground of appeal. The court concluded that Kinkead's 
        prior testimony did not incriminate him at the time it was given and therefore, 
        this evidence was not subject to the restrictions that would apply if 
        it had been incriminating at the time it was given. The court also observed 
        that a decision about whether an accused person can be cross-examined 
        on prior compelled testimony that was not incriminating at the time it 
        was given must be based on the testimony of the accused person at the 
        subsequent trial, or, at the very least, on his anticipated testimony. 
        In his case, Kinkead sought the ruling before deciding whether to testify 
        and he did not provide the trial judge or the Court of Appeal with any 
        indication about what his anticipated testimony might be. </p>

      <p>Kinkead argued that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the 
        jury that certain evidence relating to post-offence conduct had no probative 
        value as evidence of consciousness of guilt and by failing to instruct 
        the jury how this evidence was relevant to the issue of planning and deliberation. 
      </p>
      <p>Three pieces of trial evidence were relevant to this ground of appeal: 
        first, evidence that Kinkead's association with Ranger came to a complete 
        halt after the killings until October 25, 1995 when the two men were observed 
        meeting at a Scarborough park where they spent time in a forested area 
        and were later seen reading a road atlas; second, evidence that Kinkead's 
        former girlfriend had driven Kinkead to the park, going past Ranger's 
        house without going in; and third, evidence that Kinkead and his former 
        girlfriend were in Florida together at the end of 1995, where Kinkead 
        and Ranger met on one occasion. </p>
      <p>The court concluded that the trial judge's failure to give the jury a 
        &quot;no probative value&quot; instruction was at least neutral, and may 
        have inured to Kinkead's benefit, given that the evidence of the hiatus 
        in contact between Ranger and Kinkead after the day of the killings and 
        the evidence that Kinkead and his former girlfriend drove by Ranger's 
        house before the two men met in the park (suggesting a clandestine element 
        to the meeting) could have used by the jury to draw an inference of consciousness 
        of guilt. Further, the court was of the view that it was unlikely that 
        the jury would have used the evidence of Kinkead going to Florida, standing 
        alone, to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt based on post-offence 
        flight. There was no evidence or suggestion that Kinkead left the jurisdiction 
        until at least two months after the Ottey killings. Similarly, there was 
        no evidence that the police were investigating Kinkead for the Ottey murders 
        at the time he left for Florida or that there was any basis for him to 
        be concerned about that possibility. Finally, neither the Crown nor the 
        trial judge said anything to suggest that the jury could rely on the evidence 
        that Kinkead went to Florida as evidence of flight. To the contrary, the 
        more likely use of that evidence was that suggested by the trial judge, 
        namely, that the hiatus in contact, the October 25 meeting in the park, 
        and the subsequent rendezvous in Florida were part of an original plan 
        and constituted evidence of planning and deliberation.</p>

  In the reasons for judgment in Kinkead's appeal, the court noted that expert 
  opinion evidence regarding the staging of the crime scene and the potential 
  perpetrator was given at Kinkead's trial. The admission of this evidence at 
  Ranger's trial is one of the bases on which this Court ordered a new trial for 
  Ranger. The court determined that it was unnecessary to address this expert 
  opinion evidence in the context of Kinkead's appeal for three reasons. First, 
  this expert opinion evidence incriminated Ranger, rather than Kinkead. Second, 
  Kinkead admitted at his trial that Ranger had been convicted of killing Marsha 
  and Tamara Ottey, and therefore, evidence that incriminated Ranger (as the criminal 
  staging and profiling evidence did) was not inconsistent with Kinkead's position 
  at his trial. Third, Kinkead did not object to this expert opinion evidence 
  at trial nor rely on it as a ground of appeal. </p>
