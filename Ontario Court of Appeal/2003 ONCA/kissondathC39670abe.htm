<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The two-year sentence imposed at trial was demonstrably unfit. The trial 
  judge also erred in principle in discounting the importance of specific deterrence 
  because it had not worked in the past with this offender.</p>
<p>[2] The frauds were serious, sophisticated, numerous and committed while the 
  respondent was on parole for other very serious frauds for which the respondent 
  had received a four and a half year sentence. </p>
<p>[3] The respondent pled guilty to the charges and saved the state considerable 
  expense, but the genuineness of his remorse is doubtful. Greed appears to have 
  been the primary, if not the only, motivation for the crime.</p>
<p>[4] A fit sentence is five years. Having regard to the pre-trial custody (the 
  equivalent of 16 &frac12; months) we would impose a sentence of 43 months.</p>
<p>[5] A warrant may issue for the arrest of the respondent if necessary.</p>
