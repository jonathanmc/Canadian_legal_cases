<p>The appellant, Kennuth J., appeals against the conviction imposed by Justice 
  John P. Kerr of the Ontario Court of Justice dated February 21, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for robbery on the ground that the 
  trial judge's interventions created the appearance of an unfair trial. The Crown 
  concedes the appeal and agrees that a new trial must be ordered.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The charge related to an incident on April 4, 2001, when four masked individuals 
  armed with knives entered a grocery store on Danforth Road in Toronto. A fifth 
  individual remained outside the store, seemingly acting as a lookout. Although 
  nothing was taken from the store, a cell phone belonging to a customer was taken. 
  Following the robbery, the complainant chased three of the individuals and apprehended 
  the appellant because he was one of the individuals running away from the store. 
  The appellant testified and denied any involvement in the robbery. He testified 
  that he was on his way home when he encountered two individuals wearing masks 
  running towards him. Thinking they were going to rob him he ran and eventually 
  crossed the road, at which point he saw that the two individuals were no longer 
  following him. At this point he realized that he was not the target of the robbery. 
  He was then apprehended by the complainant. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] On the morning of the trial, the investigating officer disclosed that, 
  during his discussions with the complainant following the appellant's arrest, 
  the complainant allegedly commented in reference to the appellant and the others 
  involved in the robbery, &quot;If even not a part of it, he is the same age 
  like them, he must know them&quot;. This comment had not been transcribed in 
  the officers notes nor disclosed prior to the trial date. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] During the cross-examination of the complainant on his alleged statement 
  to the police, the trial judge intervened to inquire whether the statement was 
  reduced to writing. During the course of this inquiry, and in the presence of 
  the witness, the trial judge commented, &quot;If it's not in the officer's notes, 
  it would have little, if any weight.&quot; The complainant testified that he 
  did not recall making any such statement to the police. During the course of 
  the investigating officer's subsequent testimony, the trial judge again intervened 
  and vigorously cross-examined the officer on his failure to transcribe this 
  statement in his notes. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] The case against the appellant was purely circumstantial. Neither the complainant 
  nor the owner of the store could identify the appellant. The case against the 
  appellant rested on the complainant's assertion at trial that he had had the 
  culprits he chased in his view from the moment they left the store, and that 
  the appellant must have been one of them. Hence, it is clear that the evidence 
  about the complainant's alleged statement to the police officer was important 
  evidence going to the credibility of the witness and the reliability of his 
  testimony. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] We agree that, regrettably, interventions of the trial judge in this case, 
  when viewed in context, did result in the appearance of an unfair trial. The 
  test is that set out by Martin J.A. in R. v. Valley (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 
  (Ont. C.A.) at p. 232:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Interventions by the Judge creating the appearance of 
  an unfair trial may be of more than one type and the appearance of a fair trial 
  may be destroyed by a combination of different types of intervention. The ultimate 
  question to be answered is not whether the accused was in fact prejudiced by 
  the interventions but whether he might reasonably consider that he had not had 
  a fair trial or whether a reasonably minded person who had been present through 
  the trial would consider that the accused had not had a fair trial. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] It is our view that the trial judge's intervention during the course of 
  the complainant's cross-examination on his alleged statement impaired defence 
  counsel's full testing of the evidence. More importantly, the trial judge gave 
  the appearance of having pre-judged the credibility of the police officer by 
  saying, before the officer had testified and before any explanation for the 
  omission of this statement from his notes had been given, that he would afford 
  this statement little weight because it was not recorded in the officer's notes. 
  The appearance of unfairness was compounded by the trial judge's vigorous cross-examination 
  of the officer as to why the statement was not recorded in his notes despite 
  the fact that Crown counsel at trial did not take issue with the officer's evidence. 
  We conclude that these interventions, coupled with the fact that the trial judge, 
  in convicting the appellant, made no reference to the testimony of the investigating 
  officer on this crucial issue, did create an appearance of unfairness. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] The appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a new trial is ordered.
