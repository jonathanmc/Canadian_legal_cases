<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] An appellate court will only interfere with the discretion of the Discipline 
  Committee to refuse an adjournment in rare circumstances, namely, when the appellant 
  demonstrates that he or she was denied fairness or natural justice. In its endorsement 
  the Divisional Court concluded:</p>
<p class="indent">We are all of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed 
  and the matter remitted back to the Discipline Committee for a rehearing because 
  of fairness and natural justice concerns flowing from the Committee's failure 
  to grant an adjournment.</p>
<p>[2] We are not persuaded that the Divisional Court erred despite the very effective 
  argument of Ms. Rothstein, counsel for the College. In addition, the Divisional 
  Court was entitled to take into account that the public interest could be protected 
  during an adjournment by the imposition of terms pursuant to s. 16(1) </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs of the appeal to the respondent 
  are fixed in the amount of $20,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
