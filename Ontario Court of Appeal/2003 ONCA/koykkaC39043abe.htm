<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We have not been persuaded that this jury's verdict was perverse. There 
  was evidence both from the plaintiff and the experts upon which the jury could 
  reasonably have come to their conclusion concerning the amount of loss of earnings.</p>
<p>[2] Defence counsel (not Mr. Edwards) did not object at trial to the leading 
  questions put to the plaintiff. The trial judge carefully instructed the jury 
  during the plaintiff's evidence about the weight to be attached to the contents 
  of the medical records that were put to the plaintiff. The appellant has failed 
  to persuade us that he was prejudiced by the manner in which the examination-in-chief 
  was conducted.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $25,785.00 inclusive of GST 
  and disbursements.</p>
