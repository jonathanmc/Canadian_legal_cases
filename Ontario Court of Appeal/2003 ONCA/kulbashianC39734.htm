<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an application for leave to appeal and if leave be granted an appeal 
  from the order of Epstein J. dated March 14, 2003 dismissing the applicant's 
  appeal from his conviction and sentence in the Summary Conviction Court. The 
  applicant had been convicted of assault by Fairgrieve J. in January 2002 and 
  sentenced to five months in jail.</p>
<p>
  [2] While the applicant advances a number of grounds of appeal, it is only necessary 
  to deal with the principal submission that the verdict is unreasonable. We agree 
  with that submission and accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal 
  allowed and an acquittal entered.</p>
<p>
  [3] This was a very difficult case. The evidence was confusing and contradictory 
  and involved a number of difficult aspects such as the use of post-offence conduct. 
  The trial judge was very careful in his assessment and use of the evidence. 
  Nevertheless, for the following reasons we are of the view that the verdict 
  cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  [4] This offence arose out of an attack by one or more &quot;skinheads&quot; 
  on an unidentified black man. The attack began on a bus and continued when the 
  bus stopped and one or more of the skinheads pursued the victim out on to the 
  street. The evidence shows that although the applicant was one of the skinheads 
  on the bus, he was not involved in the altercation on the bus. His liability 
  depended entirely on whether he could be identified as one of the persons who 
  pursued the victim on to the street.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown's principal witness, Clayton Scott, was a most unsatisfactory 
  witness. He was one of the skinheads and the trial judge recognized that his 
  evidence had to be approached with great caution. As well, the testimony itself 
  was riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions. While he initially identified 
  the applicant as having been involved in the pursuit of the victim on to the 
  street, he quickly resiled from that position and gave inconsistent answers 
  during cross-examination by Crown counsel and defence counsel. It is apparent 
  that the trial judge would not have convicted the applicant on Scott's evidence 
  alone. The trial judge believed, however, that Scott's evidence was confirmed 
  by the independent evidence of the various persons who witnessed the attack 
  in the bus and on the street.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge's approach was essentially a sound one. He reasoned that 
  any one of the skinheads involved in the pursuit of the victim outside the bus 
  could be found to be a party to the assault by assisting in preventing the victim's 
  escape, even if that person did not actually physically assault the victim. 
  He then proceeded by a process of elimination. For sufficient reasons, he accepted 
  Scott's evidence that he did not assault the victim and that two other skinheads 
  referred to as Jerry and Pavlo also did not participate in the pursuit. This 
  left the applicant and his two co-accused Vrdoljak and Kujtkowski. Vrdoljak's 
  own testimony establishes his participation in the assault and an independent 
  witness was able to identify Kujtkowski as a participant in the assault. </p>
<p>
  [7] None of the independent witnesses, however, could satisfactorily identify 
  the applicant as being involved. In fact, at least two witnesses did not pick 
  the applicant out of a photo line-up. Nevertheless, if the independent evidence 
  established that three skinheads were involved in the pursuit, by a process 
  of elimination the applicant would be shown to be a party to the offence. This 
  is where the case breaks down. The trial judge stated that based on the confirmatory 
  evidence of six of the independent witnesses he was satisfied that the applicant 
  &quot;was the third participant in the chase&quot;. The independent evidence, 
  however, does not demonstrate that there was a third participant. Some witnesses 
  say there were three. Some say there were four, which contradicts Scott's evidence. 
  The other witnesses say that either there were one or two participants or they 
  could not tell how many. The trial judge did not indicate that the witnesses 
  who did not see three participants were not credible and he did not indicate 
  any basis for preferring the one or two witnesses who testified that three persons 
  were involved. For example, Brent Harris gave the clearest evidence that three 
  persons were involved and yet his testimony was so problematic that the trial 
  judge acquitted all of the accused in relation to the count where he was the 
  victim. The trial judge accepted Harris' evidence about the number of persons 
  involved in the attack on the black man because &quot;it coincided with the 
  evidence of other witnesses&quot;. The difficulty is that the other witnesses 
  do not clearly show how many persons were involved in the pursuit.</p>
<p>
  [8] In our view, the independent evidence as to the number of persons involved 
  is so unsatisfactory that it cannot form a safe basis for a conviction. In her 
  reasons, the appeal court judge did not directly address the question of the 
  reasonableness of the verdict, except to find that there was ample evidence, 
  which the trial judge accepted, to support the conviction. For the reasons expressed 
  above, this was an error in law.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed, the conviction 
  set aside and an acquittal entered.</p>
