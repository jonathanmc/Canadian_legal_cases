<p>On appeal from the Order of the Divisional Court (McRae, Then and Day JJ.) 
  dated December 14, 2001, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the Order 
  of Cumming J. dated October 18, 2000.</p>
<P>
  ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>    <P>
  [1] This is one of two appeals heard together by this court concerning the Class 
  Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6. Both are appeals from refusals by motions 
  judges to certify, as class actions under the CPA, claims originating from the 
  sale of so-called &quot;premium offset&quot; or &quot;vanishing premiums&quot; 
  participating whole life insurance policies.</p>    <P>
  [2] The appellant and another person brought a motion for certification on behalf 
  of a proposed class of persons who had allegedly received premium offset representations 
  from the respondent in a &quot;common manner.&quot; Cumming J. dismissed the 
  motion and the Divisional Court dismissed the appellant's appeal from the order 
  of Cumming J. as well as the companion appeal, Zicherman v. The Equitable Life 
  Assurance Company of Canada. </p>    <P>
  [3] In my view, the motions judge and the Divisional Court were correct in denying 
  certification. For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <P>
  THE FACTS</p>    <P>
  [4] The appellant Sehdev Kumar and the other proposed representative plaintiff 
  Rosel Williams brought actions against Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada 
  and Prudential Assurance Company Limited for having deceptively sold them life 
  insurance policies with a premium offset feature. The Canadian business of Prudential 
  was acquired by Mutual on March 1, 1995. Mutual's name has since been changed 
  to Clarica Life Insurance Company. </p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant is a semi-retired university professor. He is married and 
  has two children. In 1991, when he was 49 years old, he purchased a $500,000 
  whole life insurance policy from the Prudential. When Ms. Williams purchased 
  her policy in 1989, she was a 23-year-old single mother living with her parents. 
  She purchased a Prudential whole life policy with $100,000 coverage. She has 
  since settled with the respondents. I will, however, make brief reference to 
  the facts of her case since they demonstrate some of the problems with the proposed 
  class action.</p>    <P>
  [6] The appellant's policy was a participating permanent whole life policy. 
  As a participating policy holder the appellant was entitled to dividends in 
  any year in which the company declared them. The size of the dividends depended 
  upon the performance of the company's investments. The theory behind a premium 
  offset or vanishing premium policy is that at a certain point in time the accumulated 
  dividends would be sufficient to pay or &quot;offset&quot; future premiums as 
  they came due. Whole life policies with vanishing premiums pay dividends to 
  policyholders that purportedly cover the cost of premiums within a number of 
  years, upon a specified &quot;cross-over&quot; date. These policies apparently 
  accomplish their objectives so long as interest rates are high. If rates decline, 
  the dividends fail to produce sufficient income to pay the remaining premiums, 
  and insurers move back the &quot;cross-over&quot; dates by several years. Using 
  the premiums to offset future premiums was not the only way that participating 
  policies were sold. For example, the policyholder could use the dividends to 
  buy additional term insurance. </p>    <P>
  [7] The appellant claims that before he bought the policy in 1991 he was told 
  that after nine years he would no longer have to pay premiums. As a university 
  professor, this representation was important to him because he knew that he 
  would be required to retire at age 65 and live on a reduced income.</p>    <P>
  [8] The appellant claims that the two Prudential agents with whom he dealt, 
  the third party defendants Chagger and Piruchta, showed him a computer generated 
  illustration for a Life 2,000-PEP Series A insurance policy. The appellant wrote 
  across the top of this illustration, &quot;In this you pay premiums for nine 
  years until age 58&quot;. The illustration itself included a disclaimer:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The Paid-up additions and their Cash Values are based on the 
  Company's current dividend scale and ARE NOT GUARANTEED. In our present environment, 
  current dividend scales are expected to change more frequently, thus long term 
  projections should be viewed with caution.</p>    
<P>
  [9] The policy itself also stipulated that the annual premiums are payable for 
  the duration of the contract, that is until death or the surrender of the policy. 
  The appellant claims that in 1995, Piruchta told him he would have to pay premiums 
  for a total of twelve years, not nine years and for the first time explained 
  to him that the duration of premium payments was dependent upon the dividends 
  declared by the company. The appellant accordingly cancelled the policy and 
  complained to Mutual and expressed his intent to make a complaint to the Life 
  Insurance Commission of Ontario. </p>    <P>
  [10] He then commenced a class action for damages for, inter alia, negligent 
  misrepresentation. He also brought claims for breach of contract, failure to 
  warn, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, tort of deceit and breach 
  of s. 52(1) of the Competition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-34. On behalf of the class, 
  he sought damages equivalent to (a) the premiums payable after the specified 
  &quot;vanishing premium&quot; dates and to (b) the reduced amount of the policies' 
  cash surrender value.</p>    <P>
  [11] Ms. Williams met once with the agent that sold her the policy. The agent 
  proposed a particular type of policy and she agreed. She did not receive any 
  illustration when she purchased the policy in 1989. She was subsequently sent 
  two illustrations from a rival company and later two further illustrations from 
  her agent. Ms. Williams alleged that she was told that she would only have to 
  pay premiums for ten years. She was subsequently told that the premiums would 
  not &quot;vanish&quot; after ten years and she stopped paying the monthly premiums 
  as of January 1997.</p>    <P>
  Prudential's use of vanishing premium policies</p>    <P>
  [12] In response to demands from its agents and to remain competitive in the 
  market place where the premium offset feature had become popular, Prudential 
  made this feature available in 1982. Between 1982 and 1986, premium offset was 
  not actively promoted by Prudential. It was however, available at the request 
  of its agents. Prudential began actively marketing this feature of its policies 
  from July 1986 to March 1995. Over 120,000 whole life policies were sold during 
  this period. There is apparently no way to tell how many whole life policyholders 
  were told about the premium offset feature, were shown illustrations, or chose 
  to use this feature to reduce their annual premiums.</p>    <P>
  [13] Prior to 1988, there was no formal training structure in place for Prudential 
  sales agents. Rather, the managers of each office trained agents. In 1988, Prudential 
  developed a training programme for new agents to educate them about specific 
  insurance products. As early as July 1982, Prudential had developed software 
  for generating computer illustrations of premium offsets. These illustrations 
  came with pre-printed warnings. In 1986, Prudential began disseminating sales 
  bulletins to its sales agents promoting the premium offset concept. </p>    <P>
  [14] In 1990, Prudential produced a Life 2000 Series Marketing Guide. The Guide 
  illustrated premium offset as an available feature for several policies. However, 
  it did not explicitly direct sales agents to warn prospective customers of the 
  contingency that premium offset is dependent on dividend performance.</p>    <P>
  [15] Prudential's first dividend scale decrease occurred in 1992 as a result 
  of declining interest rates. In 1993, Prudential began advising its agents to 
  present multiple scale illustrations to customers showing future values based 
  on three projections: dividends higher than, equal to and lower than the current 
  rate. Prudential maintains that these were not a guarantee or a prediction by 
  Prudential of future developments regarding dividend scales or interest rates. 
  Rather, the illustrations merely set out the current dividend scales and interest 
  rates.</p>    <P>
  [16] The motions judge described some of the potential problems with the premium 
  offset feature:</p>    
<P class="indent"> In theory, if not always in practice, the client's choice of 
  policy would depend upon the individual's needs and ability to pay. It is apparent 
  that there were problems throughout the life insurance industry with the so-called 
  &quot;premium offset&quot; feature to some whole life policies. Perhaps it is 
  not too cynical to imagine that many agents might over-emphasize and over-simplify 
  this optional feature given the attractive dividends being paid. Perhaps many 
  people tended to expect that the then-prevailing economic conditions would persist 
  into the future. The certainties of the present are more apparent than the uncertainties 
  of the future. The &quot;premium offset&quot; feature is dependent, of course, 
  upon the payment of dividends and the quantity thereof. Thus, the superficial 
  appeal of a projected future &quot;premium offset&quot; date is fraught with 
  all the uncertainties attendant upon the political economy and the reality that 
  unfolds when the future becomes the present (at para. 7).</p>    
<P>
  [17] After this action was commenced Clarica established an ADR programme to 
  resolve complaints such as the appellant's. The respondents received 239 complaints 
  over the years about premium offset policies. About half of the complaints were 
  received after the ADR programme was established.</p>    <P>
  THE DEFINITION OF THE CLASS AND COMMON ISSUES BEFORE THE MOTIONS JUDGE</p>    <P>
  [18] The appellant proposed that the class be defined as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> All owners of Class Policies purchased from Prudential. Class 
  Policies being defined as</p>
<P class="indent">Any participating whole life policy issued by Prudential between 
  January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1995 which is in force as of August 31, 1998 
  (or &quot;Current Class Policy&quot;) or which has become a Lapsed Policy between 
  January 1, 1990 and August 13, 1998 (a &quot;Lapsed Class Policy&quot;) except 
  those policies in respect of which the owners have released Prudential from 
  claims related to premium offset or to the sale of the policies. </p>
<P>
  [19] The appellant proposed the following common question:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Did the use of illustrations and/or representations, in writing 
  or verbal, create an obligation on the part of Prudential with respect to a 
  specified offset date despite the terms of the policy and the terms of any illustration?</p>    
<P>
  THE REASONS OF CUMMING J.</p>    <P>
  [20] The motions judge found that there was no evidence to support &quot;the 
  plaintiffs' bald allegation of uniformity in Prudential's sales techniques and 
  materials over the 1980-1995 period&quot;. Rather, the &quot;particular circumstances 
  of the individual client and the oral statements and explanations of the particular 
  agent were of fundamental importance&quot;. This would involve examination of 
  the unique sales experience of each policyholder. The motions judge then examined 
  the elements of negligent misrepresentation as set out in Queen v. Cognos Inc., 
  [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87 at 110. Those elements are:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (1) there must be a duty of care based on a &quot;special relationship&quot; 
  between the representor and the representee; (2) the representation in question 
  must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading; (3) the representor must have acted 
  negligently in making said misrepresentation; (4) the representee must have 
  relied, in a reasonable manner, on said negligent misrepresentation; and (5) 
  the reliance must have been detrimental to the representee in the sense that 
  damages resulted.</p>    
<P>
  [21] The motions judge had the greatest concern with elements (2) to (5). In 
  summary, he found that an individual determination would have to be made with 
  respect to each policyholder for each of those elements. For example, as to 
  element (2) there would have to be evidence as to whether any representation 
  as to premium offset was made and then, if so, whether or not it was accurate. 
  In summary, he concluded that, &quot;While the theories of liability can be 
  phrased commonly the actual determination of liability for each class member 
  can only be made upon an examination of the unique circumstances with respect 
  to each class member's purchase of a policy&quot;. Accordingly, he found that 
  the claims of the class members do not raise common issues.</p>    <P>
  [22] Even if there was a common issue, the motions judge found that a class 
  proceeding would not be the preferable procedure as required by s. 5(1)(d) of 
  the Act. He reviewed the three policy objectives underlying the Act of access 
  to justice; judicial economy; and behaviour modification. He was also of the 
  view that the court must consider whether certification would be a &quot;fair, 
  efficient and manageable way of advancing the claims&quot; referring to the 
  decision of the Divisional Court in Carom v. Bre-X Minerals Ltd. (1999), 46 
  O.R. (3d) 315. [That decision was reversed in part by this court in reasons 
  reported at (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 236. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of 
  Canada was denied, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 660.]</p>    <P>
  [23] The motions judge considered that the necessary inquiry into individual 
  issues &quot;would significantly increase the time, cost and complexity of the 
  proceedings such that the CPA's objective of access to justice and judicial 
  efficiency would be impeded if not frustrated&quot;. He therefore found that 
  a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure.</p>    <P>
  THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>    <P>
  [24] The Divisional Court dealt with the appeal from the judgment of Cumming 
  J. and the appeal from the decision of Ferrier J. in the matter of Zicherman 
  v. The Equitable Life Assurance Company of Canada. By the time the cases came 
  before the Divisional Court, this court's decision in Bre-X had been released. 
  Writing for the Divisional Court, McRae J. held that the Bre-X decision merely 
  stood for the proposition that &quot;[W]here there is certification for a number 
  of common issues, judicial expediency is best served if all issues are canvassed 
  in the same action&quot; (at para 23).</p>    <P>
  [25] Before the Divisional Court, Mr. Pape, who had not appeared before the 
  motions judge, argued that if the motions judge was not satisfied with the common 
  issue proposed by the plaintiff, he should have reformulated the issue. Mr. 
  Pape suggested that the issue might be defined as, &quot;[W]as there an organized 
  and systematic marketing of premium offset policies by the insurance company 
  which was misleading?&quot; The Divisional Court held that there was no such 
  obligation on the motions judge and, in any event, even if the common issue 
  was reformulated as suggested, there was no evidence of common complaint with 
  respect to this issue:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The issue is not with respect to the use of illustrations or 
  the systematic marketing of &quot;premium offset&quot; policies by the insurance 
  companies, but rather, some individual complaints by some clients about the 
  sales approaches of some agents. Many tens of thousands of policies were sold 
  by hundreds of agents, but a relatively small number of purchasers complained 
  about representations allegedly made to them by agents at the time of sale. 
  These transactions do not present common issues but, rather, individual representations 
  (at para. 11).</p>    
<P>
  [26] The Divisional Court also held that the motions judge made proper use of 
  the evidentiary record. He recognized that he should not examine the facts with 
  a view to determining the strength of the allegation. Rather, his responsibility 
  was to &quot;look to the allegation to determine if there was an identifiable 
  class and common issues which would merit certification&quot; (at para. 10). 
  The Court agreed with the motions judge's decision and dismissed the appeal.</p>    <P>
  THE ISSUES</p>    <P>
  [27] The appellant raises three issues:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (1) Did the Divisional Court err in principle in finding that 
  the appeal must be approached solely on the basis of the issues as presented 
  to the motions judge?</p>
<P class="indent"> (2) Did the courts err in principle in their use of the evidentiary 
  record to determine there were no common issues?</p>
<P class="indent"> (3) Did the motions judge and the Divisional Court err in principle 
  in finding there were no common issues to be certified?</p>
<P>
  [28] It seems to me that the appellant cannot succeed without also showing that 
  the motions judge erred in finding that a class proceeding was not the preferable 
  procedure for the resolution of the common issues.</p>    <P>
  THE LEGISLATION</p>    <P>
  [29] The relevant parts of the CPA are ss. 5 and 6, which provide as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 5 (1) The Court shall certify a class proceeding on a motion 
  under section 2, 3 or 4 if,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the pleadings or the notice of application discloses a cause 
  of action;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) there is an identifiable class of two or more persons that 
  would be represented by the representative plaintiff or defendant;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the claims or defences of the class members raise common 
  issues;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for 
  the resolution of the common issues; and</p>
<p class="indent">(e) there is a representative plaintiff or defendant who,</p>
<P class="indent15"> (i) would fairly and adequately represent the interests of 
  the class,</p>
<P class="indent15"> (ii) has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a 
  workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class and of notifying 
  class members of the proceeding, and</p>
<P class="indent15"> (iii) does not have, on the common issues for the class, an 
  interest in conflict with the interests of other class members.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Despite subsection (1), where a class includes a subclass 
  whose members have claims or defences that raise common issues not shared by 
  all the class members, so that, in the opinion of the court, the protection 
  of the interests of the subclass members requires that they be separately represented, 
  the court shall not certify the class proceeding unless there is a representative 
  plaintiff or defendant who, </p>
<P class="indent"> (a) would fairly and adequately represent the interests of 
  the subclass; </p>
<P class="indent"> (b) has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a 
  workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the subclass and of 
  notifying subclass members of the proceeding; and </p>
<P class="indent"> (c) does not have, on the common issues for the subclass, an 
  interest in conflict with the interests of other subclass members. </p>
<p class="indent">6. The court shall not refuse to certify a proceeding as a class 
  proceeding solely on any of the following grounds: </p>
<P class="indent"> 1. The relief claimed includes a claim for damages that would 
  require individual assessment after determination of the common issues. </p>
<P class="indent"> 2. The relief claimed relates to separate contracts involving 
  different class members. </p>
<P class="indent"> 3. Different remedies are sought for different class members. 
</p>
<P class="indent"> 4. The number of class members or the identity of each class 
  member is not known. </p>
<P class="indent"> 5. The class includes a subclass whose members have claims 
  or defences that raise common issues not shared by all class members.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>    <P>
  (1) The role of the motions judge and the Divisional Court</p>    <P>
  [30] If the reasons of the Divisional Court stand for the proposition that the 
  motions judges should not modify the definition of the class or the common issues 
  as presented by the plaintiff then, in my view, this was an error. I can see 
  no reason in principle why the motions judge cannot modify the definition of 
  the class or the common issues if the judge is of the view that such modification 
  is required to accord with the Act. Further, in my view, it was open to the 
  Divisional Court, in this case, to modify the definition of the class or the 
  common issue. In Anderson v. Wilson (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 235, the Divisional 
  Court amended both the class and the common issues as certified by the motions 
  judge (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 400. On further appeal, (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 673, 
  this court again varied both the class and the common issues. Similarly, in 
  Hollick v. Toronto (City), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158 at para. 21, McLachlin C.J.C., 
  speaking for the court, held that where the class proposed by the plaintiff 
  could be defined more narrowly, &quot;the court should either disallow certification 
  or allow certification on condition that the definition of the class be amended&#133; 
  .&quot;</p>    <P>
  [31] While I would not go so far as to suggest that there is a duty on the motions 
  judge to modify the definitions, the class or the common issue, it is certainly 
  open to the judge to do so. It should be borne in mind that the judges hearing 
  these motions are experienced with managing CPA cases. They are entitled to 
  bring their experience to bear in formulating the class and the common issue, 
  provided, of course, that the parties are not unfairly prejudiced.</p>    <P>
  [32] That said, in this case the issue is of no real consequence in this appeal. 
  As I have pointed out, the Divisional Court did consider the reformulation of 
  the common issue suggested by counsel for the appellant. The court held that 
  even as reformulated, the proceeding should not be certified as a class action.</p>    <P>
  [33] In this case, I can see no prejudice to the respondents in considering 
  the reformulated question. In fairness to the appellant, the class and common 
  issue as initially proposed were drawn from the decision in Dabbs v. Sun Life 
  Assurance Co. of Canada (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 429 (Gen. Div.)). Dabbs was a motion 
  for certification and approval of a settlement in a vanishing premium case. 
  Thus, the defendant was consenting to the certification, provided the motion 
  judge also approved the settlement. The motions judge in Dabbs found that the 
  proposed class represented an identifiable class within the meaning of s. 5(1)(b) 
  of the Act and that the statement of claim raised a common issue.</p>    <P>
  [34] Further, when the instant matter was before the motions judge in September 
  2000, neither he nor the parties had the benefit of the decisions of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Hollick and Rumley v. British Columbia, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 184. 
  It is apparent that in reformulating the common issue the appellant is attempting 
  to bring his case within Rumley. In this case, in view of the extensive record 
  before the motions judge, I can see no unfairness to the respondents in considering 
  the reformulated common issue.</p>    <P>
  (2) Use of the evidentiary record</p>    <P>
  [35] The appellant submits that the motions judge erred in using the evidentiary 
  record provided by the respondents to determine the merits of the proposed claim. 
  In Hollick, the court dealt with the use of evidence on the certification motion. 
  The court held at para. 16 that &quot;the certification stage is decidedly not 
  meant to be a test of the merits of the action&quot;. Thus, the &quot;question 
  at the certification stage is not whether the claim is likely to succeed, but 
  whether the suit is appropriately prosecuted as a class action&quot;. </p>    <P>
  [36] The Supreme Court then considered the proper use of the evidentiary record. 
  McLachlin C.J.C. held at para. 25 that the class representative &quot;must show 
  some basis in fact for each of the certification requirements set out in s. 
  5 of the Act, other than the requirement that the pleadings disclose a cause 
  of action&quot;. Section 5(1)(a) requires that the pleadings disclose a cause 
  of action. This requirement is governed by the rule that pleadings should not 
  be struck for failure to disclose a cause of action unless it is &quot;plain 
  and obvious&quot; that no claim exists.</p>    <P>
  [37] The motions judge made a number of findings of fact based upon the material 
  submitted by the respondents. For example, he stated that the &quot;documentation 
  produced does not support the plaintiffs' allegation that Prudential engaged 
  in any organized and systemic marketing of premium offset insurance policies&quot; 
  (at para. 17). He also stated that the &quot;evidentiary record establishes 
  that Prudential &#133; did not require or encourage its agents to use the concept, 
  did not train its agents to use the concept in any specific or common way and 
  provided cautions and warnings about premium offsets in its directions to its 
  agents and in the illustrations they employed&quot; (at para. 18). Further, 
  he stated that the &quot;evidence establishes that agents gave unique and individually 
  targeted presentations to each different prospective policy purchaser&quot; 
  (at para. 19). </p>    <P>
  [38] As I understand it, the respondents' evidence was adduced to support its 
  position that there was no common issue of fact raised by the pleadings. The 
  evidence was also relevant to the proposed class definition. As held in Hollick 
  at para. 20, there must &quot;be some rational relationship between the class 
  and common issues&quot;. The respondents' evidence was relevant to this issue 
  as well. The appellant proposed a class comprising over 100,000 policyholders. 
  The respondents were entitled to show that many of those potential class members 
  never received any illustrations and thus that there was no relationship between 
  the class and the proposed common issue. Indeed, the other original plaintiff, 
  Ms. Williams, did not receive any written illustration before buying her policy.</p>    <P>
  [39] In my view, the motions judge did not err. He accurately summarized the 
  respondents' evidence and the appellant did not contradict that evidence. The 
  legal consequences flowing from that evidence are another matter and involves 
  consideration of the finding by the motions judge that there was no common issue 
  and that, in any event, the class proceeding would not be the preferable procedure 
  for the resolution of the common issue.</p>    <P>
  (3) The common issues</p>    <P>
  [40] Relying on Dabbs, the appellant proposed the following common issue before 
  the motions judge:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Did the use of illustrations and/or any representations, in 
  writing or verbal, create an obligation on the part of Prudential with respect 
  to a specified offset date despite the terms of the policy and the terms of 
  any illustration? (at p. 433)</p>    
<P>
  [41] In light of Rumley, the appellant refined the common issue and framed it 
  as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Was there an organized and systematic marketing of premium 
  offset policies by Prudential which was misleading?</p>    
<P>
  I do not see a radical difference between these two proposals.</p>    <P>
  [42] In the course of oral argument in this court, Mr. Pape seemed to suggest 
  a different common issue:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Was Prudential negligent in failing to properly train its agents 
  in the use of the premium offset feature?</p>    
<P>
  [43] In my view, however the proposed common issue is framed, the motions judge 
  and the Divisional Court were correct in refusing to certify this class action. 
  For the purposes of this discussion I will assume in the appellant's favour 
  that there is an identifiable class of two or more persons within the meaning 
  of s. 5(1)(b). The respondents' evidence shows that Clarica has received several 
  hundred complaints about premium offset policies. This evidence is similar to 
  the evidence relied upon in Hollick showing that of the potential class of 30,000 
  persons who lived in the vicinity of the Keele Valley landfill, there had only 
  been between 150 and 500 complaints. The Supreme Court nevertheless held that 
  the plaintiff had shown a sufficient basis in fact to satisfy the commonality 
  requirement.</p>    <P>
  [44] The Supreme Court of Canada has recently looked at the question of common 
  issues in three cases, Hollick, Rumley and Western Canadian Shopping Centres 
  Inc. v. Bennett Jones Verchere (2001), 201 D.L.R. (4th) 385 under three different 
  statutory regimes. Those cases suggest a number of principles that the court 
  must apply in determining whether there are one or more common issues. It is 
  not necessary that the common issues predominate over individual issues or that 
  the resolution of the common issues be determinative of each class member's 
  claim (Western Canadian at para. 39). The underlying question is a practical 
  one based on issues of fairness and efficiency in the sense that allowing the 
  action to proceed as a class proceeding &quot;will avoid duplication of fact-finding 
  or legal analysis&quot; (Western Canadian at para. 39). While not stated exactly 
  in those terms it seems to me that this is similar to Campbell J.'s statement 
  in Anderson v. Wilson (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 235 (Div. Ct.) at 243 that the &quot;common 
  issues need only be issues of fact or law that move the litigation forward&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [45] The Supreme Court decisions do, however, show that the court is required 
  to make a realistic appraisal of the place of the proposed common issue in the 
  litigation. McLachlin C.J.C. expressed this requirement in different ways:</p>    
<P class="indent"> In Rumley at para. 29:</p>
<P class="indent"> It would not serve the ends of either fairness or efficiency 
  to certify an action on the basis of issues that are common only when stated 
  in the most general terms. Inevitably such an action would ultimately break 
  down into individual proceedings. That the suit had initially been certified 
  as a class action could only make the proceeding less fair and less efficient.</p>
<P class="indent"> And in Western Canadian at para. 39 (adopted in Hollick at 
  para. 18):</p>
<P class="indent"> [T]he class members' claims must share a substantial common 
  ingredient to justify a class action. Determining whether the common issues 
  justify a class action may require the court to examine the significance of 
  the common issues in relation to individual issues. </p>
<P>
  [46] In my view, the problem with the appellant's application is that any common 
  issue, however phrased, cannot meet the requirements that the issue be necessary 
  to the resolution of each class member's claim and a substantial ingredient 
  of each of the class members' claims. A proposed common issue that does not 
  meet these requirements is not a common issue for the purposes of s. 5 of the 
  CPA. </p>    <P>
  [47] In this case, establishing that Prudential was negligent in any of the 
  ways suggested by the appellant would not represent a substantial ingredient 
  in each of the class members' claims. It would not, to use Campbell J.'s phrase 
  in Anderson, &quot;move the litigation forward&quot;. As the motions judge pointed 
  out, since Prudential had no direct dealings with any of the class members at 
  the time the policies were sold, the class members would still at least have 
  to show that the agents with whom they dealt made representations about premium 
  offset, that those representations constituted negligent misrepresentations 
  about the premium offset feature, and that the prospective policyholder reasonably 
  relied upon the representation. As was stated in Rumley at para. 29, &quot;Inevitably 
  such an action would ultimately break down into individual proceedings.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [48] I agree with the motion judge's conclusion on this issue:</p>    
<P class="indent"> While the theories of liability can be phrased commonly the 
  actual determination of liability for each class member can only be made upon 
  an examination of the unique circumstances with respect to each class member's 
  purchase of a policy (at para. 39).</p>    
<P>
  [49] The appellant points out that in finding that there were no common issues, 
  the motions judge relied upon the decision of the Divisional Court in Bre-X, 
  which decision was subsequently overturned by this court. In Bre-X, the motions 
  judge identified some 15 common issues relating to the torts of conspiracy and 
  fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of the Competition Act. He held that 
  a class proceeding was the preferable procedure for the resolution of those 
  common issues. However, he refused to certify the class action in negligent 
  misrepresentation and the Divisional Court upheld this result. This court held 
  that given the definitions of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, there 
  was no logical or principled basis for treating them differently for the purposes 
  of certification. Since the parties accepted that the action based on fraudulent 
  misrepresentation was properly certified there was no reason not to certify 
  the negligent misrepresentation claim. As MacPherson J.A., speaking for the 
  court, said at para. 42:</p>    
<P class="indent"> I could understand an order certifying, or refusing to certify, 
  both claims. I do not, however, understand why opposite orders were considered 
  appropriate for the two claims.</p>    
<P>
  [50] He went on to point out that several of the common issues related directly 
  to the negligent misrepresentation claim and that the two core issues in the 
  litigation-whether there was gold in the Busang mine and, if not, what was the 
  various defendants' knowledge of that fact-were common to the claims of misrepresentation 
  whether made fraudulently or negligently. Moreover, Bre-X is factually a different 
  case. The foundations of the plaintiffs' case are the public statements made 
  by the Bre-X insiders to sell a single product, Bre-X shares, and the insiders' 
  knowledge that those claims were untrue. This case, on the other hand, will 
  always come down to individual representations made by hundreds of different 
  agents selling a variety of whole life insurance products in widely different 
  circumstances. It has not been suggested that the premium offset feature is 
  per se illegal or misleading. Only if the feature is not properly used does 
  it become misleading.</p>    <P>
  (4) Preferable procedure</p>    <P>
  [51] Even if the appellant were able to get over the common issue problem, I 
  agree with the motions judge that the class action would not be the preferable 
  means of resolving the common issues. The question of preferability should be 
  examined &quot;through the lens of the three principal advantages of class actions 
  - judicial economy, access to justice, and behaviour modification&quot; (Hollick 
  at para. 27).</p>    <P>
  [52] Many of the comments made by the court in Hollick are applicable to this 
  case. Although class actions will be allowable even where there are substantial 
  individual issues, preferability &quot;must take into account the importance 
  of the common issues in relation to the claims as a whole&quot; (Hollick at 
  para. 30). Resolution of the proposed common issues would, in my view, have 
  almost no impact on the claims for the reasons set forth above. In terms of 
  judicial economy, as was said in Hollick at para. 32 &quot;any common issue 
  here is negligible in relation to the individual issues&quot;. Thus, &quot;[o]nce 
  the common issue is seen in the context of the entire claim, it becomes difficult 
  to say that the resolution of the common issue will significantly advance the 
  action&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [53] It seems to me that the comments of Winkler J. in Mouhteros v. DeVry Canada 
  Inc. (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 63 (Gen. Div.) at 73 apply to this case: &quot;[C]ertification 
  in this case will result in a multitude of individual trials, which will completely 
  overwhelm any advantage to be derived from a trial of the few common issues&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [54] I am not persuaded that the appellant has shown that allowing a class action 
  would serve the interests of access to justice. In this respect, the fact that 
  Clarica has established an ADR programme to deal with policyholders' complaints 
  about the premium offset is a relevant, although probably minor, consideration. 
  See Hollick at paragraphs 33-5. More importantly, it seems to me that since 
  resolution of the common issue would play such a minimal role in resolution 
  of the individual claims, the potential members of the class would be faced 
  with the same costs to litigate their claim as if they were bringing the claims 
  as individuals and not members of the class.</p>    <P>
  [55] I acknowledge that the class action could serve the interests of behaviour 
  modification by exposing the vanishing premium/premium offset sales technique 
  to public scrutiny through a class action, assuming that a court were to find 
  that the technique amounted to negligent misrepresentation. However, the other 
  considerations relating to judicial economy and access to justice so far outweigh 
  this consideration that a class action should not be considered a preferable 
  procedure.</p>    <P>
  [56] It is apparent that the appellant has reformulated the common issue in 
  an attempt to bring his case within the holding of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Rumley. The Rumley plaintiffs brought an action against the government of 
  British Columbia for compensatory and punitive damages based upon abuse at a 
  residential school for children with disabilities. The Supreme Court found that 
  the commonality and preferability requirements under the British Columbia Class 
  Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 50 were met. Fundamental issues in that case 
  were the duty of care and whether the government's conduct fell below an acceptable 
  standard. Resolving those issues was necessary to the resolution of each class 
  member's claim. As Nordheimer J. observed in Gariepy v. Shell Oil Co., [2002] 
  O.J. No. 2766 (S.C.J.) at para. 73:</p>    
<P class="indent"> In Rumley, the determination of systemic negligence would have 
  left the members of the class only with the requirement of establishing the 
  fact of the abuse and the injuries that flowed from it. In that sense, the members 
  of the class in Rumley would be left, in essence, with only having to prove 
  their damages.</p>    
<P>
  [57] As I have explained, in this case resolution of the proposed common issue 
  in this case would contribute little, if anything, to the resolution of each 
  class member's claim. McLachlin C.J.C. held in Rumley at para. 30 that plaintiffs 
  are entitled to restrict the grounds of negligence they wish to advance to make 
  the case more amenable to class proceedings. Thus, it was open to the appellant 
  in this case to attempt to establish liability based on the company's systemic 
  negligence rather than vicarious liability for the actions of the agents. However, 
  that does not advance the appellant's position in this case since whether the 
  company is liable on a theory of systemic negligence or vicarious liability, 
  the class members would still have to prove the elements of negligent misrepresentation 
  as set out in Cognos. </p>    <P>
  [58] It may be that a common issue could be framed to assist in litigation of 
  the first element from Cognos, &quot;a duty of care based on a 'special relationship' 
  between the representor and the representee&quot;. In other words, a common 
  issue might be framed to address the question of whether Prudential owed a duty 
  of care to the individual policyholders. However, given that life insurance 
  policies are sold by individual agents having regard to the particular circumstances 
  of the client, resolving that issue would not sufficiently advance the policyholders' 
  cases to make class proceeding the preferable procedure. The centrality of the 
  relationship between the agent and the client dictates that there would have 
  to be an individual inquiry as to whether the premium offset representation 
  was made, how it was made and whether it had any impact in the particular case.</p>    <P>
  [59] In Hollick at para. 19 the court found that &quot;some aspect of the issue 
  of liability is common within the meaning of s. 5(1)(c)&quot; since &quot;[f]or 
  any putative class member to prevail individually, he or she would have to show, 
  among other things, that the respondent emitted pollutants into the air&quot;. 
  The court went on to find that there was a rational connection between the class 
  as defined and the asserted common issues. I have some concern that this element 
  can be satisfied in this case since the class as defined embraces all persons 
  who purchased participating whole life policies issued by Prudential during 
  the specified time period. The difficulty with that definition is that it embraces 
  many policyholders who would not have purchased policies with the premium offset 
  option. Nevertheless, I will put that concern to one side since, as I have pointed 
  out, McLachlin C.J.C. held in Hollick at para. 21 that courts can allow certification 
  on condition that the definition of the class is amended.</p>    <P>
  [60] In Hollick, the Supreme Court refused to certify the class action because 
  it would not be the preferable procedure. The reasoning of the court in Hollick 
  at para. 32, concerning judicial economy, applies in this case:</p>    
<P class="indent"> I am not persuaded that the class action would be the preferable 
  means of resolving the class members' claims. Turning first to the issue of 
  judicial economy, I note that any common issue here is negligible in relation 
  to the individual issues. While each of the class members must, in order to 
  recover, establish that the Keele Valley landfill emitted physical or noise 
  pollution, there is no reason to think that any pollution was distributed evenly 
  across the geographical area or time period specified in the class definition. 
  On the contrary, it is likely that some areas were affected more seriously than 
  others, and that some areas were affected at one time while other areas were 
  affected at other times. As the Divisional Court noted: &quot;[E]ven if one 
  considers only the 150 persons who made complaints -- those complaints relate 
  to different dates and different locations spread out over seven years and 16 
  square miles&quot; (p. 480). Some class members are close to the site, some 
  are further away. Some class members are close to other possible sources of 
  pollution. Once the common issue is seen in the context of the entire claim, 
  it becomes difficult to say that the resolution of the common issue will significantly 
  advance the action [emphasis added].</p>    
<P>
  [61] My earlier discussion concerning access to justice and behaviour modification 
  applies to this theory as well.</p>    <P>
  DISPOSITION</p>    <P>
  [62] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondents shall have ten 
  days from release of these reasons to provide the Senior Legal Officer with 
  submissions on costs and their bill of costs. The appellant may file his submissions 
  as to costs within seven days after receipt of the respondents' submissions. 
  The respondents may respond within 7 days thereafter.</p>
