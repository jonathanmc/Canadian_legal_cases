<p>On appeal from convictions by Justice G. N. Glaude of the Ontario Court of 
  Justice on January 9, 1997 and on appeal from sentence imposed on October 23, 
  1997.</p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] On January 7, 1997, the appellant was convicted of 26 counts of sexual offences 
involving children, including 2 counts of sexual assault, as well as 8 counts 
of possession of child pornography. Following a hearing, the appellant was designated 
a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence in respect of 
the two counts of sexual assault. He was sentenced to a concurrent term of 12 
years and two months in respect of the other counts. The appellant appeals his 
conviction on three of the counts of possession of child pornography and one count 
of sexual exploitation and appeals all aspects of his sentence.</p> 
<p>
  [2] Because the Supreme Court of Canada is currently considering the dangerous 
  offender provisions of the Criminal Code in five cases on appeal from the British 
  Columbia Court of Appeal (R. v. Johnson, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 650; R. v. Kelly, 
  [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 152; R. v. Edgar, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 654; R. v. S.K.M., 
  [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 92; R. v. Smith, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 49), it was agreed 
  that the sentence portion of the appeal would be adjourned and that this panel 
  would proceed only with the conviction appeal.</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to count 21, sexual exploitation of J.M., the Crown concedes 
  that the verdict is unreasonable, the conviction must be quashed and an acquittal 
  entered as the victim was 9 or 10 years old at the time and therefore not a 
  &quot;young person&quot; as defined in s. 153(2) of the Criminal Code (between 
  14 and 18 years).</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>[4] When the police searched the appellant's home, they found slides and film, 
  the subject of four of the charges for possession of child pornography, and 
  four pieces of written material, described in the information as three &quot;pocket 
  novels&quot;: Toward a Perspective for Boy-Lovers (count 37), Vice Versa (count 
  38), and The Asbestos Diary (count 39), and one &quot;newspaper publication&quot;: 
  The Body Politic (count 42). The appeal relates only to two novels and the newspaper 
  article, counts 38, 39 and 42. No appeal was brought in respect of Toward a 
  Perspective for Boy-Lovers, which was found by the trial judge to amount to 
  &quot;nothing less than a 'how to' reference book for men who wish to engage 
  in sexual activity with young boys.&quot;</p>
<p>
  THE TRIAL JUDGE'S FINDINGS AND APPROACH</p>
<p>[5] This trial took place and reasons for judgment were delivered on January 
  9, 1997, well before the Supreme Court of Canada heard argument and released 
  its reasons in R. v. Sharpe, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, where the court explained the 
  constitutional ambit and scope as well as the operation of s. 163.1, the child 
  pornography section of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge therefore made his findings without the guidance of the 
  Supreme Court as to the meaning of certain of the provisions of s. 163.1, its 
  proper operation, and the process to be used by a trier of fact in adjudicating 
  the issues raised by the section and in applying the burden of proof.</p>
<p>
  [7] Section 163.1 of the Code provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 163.1 (1) In this section, &quot;child pornography&quot; means</p>
<p class="indent10">(a) a photographic, film, video or other visual representation, 
  whether or not it was made by electronic or mechanical means,</p>
<p class="indent15">(i) that shows a person who is or is depicted as being under 
  the age of eighteen years and is engaged in or is depicted as engaged in explicit 
  sexual activity, or</p>
<p class="indent15">
  (ii) the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, 
  of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years; 
  or</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (b) any written material or visual representation that advocates or counsels 
  sexual activity with a person under the age of eighteen years that would be 
  an offence under this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (2) Every person who makes, prints, publishes or possesses for the purpose of 
  publication any child pornography is guilty of</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 
  ten years; or</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (3) Every person who imports, distributes, sells or possesses for the purpose 
  of distribution or sale any child pornography is guilty of</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 
  ten years; or</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
<p class="indent">
  (4) Every person who possesses any child pornography is guilty of</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 
  five years; or</p>
<p class="indent10">
  (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
<p class="indent"> (5) It is not a defence to a charge under subsection (2) in 
  respect of a visual representation that the accused believed that a person shown 
  in the representation that is alleged to constitute child pornography was or 
  was depicted as being eighteen years of age or more unless the accused took 
  all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of that person and took all reasonable 
  steps to ensure that, where the person was eighteen years of age or more, the 
  representation did not depict that person as being under the age of eighteen 
  years.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) Where the accused is charged with an offence under subsection 
  (2), (3) or (4), the court shall find the accused not guilty if the representation 
  or written material that is alleged to constitute child pornography has artistic 
  merit or an educational, scientific or medical purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">(7) Subsections 163(3) to (5) apply, with such modifications 
  as the circumstances require, with respect to an offence under subsection (2), 
  (3) or (4).</p>
<p>[8] After finding that the appellant knowingly possessed the 
  impugned material, the trial judge dealt with the defences set out in s. 163.1(6): 
  artistic merit, or educational, scientific or medical purpose. He referred to 
  the defences as lawful justification or excuse, and made the following finding: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> I am of the view that no doubt has been raised with respect 
  to lawful justification, no defence of artistic merit, or educational, or a 
  scientific or medical purpose has been presented. </p>
<p class="indent">In my view, if the Crown is able to satisfy this court beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the documents in question are pornographic, the failure 
  of the accused to testify leaves it open to the court to draw an inference that 
  no legal justification exists.</p>
<p class="indent">In the circumstances of this case, I draw that inference.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge then turned to what he referred to as &quot;the only real 
  issue&quot; in the case, to determine whether the Crown had satisfied the court 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the materials are child pornography. The Crown's 
  position was that the impugned materials advocated or counselled sexual activity 
  with a person under 18 and relied on s. 163.1(b). The Crown led expert evidence 
  from Detective Constable Goldschmidt, an officer who had been dealing with obscenity 
  investigations since 1991 and in that context had viewed tens of thousands of 
  videos, thousands of magazines, and several hundred books. His opinion was that 
  the four impugned books were pornography.</p>
<p>
  [10] The two novels, The Asbestos Diary and Vice Versa, were written by one 
  author, Casimir Dukahz. The Asbestos Diary was published in 1966 and Vice Versa 
  was printed in 1976. Each has a Library of Congress catalogue number. The trial 
  judge described both as containing &quot;vignettes of sexual episodes between 
  an adult and a boy, ranging in the age of twelve to eighteen years.&quot; The 
  expert witness's opinion was that both counselled or advocated sexual activity 
  with a person under 18. The trial judge concluded that &quot;all of these vignettes 
  have, as a purpose, to legitimize and to encourage this type of sexual activity 
  between adults and young boys.&quot; The trial judge recognized the artistry 
  of the works, but concluded that their net effect was to encourage and thus 
  advocate the illegal activity.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Body Politic was a newspaper which contained an article &quot;Men Loving 
  Boys Loving Men&quot; first published in 1977, before the new child pornography 
  legislation was proclaimed, and was the subject of obscenity charges and acquittals 
  at the time. The article was reprinted in 1979. The trial judge found that the 
  author of the article was advocating changes to the legislation prohibiting 
  sexual activity between men and boys by using detailed accounts of such activity. 
  Detective Goldschmidt noted that the article did not point out the possibility 
  of harm to the young boys from the sexual activity but rather said that sexual 
  contact would benefit them, and that it is the laws that are harmful. The trial 
  judge agreed with the expert that this article fell within s. 163.1(b). He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am unable to disagree with that view. In the end, the author's wish to advocate 
  for changes in the legislation takes a back seat to his advocating ongoing sexual 
  relations between men and young boys, which, given the proclamation of the pornography 
  legislation in the 1990's, falls within that new law, and accordingly I find 
  the accused guilty of possession of this pornographic material contained in 
  count 42.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES AND ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant says that in light of the Sharpe decision, the trial judge 
  erred in three ways: (i) by relying on the expert opinion in finding that the 
  material was child pornography; (ii) by applying the wrong test; and (iii) by 
  failing to properly consider the availability of the defences.</p>
<p>
  [13] In Sharpe, the Supreme Court set out the tests for the application of the 
  subsections of s. 163.1 and the meaning to be given to those subsections. For 
  the purpose of this case, the following explanations and interpretations by 
  the Supreme Court are relevant and applicable: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) &quot;&#133;Parliament's goal was to prohibit possession 
  of child pornography that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children. The primary 
  definition of 'child pornography' does not embrace every kind of material that 
  might conceivably pose a risk of harm to children, but appears rather to target 
  blatantly pornographic material. Additionally, the defences exempt classes of 
  material raising special free expression concerns. In this way, Parliament has 
  attempted to meet the dual concerns of protecting children and protecting free 
  speech.&quot; (para. 74).</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Courts must take an objective approach to determining whether 
  material falls within the definition of child pornography based on what a reasonable 
  person would conclude. In the context of impugned written material, this means 
  that the terms &quot;advocates&quot; and &quot;counsels&quot; in ss. (1)(b) 
  require that &quot;the material, viewed objectively, must be seen as 'actively 
  inducing' or encouraging the described offences with children.&quot; It is not 
  enough for the material to describe the criminal act. It must &quot;send the 
  message that sex with children can and should be pursued.&quot; (para. 56).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The offence is committed only when what is advocated is 
  a criminal offence. Certain consensual acts with persons under 18 but over 13, 
  or in some cases 14, do not constitute an offence. (See ss. 151, 152, 153 of 
  the Code.)</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The statutory defences are to be liberally interpreted. 
  The defence of artistic merit is very broad and includes &quot;any expression 
  that may reasonably be viewed as art&quot;(para. 63). The New Shorter Oxford 
  English Dictionary on Historical Principles (1993) vol. 1, p.120 definition 
  of &quot;art&quot; includes &quot;the production according to aesthetic principles, 
  of works of the imagination, imitation or design.&quot; The determination of 
  what is &quot;art&quot; is to be made by the trial judge on the basis of a variety 
  of factors including the subjective intention of the creator, the form and content 
  of the work, its connections with artistic conventions, traditions or styles, 
  the opinion of experts, and the mode of production, display and distribution. 
  The factors will be refined as the case law develops (para. 64). The defence 
  is not limited to good art or to talented or experienced artists (para. 63).</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The artistic merit defence does not operate on the same 
  criteria for child pornography as for obscenity (s. 163). Consequently, there 
  is no internal necessity aspect to the defence for child pornography, that is, 
  that the sexual aspect must be essential to a wider artistic purpose. There 
  is also no qualification on the artistic merit defence which would import a 
  requirement that the work must comport with community standards of tolerance 
  in the sense of not posing a risk of harm to children (paras. 65 and 67).</p>
<p class="indent">(6) Procedurally, the test for the defence of artistic merit 
  is objective. It functions in the same manner as other defences such as self-defence, 
  provocation or necessity. Once the accused raises the defence, the Crown must 
  disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused raises the defence by pointing 
  to facts capable of supporting it. This will generally be something more than 
  just an assertion of the subjective intent of the creator (para. 66). However, 
  there is no suggestion that an accused is required to testify in order to raise 
  the defence.</p>
<p>
  [14] In my view, it is clear that without the benefit of the Sharpe decision, 
  the trial judge in this case did not approach the analysis of determining whether 
  the impugned material is child pornography, whether the defence of artistic 
  merit applies, or the proper onus of proof in respect of raising and disproving 
  the defence, in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>
  [15] First, the trial judge appears to have discounted the availability of the 
  defence of artistic merit on the basis that the appellant did not testify. Consequently, 
  having concluded that the defence was not raised, he did not put the onus on 
  the Crown to disprove it. The result is particularly incongruous because the 
  trial judge made certain observations when describing the impugned material 
  which suggest artistic merit and therefore raise the defence. For example, when 
  discussing The Asbestos Diary and Vice Versa, the trial judge describes the 
  language as &quot;flowery&quot;, says that the author &quot;masters the English 
  language&quot; and refers to the author as &quot;a modern day Chaucer in that 
  he describes the vilest sexual acts in a quiet poetic way.&quot; And further 
  on: &quot;I am mindful that, to a certain degree, there is a type of artistry, 
  warped as it is, to the delivery of these vignettes&#133;.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [16] Second, the trial judge accepted the expert's definition of child pornography 
  as material that counsels or advocates sexual activity with a person under 18. 
  This represents too broad an approach, as there must be the advocacy of an offence, 
  which requires further analysis of the age of the child involved, if the child 
  is over 13 as described in paragraph [13](2) and (3) above. This error may have 
  no significance, however, because the trial judge described the material as 
  relating to boys ranging from 12 to 18 years.</p>
<p>
  [17] Third, it is not clear that the trial judge considered and applied the 
  terms &quot;advocate&quot; and &quot;counsel&quot; in the strict and purposive 
  way prescribed by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, without the benefit of the Supreme Court decision in Sharpe, 
  the trial judge in this case did not properly analyze and address the issues 
  raised in the application of s. 163.1 in accordance with the principles and 
  interpretative directions set out in that decision. Most significantly, the 
  trial judge did not properly consider the availability of the defence of artistic 
  merit as it has been explained by the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>
  [19] I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and order 
  a new trial on counts 38, 39 and 42. The appellant suggested that the matter 
  need not be retried but that this court could decide it based upon the principles 
  set out in Sharpe and on the existing record. In my view that approach would 
  not be appropriate. As indicated, the law has been significantly clarified both 
  substantially and procedurally by the Supreme Court in Sharpe. The evidence 
  led at trial and the trial judge's findings are based on a different model. 
  A new trial is required in which the trial judge can assess the case on the 
  basis of evidence that is both relevant and admissible having regard to the 
  principles set forth in Sharpe. In respect of count 21, </p>
<p>
  [20] I would allow the appeal and enter an acquittal.</p>
