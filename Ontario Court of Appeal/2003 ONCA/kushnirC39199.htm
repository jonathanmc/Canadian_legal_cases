<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, as a result of a combination of the letter of October 3, 2001 
  and the voicemail message of October 5, 2001, there was a concluded agreement 
  between Ms. Kushnir and Mr. Pape that Ms. Kushnir would pay Mr. Pape's account 
  in accordance with the terms of the October 3, 2001 letter. As part of that 
  agreement, Ms. Kushnir gave up her right to have Mr. Pape's account assessed. 
  We see no reason in the circumstances of this case to override that agreement. 
</p>
<p>[2] As a result, the order of Laforme J. of November 5, 2002 is set aside and 
  an order shall go ordering the petitioner Lorri Kushnir to pay the appellant 
  the sum of $32,384.87. Costs of the appeal and below are ordered in favour of 
  the appellant, Mr. Pape, fixed in the amounts of $3,500 and $1,000 respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;R.R. McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;<br>
  &quot;J.M. Simmons J.A.&quot;<br>
