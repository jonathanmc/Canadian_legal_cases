<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On this appeal, McCarthy T&eacute;trault asks this court to make a charging 
  order over certain assets belonging to the respondent. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, the law firm is not entitled to such a lien. The facts in 
  this case do not support a finding that the law firm's services, which included 
  obtaining a non-depletion order, were instrumental in obtaining the funds ultimately 
  recovered. Instrumentality is required to support a charging order. See Higgott 
  and Higgott (1989), 38 C.P.C. (2d) 42 and Blue Resources Ltd. v. Sheriff (1996), 
  97 C.P.C. (3d) 200. Moreover, there is no evidence that the respondent cannot 
  or will not pay the account. In fact, she has confirmed that she has sufficient 
  assets to satisfy the assessment award and has undertaken to pay the award within 
  thirty days after the assessment. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the McCarthy T&eacute;trault appeal is dismissed. Costs to 
  the respondent fixed in the amount of $1,500.</p>
