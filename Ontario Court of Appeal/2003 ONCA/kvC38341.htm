<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice J.J. Douglas of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated April 29, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] We have concluded that this appeal must be allowed, the conviction set aside 
  and an acquittal entered. The appellant was convicted of sexual assault of a 
  seven-year-old child. The incident allegedly occurred during the evening of 
  December 31, 2000 and January 1, 2001. At the time, the appellant, who was 14 
  years of age, was babysitting the complainant and her younger brother and sister. 
  The complainant testified that the appellant briefly touched her pubic area 
  underneath her pyjamas when the two of them were watching television.</p>
<p>
  [2] The manner in which the allegation against the appellant surfaced is central 
  to an understanding of why the conviction cannot stand. The complainant's mother 
  is a nurse. She had taught her daughter about inappropriate touching. When she 
  returned home in the early morning hours of January 1, the complainant seemed 
  normal and made no complaint about the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant 
  became the family's regular babysitter and during this entire time of many months 
  the complainant not only made no complaint about the appellant but acted completely 
  normal around the appellant. According to the mother, the complainant never 
  showed any reluctance to have the appellant as her babysitter and was happy 
  to see him.</p>
<p>
  [3] In July 2001, the appellant's parents went to the complainant's parents 
  and disclosed to them that the appellant had been charged with sexual assault 
  in connection with babysitting another child. The appellant's parents were hoping 
  to get a letter of reference from the complainant's parents. The mother was 
  quite willing to do so. The father was not and concluded that the appellant 
  was a child molester. By this time, the complainant's parents had separated, 
  although they continued to reside in the same house. The question of the letter 
  became another point of contention with the couple.</p>
<p>
  [4] On August 1, 2001, the father told the complainant that the appellant had 
  done something bad with a four-year-old girl and that the police had charged 
  him. According to the father, the complainant spontaneously told him that the 
  appellant had tried to put his hands up her pyjamas. The father then left a 
  note for his wife (the two were no longer communicating verbally) telling her 
  to ask the complainant about something she had told him. The mother did so and 
  the complainant disclosed the assault to her. The mother testified that it was 
  contrary to the complainant's usual character not to have told her about the 
  incident. She was very surprised that the complainant made this disclosure to 
  her husband and not to her. She testified that she believed that her husband 
  was looking for ways to get back at her for having ended the marriage.</p>
<p>
  [5] The father claimed that he said nothing to his daughter other than as set 
  out above. The trial judge found the father to be a very unsatisfactory witness. 
  The trial judge described him as evasive and having an evident bias against 
  the appellant. He was shown to have contradicted himself on some important parts 
  of his testimony. In particular, he gave two entirely different accounts of 
  the complainant's demeanour when she made the disclosure to him.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge approached the case on the basis that there were essentially 
  two alternatives. Either the complainant was telling the truth or she and her 
  father had deliberately fabricated a false allegation against the appellant. 
  He resolved that issue in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent"> Two things are, I believe, important here: the inherent rationality 
  of the theory of fabrication, and its consistency with the evidence of the witnesses. 
  I recognize that distressed spouses all too often use children to get even with 
  their opposite member. Your classic case would be an allegation of some form 
  of abuse, both to get even and to enforce or extend property or custodial rights.</p>
<p class="indent">The theory here, however, is either far subtler or far-fetched. 
  If true, the result is the father's daughter is exposed to the difficulties 
  of the court process. The mother is not embarrassed or deprived of anything 
  and the father gains little except the fleeting capacity to say I was right, 
  and you were wrong about the complainant in his letter of reference. One would 
  think a mind so malignant as to unnecessarily expose his young daughter to the 
  difficulties of the criminal courts for so little gain would at least assist 
  her in that fabrication by supporting her case where he could, in his testimony, 
  yet he does not.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, the hypothesized explanation does not withstand scrutiny 
  and finds no support in the evidence, notwithstanding my agreement as to the 
  apparent unwillingness of the father to tell the truth about many matters.</p>
<p>
  [7] In our view, by proceeding in this way the trial judge misapprehended both 
  the nature of the defence and the serious problem posed by the manner in which 
  the disclosure was made and the impact of the negative finding about the father's 
  credibility. The real issue here was the reliability of the complainant's account 
  of what occurred. The trial judge had to come to grips with the impact of the 
  manner of disclosure on the reliability of the complainant's evidence. This 
  he failed to do.</p>
<p>
  [8] The issue was not whether the father deliberately fabricated a false allegation 
  but whether suggestions by the father may have led the complainant to believe 
  that she had been assaulted. The manner in which the father approached his daughter 
  was fraught with peril. Nevertheless, it might have been open to a trier of 
  fact to discount this aspect of the case, if the father's evidence could be 
  relied upon. However, as we have said, the trial judge found that he could not 
  rely on the father's evidence. The fact that the father gave inconsistent versions 
  of the disclosure episode itself is particularly troubling.</p>
<p>
  [9] We are also concerned with the manner in which the trial judge dealt with 
  the delay in disclosing the incident to the mother. It is accepted that both 
  children and adults who have been assaulted may delay in making disclosure of 
  a sexual assault. As Major J. said in R. v. D. (D.) (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 
  41 (S.C.C.) at para. 65: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A trial judge should recognize and so instruct a jury that there is no inviolable 
  rule how people who are the victims of trauma like a sexual assault will behave. 
  Some will make an immediate complaint, some will delay in disclosing the abuse, 
  while some will never disclose the abuse. Reasons for delay are many and at 
  least include embarrassment, fear, guilt, or a lack of understanding and knowledge. 
  In assessing the credibility of a complainant, the timing of the complaint is 
  simply one circumstance to consider in the factual mosaic of a particular case. 
  A delay in disclosure, standing alone, will never give rise to an adverse inference 
  against the credibility of the complainant [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge resolved the issue of the delay in disclosure by concluding 
  that the complainant did not perceive that the touching by the appellant was 
  improper. That finding was not reasonably open on these facts. The mother had 
  told her child about bad touching. In her evidence, the complainant said that 
  when the appellant touched her, it hurt. Her description of the incident clearly 
  showed an improper touching and the father claimed that the complainant immediately, 
  with no prompting from him, disclosed the improper touching by the appellant. 
  Those facts are inconsistent with the trial judge's finding that the reason 
  for the delay was that the complainant did not realize the touching was improper. 
  They are more consistent with the defence theory that the child came to believe 
  she had been touched because of the suggestive way in which the father elicited 
  the complaint.</p>
<p>
  [11] Equally troubling is that the trial judge failed to consider the impact 
  on the reliability of the complainant's evidence of his own finding that the 
  child did not perceive the events as improper. Taken with the manner in which 
  the disclosure was elicited, we think this seriously undermined the prosecution 
  case.</p>
<p>
  [12] In these circumstances, the verdict cannot stand. We have considered whether 
  the appropriate disposition is to order a new trial or to enter an acquittal. 
  We are of the view that an acquittal must be entered. On this record, no trier 
  of fact acting reasonably would ever be in a position to determine the real 
  circumstances that led to the disclosure. That was a pivotal issue in the case. 
  Since the father could not be relied upon to give an accurate account, a trier 
  of fact would never be able to make a proper assessment of the reliability of 
  the complainant's account. The trial judge found that the complainant was an 
  honest witness but that is only one aspect of the issue. The real question here 
  was the reliability of the account and on this record a finding in favour of 
  the prosecution would be unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [13] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed and an acquittal 
  entered.</p>
