<p>On appeal from the summary conviction appeal judgment of Justice Eugene G. 
  Ewaschuk of the Superior Court of Justice dated June 28, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondents were charged on an information reading: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On or about the 26th day of August, 1997, in the City of Scarborough, in the 
  Toronto Region, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, did wilfully promote 
  hatred against an identifiable group, to wit Roma, by communicating statements, 
  including the written statements: &quot;Honk if you hate Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Canada 
  is not a Trash Can&quot;, and &quot;Your [sic] a cancer to Canada&quot;, contrary 
  to the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondents conceded that Roma was an identifiable group but said nothing 
  as to gypsies.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown appeals from the order of Ewaschuk J., sitting as a Summary Conviction 
  Appeals Court judge, dismissing an appeal from an order of Otter J. dismissing 
  the above information against the respondents. During argument at the conclusion 
  of the trial and after the respondents had elected not to call evidence, their 
  counsel submitted that, although there was an admission that Roma is an identifiable 
  group, there was no evidence that the respondents had directed hatred at Roma. 
  The evidence showed only that the chants and signs promoting hatred targeted 
  gypsies, not Roma, and that as a result, it was argued the respondents should 
  be discharged.</p>
<p>
  [4] In response to the argument of the defence, the Crown sought to amend the 
  information to read &quot;Roma a.k.a. gypsies&quot;. The trial judge refused. 
  The Crown then asked the trial judge to take judicial notice of the dictionary 
  definitions of Roma. Again, the trial judge declined. Finally, the Crown asked 
  the trial judge to reopen the trial to permit the Crown to call evidence that 
  gypsies are the same as Roma. The trial judge refused this application as well 
  and as a result he dismissed the charges.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown appealed, challenging each of the three rulings referred to in 
  the previous paragraph. Ewaschuk J. dismissed the appeal. The Crown's application 
  for leave to appeal to this court challenges the same three rulings that were 
  considered by the summary conviction appeal court. </p>
<p>
  [6] As to judicial notice, at trial the Crown asked that the court take judicial 
  notice of the dictionary definitions of Roma (singular - Rom) in order to establish 
  that Roma are gypsies or are known as gypsies. In support of its application, 
  the Crown referred to five dictionaries. Although the language in each is not 
  exactly the same, all of the dictionaries referred to Rom as a gypsy. In some 
  instances, the definitions were limited to a man or boy gypsy. </p>
<p>
  [7] There are two bases on which a court may take judicial notice of a fact. 
  The one that is relevant to this case covers facts which are capable of immediate 
  and accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible sources of indisputable 
  accuracy: Sidney W. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, Sopinka's The Law of Evidence 
  in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1999) at para. 19.13.</p>
<p>
  [8] Given that the Crown asked nothing more than that the trial judge take judicial 
  notice of definitions found in standard dictionaries and given that those definitions 
  were relatively consistent, the trial judge should probably have acceded to 
  the Crown's request and taken notice of those definitions. However, the trial 
  judge's error, if there was one, is not dispositive of the application before 
  this court.</p>
<p>
  [9] In dismissing the summary conviction appeal, Ewaschuk J. found that there 
  was no evidence that the respondents had targeted Roma. He reasoned that even 
  if one accepted that Roma are a subset of gypsies (as the dictionary definitions 
  would have shown), that would not have been sufficient to found convictions; 
  rather, it would be necessary to show that the words Roma and gypsies are interchangeable 
  (according to the dictionaries they are not). Only then would it be established 
  that the hatred targeted at gypsies was targeted at Roma. Put another way, Ewaschuk 
  J. concluded that even if the trial judge had taken judicial notice of the fact 
  that gypsies include Roma, the result of the trial would have been the same. 
  That conclusion turned on an assessment of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [10] It was suggested in argument before us that the reason that the Crown specified 
  Roma rather than gypsies as the identifiable group in the information was in 
  order to be sensitive to the Roma people. The term gypsy in its broadest sense 
  is often used to refer to people who lead a nomadic life, and for many Roma, 
  the term gypsy conjures up unflattering or stereotypical images. For example, 
  one dictionary definition of a gypsy is &quot;a cunning rogue&quot;: Oxford 
  English Dictionary 2nd ed. We understand the Crown's concern for sensitivity; 
  however, what seems to be common ground is that not all people who are referred 
  to as gypsies are in fact Roma.</p>
<p>
  [11] Pursuant to s. 839(1) of the Criminal Code, an appeal lies to this court 
  with leave on a question of law alone. The Crown's challenge in this court is 
  to the decision of the summary conviction appeal court. The decision of the 
  summary conviction appeal court relating to the judicial notice ground was based 
  on an assessment of the evidence. The Crown's challenge in this court does not 
  raise a question of law. Therefore, we would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [12] Moreover, the trial judge's decision not to take judicial notice was an 
  exercise of discretion. Likewise, the trial judge's refusals to amend the information 
  or to allow the Crown to reopen its case were discretionary rulings. Noting 
  the very late stage of the trial at which the Crown made the applications in 
  issue, Ewaschuk J. declined to interfere with the trial judge's exercises of 
  discretion. We see no basis upon which to interfere with his decision.</p>
<p>
  [13] There was a further ground of appeal presupposing a new trial. It is now 
  redundant.</p>
<p>
  [14] Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
