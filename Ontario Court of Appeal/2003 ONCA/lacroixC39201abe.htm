<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant was sentenced on a joint submission to two years in a penitentiary 
  followed by three years probation. On appeal he seeks to vary the custodial 
  part of his sentence to two years less a day. The Crown does not oppose the 
  variation.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant faces a deportation order. Under the Immigration and Refugee 
  Act he can appeal that order only if his sentence is less than two years. At 
  the time of sentencing the appellant was unaware of and, therefore, did not 
  make known to the trial judge the immigration consequences of his sentencing. 
  These consequences are a relevant consideration on sentence. No disservice to 
  the fitness of the sentence would be caused by the variation the appellant seeks. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, the sentence appeal is allowed and the custodial part of the 
  sentence is reduced to two years less a day. The other terms of the sentence 
  remain in place. </p>
