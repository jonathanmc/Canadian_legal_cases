<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice M.J. Girard of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated December 20, 2000, and the sentence imposed dated February 
  27, 2001.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of fraud over $5,000 and possession of stolen 
  property valued at over $5,000. He received a sentence of 15 months. The appellant 
  appeals conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] I would allow the conviction appeal and order a new trial. The trial judge's 
  reasons fail to come to grips with substantial potentially significant evidence 
  on the only material fact in issue. The deficiency in the reasons forecloses 
  meaningful appellate review of the trial judge's finding that the appellant 
  was wilfully blind.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown alleged that the appellant, who sold used cars in Welland, Ontario, 
  received and sold stolen cars for various car dealers in Quebec. According to 
  the Crown's theory, vehicles that had been wrecked in crashes, usually in the 
  United States, were purchased at auction by the Quebec dealers. The wrecked 
  vehicles were imported into Canada, where they underwent various registrations, 
  including a registration in Ontario as a &quot;fit&quot; vehicle. By registering 
  the vehicles in Ontario, the Quebec dealers avoided the registration scheme 
  in place in Quebec. Under that scheme, the wrecked vehicles had to be identified 
  as severely damaged and had to undergo one and perhaps two inspections before 
  resale.</p>
<p>
  [4] It was also the Crown's theory that vehicles of the same make and model 
  as the purchased wrecked vehicles were stolen from various locations. The vehicle 
  identification numbers (VIN) on the stolen vehicles were removed and replaced 
  with the VIN from the corresponding wrecked vehicles. The revinned stolen vehicles 
  were then sold through various retail outlets, including the appellant's business, 
  as used vehicles that had been repaired after an accident. </p>
<p>
  [5] It was the Crown's position that the appellant was involved in &quot;cleaning&quot; 
  the title of the wrecked vehicles by registering the vehicles in Ontario for 
  the Quebec dealers. The Crown also alleged that between November 1997 and November 
  1998 the appellant took delivery of some 30 stolen vehicles and sold 24 of those 
  to members of the public. The other six vehicles were in his possession when 
  he was arrested in November 1998. At trial, the defence accepted that the 30 
  vehicles had been stolen and revinned.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant testified that he registered the wrecked vehicles in Ontario 
  as &quot;fit&quot; for the Quebec dealers. He said that to his knowledge, there 
  was nothing illegal about registering those vehicles in Ontario, and that it 
  was common practice for individuals involved in the car business in Quebec to 
  register vehicles in Ontario to avoid the labelling and inspection requirements 
  imposed when vehicles were registered in Quebec. Ontario later adopted a labelling 
  scheme like Quebec's, thereby closing this loophole in the Ontario registration 
  scheme. The appellant received a fee of about $200 per vehicle for registering 
  the vehicles in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant also testified that he sold vehicles on consignment for the 
  dealers in Quebec during the same period that he was registering vehicles for 
  them. He believed that the vehicles he sold had been involved in accidents and 
  repaired. He was advised orally of the nature of the damage to each vehicle 
  by the Quebec dealers before he sold it. All of the contracts that the appellant 
  completed with the purchasers identified the vehicles as &quot;accident repair&quot;. 
  The appellant testified that the prices he received for those vehicles were 
  consistent with prices that he would expect to obtain for used vehicles that 
  had been damaged in accidents and repaired before resale.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant did business with the dealers in Quebec from 1996 through 
  1998. He insisted that he was unaware that any of the vehicles provided to him 
  were stolen. </p>
<p>
  [9] Two Quebec police officers visited the appellant in November 1997. They 
  told him that the individuals with whom he was doing business in Quebec were 
  dealing in stolen automobiles. The officers explained that VINs on the stolen 
  vehicles were replaced with VINs taken from wrecked automobiles. They advised 
  the appellant that by registering the wrecked vehicles in Ontario, he was assisting 
  in the scheme. The officers identified the Labbe brothers and Laurent Laroche 
  as persons who were involved in the car theft scheme. They warned the appellant 
  against continuing to do business with these individuals, but did not accuse 
  the appellant of any wrongdoing in his prior business dealings with them. </p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant said that after he spoke with the Quebec police officers, 
  he became suspicious that the vehicles being sent to him from Quebec were stolen. 
  He called Mr. Laroche, whom he had never met. Laroche assured him that the cars 
  were not stolen, that he had no criminal record, and that the police had been 
  harassing him since 1992. The appellant said that he was satisfied with Laroche's 
  explanation and continued to do business with him. </p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant next spoke to Laroche after the appellant received a subpoena 
  for Laroche's trial in September 1998. The appellant was upset and called Laroche. 
  He demanded an explanation for the charges given that Laroche had assured him 
  that the cars were not stolen. Laroche again assured him that nothing untoward 
  was going on. The appellant continued to do business with Laroche.</p>
<p>
  [12] About a month after the second call, the appellant was advised by the Quebec 
  police that it would be unnecessary for him to attend court in Quebec. The appellant 
  placed a third call to Laroche who told him that the charges had been withdrawn, 
  thereby confirming his earlier assurances to the appellant. The charges against 
  Laroche were in fact withdrawn in November 1998. The appellant was arrested 
  a short time later and charged with fraud and possession of stolen property. 
  </p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Reasons for Judgment</p>
<p>
  [13] The evidence at trial was lengthy and in some ways complex, especially 
  as it related to the registration and re-registration of many of these vehicles. 
  However, as Crown counsel observed in this Court, the case ultimately came down 
  to a single issue - had the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
  appellant knew the vehicles were stolen? The Crown could meet this onus by proving 
  actual knowledge or by proving that the appellant was wilfully blind to the 
  fact that the vehicles were stolen. At trial, the Crown placed considerable 
  reliance on wilful blindness.</p>
<p>
  [14] The reasons for judgment are long. They deal extensively with the history 
  of the 30 stolen vehicles and of various registrations of the corresponding 
  wrecked vehicles. Much of this evidence was not in dispute. The trial judge 
  also describes in detail the registration scheme in Quebec, the appellant's 
  knowledge of that scheme and the &quot;cleaning&quot; of titles in Ontario to 
  avoid the Quebec registration requirements. The trial judge found that the appellant 
  began &quot;cleaning&quot; the titles of the wrecked vehicles for the Quebec 
  dealers in 1996. Significantly, the trial judge concluded that the appellant's 
  suspicions that the vehicles he was selling for those dealers were stolen did 
  not arise until the appellant was visited by the Quebec police officers over 
  a year later in November 1997. </p>
<p>
  [15] The meeting with the Quebec police officers in November 1997 figured prominently 
  at the trial and the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the officers and the 
  appellant concerning that meeting in some detail. He accepted the officers' 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge next summarized the appellant's evidence of the telephone 
  conversation he had with Laroche after the meeting with the Quebec police officers. 
  The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; The accused was informed that his involvement with cleaning titles of 
  seriously damaged vehicles was likely to assist Mr. Laroche in dealing with 
  stolen vehicles and with the sale of vehicles which had been revinned and yet 
  without further investigation or inquiry, the accused proceeds to continue to 
  deal with Mr. Laroche and with Mr. Gilles Labbe and the Labbe brothers. </p>
<p>
  [17] After summarizing the undisputed evidence concerning the theft and sale 
  of the vehicles between November 1997 and November 1998, the trial judge then 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, the activities of the accused subsequent to the communications of 
  the 26th of November, 1997 are relevant in assessing his state of mind.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge referred to three parts of the evidence which, in his view, 
  were relevant to the appellant's state of mind. The first was a newspaper article 
  dated March 12, 1998 found in the appellant's office when he was arrested. That 
  article outlined a car theft scheme similar to the one described to the appellant 
  by the Quebec police officers. The trial judge held that the appellant had read 
  the article and would have realized that by &quot;cleaning&quot; the titles 
  for the Quebec dealers, he was engaged in conduct that was consistent with the 
  theft scheme described in the newspaper article.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge next referred to the labelling system used in the registration 
  scheme in Quebec and the appellant's knowledge of it. The third area of evidence 
  referred to by the trial judge was the documentation process as it related to 
  the sale of the stolen vehicles. He referred both to the documentation that 
  was prepared and the absence of documentation relating to some aspects of the 
  transactions.</p>
<p>
  [20] These three areas of the evidence were relevant to the appellant's state 
  of mind. I would observe, however, that the newspaper article did not contain 
  any information of significance that had not been provided to the appellant 
  by the Quebec police officers four months earlier in November 1997, and that 
  the appellant's knowledge of the Quebec branding system existed from 1996 when 
  the appellant first began doing business with the Quebec dealers. The trial 
  judge found, however, that the appellant had no reason to suspect that the vehicles 
  were stolen until over a year later. </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge next turned briefly to the doctrine of recent possession, 
  quoting from two of the leading authorities. Thereafter, he made no further 
  reference to this doctrine or its potential applicability until he articulated 
  his ultimate conclusion on count 2 (possession of stolen property): </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; I am satisfied that the explanation of the accused for 
  his possession is not one which might reasonably be true having come to the 
  conclusion that for the accused to proceed after the date of the 26th of November, 
  1997 with transactions involving Mr. Laroche and/or the Labbe brothers constitutes 
  self-deception to the point of wilful blindness.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge considered the applicability of the wilful blindness doctrine 
  in some detail. He referred to several authorities, including the often cited 
  passage from Professor Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part, 2d ed. 1961 
  at p. 157: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; The rule is that if a party has his suspicion aroused but then deliberately 
  omits to make further inquiries, because he wishes to remain in ignorance, he 
  is deemed to have knowledge.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge found that the appellant was wilfully blind. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; I am satisfied that the accused Mr. Lagace became aware of the need for 
  some inquiry after the communications of November 26, 1997 and he declined to 
  make inquiries other than one telephone call to Mr. Laroche (whom he had never 
  met) because he did not wish to know the truth. He preferred to remain ignorant. 
  In effect, the accused deliberately failed to inquire when he knew there was 
  reason for inquiry. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  The Grounds of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [24] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the convictions were unreasonable. 
  The court did not require argument from the Crown on this issue. There was ample 
  evidence to support the convictions. </p>
<p>
  [25] Counsel also argued that the trial judge misapplied the wilful blindness 
  doctrine. He submitted that only a suspicion that the vehicles were probably 
  stolen, as opposed to some lower level of suspicion, triggered the requirement 
  for inquiry. Counsel contended that the trial judge did not consider the appellant's 
  level of suspicion after his conversation with the Quebec police officers.</p>
<p>
  [26] I would reject this submission. I see no need to quantify the level of 
  suspicion beyond the recognition that it must be a real suspicion in the mind 
  of the accused that causes the accused to see the need for inquiry: R. v. Sansregret 
  (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) at 235 (S.C.C.); R. v. Jorgensen (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 
  97 at 135 (S.C.C.); R. v. Duong (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 392 at 401-402 (Ont. 
  C.A.). The appellant on his own evidence was sufficiently suspicious that the 
  vehicles were stolen that he immediately made an inquiry of the owner of the 
  vehicles. In my view, the potential application of the wilful blindness doctrine 
  did not require that the trial judge describe the level of suspicion beyond 
  the finding that it was sufficient in the appellant's mind to call for an inquiry. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] Counsel for the appellant also argues that as a matter of law, the doctrine 
  of wilful blindness could not operate against the appellant because he made 
  an inquiry after his suspicion was aroused.</p>
<p>
  [28] I disagree. Culpability on the basis of wilful blindness rests on a finding 
  of deliberate ignorance. An accused who suspects that property is stolen but 
  declines to make the inquiries that will confirm that suspicion, preferring 
  instead to remain ignorant is culpable. Where an accused makes some inquiry, 
  the question remains whether that accused harboured real suspicions after that 
  inquiry and refrained from making further inquiries because she preferred to 
  remain ignorant of the truth. Where some inquiry is made, the nature of that 
  inquiry will be an important consideration in determining whether the accused 
  remained suspicious and chose to refrain from further inquiry because she preferred 
  to remain deliberately ignorant of the truth. For example, a finding that an 
  accused took all reasonable steps to determine the truth would be inconsistent 
  with the conclusion that the accused was wilfully blind: R. v. Mara, [1997] 
  2 S.C.R. 630 at para. 51. </p>
<p>
  [29] I, of course, do not suggest that there is any onus on the accused to demonstrate 
  that all reasonable steps were taken. In any case where the Crown relies on 
  the doctrine of wilful blindness and some inquiry has been made, the trier of 
  fact will have to decide whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that despite that inquiry the accused remained suspicious and refrained from 
  making any further inquiry because she preferred to remain ignorant of the truth. 
  As I read the trial judge's reasons, he held that the appellant's inquiry did 
  not remove his suspicion and that no further inquiry was made because the appellant 
  chose not to confirm his suspicion, preferring ignorance over the truth. </p>
<p>
  [30] Counsel for the appellant next argues that the trial judge failed to consider 
  many significant parts of the evidence that were potentially probative of the 
  appellant's state of mind and supported his contention that the Crown had not 
  proved that he was wilfully blind after November 1997. Counsel submits that 
  the trial judge's failure to address this evidence must leave this court unable 
  to determine how the trial judge reached his verdict. </p>
<p>
  [31] Despite the able and forceful submissions made by Ms. Woollcombe on behalf 
  of the Crown, I think this submission must succeed. An accused must not be left 
  in doubt as to why he was convicted. An accused must also have a meaningful 
  opportunity to pursue the avenues of appeal open to him under s. 686 of the 
  Criminal Code. Where the reasons for judgment leave the appellate court unable 
  to meaningfully exercise appellate review, the conviction cannot stand: R. v. 
  Sheppard (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 at 309 (S.C.C.). As Binnie J. said in Sheppard 
  at 317: </p>
<p class="indent">
  These cases make it clear, I think, that the duty to give reasons, where it 
  exists, arises out of the circumstances of a particular case. Where it is plain 
  from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the absence 
  or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment to the exercise 
  of the right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account intervene. 
  On the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through confused 
  or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult issues 
  of law that need to be confronted but which the trial judge has circumnavigated 
  without explanation, or where (as here) there are conflicting theories for why 
  the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of which 
  would clearly constitute reversible error, the appeal court may in some cases 
  consider itself unable to give effect to the statutory right of appeal. In such 
  a case, one or the other of the parties may question the correctness of the 
  result, but will wrongly have been deprived in the absence or inadequacy of 
  reasons of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly scrutinized on 
  appeal. In such a case, even if the record discloses evidence that on one view 
  could support a reasonable verdict, the deficiencies in the reasons may amount 
  to an error in law and justify appellate intervention. It will be for the appeal 
  court to determine whether, in a particular case, the deficiency in the reasons 
  precludes it from properly carrying out its appellate function. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [32] Sheppard emphasizes that the adequacy of reasons is not measured by the 
  inch or the pound, but rather by the extent to which those reasons allow meaningful 
  exercise of the rights of appeal. Short reasons can make the basis for conviction 
  or acquittal crystal clear, and a weighty judicial tome may obscure entirely 
  how the crucial issue in a case came to be decided the way it was. The former 
  reasons serve their assigned purpose, the latter result in reversible error. 
  </p>
<p>
  [33] On the trial judge's analysis, the appellant's liability turned on a very 
  narrow question. He did not suggest that the appellant had any reason to suspect 
  that the Quebec dealers were dealing in stolen vehicles prior to November 1997 
  when he was visited by the police. The narrow question was - had the Crown proved 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that after the appellant spoke to Laroche in November 
  1997 he remained suspicious that the vehicles were stolen and deliberately chose 
  to refrain from further inquiry so that he would not learn the truth? The trial 
  judge's ultimate finding that the accused was wilfully blind after November 
  1997 constituted a finding of a culpable state of mind on the edge of criminal 
  liability. That finding could only be properly made after a rigorous analysis 
  of all of the relevant evidence. </p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge correctly observed that the appellant's state of mind after 
  November 1997 could be inferred from his conduct. The trial judge referred to 
  some of that conduct. I agree that the conduct referred to by the trial judge 
  was relevant and potentially supportive of the Crown's case. The trial judge 
  did not, however, refer to many aspects of the evidence which were at least 
  as probative, if not more probative, of the appellant's state of mind after 
  November 1997. Much of this evidence, if accepted, pointed away from the finding 
  that the appellant was wilfully blind after November 1997. That evidence comes 
  from several sources none of which are inherently or obviously unworthy of belief, 
  and some of which the trial judge accepted as reliable. I will summarize that 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [35] The defence adduced evidence of the appellant's good character. The thrust 
  of that evidence, some of which came from Crown witnesses, was that the appellant 
  was an honourable person who conducted his business in an honest and forthright 
  manner. This character evidence was relevant to the appellant's credibility, 
  but more importantly was potentially significant circumstantial evidence that 
  the appellant was not wilfully blind as to the origin of the vehicles he sold 
  in the course of his business operation. The trial judge does not mention the 
  character evidence in his reasons.</p>
<p>
  [36] The defence led expert evidence that the prices at which the appellant 
  sold the stolen vehicles were consistent with the prices charged for accident 
  repair vehicles of the same make and model and inconsistent with prices charged 
  for stolen vehicles. The Crown had led evidence from some of the purchasers 
  that they thought they were getting a very good deal on the cars they bought 
  from the appellant, and that one of the stolen cars on the appellant's car lot 
  when he was arrested was being offered for sale at well below market value. 
  There was also reason to question the applicability of the expert's evidence 
  to vehicles that had been stolen and revinned. Unfortunately, the trial judge 
  did not deal with the evidence of price at all. The appellant has no way of 
  knowing why evidence from an independent expert supporting his position on pricing 
  did not leave the trial judge with at least a reasonable doubt as to whether 
  the appellant was wilfully blind.</p>
<p>
  [37] There was also evidence from a Crown witness who had been involved in the 
  theft of some of the cars. He testified as to his dealings with the appellant. 
  In cross-examination, he indicated that false documents were created and given 
  to the appellant to hide the fact that the vehicles were stolen from the appellant. 
  The trial judge referred to and accepted this person's evidence in the course 
  of summarizing the history of some of the vehicles, but made no reference to 
  his evidence that efforts were made to keep the appellant unaware that the vehicles 
  were stolen. This court does not know what the trial judge made of this part 
  of the accomplice's evidence, or why evidence from a Crown witness suggesting 
  that the appellant was kept in the dark as to the stolen nature of the vehicles 
  did not factor into the trial judge's decision that the appellant was wilfully 
  blind. </p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant also testified that he used a service provided by the insurance 
  industry (Auto Check) to check on the history of each of the vehicles before 
  he sold it. According to the appellant, this was the service commonly used by 
  used car dealers. There was evidence that there was another service available 
  that was potentially more reliable than the service used by the appellant. The 
  trial judge made no reference to this evidence and provides no insight as to 
  why the appellant's evidence that he made the kinds of checks that used car 
  dealers routinely make on vehicles to determine their history did not warrant 
  consideration when determining his state of mind with respect to the vehicles.</p>
<p>
  [39] Although the trial judge made reference to the documentation kept by the 
  appellant and his failure to keep certain other documentation, he made no finding 
  as to what role, if any, matters relating to the documentation played in his 
  ultimate finding. The appellant relied on the fact that all of the sales were 
  properly recorded in his registry as required by provincial legislation. The 
  trial judge made no reference to this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [40] There was unchallenged evidence that the appellant provided a warranty 
  with a company called Lubrico with each of the vehicles he sold. He also invited 
  prospective purchasers to have the car examined by their own mechanic before 
  completing the purchase. The defence argued that this conduct was inconsistent 
  with someone who was suspicious that the vehicles were stolen. The Crown countered 
  this submission with the contention that the warranties were designed to discourage 
  purchasers from taking the vehicles to the dealers where it was more likely 
  that the revinning of the vehicles would be discovered. The Crown also argued 
  that the cars were so skilfully revinned that there was little danger in allowing 
  a mechanic to examine the car before a purchase. There seems to be potential 
  merit to both arguments. Unfortunately, the trial judge did not deal with this 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [41] The trial judge also misapprehended the evidence on a potentially significant 
  feature of the case. Misapprehension of evidence can amount to a freestanding 
  error warranting reversal. I, however, include this misapprehension of the evidence 
  with my analysis of the failure to consider relevant evidence, since by misapprehending 
  the evidence the trial judge effectively failed to consider the evidence as 
  it was actually given.</p>
<p>
  [42] The trial judge indicated that the appellant made a single telephone call 
  to Laroche. In fact, the appellant made three phone calls to Laroche: the one 
  referred to by the trial judge in November 1997, a second telephone call in 
  September 1998 when the appellant received a subpoena to testify at Laroche's 
  trial, and a third in November 1998 after the appellant had been advised by 
  the police that he would not have to attend at Laroche's trial. </p>
<p>
  [43] The second of these conversations was potentially significant in assessing 
  whether the appellant remained wilfully blind after his first conversation with 
  Laroche. The appellant said that after he got the subpoena he was disturbed 
  and called Laroche to demand an explanation because Laroche had assured him 
  in their earlier telephone call that there were no problems. If the trial judge 
  accepted that the appellant made this call, it could have supported the inference, 
  at least to the point of leaving a reasonable doubt, that the appellant had 
  indeed been satisfied that the vehicles were not stolen after his first call 
  to Laroche in November 1997 and became concerned when he received the subpoena. 
  The trial judge's reasons indicate that he proceeded on the basis that the appellant 
  had only one conversation with Laroche. This court cannot determine what effect, 
  if any, this evidence might have had on the trial judge's analysis. Nor can 
  it be inferred from the trial judge's reasons that he must have rejected this 
  part of the appellant's evidence. The trial judge accepted parts of the appellant's 
  evidence, including his evidence concerning the first telephone call in November 
  1997. </p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [44] This was a close case. On the trial judge's view of the evidence, the appellant's 
  culpability rested on the very borderline of criminal liability. He did not 
  address a large body of evidence that was potentially, directly probative of 
  the crucial issue. It cannot be inferred from the trial judge's reasons that 
  he rejected this evidence or preferred the Crown's position with respect to 
  the evidence. Nor is any of the evidence patently unreliable so as to obviate 
  the need for any express analysis of it. This deficiency in the reasons forecloses 
  effective appellate review of the trial judge's ultimate conclusion that the 
  appellant was wilfully blind after November 1997. Absent any reference to this 
  significant, diverse and potentially probative body of evidence, this Court 
  cannot meaningfully deconstruct the verdict to determine whether it reflected 
  a consideration of all of the evidence and a proper application of the wilful 
  blindness doctrine to the totality of the evidence. The convictions cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  [45] Counsel for the appellant argued that if the convictions were quashed, 
  this court should enter a stay of proceedings. He referred to the personal hardships 
  suffered by the appellant after this prosecution was commenced.</p>
<p>
  [46] There was ample evidence to support the convictions. The respondent's personal 
  circumstances do not justify a judicial prohibition against further prosecution. 
  I would quash the convictions and direct a new trial. It is for the Crown to 
  decide whether a new trial is in the best interests of the administration of 
  justice. </p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> It is arguable that the inference of 
  knowledge from recent possession is inconsistent with a finding of wilful blindness. 
  It is also arguable that the inference had no place in this case since it was 
  the Crown&#146;s theory that the appellant had nothing to do with, and no knowledge 
  of the actual thefts. These are matters that may have to be resolved if there 
  is a new trial.</p>
