<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Alfred J. Stong of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on October 11, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LABROSSE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Following his trial by judge and jury, the respondent was found guilty of 
  the offences of criminal negligence causing death and manslaughter as a result 
  of an automobile accident. For the offence of criminal negligence causing death, 
  the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for two years less a day, followed 
  by probation for a period of three years, and a lifetime driving prohibition. 
  The conviction for manslaughter was judicially stayed. The Crown appeals the 
  sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The accident occurred on a busy six-lane highway in a built up commercial 
  area at one of the busiest times of day. Prior to the collision, the respondent 
  was engaged in a &quot;show of speed&quot; with another automobile which lasted 
  less than one minute. He had modified his vehicle for both the appearance and 
  ability to attain high speeds. At the time of the collision, the respondent 
  was travelling at an estimated speed of 170 km/h in a 70 km/h zone. As a result 
  of the collision, the respondent suffered a brain haemorrhage and retrograde 
  amnesia. He cannot recall the events leading to the collision, nor the collision 
  itself. </p>
<p>
  [3] The victim was a 29-year old married woman and mother of two young children 
  aged 5 and 3. She was described as a fine person who loved life and who was 
  close to her sons. The collision and resulting death had serious impact on the 
  family and friends of the victim and witnesses to the horrific crash. Her sons, 
  in particular, continue to struggle with the loss of their mother. </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent was sent to Canada from Hong Kong at the age of 16. At trial, 
  he was described as a loner with an apparent stoic disposition, and there was 
  evidence that his emotional development may have been hampered as a result of 
  being sent to a new country at a young age without immediate family support. 
  At the time of the accident, the respondent was 26 years old and single, with 
  no criminal record and no pattern of alcohol or drug use. His driving record 
  consisted of a single speeding violation. He was employed as a sales representative 
  selling computer equipment and was also a part-time student at Ryerson University 
  where he achieved high marks while studying for a degree in computer science 
  software engineering. He is generally known as being a reliable and punctual 
  person with no known history of violence or aggression. The pre-sentence report, 
  generally positive, described the respondent as a suitable candidate for community 
  based supervision since he had no criminogenic factors that might suggest a 
  risk of re-offending.</p>
<p>
  [5] At the sentencing hearing (and in this court), the Crown submitted that 
  in the circumstances of this case, the proper range of sentence for criminal 
  negligence causing death was between three and five years imprisonment. The 
  defence argued in favour of a sentence of between 18 months to 2 years less 
  one day, to be served conditionally.</p>
<p>
  [6] In his reasons, the trial judge viewed this case &quot;to be one of the 
  most extreme examples of both a wanton and reckless disregard for the lives 
  and safety of other persons in the operation of a motor vehicle as could possibly 
  be imagined.&quot; Although another vehicle was involved, the trial judge did 
  not conclude that the respondent was involved in a race with the other vehicle. 
  However, he noted that the two vehicles were &quot;at least engaged in a show 
  of speed with each other&quot; at the time of the accident. Even though the 
  respondent presented a stoic appearance during the process, trial and sentencing, 
  the trial judge was &quot;not prepared to find&quot; that the respondent was 
  not &quot;remorseful for what he had done&quot;. The trial judge nevertheless 
  recognized that the personal deterrent aspect of sentencing for this accused 
  person was secondary to that of general deterrence and that the imposition of 
  a conditional sentence, in the circumstances of this case, would send the wrong 
  message to the community.</p>
<p>
  [7] As a result, the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment of two years 
  less one day, to be followed by probation for three years, including the performance 
  of 240 hours of community service, plus a lifetime driving prohibition. </p>
<p>
  [8] Criminal negligence causing death is a serious offence which carries a maximum 
  sentence of life imprisonment. Attached to these reasons, as &quot;Schedule 
  A&quot;, is a sampling of sentences imposed by various courts for the offence 
  of criminal negligence causing death. These samples demonstrate the wide divergence 
  of punishments for this offence and the impact of certain factors on the severity 
  of the sentence. Also included in the schedule are numerous dangerous driving 
  causing death cases which were relied on by the parties. These cases have generally 
  attracted lighter sentences than those imposed in the criminal negligence causing 
  death cases. </p>
<p>
  [9] On the basis of the existing case law, I cannot accept the Crown's submission 
  that there is a range of between 3 to 5 years for the commission of this offence. 
  It is important at the outset to restate the position of this court with respect 
  to a range in criminal negligence cases. In R. v. Linden (2000), 147 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 299 (Ont. C.A.), the court stated that as a result of the many factual 
  possibilities in criminal negligence causing death cases, there is no set range 
  of sentence for this offence. At para. 2, the court said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If there was any error by the trial judge, it was in assuming that there was 
  a set range for the offence of criminal negligence causing death. The cases 
  demonstrate that criminal negligence causing death can be committed in so many 
  different ways that it defies the range-setting exercise. The cases do not demonstrate 
  a range, only a series of examples that are driven by the almost infinite variety 
  of circumstances in which this offence can be committed &#133; [c]ases can be 
  found in the reformatory range and there are even examples of suspended sentences 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [10] However, while the court in Linden stated that there is no set range for 
  the criminal negligence causing death offence, it recognized that driving offences 
  involving reckless conduct and the consumption of alcohol are generally subject 
  to more severe sentences. In addition to the consumption of alcohol or drugs, 
  courts have also treated multiple deaths, racing, reckless driving for a lengthy 
  period of time, a lengthy criminal record, a bad driving record, flight from 
  the police, and leaving the scene of the accident as aggravating circumstances. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] In the present case, the modifications that the respondent made to his 
  automobile and the show of speed, as found by the trial judge, are aggravating 
  circumstances. However, unlike many cases of the &quot;worst offence&quot; nature, 
  there was no alcohol or drug use, no street racing, no reckless driving for 
  a lengthy period of time, no attempt to evade the police or leave the scene 
  of the accident, and no criminal or significant driving record. Moreover, the 
  respondent was of impeccable background and prior good character, and had respected 
  and obeyed his strict bail conditions for over 29 months, leading up to the 
  imposition of the sentence.</p>
<p>
  [12] Although the consequences of the offences were tragic, the sentence of 
  imprisonment of two years less one day, plus probation for three years, including 
  the performance of 240 hours of community service and a lifetime driving prohibition, 
  is not unfit. Among other things, it goes a long way towards ensuring that the 
  respondent will never drive in a similar manner again. The sentence therefore 
  is not so inadequate that the interests of justice require the court's intervention. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] Particularly relevant in reviewing the adequacy of the sentence imposed 
  in this case are R. v. Guay (1986), 15 O.A.C. 111 and R. v. Persaud (2002), 
  159 O.A.C. 134. In those two cases, this court imposed reformatory sentences 
  of 18 or 20 months respectively even though both offenders were convicted of 
  criminal negligence causing death. </p>
<p>
  [14] The sentence imposed by the trial judge is entitled appropriate deference. 
  In my view, the trial judge did not commit an error in principle. While the 
  sentence imposed could have been more substantial, the case law does not support 
  a conclusion that the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit. See R. v. C.A.M., 
  [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.</p>
<p>
  [15] Although I have concluded that the sentence is not demonstrably unfit, 
  there is another important factor that was argued by the parties that militates 
  against increasing the sentence imposed on the respondent. The respondent was 
  sentenced on October 11, 2002. In early March 2003, the transcript was available 
  for review by the trial judge but was not returned to the Crown until July 2003. 
  As a result of the delay, the appeal was not heard until September 2, 2003, 
  11 months after the respondent was first sentenced. No part of the delay is 
  attributable to the respondent. By the time the appeal was heard, the respondent 
  had been released on parole since July 18, 2003, having been in custody for 
  approximately 9&frac12; months. </p>
<p>
  [16] This court has consistently held that reincarceration in itself imposes 
  additional hardship on an offender such that it has generally been hesitant 
  to reincarcerate the offender unless the sentence is so grossly inadequate that 
  the interests of justice require the court's intervention. (See R. v. Cheng 
  (1991), 50 O.A.C. 374.)</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge found that the respondent was otherwise of good character 
  and not in need of specific deterrence. The pre-sentence report was favourable 
  to the respondent and concluded that he was a suitable candidate for community 
  supervision. This appears to have been confirmed by the Parole Board which, 
  as I have said, granted him early release in July 2003. The sentence still includes 
  a large amount of community service hours. The respondent has conducted himself 
  properly since his release and &quot;[t]o the extent that additional imprisonment 
  might accomplish general deterrence, it would be of minimal significance compared 
  to the impact of further punishment upon this youthful person who shows no present 
  need except to get ahead with a useful life&quot;, R. v. McIntyre, [1993] O.J. 
  No. 2971 at para. 8 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [18] Under the circumstances, the reincarceration of the respondent would therefore 
  serve no genuine societal interest.</p>
<p>
  [19] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
