<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice B. Trafford of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated July 5, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are satisfied that the appellant has shown no error in the reasons of 
  the trial judge which would justify our intervention.</p>
<p>
  [2] The core finding was that the plaintiff suffered an injury to her shoulder 
  which causes incessant pain and that she has succumbed as a result to a state 
  of depression that makes surgical intervention inadvisable. Further, even if 
  the depression abates the surgery will only alleviate pain but will not give 
  her the ability to lift above shoulder height. The trial judge considered and 
  rejected the contention that the plaintiff's injuries were the subject of a 
  previous incident. These findings were supported in the evidence and the attack 
  upon them was premised on arguments that other evidence would indicate the contrary. 
  That other evidence may have been more credible in the eyes of some but was 
  clearly not to this trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [3] Objection was taken to evidence, some of it from experts, presented at the 
  last minute and contrary to the rules. There was no request for an adjournment 
  and the trial judge found that the defendant was not prejudiced by its late 
  production. We are concerned that the trial judge repeatedly ruled when objections 
  were made that he would hear the evidence and make rulings as to admissibility 
  later - then never made such rulings except as one might infer from reading 
  the reasons for judgment. That is an unsatisfactory procedure, especially for 
  review on appeal, but we cannot conclude that any one or more of the instances 
  of admission, assuming everything was admitted and considered relevant, would 
  justify a new trial or seriously impacted on the outcome.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant argues that insufficient consideration was given to mitigation 
  and contingencies in the assessment of damages for future care and wage loss. 
  We do not agree. The trial judge allowed almost 20% reduction of actuary calculations 
  and given the plaintiff's age at trial of 57 this can't be far off the mark. 
  There was evidence to support the finding that the plaintiff's injuries were 
  such that she could not seek alternative employment.</p>
<p>
  [5] The costs were awarded favouring the plaintiff for a Rule 49 offer before 
  trial. The appellant says this takes no account of the conduct of the plaintiff's 
  counsel in putting forward last minute evidence and prolonging the trial. The 
  respondent says this late introduction was in response to a witness list from 
  the appellant suggesting a fresh line of evidence. The trial judge had all this 
  before him and the discretion was his, not ours, to reach his conclusion on 
  costs.</p>
<p>
  [6] We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs. We have considered the bill 
  of costs and submissions submitted by the parties and fix the costs at $7,500.</p>
