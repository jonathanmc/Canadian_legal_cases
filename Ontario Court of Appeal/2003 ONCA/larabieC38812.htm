<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The preliminary issue raised on this appeal related to the retesting of 
  the semen for a DNA match following the trial. The Crown sought to introduce 
  the test result on the summary conviction appeal, but withdrew the application. 
  In spite of this withdrawal, the summary conviction appeal judge referred to 
  the unadmitted fresh evidence in his reasons. On this appeal the Crown sought 
  to rely on the evidence as well. The appellant objects to the references to 
  this evidence by the summary conviction appeal judge and by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [2] We agree with appellant counsel's submissions. The summary conviction appeal 
  judge should not have considered or relied in any way on the fresh evidence 
  which was not before him. Nor should the Crown have sought to rely on the evidence 
  on this appeal without making a fresh evidence application and receiving a favourable 
  ruling.</p>
<p>
  [3] In considering the merits of the appeal, we take no account of the fresh 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [4] The substantive ground of appeal in this court (and below) was that the 
  verdict of the trial judge was unreasonable and that the evidence cannot support 
  a conviction. We do not accept this submission. The trial judge reviewed the 
  evidence of the complainant with considerable caution in light of her state 
  of intoxication. As a result, he looked for corroboration in other evidence. 
  He found corroboration of two significant points in the DNA results, which first 
  excluded the complainant's husband as the person who had intercourse with her 
  as she said, and second, did not exclude the appellant, the person she identified 
  as her assailant. He was included as one of a maximum of 711 males in Ontario 
  who were not excluded as a match. That number is artificially high because it 
  assumes all males in Ontario are Caucasian, which of course they are not. In 
  our view, the trial judge was entitled to accept the DNA evidence as corroborative 
  of the fact that the appellant had intercourse with the complainant.</p>
<p>
  [5] Although the trial judge did not expressly make a finding in accordance 
  with the principle in R. v. W.D., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, a review of his reasons 
  read as a whole, makes it clear that he rejected the evidence of the appellant 
  as raising any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, the trial judge was entitled to come to the conclusion he did 
  on the evidence. The verdict is not unreasonable. Leave to appeal is granted 
  but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
