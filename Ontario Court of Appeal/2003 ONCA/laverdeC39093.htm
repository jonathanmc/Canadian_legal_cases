<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. 
  He appeals those convictions.</p>
<p>
  [2] The complainant testified that he was attacked and stabbed by the appellant 
  while taking a shower. The complainant and the appellant had argued earlier 
  that evening. The complainant suffered significant injuries and was found lying 
  on the shower room floor. The appellant who was arrested shortly after the offence 
  was partially clothed. He had no apparent injuries except for a small nick on 
  his ear, of no apparent significance. He did not complain of any injuries when 
  questioned by the police. The appellant did not testify and did not call any 
  defence.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on any of the self-defence 
  provisions. We see no error in this ruling. It was common ground by the end 
  of the trial that the appellant had stabbed the complainant. Identity was not 
  an issue. On the complainant's evidence, he was the victim of an unprovoked 
  attack from behind. There were, however, significant difficulties with the complainant's 
  credibility. Counsel for the appellant argues that if the complainant's evidence 
  as to how he came to be stabbed was rejected, the resulting &quot;absence of 
  evidence&quot; necessitated an instruction on the defence of self-defence. We 
  cannot agree. The trial judge may instruct a jury on the defence of self-defence, 
  only where there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, 
  could acquit on the basis of that evidence: R. v. Cinous (2002), 162 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 129 at 160 (SCC). The accused bears the evidential onus of pointing to 
  evidence on the record which puts the defence of self-defence into play. The 
  rejection of evidence and/or the absence of evidence standing alone cannot provide 
  the necessary evidentiary basis for the defence. </p>
<p>
  [4] On the evidence adduced in this case, self-defence could not be put to the 
  jury unless there was some basis in the evidence upon which a jury, acting reasonably, 
  could conclude that the complainant had struck or at least threatened the appellant 
  before the appellant stabbed him. There is no such evidence. Rejection of the 
  complainant's evidence that he was attacked from behind by the appellant cannot 
  be transformed into evidence that the complainant struck or threatened the appellant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] This case is distinguishable from R. v. Cameron (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 346 
  (Ont. C.A.). In Cameron, there was evidence, apart from the evidence of the 
  deceased and the accused, that the two had engaged in a fight in which both 
  were armed with a knife. We read Cameron as standing for the proposition that 
  self-defence as defined in the various sections of the Criminal Code is not 
  necessarily precluded where the jury cannot decide who was the aggressor in 
  a fight. In our view, Cameron had no application to this case and does not support 
  the submission that the absence of evidence can justify leaving self-defence 
  with the jury. </p>
<p>
  [6] Counsel's second argument turns on evidence given by the complainant at 
  the preliminary inquiry. The complainant did not adopt this evidence at trial. 
  Counsel contends that the trial judge should have admitted the evidence given 
  at the preliminary inquiry on the principled approach to the admission of hearsay 
  evidence. This argument was not raised at trial and the trial judge cannot be 
  criticized for not pursuing this avenue of admissibility on his own initiative. 
  In any event, we are satisfied that the evidence would not have made any difference 
  in the end result or it would not have justified leaving self-defence to the 
  jury. </p>
<p>
  [7] We are satisfied that on this evidence, convictions for both assault with 
  a weapon and aggravated assault offend the rule against multiple convictions. 
  We stay the conviction on the charge of assault with a weapon and affirm the 
  conviction on aggravated assault: see R. v. Basilio (2003), 175 C.C.C. (3d) 
  440. </p>
<p>
  [8] To the extent described above, the appeal is allowed. Otherwise, the appeal 
  is dismissed and the conviction on aggravated assault is affirmed.</p>
