<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This was a most serious attack involving a sexual assault of an elderly 
  woman in her own home. The appellant has a record for a similar offence and 
  has engaged in other inappropriate sexual conduct. At this point, he continues 
  to have difficulty accepting responsibility for his actions. The appellant has 
  serious problems and obviously requires treatment.</p>
<p>[2] The sentence in this case was imposed in accordance with a joint submission 
  following a partial preliminary inquiry. The trial judge had a complete picture 
  of the circumstances of the offence and the appellant&#146;s background. The 
  joint submission was a proper one and we see no error in principle.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
