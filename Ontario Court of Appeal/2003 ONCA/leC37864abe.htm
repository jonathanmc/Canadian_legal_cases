<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At its best for the defence, the informant could have testified that the 
  appellant was not one of the persons who attended at the apartment on a specific 
  day.</p>
<p>[2] It cannot be said that the evidence would have materially assisted the 
  appellant in meeting the case put against him by the Crown, much less that the 
  evidence was &quot;necessary&quot; to ensure that the appellant received a fair 
  trial.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
